Lumer and F. F. Bonsall, are considered and the theory of such numerical ranges applied to Banach algebra.  The first part of the thesis is largely expository as in it we introduce the basic results on numerical ranges.  For an element of a unital Banach algebra, the question of approximating its spectrum by numerical ranges has been considered by F. F. Bonsall and J. Duncan. We give an alternative proof that the convex hull of the spectrum of an element may be approximated by its numerical range defined with respect to equivalent renormings of the algebra.  In the particular case of operators on a Hilbert space, this leads to a sharper version of a result by J. P. Williams.  An element is hermitian if it has real numerical range.  Such an element is characterized in terms of the linear subspace spanned by the unit, the element and its square.  This is used to characterize Banach*&#8211;algebras in which every self&#8211;adjoint element is hermitian.  From this an elementary proof that such algebras are B*-algebras in an equivalent norm is given.  As indicated by T. W. Palmer, a formula of L. Harris is then used to show that the equivalent renorming is unnecessary, thus giving a simple proof of Palmer's characterization of B*-algebras among Banach algebras.  The closure properties of the spatial numerical range are studied.  A construction of B. Berberian is extended to normed linear spaces, however because the numerical range need not be convex, the result obtained is weaker than that of Berberian for Hilbert spaces.  A Hilbert space or an Lp-space, for p between one and infinity, is seen to be finite dimensional if and only if all the compact operators have closed spatial numerical range.  The spatial numerical range of a compact operator, on a Hilbert space or an Lp-space, for p between one and infinity, is shown to contain all the non&#8211;zero extreme points of its closure.  So, for a compact operator on a Hilbert space the spatial numerical range is closed if and only if it contains the origin, thus answering a question of P. R. Halmos.  Operators that attain their numerical radius are also considered.  A result of D. Hilbert is extended to a class of Banach spaces.  In a Hilbert space the hermitian operators, which attain their numerical radius, are shown to be dense among all the hermitian operators.  This leads to a stronger form of a result by J. Lindenstrauss in the spatial case of operators on a Hilbert space.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Numerical range</field><field name="subject">B*-algebra</field><field name="subject">Banach algebra</field><field name="subject">hermitian operator</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rainfall runoff model improvements incorporating a dynamic wave model and synthetic stream networks</field><field name="creator">Cui, Gurong</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns general improvements to rainfall runoff models and focuses on two particular aspects, namely flood-wave routing in the main channel and consistent parameterisation of the rainfall-runoff process under different degrees of discretization of the catchment.  The primary goal is to: 1) describe a general methodology for parameterisation of a rainfall runoff model so that the parameters are consistent across catchments modelled at different discretization scales and 2) develop an improved channel routing technique which takes proper account of the effects of all characteristics of wave motions in the channels.  The first of these concerns methods for removing the inconsistency of parameterisation that results from different catchment discretizations in rainfall-runoff models.  A stochastic Tokunaga network is developed for dealing with the scaling inconsistence.  The problem of network embedding is also discussed.  The second is a relatively simple method for the solution of the full dynamic wave equations for one-dimensional channel flow, which accurately simulates the effects of shocks.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parameterisation</field><field name="subject">Stream network</field><field name="subject">Tokunaga tree</field><field name="subject">rainfall runoff</field><field name="subject">scaling</field><field name="subject">regional scale</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24982</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theory and Applications of Weighted Least Squares Surface Matching for Accurate Spatial Data Registration</field><field name="creator">P&#226;quet, Robert Jean Marc</field><field name="description">This thesis discusses matching of 3D surfaces, in particular, their registration in a common coordinate system. This differs from object recognition in the sense that the surfaces are generally close to registration, sometimes so close that the mismatch cannot be detected on visual inspection. The surface matching algorithm, based on least squares theory, is therefore an estimation of the matching parameters, sometimes very small, which provides the most statistically accurate registration. High redundancy is achieved with the algorithm, as each point of one surface can potentially participate in the formation of an observation equation for the least squares adjustment. The algorithm minimises the separation between the surfaces. The surfaces are defined by sets of points represented by their cartesian coordinates in 3D space, without restrictions on the mode of sampling used in the capture of the data. The registration is executed without control points. Modern non-thematic sampling methods, for instance airborne laser scanning, can benefit from such an algorithm. Other applications include processes where permanent control markers cannot be used, for example, medical applications or coastal erosion. Surface matching has been used previously by a small number of people. The particular interest of this thesis, however, has been to test the accuracy and other characteristics of the matching, especially when weighting is used with the surface separations. This thesis presents and compares several weighting techniques including one technique based on the covariance function. In addition, a statistical method to model matching accuracy as a function of the density of the control surface is formulated. The method is useful to ascertain the interpolation component of the matching error. The remaining component of the error can be deducted and analysed according to the project under consideration. Examples of project might be filtering in data fusion assessment, or volume displacement in landslide analysis. The theory is developed using artificial data. This helps to isolate and analyse in turn the various characteristics of the surface matching. The thesis is then illustrated with examples involving real data sampled in Newcastle, NSW, Australia, using methods such as ALS, photogrammetry and GPS.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surface matching</field><field name="subject">registration</field><field name="subject">spatial information</field><field name="subject">algorithm</field><field name="subject">matching algorithm</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24755</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heartbreak and hope, deference and defiance on the Yimmang: Tocal's convicts 1822-1840</field><field name="creator">Walsh, Brian Patrick</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate -

Specifically it examines the evidence for UCBs that result from the interface of physical, social, structural, and cultural components of the environment of a child care centre with the psychological habitats of individual children over the full day of their attendances.  The identified unwanted behaviours are used as starting points to analyse children&#8217;s behaviour streams for indication of environmental influences in the production of UCBs and to establish common patterns of influence across different children.  To facilitate a systematic investigation of the complex child:environment relationships in a child care centre, a conceptual framework was developed to describe time-space locations of settings and situations, the basic components of environmental influence, the child&#8217;s psychological habitat, UCBs, and the contextualisation of child behaviours in situ.  The framework was utilised to review literature associated with components of both the child&#8217;s psychological habitat and the environment of a child care centre, implement an appropriate data collection strategy, as well as guiding data analysis and interpretation of findings.  The qualitative approach to data collection involved full-day observations of individual children and recording on audio-tape a continuous concurrent narrative of their actions within a variety of settings and situations.  Observations of 30 different children over 54 days yielded almost 400 hours of recordings, which were transcribed onto more than 1000 typed pages.  Examination of the transcripts provided evidence of 1384 manifestations of UCBs embedded in 1028 distinct sequences of unwanted behaviours within behaviour streams.  Analysis of the behaviour streams and interpretation of antecedent events implicated a variety of interrelated physical, social, structural, and cultural factors in the production of UCBs, which are considered in light of findings from previous studies.  Overall, no single factor was found to influence the behaviours of all children, or the same child across different settings and situations.  The findings serve to reinforce the known complexity of person:environment relationships, which is further intensified in children between the ages of 3-5 years by their developing socio-emotional and cognitive systems, innate and learned within-child characteristics, and different experiences of centre-based child care.  The findings also reinforce the need for practitioners and researchers to consider more fully the individuality of each child when planning programs and investigations into the impact of child care on children.  Implications of the findings for practitioners are stated and recommendations are made for future research.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Early Childhood</field><field name="subject">child behaviour</field><field name="subject">child care centres</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24772</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CATSCAN/DOGMA : creating new music-theatre</field><field name="creator">Gregg, Stuart Charles John</field><field name="description">Masters Research -

The earth's climate is sensitive to alterations in these levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHG), with significant changes in climate predicted long term. The adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 heralded a new age in terms of greenhouse gas accounting and emissions responsibility, for all nations. In Australia, carbon emissions from the Land Use and Land Use Change and Forestry sector are responsible for a large proportion of the national total emissions. Radar remote sensing has demonstrated considerable potential in the estimation and mapping of vegetation biomass and subsequently carbon. The aim of this research is to investigate the potential of airborne polarimetric radar for quantifying and mapping the biomass and structural diversity of woodlands in semi-arid Australia.  Initial investigation focussed on the physical structure of the woodland, which revealed that despite a diversity of woodland associations, the species diversity was relatively low. Both excurrent and decurrent growth forms were present, which subsequently resulted in varying allocation of biomass to the components (i.e., branches, trunks).  In view of this, both empirical and modelling methodologies were explored. Empirical relationships were established between SAR backscatter and the total above ground biomass. Considerable scatter was present in these relationships, which was attributed to the large range of species and their associated structures. Comparison of actual and model simulations for C-, L- and P-band wavelengths, reveal that no significant difference existed for these wavelengths, except at CHH, and the cross-polarised data at L- and P-band. The study confirmed that microwaves at C-band interacted largely with the leaves and small branches, with scattering at VV polarization dominating.  Compared to the lower frequencies, the return from the ground surface (as expected) was significant. The differences in scattering mechanisms (i.e., branch-ground versus trunk-ground) between excurrent and decurrent structures were due largely to the larger angular branches associated with Eucalyptus and Angophora species, which were absent from Callitris glaucophylla.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Synthetic aperture radar</field><field name="subject">Polarimetry</field><field name="subject">Forests and forestry Australia</field><field name="subject">Arid regions Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a semi-automatic method for cellular migration and division analysis</field><field name="creator">Chu, Calvin, School of Biomedical Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Binary image processing algorithms have been implemented in this study to create a background subtraction mask for the segmentation of cellular time lapse images. The complexity in the development of the background subtraction mask stems from the inherent difficulties in contrast resolution at the cellular boundaries. Coupling the background subtraction mask with the path reconstruction method via superposition of overlapping binary segmented objects in sequential time lapse images produces a semi-automatic method for cellular tracking. In addition to the traditional center of mass or centroid approximation, a novel quasi-center of mass (QCM) derived from the local maxima of the distance transformation (DT) has also been proposed in this study. Furthermore, image isolation and separation between spreading/motile and mitotic cells allows the extraction of both migratory and divisional cellular information. DT application to isolated mitotic cells permits the ability to identify distinct morphologic phases of cellular division. Application of standard bivariate statistics allows the characterization of cellular migration and growth. Determination of Hotelling???s confidence ellipse from cellular trajectory data elucidates the biased or unbiased migration of cellular populations. We investigated whether it was possible to describe the trajectory as a simple binomial process, where trajectory directions are classified into a sequence of (8) discrete states. A significant proportion of trajectories did not follow the binomial model. Additionally, a preliminary relationship between the image background area, approximate number of counted cells in an image frame, and imaging time is proposed from the segmentation of confluent monolayer cellular cultures.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cell division</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Long-term outcomes after severe, traumatic brain injury</field><field name="creator">Hill, Heather B, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Predominant theories regarding adjustment and adaptation from the 1960s to mid 1980 are examined. Medical literature relating to outcomes after traumatic brain injury is examined. The gloom in major texts is surprising. The lack of definition of the commonly used term ???long-term??? is discussed. The relative lack of research to guide advice about very long-term prognoses remains a major concern. There are a number of ways of defining reality. Some come from an observer???s view of a person???s life. Some come from the reports of a significant other in the life of the person with TBI. Others come from the words or writings of the person who sustained a serious TBI. Quantitative research excels at summarising data and reaching generalisations based on statistical projections. Qualitative research excels at telling the story from the person???s viewpoint, providing the rich descriptive detail that sets quantitative results into their human context. An opportunistic sample of people who suffered a very severe TBI in 1981 was traced and narratives of their experiences since their injury obtained, either written or converted to text from interview. The texts were analysed using a qualitative technique based on grounded theory. The results of the analysis, the fact that a variety of approaches were used by people to deal with their problems, possible reasons for negative prognoses, and the limitations of the study are highlighted. Possible reasons why negativity appears to pervade the thinking of some health professionals involved with people with TBI, and possible directions for the future in therapy and research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brain damage</field><field name="subject">patients</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22812</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insider trading regulation ??? the impact on world equity market performance and information based trading</field><field name="creator">Grankvist, Mats, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the impact of insider trading regulation and its enforcement on bid-ask spreads, information asymmetry proxies, volatility, trade frequency and trade sizes. It employs an exclusive intra-day market-microstructure data-set for 29 countries and 32 exchanges and utilizes structural simultaneous equations models with distributed geometric lags estimated with GMM, controlling for market architecture, trading demand, minimum tick size and Fama-French factors. This thesis finds that enforcement of insider trading regulation in a country, rather than the strictness of written insider trading law, reduces information asymmetry and bid-ask spreads, increases volatility, and has an overall positive impact on traded value. The positive impact is mostly concentrated in the smallest stocks in the sample. The regulation of disclosure requirements has similar, but not identical, beneficial externalities in the market. The results support the prediction by Bhattacharya and Daouk (2002) that the fall in the cost of equity that results from insider trading prosecution in a country is due to a reduction in adverse selection. This thesis also find some support of the free inside information scenario of Medrano and Vives (2004), where volatility increases when insiders are forced to disclose the inside information before legally trading on it, if insider trading is not permitted and the regulation is enforced.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical modelling of heat and mass transfer and optimisation of a natural draft wet cooling tower</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Nicholas J</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heat -- Transmission</field><field name="subject">Mass transfer</field><field name="subject">Cooling towers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4123</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chickpea improvement through genetic analysis and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of ascochyta blight resistence using wild Cicer species</field><field name="creator">Aryamanesh, Nader</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The genetics of ascochyta blight resistance was studied in five 5 x 5 half-diallel cross sets involving seven genotypes of chickpea (ICC 3996, Almaz, Lasseter, Kaniva, 24B-Isoline, IG 9337 and Kimberley Large), three accessions of Cicer reticulatum (ILWC 118, ILWC 139 and ILWC 184) and one accession of C. echinospermum (ILWC 181) under field conditions. Both F1 and F2 generations were used in the diallel analysis. Almaz, ICC 3996 and ILWC 118 were the most resistant genotypes. Estimates of genetic parameters, following Hayman's method, showed significant additive and dominant gene actions. The analysis also revealed the involvement of both major and minor genes. Susceptibility was dominant over resistance to ascochyta blight. The recessive alleles were concentrated in the two resistant chickpea parents ICC 3996 and Almaz, and one C. reticulatum genotype ILWC 118. High narrow-sense heritability (ranging from 82 to 86% for F1 generations, and 43 to 63% for F2 generations) indicates that additive gene effects were more important than non-additive gene effects in the inheritance of the trait and greater genetic gain by breeding resistant chickpea cultivars using carefully selected parental genotypes. Current simple leaf varieties are often susceptible to ascochyta blight disease whereas varieties of other leaf types range from resistant to susceptible. The inheritance of ascochyta blight resistance and different leaf types and their correlation were investigated in intraspecific progeny derived from crosses among two resistant genotypes with normal leaf type (ICC 3996 and Almaz), one susceptible simple leaf type (Kimberley Large) and one susceptible multipinnate leaf type (24 B-Isoline). ...  An interspecific F2 mapping population derived from a cross between chickpea accession ICC 3996 (resistant to ascochyta blight, early flowering, and semi-erect plant growth habit) and C. reticulatum accession ILWC 184 (susceptible to ascochyta blight, ii late flowering, and prostrate plant growth habit) was used for constructing a genetic linkage map. F2 plants were cloned through stem cuttings taken at pre-flowering stage, treated with plant growth regulator powder (0.5 mg/g indole butyric acid (IBA) and 0.5 mg/g naphthalene acetic acid (NAA)) and grown in a sand + potting mix substrate. Clones were screened for ascochyta blight resistance in controlled environment conditions using a 19 scale. Three quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were found for ascochyta blight resistance in this population. Two linked QTLs, located on linkage group (LG) 4, explained 21.1% and 4.9% of the phenotypic variation. The other QTL, located on LG3, explained 22.7% of the phenotypic variation for ascochyta blight resistance. These QTLs explained almost 49% of the variation for ascochyta blight resistance. LG3 had two major QTLs for days to flowering (explaining 90.2% of phenotypic variation) and a major single QTL for plant growth habit (explaining 95.2% of phenotypic variation). There was a negative correlation between ascochyta blight resistance and days to flowering, and a positive correlation between days to flowering and plant growth habit. The flanking markers for ascochyta blight resistance or other morphological characters can be used in marker-assisted selections to facilitate breeding programs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chickpea ascochyta blight -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Chickpea</field><field name="subject">Plant diseases -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Gene mapping</field><field name="subject">Cicer</field><field name="subject">Chickpea</field><field name="subject">QTL mapping</field><field name="subject">Wild Cicer species</field><field name="subject">Ascochyta blight resistance</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0072</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dance at the seventeenth-century Danish court</field><field name="creator">Kjaergaard, Mette</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the culture and practice of dance in Denmark in the seventeenth century, focussing on the performance practice within festivals, the pervading French influence and philosophical discourse of dance. 
 The repertoire of staged court dance in Denmark comprises ballets and plays performed in conjunction with festival events such as coronations, weddings, and christenings. Typical is the 1634 festival in honour of Prince-Elect Christian and Magdalena Sibylla&#65533;s wedding in Copenhagen, a celebration of international significance. Subsequent celebrations during the reigns of Frederik III and Christian V followed similar models. The festival of 1655 in homage of Prince Christian, for example, gave rise to performances of the ballet Unterschiedliche Oracula, and the German-language opera Arion. The programmes from these performances, along with other contemporary descriptions, provide evidence of aspects of the ballet genre, stage construction, machinery, characters, allegory and political themes. The Danish productions, which also include an equestrian ballet, are in many respects comparable to French court ballets produced from the beginning of the century. 
 Evidence that French choreographies were known in Denmark is clearly provided by choreographies in the publication Mai&#770;tre de Danse (Glu&#776;ckstadt 1705) and the Danish manuscript of violin dance tunes Additamenta 396 4&#65533;. Evidence that the Danish aristocracy actively sought and coveted French culture can be found as early as the wedding festival in 1634 and well into the eighteenth century. French acculturation is evident elsewhere too, such as in Ludvig Holberg&#65533;s comedy Jean de France (1722), in a translation of French dance etiquette for youth, in contemporary accounts of French clothing and language, and by the employment of French musicians and dancing masters at the Danish court. 
 Included is an examination of Andreas Schroder&#65533;s treatise De Saltatoribus (Flensburg 1622) and Thomas Bartholin&#65533;s dance chapter in his book Qu&#65533;stiones Nuptialis (Copenhagen 1670) as significant Danish primary sources. These sources are placed in contrast with contemporary European dance manuals such as Arbeau, De Lauze, Esquivel de Navarro, Caroso and Negri. Danish and other European authors differ in their views on the morality of dance, although they cite many of the same Ancient and Biblical sources for their persuasive arguments. 
 Just as Denmark was connected to other countries of northern Europe in a complex political web, so too did these courts share artistic and cultural traditions, which are reflected in the sources related to dance. Danish dance practices can especially be demonstrated to be akin to those of neighbouring German courts, which, like Denmark, imitated the dance fashions of France.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dance</field><field name="subject">Denmark</field><field name="subject">court and courtiers</field><field name="subject">17th century</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081127.161219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heme oxygenase and the use of tin protoporphyrin in hypoxia-ischaemia-induced brain damage : mechanisms of action</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Brad Alexander</field><field name="description">Stroke is the third largest cause of death, and the leading cause of disability worldwide. Treatments are sought to reduce mortality, and increase survival time following an ischaemic stroke. Hypoxia-ischaemia (HI) is the combination of cerebral ischaemia and global hypoxia that can lead to neuronal damage, particularly perinatally. The complex neurodegenerative cascade following ischaemic stroke and HI activates many stress pathways, including heme oxygenase (HO). HO metabolises free heme to release iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin, which is subsequently metabolised to bilirubin. This thesis aims to elucidate the role HO plays following HI, and assess any neuroprotective mechanisms using HO modulators. 
 The 26 day old rat model of HI was used to induce the neurodegenerative cascade. All animals were sacrificed 3 days post-insult. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting demonstrated that HO-1 was increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere of both HI (by 1.7 &#65533; 0.1 fold: p = 0.016, n = 4) and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) brains (by 1.6 &#65533; 0.1 fold: p = 0.037, n = 4), compared to controls. HO-2 was constitutively expressed throughout the control brain, but HI upregulated HO-2 expression (by 1.7 &#65533; 0.2 fold: p = 0.027, n = 4) ipsilaterally, whereas MCAO did not alter HO-2 expression. Administration of the HO inhibitor tin protoporphyrin (SnPP; 30[mu]mol/kg intraperitoneally) daily, beginning 1 day prior to HI until sacrifice, reduced infarct volume to 50% &#65533; 10 of saline-treated animals (p = 0.039, n = 6-8). The HO inducer ferriprotoporphyrin (FePP; 30[mu]mol/kg) had no effect on infarct volume. HO activity and protein expression were not significantly altered following treatment with SnPP. Therefore, the neuroprotective actions of SnPP may be through alternative mechanisms. SnPP treatment increased HI + saline-induced total nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity by 1.5 &#65533; 0.06 fold (p &lt; 0.001, n = 6-8). Conversely, SnPP inhibited both inducible NOS (50% &#65533; 7 of HI + saline; p = 0.045, n = 7-8) and cyclooxygenase (COX) activity (32% &#65533; 6 of HI + saline; p = 0.049, n = 4-8). SnPP treatment also increased mitochondrial complex I activity by 1.6 &#65533; 0.25 fold (p = 0.04, n = 4-8) and complex V activity by 1.7 &#65533; 0.26 fold (p = 0.046, n = 4-8) in the ipsilateral hemisphere. It appears that SnPP is acting on inflammatory and mitochondrial enzymes to produce neuroprotection. In vitro analysis of cultured RAW264.7 macrophages exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10[mu]g/mL) treated with SnPP (dose range: 10&#8315;&#65533;&#8304;M - 10&#8315;&#8309;M) did not alter nitrite levels or cell viability. However, high dose SnPP (10&#8315;&#8309;M) in the absence of LPS increased nitrite levels from control cells by 2.7 &#65533; 0.7 fold (p = 0.043, n = 6), complementing the in vivo total NOS data. Other mechanisms such as NMDA receptor activation were not affected by 100[mu]M SnPP or 100[mu]M SnCl&#8322; in patch clamped cortical pyramidal neurons. 
 Overall, the role that HO plays following HI remains unclear, but this thesis provides definitive evidence that SnPP (an established HO inhibitor) provides neuroprotection. This neuroprotection may be due to its effects on inducible pathways such as NOS and COX. Therefore, further experimentation is required to fully elucidate the role that HO plays following cerebral ischaemia, and additional in vivo evidence will be necessary to establish HO inhibitors as a putative candidate for cerebral ischaemia neuroprotection.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cerebral ischemia</field><field name="subject">cerebral arteries</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="subject">heme oxygenase</field><field name="subject">bilirubin</field><field name="subject">neuroprotective agents</field><field name="subject">protoporphyrins</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090119.150318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chordopoxviruses encode a novel class of F-box proteins</field><field name="creator">Sonnberg, Stephanie</field><field name="description">Poxviruses are an extensive family of large DNA viruses, including the human pathogen variola virus, which causes smallpox. Vertebrate poxviruses encode numerous proteins of unknown function that contain an ankyrin repeat (ANK) domain. ANK domains have been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions and are present in a large number of cellular proteins involved in pathways such as transcription, cell cycle regulation and development. Recently, an F-box-like motif, which conserved key residues of the cellular F-box motif, was identified at the C-terminus of these proteins. Most cellular F-box proteins are specificity factors of SCF1 ubiquitin ligases, recruiting substrate proteins to the SCF1 complex where they are poly-ubiquitinated. F-box proteins use their N-terminal F-box to bind the SCF1 complex, and a second interaction motif, such as a leucine-rich-repeat domain, but never an ANK domain, to recruit the substrate. Poxviral ANK/F-box-like proteins exhibit a reversed domain order compared to cellular F-box proteins, and a novel domain combination of ANK domain and putative F-box. The aim of this study was to examine the functionality of the poxviral F-box-like motif and to assess whether poxviral ANK/F-box-like proteins could function as specificity factors of cellular ubiquitin ligases. 
 Using immunoprecipitation of transiently expressed recombinant proteins, several poxvirus F-box-like motifs that represented the sequence variation and differences in motif length observed among poxvirus ANK/F-box-like proteins, were tested and found to be functional F-box domains. The poxviral ANK/F-box proteins interacted with all three subunits of the SCF1 complex, Skp1 (directly), Cul1 and Rbx1 (indirectly) regardless of the manner of SCF1 expression (transient over-expression or endogenous). A representative poxviral F-box was found to be both necessary and sufficient for binding SCF1, while the ANK domain of the same protein was expendable. SCF1 ubiquitin ligases bound by a poxviral ANK/F-box protein remained competent in forming poly-ubiquitin chains, indicating that these poxviral proteins are not inhibitors of SCF1. 
 This evidence strongly suggests that poxvirus ANK/F-box proteins function as specificity factors of SCF1 ubiquitin ligases. Individual chordopoxviruses each encode several discrete ANK/F-box proteins. The five ANK/F-box proteins of one poxvirus, orf virus, were competent in binding SCF1, and when transiently expressed, were found to exhibit different sub-cellular localization patterns that were consistent in two cell lines and in the presence and absence of orf virus infection. Furthermore, the ANK domains of the five orf virus ANK/F-box proteins were distinct in primary amino acid sequence and in predicted tertiary structure. Together theses findings indicate that the five orf virus ANK/F-box proteins interact with different binding partners. 
 In summary, this study identifies a novel class of F-box proteins encoded by chordopoxviruses that exhibits a reversed domain order and a novel domain combination of ANK domain with a truncated, but functional, F-box motif. Bioinformatic analysis, structure modeling, and microscopy findings suggest that chordopoxvirus ANK/F-box proteins function as specificity factors of SCF1 ubiquitin ligases. Several viruses use specificity factors to target cellular anti-viral factors to the ubiquitination system, a virulence mechanism that now seems likely to also exist in poxviruses.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">poxviruses</field><field name="subject">proteins</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090120.145226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The enthusiasm for disease screening : an ethical critique with a sociological perspective</field><field name="creator">Lau, Yvonne</field><field name="description">Screening is generally considered a useful strategy in the prevention of chronic diseases. The notion is that early detection through the use of certain screening tests can facilitate effective preventive measures to be undertaken which can then lead to improved prognosis from or ultimate avoidance of serious clinical diseases. The enthusiasm for screening in the United States is high and can be seen by the size of public demand for it. Rapid technological advances and knowledge expansion in the past decade have further facilitated the introduction of new tests and screening opportunities. In the mean time, the concept of screening has undergone subtle changes. Previous emphasis on clear and demonstrable population health benefits has been slowly replaced by an emphasis on individual responsibility for the surveillance of personal health risks. Disease screening is frequently advocated as part of a health promotion programme. As a clinician who has worked in breast cancer screening and who is wary of the complexities and problems associated with disease screening, my contention is that the enthusiasm for screening may not ultimately be conducive to health and well-being. 
 This thesis represents an effort to understand the popularity and enthusiasm for disease screening, how it has come about and, why it may not be conducive to health and well-being. The thesis begins with a description of the phenomenon to be followed by a detailed examination of the scientific principles behind disease screening. It then moves on to discover how the phenomenon might have come about by first considering the evolution of biomedicine over the centuries and then its present endeavour in the form of surveillance medicine as well as the latter&#65533;s relationship with today&#65533;s market economy. Using relevant case studies that involve, for example, cancer and prenatal genetic screening, this thesis explores different concerns relating to health and well-being, including such topics as the creation of health roles, the reconfiguration of human values and interpersonal relationships as well as medicalisation. A final chapter offers an account of health and well-being and sums up why the enthusiasm for screening may not be conducive to health and well-being. 
 The enthusiasm for screening compels people to assume health as a moral virtue. Screening is turned into a ritual that people consume to attain salvation. Since diseases may lead to death, diseases must be avoided though screening. Yet health is not just about the absence of disease. Health and well-being can only be realised by the individual within the context of the individual&#65533;s life as a whole. The institution of biomedicine has undeniable responsibility to ensure that screening will not be used to the detriment of individuals&#65533; health and well-being. Without condemning disease screening as a potentially useful tool in the prevention of disease, this thesis advocates prudence in its utilisation. People must not be compelled to attend screening through programmes of promotion (commercially related or not). Rather, autonomous decisions must be facilitated as far as possible through the provision of clear, accurate and factual information.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical screening</field><field name="subject">sociological aspects</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090121.085918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of fluorescence-guided Er:YAG laser debridement and mechanical therapy for the non-surgical treatment of chronic periodontitis : a controlled prospective clinical study</field><field name="creator">Soo, Lingfeng</field><field name="description">Aims: The aim of this study was to compare two different methods of root surface debridement for the treatment of moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis; fluorescence-guided laser debridement using an Er:YAG laser (ERL) or mechanical scaling and root-planing (SRP/UL) using an ultrasonic scaler and hand instruments. The effectiveness of each treatment method was assessed by patient-centred outcomes such as clinical periodontal measurements and patients&#65533; overall experience. 
 Methods: This study was a phase IV randomised controlled clinical trial, with all examinations and treatments carried out between 1st February 2007 and 7th March 2008. Using a split-mouth design, each patient received both test and control treatments. The control quadrants received scaling and root planing using a Piezon&#65533; (EMS, Nyon, Switzerland) ultrasonic scaler and Gracey curettes, while the test quadrants received fluorescence-guided Er:YAG laser root debridement (Keylaser 3, Kavo, Biberach, Germany; panel settings 160mJ/pulse, 10Hz, water spray, 655nm fluorescence calculus-detection system). Full mouth clinical measurements [plaque index (PlI), probing depth (PD), gingival recession (GR), bleeding on probing (BOP), and clinical attachment level (CAL)] were recorded at baseline, and 6 and 12 weeks post-therapy. A patient questionnaire was used to evaluate patient perception in terms of pain, discomfort and satisfaction during treatment, and 24 hours and one week post-treatment. A wash-out period of 6 weeks enabled each patient to evaluate their experience of each treatment on its own merit. 
 Results: Twenty-eight patients received both treatments and completed the patient perception questionnaire. No significant difference was found between ERL and SRP/UL in terms of pain and discomfort during treatment, and 24 hours and one week post-treatment. In terms of patient satisfaction, none of the patients rated ERL more favourably than SRP/UL immediately following treatment, however no significant difference was found 24 hours later and one week post-therapy. Complete clinical data was collected for 22 patients, four of whom increased their tobacco consumption to [greater than or equal to] 10 cigarettes/day. Therefore, the analysis of clinical data was carried out twice with respect to patients&#65533; smoking status. In patients who smoked [less than or equal to] 9 cigarettes/day (n = 18 patients), ERL provided less PD reduction at 6 and 12 weeks (p &lt; 0.001, 6 weeks; p &lt; 0.05, 12 weeks) than SRP/UL. Even though SRP/UL quadrants had a greater proportion of sites with BOP (% BOP) at baseline, at 6 weeks they showed a significantly greater reduction in %BOP (p = 0.0123) than ERL quadrants, however there was with no significant difference in bleeding scores (p = 0.202) at 12 weeks post-therapy. When patients who smoked [greater than or equal to] 10 cigarettes/day were included in the analyses (n = 22 patients), ERL resulted in less BOP reduction and PD reduction at 6 and 12 weeks following treatment (BOP reduction: 6 weeks p &lt; 0.05, 12 weeks p &lt; 0.001; PD reduction: 6 weeks p &lt; 0.01, 12 weeks p &lt; 0.05). Although statistically significant, the differences between the treatment groups were very small and were not clinically significant. 
 Conclusion: The use of ERL for root surface debridement offers no significant advantages over mechanical therapy in the treatment of moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis, in terms of clinical outcomes and patient perception of pain, discomfort or satisfaction related to the procedure.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">periodontitis</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">lasers in dentistry</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090216.150022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of an Orf virus RING-H2 protein, B5L : a mimic of cellular anaphase promoting complex subunit 11</field><field name="creator">Mo, Min</field><field name="description">The anaphase promoting complex (APC/C) is an ubiquitin ligase that is an essential regulator of multiple steps in the cell cycle. The complex consists of at least 12 subunits with a catalytic core formed by a scaffold protein, APC2, and a RING-H2 protein, APC11. The Parapoxvirus, Orf virus (OV), encodes a RING-H2 protein, B5L, with clear sequence similarities to APC11. The disruption of APC/C function leads to pre-mature entry into S phase and a delayed M phase exit and, potentially, apoptosis. This investigation explored the functional significance of the similarity between B5L and APC11 and specifically sought to determine if B5L manipulates cell cycle regulation by targeting APC/C function. 
 Co-immunoprecipitation experiments from lysates of cells expressing a range of constructs revealed an interaction between B5L and APC2 in the same manner as seen with APC11. Furthermore, B5L was found to associate with endogenous APC/C. However, although APC11 promoted the formation of polyubiquitin chains in substrate-independent in vitro assays, B5L was inactive in this assay. Bioinformatics comparisons of APC11 and other known RING ubiquitin ligases with B5L and its poxviral homologues revealed some subtle differences. In particular a domain of APC11 (amino acids 61-74), that is essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity is not conserved in B5L or its homologues. When this APC11 domain was incorporated in place of the corresponding region of B5L (amino acids 59-67), the mutated B5L acquired ubiquitin ligase activity. On the other hand, APC11 protein in which the domain was replaced with that of B5L lost ubiquitin ligase activity. 
 Stable cell lines expressing B5L showed an increased number of cells in G2/M phase (30&#65533;4%) compared with cell lines expressing APC11 (11&#65533;2%, n=3, p&lt;0.05, ANOVA, Tukey&#65533;s), consistent with impaired APC/C function. APC/C substrates such as cyclin A, cyclin B and the thymidine kinase were stablized in B5L-expressing cells compared with control cells. Furthermore, transient hyper-expression of B5L induced apoptosis in 25&#65533;2% (n=3, p&lt;0.05) of the cell population compared with only 6&#65533;1% apoptotic cells when APC11 was hyper-expressed. Analysis of the DNA content of OV-infected cells revealed enhanced DNA synthesis compared with cells infected with a B5L knockout OV. 
 These observations indicate that B5L is a non-functional mimic of APC11. It associates with APC/C, but lacks ubiquitin ligase activity, and hence disrupts APC/C function. These abilities may enable OV to induce a cellular environment that enhances viral replication.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Orf virus</field><field name="subject">ubiquitin</field><field name="subject">ligases</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090220.085825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and characterisation of chitosan derivatives</field><field name="creator">Munro, Natasha Helen</field><field name="description">Chitin is a natural polymer which is extracted from a number of biological sources. This polymer is deacetylated to form the related polymer chitosan. The design and preparation of chitosan derivatives has been investigated to tailor the physical and chemical properties towards specific applications. To this end, this thesis describes the synthesis and characterisation of a number of chitosan derivatives. The prepared polymers contained either naphthalimide groups, thiol groups, poly(methyl methacrylate) side chains or poly(oligoethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate) side chains. 
 Chitin was successfully extracted and purified from squid pens by literature methods to give polymers with DD values from 12 to 23%. The Kurita method was used to obtain chitosan samples with a range of DD values from 75 to 91%. The prepared polymers were characterised by microanalysis, IR, &#65533;H NMR and solid-state &#65533;&#65533;C NMR spectroscopy. The MW distributions of the chitosan samples were determined by GPC in 0.3 M AcOH/0.2 M AcONa(aq) solution with dextran standards. 
 The N-(naphthalimide)-chitosan derivatives were fluorescent materials and were typically prepared from the reaction of 4-bromonaphthalic anhydride with chitosan. This reaction was thoroughly investigated to find the optimal reaction conditions. The bromo groups were subsequently displaced by one of four nucleophiles: dimethylamine, piperidine, methoxide or vinylferrocene. The polymers were characterised by microanalysis, GPC, IR, &#65533;H NMR, UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. The excitation and emission wavelengths and Stokes shifts were dependent on the substituent present in the naphthalimide group. 
 Chitin and chitosan were sequentially reacted with tosyl chloride, potassium thioacetate and sodium methoxide to form the thiolated derivatives. The success of the tosylation reaction was dependent on the synthetic route used and the DD of the polysaccharide. The thiolated chitin polymers were well defined although the samples were completely insoluble. The thiolated chitosan polymers were also characterised and were highly swollen in acetic acid solution. 
 These thiolated polysaccharides were used as macroinitiators for the free-radical polymerisation of MMA. The products obtained from the reaction of 6-mercaptochitin in DMSO with MMA were typically prepared with low yields and low amounts of grafting. The products prepared from 6-mercaptochitosan under the same conditions contained larger amounts of the synthetic polymers although the products were highly variable. MMA was subsequently polymerised with 6-mercaptochitosan in acetic acid buffer to form highly grafted copolymers. 
 Chitosan was reacted with the monomer OEGMA by ATRP to form chitosan-graft-poly(OEGMA) copolymers. Two synthetic routes were investigated. The "grafting-from" route involved. the formation of a chitosan macroinitiator and polymerisation of OEGMA with this polymer. The polymers contained a large amount of grafted side chains as estimated from the &#65533;H NMR spectra. However, the purification was not satisfactory as determined by the presence of two peaks in the GPC traces. The "grafting-to", route involved the formation of poly(OEGMA) by ATRP with activated initiators and subsequent attachment to chitosan. The prepared copolymers showed large differences in their appearance with even very low amounts of grafting. The purification of the polymers prepared by this method was successful with no detectable homopolymer as determined by GPC analysis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chitosan</field><field name="subject">polymerization</field><field name="subject">chitin</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090225.161155</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Canterbury Society of Arts 1880-1996 : conformity and dissension revisited</field><field name="creator">Feeney, Warren</field><field name="description">Established in 1880 the Canterbury Society of Arts (CSA) dominated the arts in Canterbury for nearly a century and was the most significant art society in New Zealand. This thesis examines the CSA&#65533;s history from 1880 to its change in trading name to the Centre of Contemporary Art (COCA) in 1996 when the Society sought to redefine its role. Chapter One considers its origins, comprising a discussion of the period from 1850 to 1880 in which it was founded as part of an educational complex that reflected Edward Gibbon Wakefield&#65533;s ideal for the systematic settlement of Canterbury. A discussion of the Society&#65533;s permanent collection from 1881 to 1932 in the following chapter draws attention to how the CSA was guided by its founding ambitions to promote the development of New Zealand art and accompanying responsibilities for art education. Chapter Three considers the premises and art galleries utilised by the Society from 1881 to 1932, revealing that its objectives to advance the arts remained visionary and often demanding. In Chapter Four the period between the Depression and the end of the Second World War is examined and economic and aesthetic challenges, evident in the Society&#65533;s limited capacity to purchase works for its collection, alongside the emergence of new art organisations such as the Group are discussed. This is followed by a consideration of the post-war period from the perspective of the CSA&#65533;s remarkable secretary from 1943 to 1959, William Sykes Baverstock. His response to an emerging modern movement provides a context to examine significant changes in the arts which initially posed a challenge to the CSA. Consideration of the 1960s to mid-1970s in Chapter Six reveals the vital role played by the CSA in supporting the development of contemporary New Zealand art and includes discussion of significant events and exhibitions such as the Hay&#65533;s Art Prize and the expansion of the Society&#65533;s programme to include international shows and solo exhibitions of contemporary sculpture, craft, design, and painting. It argues that these activities represented the CSA&#65533;s most ambitious and successful period in its history, symbolised by its new modernist-styled gallery which opened at 66 Gloucester Street in 1968. An examination of the late 1970s to mid-1980s in Chapter Seven demonstrates that the CSA continued to maintain its influence as a centre for contemporary arts practice. However, the demands of a greater arts professionalism championed by the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council and accompanied by a growth in dealer galleries, meant that the CSA also became subjected to criticism and this despite its continuing capacity to expose large audiences to new and challenging arts practices. The close and long-standing relationship between the CSA and the Canterbury College School of Art is considered in Chapter Eight and the way in which this contributed to the Society&#65533;s cultural supremacy is acknowledged. The deaccession of 42 important historical works from the CSA&#65533;s permanent collection in 1995 discussed in Chapter Nine reveals the extent to which its stature had substantially changed by the 1990s. Its essentially nineteenth-century infrastructure was ultimately inappropriate for addressing new levels of arts professionalism. Chapter Ten concludes that the CSA was a visionary, and sometimes radical, arts organisation that deserves to be more carefully and generously considered. Indeed, its long history reveals a vital arts and educational institution that has made an essential but hitherto hugely underrated contribution to New Zealand&#65533;s cultural development.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Canterbury Society of Arts</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">societies</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Canterbury</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090226.135746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution and ranging of Hector&#65533;s dolphins : implications for protected area design</field><field name="creator">Rayment, William J</field><field name="description">The efficacy of a Marine Protected Area (MPA) is contingent on it having a design appropriate for the species it is intended to protect. Hector&#65533;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori), a coastal delphinid endemic to New Zealand, is endangered due to bycatch in gillnets. Analyses of survival rate and population viability suggest that the Banks Peninsula population is most likely still declining despite the presence of the Banks Peninsula Marine Mammal Sanctuary (BPMMS), where gillnetting is regulated. More data on distribution and movements of dolphins are therefore required to improve the design of the BPMMS. On aerial surveys of Hector&#65533;s dolphin distribution at Banks Peninsula over three years, sightings were made up to 19 n.mi. offshore. On average, 19% of dolphins were sighted outside the BPMMS&#65533;s 4 n.mi. offshore boundary in summer, compared to 56% in winter. On similar surveys of the South Island&#65533;s west coast, all dolphins were sighted within 6 n.mi. of the coast and there was no seasonal change in distribution. At each location, Mantel tests indicated that distance offshore had the strongest and most consistent effect on distribution. However, a logistic regression model using the combined datasets suggested that distribution was most strongly defined by water depth, with all sightings made inside the 90 m isobath. Boat surveys were carried out at Banks Peninsula (2002 to 2006) to continue the long-term photo-ID project. Using the 22 year dataset, alongshore home-range of the 20 most frequently sighted dolphins was estimated by univariate kernel methods. Mean alongshore range was 49.69 km (SE = 5.29), 60% larger than the previous estimate. Fifteen percent of these individuals had ranges extending beyond the northern boundary of the BPMMS. An acoustic data logger, the T-POD, was trialled for passive acoustic monitoring of Hector&#65533;s dolphins. Simultaneous T-POD/theodolite surveys revealed that T-PODs reliably detected dolphins within 200m. No detections were made beyond 500m. To monitor inshore habitat use, T-PODs were deployed in three locations at Banks Peninsula (n = 431 days). A GLM analysis of Detection Positive Minutes (DPM) per day indicated that season had the largest effect on detection rate, with over twice as many DPMs per day in summer (x&#772; = 99.8) as winter (x&#772; = 47.6). The new findings on Hector&#65533;s dolphin distribution and ranging can be used to improve the design of the BPMMS. It is recommended that the offshore boundary of the BPMMS is extended to 20 n.mi. (37 km), the northern boundary is moved 12 km north and recreational gillnetting is prohibited year round. In areas where distribution of Hector&#65533;s dolphin has not been studied, the offshore boundary of MPAs should enclose the 100 m isobath.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hector's dolphin</field><field name="subject">counting</field><field name="subject">Cetacea populations</field><field name="subject">estimates</field><field name="subject">aerial surveys in wildlife management</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Banks Peninsula.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090227.161621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ageing and emotion : categorisation, recognition, and social understanding</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Melissa-Sue</field><field name="description">The present thesis investigated age differences in emotion recognition skills of 146 older adults (age range 60-92 years) and 146 young adults (age range 18-25 years) in four experiments. Experiment 1 assessed participants&#65533; ability to categorise facial expressions of sadness, fear, happiness, and surprise. In Experiments 2 and 3, participants were asked to identify six emotions (happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, anger, disgust) from still and dynamic faces, alone and in combination with vocal expressions. Finally, Experiment 4 compared performance on these standard emotion recognition paradigms to that of more ecologically-valid measures; the Faux Pas and Verbosity and Social Cues Tasks. 
 Across the four studies, there was evidence of an age-related decline in emotion recognition skills. Older adults were overall less sensitive to perceptual differences between faces in Experiment 1 and showed a loss of categorical perception effect for fearful faces. Older adults were less accurate than young adults at recognising expressions of sadness, anger, and fear, across types of expression (voices and faces). There were some differences across modalities, with older adults showing difficulties with fear recognition for faces, but not voices, and difficulty in matching happy voices to happy faces but not for happy voices and faces presented in isolation. Experiment 2 also showed that the majority of older adult participants had some decline in emotion recognition skills. 
 Age differences in performance were also apparent on the more ecologically-valid measures. Older adults were more likely than young adults to rate the protagonist as behaving inappropriately in the Faux Pas Task, even with the control videos, suggesting difficulty in discriminating faux pas. Older adults were also judged to be more verbose and to offer more off-topic information during the Verbosity Task than young adults and were less likely to recognise expressions of boredom in the Social Cues Task. 
 These findings are discussed in terms of three theoretical accounts. A positivity bias (indicating increased recognition and experience of positive emotions and reduction for negative emotions) was not consistent with the older adults&#65533; difficulties with matching happy faces to voices and relatively preserved performance with disgusted expressions. Age-related decline in cognitive processes did not account for the specific pattern of age differences observed. The most plausible explanation for the age differences in the present thesis is that age-related neurological changes in the brain areas that process emotions, specifically the temporal and frontal areas, are likely to contribute to the older adults&#65533; declines in performance on emotion categorisation, emotion recognition, and social cognition tasks.

All anxiolytic medications produce a decrease in rodent hippocampal theta rhythm - so hippocampal theta could underlie some types of anxiety. But, a review (Chapter 2) showed that ethanol and other anxiolytics increase FM-theta in the human scalp EEG and have other properties unlike hippocampal theta. The experiments in this thesis, therefore, tested for other potential homologues (Chapter 3) of hippocampal theta in the human EEG. 
 The phase of hippocampal theta activity is reset in a working memory task and not an equivalent reference memory task in rats. Furthermore, low doses ethanol increases and high dose ethanol (and other anxiolytics) decrease theta activity. So, EEG was recorded from 15 scalp sites while participants performed non-verbal working memory and reference memory tasks before and after ethanol administration and assessed for the presence of phase-reset and ethanol-related changes in 5-7Hz and 8-11Hz spectral power (chapter 4 and 5). 
 There was little general evidence for stimulus-induced phase-resetting of the ongoing EEG activity (Chapter 6). Increased post-stimulus synchronization in the theta frequency range was accompanied by increases in post-stimulus spectral power - suggesting that the synchronised activity was evoked rather than reset. 
 Across 3 experiments (Chapter 7), low dose ethanol (54.5-146.6[mu]g/l) increased 5-7Hz theta, while the highest dose (307[mu]g/l) reduced task-related-increases in 5-7Hz activity. These effects were noted across electrode locations including frontal-midline sites and particularly at the beginning of the delay period. The suppression of 5-7Hz activity also coincided with an impairment in working memory performance. The dose-response curve for 5-7Hz theta was as predicted from rat hippocampal work. This particular component, linked to high working memory load or task difficulty, is a potential of homologue hippocampal theta. A clear decrease in theta with high dose ethanol, of this type, has not been reported previously. 
 Activity in the 8-11Hz range typically increased with all doses of ethanol. It is clearly not a homologue of hippocampal theta. This is consistent with previous reports of increased alpha with high doses of ethanol - although these have been accompanied by increased, not decreased, theta. 
 There is a potential homologue of hippocampal theta that can be detected in the human EEG (chapter 8); but the observed changes in 5-7Hz activity cannot be localised and may not be related to the hippocampus. It is clear there is more than one type of theta within the human EEG - with opposing sensitivities to ethanol. Critically, these types were detected at a single site and apparently in phase with one another. The current data, together with the previous literature, suggest that theta can be generated concurrently in distinct networks that, under specific task demands, can become coherent and so produce synchonised activity. Future studies need to test higher doses of ethanol and other anxiolytics and use different experimental paradigms to further differentiate the theta systems in the human EEG. Human EEG could be useful for differentiating sub-types of anxiety, and the choice and effectiveness of interventions delivered.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anxiety disorders</field><field name="subject">physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">theta rhythm</field><field name="subject">electroencephalography</field><field name="subject">hippocampus (brain)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090309.150949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theta activations associated with goal-conflict processing : evidence for the revised "behavioral inhibition system"</field><field name="creator">Neo, Phoebe Suat-Hong</field><field name="description">In the theory of the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS), Gray and McNaughton (2000) classified events that produce or inhibit goal-directed behaviour into two affective categories: approach versus avoidance. We experience goal-conflict when approximately equal but incompatible approach and avoidance tendencies are concurrently activated. Gray and McNaughton (2000) proposed goal-conflict as a class of mechanisms separable from "simple" mechanisms: Goal-conflict effects are maximal when incompatible approach and avoidance tendencies are balanced, simple effects are maximal when either approach or avoidance tendencies predominate. 
 Gray and McNaughton (2000) saw the hippocampus as a key nexus for resolving goal conflict by recursive amplification of the subjective value of punishment, thereby increasing avoidance tendencies. Rodent hippocampal theta (4-12 Hz) is necessary (but not sufficient) for correct and efficient transmission of hipppocampal outputs. The BIS theory is fundamentally an animal model. It is not clear if a human BIS exists in the same form. Record human hippocampal (4-12 Hz) activity from the scalp is unlikely. However, during goal-conflict resolution, cortically generated theta recorded from the scalp could be modulated by human hippocampal theta. Therefore, superficially recorded 4-12 Hz theta spectra power was used to assess if specific goal-conflict processing activity could be detected in humans. 
 Human goal-conflict processing was assessed in four experiments: the Stop-Signal Task (SST), an existing experimental task, and three variations of a task termed "Choice", created for this thesis. Across experiments, three key conditions were created. Approach and avoidance were balanced in the intermediate condition (maximal goal-conflict). Net approach and avoidance predominated in the adjacent conditions respectively (minimal goal-conflict). Goal-conflict was assessed as the difference between activity in the intermediate condition and the average activity across the adjacent conditions (via extraction of the orthogonal quadratic trend for significance testing). 
 Goal-conflict increased activations consistently at F8, above the right frontal cortex. Increase in task dependent goal-conflict activations were also observed at F7, Fz and F4 above the frontal cortex, and T3, T4, T5 and T6 above the temporal cortex. Activations within the human theta frequency range (4-7 Hz) were consistently detected in the Choice tasks. In the SST, activations spanned the conventional human theta (4-7 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) frequencies. In the Choice tasks, higher conflict theta at T3, T5 and F8 predicted increased avoidance. 
 Taken together, the findings support Gray and McNaugthon&#65533;s (2000) views that a) goal-conflict is a class of mechanism separable from simple approach and avoidance; b) goal-conflict processing recruits and increases cortical rhythmic activity within the same frequency range as rodent hippocampal theta (4-12 Hz); and goal-conflict is resolved by increasing the subjective value of punishment, thereby increasing avoidance tendencies. Although speculative, the current work identified a right inferior frontal gyrus neural circuit for slower, and a presupplementary motor area circuit for faster behavioral inhibition during goal-conflict resolution. These circuits are not explicit in the current BIS model.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">goal (psychology)</field><field name="subject">theta rhythm</field><field name="subject">hippocampus (brain)</field><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="subject">nervous system</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090309.160549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rapid effects of estrogen on intracellular calcium levels in adult GnRH neurons</field><field name="creator">Romano, Nicola</field><field name="description">The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons of the hypothalamus are the principal regulators of reproductive function and are strongly modulated by estrogen (E&#8322;). Several studies indicate that E&#8322; is able to influence GnRH neurons, both with "classical" long-term transcriptional effects, and with rapid non-transcriptional effects. One most interesting action of E&#8322; is that of modulating intracellular calcium concentration [Ca&#65533;&#8314;]I: this has been shown to happen in many different cell types, including embryonic models of GnRH neurons. 
 The aim of this project was to evaluate if these rapid effects of E&#8322; on [Ca&#65533;&#8314;]I also happen at the level of adult GnRH neurons. In order to study the acute effects of E&#8322; on calcium dynamics, a novel transgenic mouse line was generated, that allows real-time measurement of [Ca&#65533;&#8314;]I selectively in GnRH neurons in an acute brain slice preparation. Using this mouse line, our group has previously shown that these cells show spontaneous activity in the form of Ca&#65533;&#8314; transients. 
 A first set of experiments was designed to define the effects of E&#8322; on spontaneous activity. E&#8322; was found to modulate [Ca&#65533;&#8314;]I in a activity-dependent manner: it increased the frequency of [Ca&#65533;&#8314;]I transients in about 50% of GnRH neurons with low spontaneous activity, whereas it decreased the frequency of the transients in more than 80% spontaneously active GnRH neurons. Different experiments were then performed in order to determine the molecular pathways that generates these opposite effects. 
 The inhibitory effect was reproduced by the membrane-impermeable compound E2-6-BSA, indicating that it happens through a membrane receptor. The E&#8322; isomer l7&#945;-estradiol was also able to reproduce the inhibitory effect of E&#8322;, suggesting the involvement of some non-classical receptor. This is also confirmed by the presence of this effect in estrogen-receptor &#946; (ER-&#946;) knock-out mice, which exclude the involvement of this receptor. 
 The stimulatory effect was found to be generated through a novel, indirect mechanism. It cannot be reproduced by E2-6-BSA nor by l7&#945;-estradiol, and it is still present in the ER-&#946; knock-out mice. The stimulation, though, can be reproduced in about 50% of cells with an ER-&#945; selective agonist. As this receptor is not present in GnRH neurons, an indirect mechanism must be generating the stimulatory effect. Blockage of action potential mediated synaptic transmission with tetrodotoxin (TTX) did not block E&#8322; effects, but blockage of non-action potential mediated GABAergic transmission using the GABA[A] selective blocker gabazine completely abolished them. Our hypothesis is therefore that E&#8322; stimulates the generation of [Ca&#65533;&#8314;]I transients through estrogen-receptor a (ER-&#945;) located in the terminals of GABAergic afferents. This modulation, in turn, is able to determine release of Ca&#65533;&#8314; from IP&#8323;-sensitive intracellular stores. To confirm this, we applied exogenous GABA to the neurons and found that it was able to initiate [Ca&#65533;&#8314;]I transients. Furthermore, removal of tonic GABAergic tone with gabazine was able to block spontaneous activity. 
 To further analyse the effects of E&#8322;, Ca&#65533;&#8314; imaging experiments were performed together with cell-attached patch clamp electrophysiological recordings in order to correlate the electrical activity with the calcium activity. Simultaneous recordings revealed a strong correlation between [Ca&#65533;&#8314;]I transients and bursts of action currents in adult GnRH neurons. E&#8322; was able to increase the electrical activity of GnRH neurons with low spontaneous activity, and inhibit that of highly active ones. Application of GABA to GnRH neurons resulted in increased firing, accompanied by an increase in [Ca&#65533;&#8314;]I. 
 These observations provide evidence for a complex mechanism of E&#8322; action on adult GnRH neurons, that may be important for the generation of the pulsatile release of this hormone.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">estrogen</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">calcium in the body</field><field name="subject">luteinizing hormone releasing hormone</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090310.144345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organic architecture : its origin, development and impact on mid 20th century Melbourne architecture</field><field name="creator">Njoo, Alex Haw Gie</field><field name="description">Australia in the early 50s followed a decade or so of frenzy activities in the visual arts.

Although many studies have been conducted on noncompliant visitor behaviour within natural resource areas, few attempts have been made to gain an understanding of the behaviour, or to understand the decision making process.  This dissertation seeks to address this gap by exploring salient motivations behind noncompliant behaviour within a natural recreation setting.  The study was conducted over the summer of 2007-2008 within the popular tourist attractions of Fox and Franz Josef glaciers, Westland National park, New Zealand.  The Department of Conservation has a legal and increasingly a moral obligation to provide a level of service and ensure a high standard of visitor safety within lands it administers.  However, despite its efforts, management actions are criticised as being &#8216;over cautious&#8217;, and consequently a large number of visitors choose to ignore hazard warnings communicated by management and cross safety barriers, placing themselves and others at considerable risk.  Previous studies at the glaciers have identified a number of causes for visitor non-compliance, including situational factors and the adequacy of current visitor management procedures.  Through a quantitative measure, and qualitative interview responses, study findings show that visitor compliance with protective recommendations was strongly influenced by a number of situational factors including the proximity of track end points from the glacier terminus; the visibility of other visitors beyond the roped barriers; modest hazard perceptions of visitors; estimated visitor age; time of day and weather conditions.  Based on visitor interview responses, motives of non-compliance were further explored by classifying behaviour according to Gramann and Vander Stoep&#8217;s (1987) typologies of normative violations.  It is identified, using Ajzen&#8217;s (1985; 1991) theory of planned behaviour, that non-compliance with protective recommendations at the glaciers is motivated by, (1) a &#8216;belief&#8217; that the situation or resource encouraged it; (2), through a release of &#8216;social pressure&#8217;, because everyone else was going over; and (3), a &#8216;perceived facilitation of the behaviour&#8217;, in that there were no obvious consequences to self or others.  Implications for management to control noncompliant behaviour are discussed in detail.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">visitor management</field><field name="subject">national parks</field><field name="subject">recreation</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">protective recommendations</field><field name="subject">non-compliance</field><field name="subject">Franz Josef Glacier</field><field name="subject">Fox Glacier</field><field name="subject">hazard management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neural mechanisms involved in cross-limb transfer of strength and ballistic motor learning</field><field name="creator">Lee, Michael, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the potential mechanisms and sites of neural adaptations that mediate cross-limb transfer of strength and motor learning that can occur subsequent to unilateral training. Better understanding of the mechanisms should allow therapeutic benefits of this effect to be assessed. There are two main classes of mechanisms that could contribute to cross-limb transfer. The first is described by the ??bilateral access?? hypothesis, which suggests that neural adaptations induced by training reside in bilaterally projecting motor areas that are accessible to the untrained (ipsilateral) hemisphere during task execution to facilitate performance. According to the alternative ??cross-activation?? hypothesis, activation of the untrained hemisphere during unilateral training leads to adaptations in the untrained hemisphere that cause improved performance with the opposite untrained limb. A series of studies were conducted in this research. We directly tested the cross-activation hypothesis via a reliable twitch interpolation technique involving transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Four-weeks of strength training for the right wrist increased neural drive (from the untrained motor cortex) to the untrained left wrist. The data demonstrate that strength training of one limb can influence the efficacy of corticospinal pathways that project to the opposite untrained limb, consistent with the cross-activation hypothesis.  To investigate the contribution of each hemisphere in cross-limb transfer, we applied repetitive TMS (rTMS) to the trained or the untrained motor cortex to disrupt brain processing after unilateral ballistic training. Learning to produce ballistic movements requires optimization of motor drive to the relevant muscles in a way that resembles high-force contractions performed during strength training. Ballistic skill transferred rapidly to the untrained hand and the improved performance was accompanied by bilateral increases in corticospinal excitability. Performance improvement in each hand was specifically suppressed by rTMS of the opposite hemisphere. Thus the motor cortex ipsilateral to the trained hand is critically altered during unilateral training; and neural adaptations within this untrained hemisphere are crucial in cross-limb transfer of ballistic skill. Overall, the data are in agreement with the cross-activation hypothesis for high-force and ballistic tasks, although they do not exclude the potential involvement of bilateral access mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cross-limb transfer</field><field name="subject">Cross education</field><field name="subject">Strength training</field><field name="subject">Motor learning</field><field name="subject">Transcranial magnetic stimulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A metabolic approach to the GABAergic system</field><field name="creator">Nasrallah, Fatma, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Here, we investigated the effects of modulation of the GABAergic system using a targeted neuropharmacological, 1H/13C NMR spectroscopy and metabolomic approach in Guinea pig cortical brain slices. The effects of exogenous GABA, agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators at GABAA receptors were described and classified on the basis of metabolic activity; this corresponded to receptor location rather than pharmacology. The effects of agonists and antagonists at the GABAB receptor were described and classified into inhibitory and excitatory components, consistent with context dependent outcomes of receptor activity. Metabolic evidence for GABAC mediated activity in the cerebral cortex was identified for the first time indicating a strong role for this receptor in the control of neuronal activity. Inhibition of GABA uptake was examined using inhibitors of these transporters. The major effect of individual transporter subtype blockade was increased synaptic inhibition. The paradoxical activity of the GABA-transaminase inhibitor vigabatrin was resolved, with a direct demonstration of a single inhibitory mechanism mediated via this drug, via a mechanism also induced by antagonists at the GABAC receptor. These data were then integrated using multivariate statistics to identify 5 subclasses of activity which corresponded to receptor location (e.g. synaptic or extrasynaptic) rather than receptor pharmacology.

Increasing evidence suggests that precarious employment is associated with poorer occupational health and safety (OHS) outcomes in terms of injury rates, disease risk and psychological wellbeing. This study used a cross sectional survey of 255 employees to compare the OHS experiences of temporary (N = 156, 61.2%) and permanent (N = 99, 38.8%) workers employed in three companies involved in the seasonal processing of primary agriculture products (dairy, meat and produce) in two regions of New Zealand.  This research identified a clearly definable group of temporary workers (seasonals), who exhibit different characteristics to those commonly associated with precarious employment as they have an expectation of reasonable lengths of fairly secure employment (seasons exceed eight months).  Many respondents only undertook one period of employment per year and were re-engaged in subsequent seasons.  There are limited opportunities for alternative employment adjacent to these plants.  This creates a dependant employment market, potentially putting labour in a weak bargaining position.  This is countered by a high overall level of union membership (N = 181, 71%) and the operation of collective employment contracts.  This may be atypical in seasonal industries.  Injury numbers were similar (permanent N = 49, 49.5%, temporary N = 73, 46.8%) and serious injuries (permanent N = 23, 23.2%, temporary N = 31, 19.9%).  Once a factor was introduced to compensate for exposure time, thereby creating a frequency rate, results showed a statistically significant difference with temporary workers suffering injuries and serious injuries with less exposure than their permanent counterparts (t (193.821) = -5.566, p &lt; 0.05 and (t (236.928) = -2.160, p &lt; 0.05 respectively).  There was a significant difference in chronic injuries with permanent employees being more likely to have a chronic injury (F91,253) = 20.456, p&lt;0.05).  Most importantly, using the General Linear Model (logistic regression), when all other influences were controlled for, this research found employment status remained influential in determining whether a respondent was injured at work or not.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PRECARIOUS EMPLOYMENT</field><field name="subject">TEMPORARY WORKERS</field><field name="subject">SEASONAL</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology and Molecular Biology of New HIV-1 Recombinants from Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Lau, Katherine Aik Hee</field><field name="description">PhD</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV-1, recombinants, CRF, Malaysia, inter-subtype recombination</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early Buddhist dhammak&#257;ya: Its philosophical and soteriological significance</field><field name="creator">Jantrasrisalai, Chanida</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dhammak&#257;ya/dharmak&#257;ya</field><field name="subject">early Buddhist teaching</field><field name="subject">meditation</field><field name="subject">bodies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patients, carers and nurses : collaborators in development of a new model of nursing care for older persons in the acute care setting</field><field name="creator">Hickman, Louise D.</field><field name="description">Globally the population is ageing and as a consequence people are living longer with multiple chronic conditions. A range of factors, including decreased lengths of hospital stay and a greater focus on community based care, has lead to an increasing acuity of patients admitted to acute care settings, many with complex care needs. To date, models of nursing care in acute settings have been configured to focus on acute, procedural care and do not meet the unique needs of the older person. In order to ensure optimal health outcomes of older hospitalised people, nursing care needs to be responsive to the priorities and needs of patients and their families. This study sought to collaboratively develop a model of nursing care with nurse clinicians to improve the care of older people in the acute care setting. Model development was driven by an action research framework, using evidence-based principles and a comprehensive needs assessment. A three phased, mixed method design was embedded within the overarching conceptual and philosophical framework of action research. The first phase of the study comprised a needs assessment and allowed appraisal of the needs of patients as perceived by patients, carer&#8217;s and nurses, this was performed using the Caring Activity Scale [CAS](1). Qualitative data and semi-structured interviews added depth to the survey data and qualified responses by confirming that patients thought that nurses did the best they could within a culture of busyness, while patients strived to maintain and sustain their own independence. Managing the discharge process and carer burden arose mainly from the carer semi-structured interviews only. Data revealed significant differences between patients, carer&#8217;s and nurses in relation to priority and satisfaction with care. Patients did not place a large importance on discharge care which contrasted with the focus of nursing initiatives. During the subsequent phases of the study a collaborative approach, using action research principles, was used to develop and implement a model of nursing care. A key feature of this model was the introduction of a team structure with a focus on patient centred care. Significant differences were identified in the pre model and post model patient groups in relation to satisfaction with care, with the post model group more satisfied than the pre group model group. Further, improvements in functional status and medication knowledge were demonstrated among patients cared for under the new model. This study has demonstrated that developing a model of care appropriate to the needs of patients, carer&#8217;s and nurses can be achieved through the use of action research principles. Study data illustrates the importance of collaboration, empowerment and change management principles in driving clinical improvement and patient satisfaction with care. The findings also underscore the importance of promoting and educating patients and carers as well as nurses about the importance of discharge planning to optimise post-discharge health outcomes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">medical care</field><field name="subject">intensive care nursing</field><field name="subject">geriatric nursing</field><field name="subject">hospitals</field><field name="subject">admission and discharge</field><field name="subject">action research in nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/37238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acting Your Age: A Study of the Relationship between Online Social Interaction and Identity in Older Adults</field><field name="creator">P.T.Dell@curtin.edu.au</field><field name="description">This study combined quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the relationship between Internet use and identity, particularly age-identity, in older Internet users. It has a theoretical basis in symbolic interactionism &#150; particularly the theories of Erving Goffman &#150; and conceptualizes identities as roles that are negotiated during social interaction.

The focus on older users was motivated by the strong focus of prior Internet research on younger users. Few studies have examined older users specifically, and fewer still have examined age-identity.

Thus, the focus in this study is on how changes in social interaction that occur due to Internet use affect the identity negotiation process. The research is focused around two key areas: whether older users experience the same kinds of online identity processes as younger users, and the impact exposure to novel audiences has on identity negotiation.

The study consists of two phases. In the first, a quantitative survey was administered in which a measure of age-identity was assessed and compared with measures of audience novelty. Results showed that a significant increase in variance of ageidentity is associated with communication with people from other countries. This finding supports the theory that identity is formed in negotiation with the audience with whom one communicates, and that expanding this audience may lead to identity effects.

To investigate this issue more deeply, a qualitative phase was conducted in which participants were interviewed using rapid ethnography techniques, and at the conclusion of which a model of the interaction between age-identity and Internet communication was developed. This model was then verified with follow-up interviews with key informants and with field observations from sites of online social interaction among seniors.

The model developed during the qualitative stage identifies three ways in which ageidentity is influenced by social interaction on the Internet. First, the Internet is used in response to emotional or practical consequences of ageing. Second, older Internet users could take advantage of the ability to manage their personal front online to achieve agelessness, and third, the Internet is used as a backstage area to discuss ageidentity issues. The context of these claims is all-important; each individual&#146;s unique circumstances, emotions and motivations influence the way in which they will use the Internet and respond to others encountered through it.

The extension of Goffman&#146;s dramaturgical metaphor to age- identity on the Internet and to include the concept of character development, in which identity evolves over time in response to inner tensions and external events, is a tentative but powerful finding. It poses a challenge for future research into the nature of identity change, both online and offline.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">internet use</field><field name="subject">social impact</field><field name="subject">older adults</field><field name="subject">goffman</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090318.134420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A reverse vaccinology approach to identifying subunit proteins for use in vaccines against Brachyspira pilosicoli infections in humans and animals</field><field name="creator">movahedi.ar@gmail.com</field><field name="description">The anaerobic intestinal spirochaete Brachyspira pilosicoli is the causative agent of &#147;intestinal spirochaetosis&#148; (IS), a disease of humans and a number of animal species. IS has been reported in adults and children worldwide but the prevalence in people living in poor hygienic conditions, indigenous populations, homosexual males, and in immunocompromised people is much higher than in other populations. IS is also widespread in pigs and chickens, and causes significant economic impact in the associated industries. To date attempts to develop a vaccine against B. pilosicoli to protect humans and animals have not been successful. 

In this study a reverse vaccinology approach was used, in which 24 putative open reading frames (ORFs) derived from a partial genome sequence of B. pilosicoli were subjected to in silico and laboratory screening processes to identify potential efficacious vaccine antigens. In silico analysis of the ORFs using a range of bioinformatics algorithms assigned 12 ORF products as periplasmic, outer membrane, or secretory proteins, and these were given a high priority as potential vaccine candidates. The 12 selected ORFs were amplified from a human strain of B. pilosicoli (Wes-B) and cloned. Products from nine ORFS were successfully over-expressed in an Escherichia coli expression system, and then purified using affinity chromatography.

In an in vitro immunogenicity trial all the recombinant proteins except for NAV-P27 were strongly recognised in Western immunoblots by a mouse serum raised against B. pilosicoli strain WesB, and by a subset of convalescent sera from pigs naturally and experimentally infected with B. pilosicoli. In an analysis of in vivo immunogenicity, the post-immunisation mouse sera raised against each recombinant protein reacted strongly with each specific proteins, and also recognised the native

protein in extracts of B. pilosicoli strain WesB. Sequence analysis of four randomly selected ORFs showed that these were highly conserved amongst the genomes of different human and swine strains of B. pilosicoli. Evaluation of all the data obtained in the reverse vaccinology approach resulted in selection of four ORF products (NAV-P3, NAV-13, NAV-22 and NAV-31) as being potentially protective antigens to be analysed for their further efficacy. These four recombinant proteins were assessed for their efficacy as vaccine components in a mouse model of IS, where the animals were challenged with a human strain of B. pilosicoli. The proteins all induced systemic and local antibody responses, and tended to reduce spirochaete colonisation following experimental infection. These proteins used individually or in combination now have the potential to be further developed into a new vaccine to prevent B. pilosicoli infections.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vaccines</field><field name="subject">brachyspira pilosicoli</field><field name="subject">subunit proteins</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090318.140633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"The white man never wanna hear nothin about what's different from him": Representations of Laws 'Other' in Australian Literature</field><field name="creator">N.Sidebotham@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Law controls our everyday.  It regulates our lives.  It tells us what is and is not acceptable behaviour, it confers and protects our rights, and it punishes us for our indiscretions.  But law does much more than this.  It creates normative standards which shape the way people are treated and the way that we relate to each other and to society generally.  The law defines people.  It constructs identity.  And it creates the &#145;other&#146;.  This is a legacy of positivism&#146;s insistence on identifying that which is &#145;inside&#146; law, and so accorded legitimacy, and that which is not.  That which does not conform to law&#146;s constructed standards and values is identified as &#145;other&#146; and marginalised and silenced.  In this thesis, I demonstrate the way that the law constructs &#145;other&#146;, in particular, the Aboriginal &#145;other&#146;.  I consider the way that Aborigines have been defined by the law to show the consequences that this has had for Aboriginal people beyond the purely legal.  I argue that law&#146;s construction of Aboriginality has contributed to the marginalisation of Aboriginal people and their exclusion from many aspects of the legal and the social, and that it has silenced them within the dominant domain, denying them the ability to challenge the wrongs perpetrated against them.  I examine these issues through the medium of literature.  I argue that literature&#146;s contribution to exposing, critiquing and challenging law&#146;s construction of &#145;other&#146; is invaluable.  It informs the reader about the way that the law has treated Aboriginal people and, more generally, about the structures and limitations of our positivist legal system.  It thereby contributes to the community&#146;s perception and understanding of the way the law works, and the impact that it has on the lives of its subjects.  Perhaps most importantly, it also educates towards social change and reform.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Law</field><field name="subject">Australian literature</field><field name="subject">critique</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal 'other'</field><field name="subject">social change</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090318.172325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biology of three teleost species with divergent life cycle characteristics and their implications for fisheries management</field><field name="creator">p.coulson@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis was to determine the size and age compositions, growth and reproductive biology of Western Blue Groper (Achoerodus gouldii), Blue Morwong (Nemadactylus valenciennesi) and Yellowtail Flathead (Platycepahlus endrachtensis) in south-western Australian waters, in which these three species have divergent life cycle characteristics. As A. gouldii and N. valenciennesi are commercially and recreationally important in coastal waters and P. endrachtensis is one of the most recreationally important species in the Swan River Estuary, these biological data were then used to produce estimates of mortality and spawning stock biomass per recruit for each of these species. The biological data and stock assessment parameters were finally employed comparatively to ascertain whether any of the three species possessed characteristics that would make them particularly susceptible to the effects of fishing and whether there was evidence that any of the species is fully or even overexploited.

Achoerodus gouldii typically uses reefs in protected inshore waters along the coast and around neighbouring islands as a nursery habitat and then, as it increases in size, moves to deeper, offshore reefs, where it spawns between early winter and mid-spring. The maximum total length and age of A. gouldii were 1162 mm and 70 years, the latter being the greatest age by far yet recorded for any species of labrid. However, most growth occurs in the first 20 years of life. Histological and demographic analyses demonstrated that all individuals begin life as females and, after attaining maturity, many become males, i.e. A. gouldii is a monandric protogynous hermaphrodite. The L50 at maturity and sex change were 653 and 821 mm, respectively, which correspond to ages of c. 17 and 37 years, respectively. As sex change took place over a narrower range in lengths (650 to 900 mm) than in ages (15 to 49 years), that change is apparently related more to size than age. Since sex change is typically accompanied by a change from green to blue, body colour can be used as a proxy for determining the length (L50) at which females change to males. von Bertalanffy growth curves fitted to the lengths at age of individuals of each sex of this hermaphroditic species using a novel technique demonstrated that, with increasing age, the lengths of males became increasingly greater than those of females. Thus, at ages 15, 30 and 60 years, the estimated lengths at age of females were c. 600, 670 and 680 mm, respectively, whereas those of males were c. 695, 895 and 975 mm, respectively. 

As A. gouldii is very long-lived and sexual maturity, and even more particularly sex change, occur late, this labrid is potentially very susceptible to overfishing. Thus, because the mortality estimates and per recruit analyses indicated that, at present, this species is close to or fully exploited, fisheries managers will need to take a precautionary and watchful approach to managing and thus conserving the stocks of this species. 

As with A. gouldii, N. valenciennesi moves to deeper, offshore waters as it increases in size and then matures and spawns in those waters. Although N. valenciennesi has a maximum length of nearly 1 m and thus, like A. gouldii, is moderately large, it has a far shorter life span, i.e. 19 vs 70 years. While female N. valenciennesi does not grow to as large a size as its males (max. lengths = 846 and 984 mm, respectively), the maximum age of both sexes was 19 years. From the growth curves, the females by ages 3, 6 and 10 years havd attained, on average, lengths of 435, 587 and 662 mm, respectively, compared with 446, 633 and 752 mm, respectively, for males. Both sexes grew little after 10 years of age. 

Juvenile N. valenciennesi &lt; 400 mm in total length were found exclusively in shallow, coastal waters on the south coast, whereas their adults were abundant in offshore waters of both the south and lower west coasts. The females and males typically mature in offshore waters of the south coast at lengths of c. 600-800 mm and ages of c. 7-9 years. In contrast, the vast majority of females caught in offshore waters of the lower west coast (where they were of a similar length and age range to those in offshore waters on the south coast) became mature at lengths of 400-600 mm and 3-4 years of age. The attainment of maturity by N. valenciennesi at far lesser lengths and ages on the lower west coast than south coast suggests that the former coast provides better environmental conditions for the gonadal maturation and spawning of this species. Furthermore, the contrast between the almost total absence of the juveniles of N. valenciennesi in nearshore waters on the lower west coast and their substantial numbers in comparable waters on the south coast indicates that the larvae of this species produced on the lower west coast are transported southwards to the south coast, where they become juveniles. As spawning occurs between mid-summer and late autumn, the larvae, which spend a protracted period in the plankton, would be exposed, on the lower west coast, to the influence of the southwards-flowing Leeuwin Current at the time when that current is at its strongest.

Although N. valenciennesi is caught by recreational line fishing and commercial gillnet fishing when they are as young as 3-4 years old, they do not become fully vulnerable to these fisheries until they are about 9 years old. Consequently, the individuals of this species can potentially breed over a number of years before they become particularly prone to capture by fishers. Mortality estimates and per recruit analyses suggested that N. valenciennesi in south-western Australia is not currently overfished. A greater resilience to fishing by N. valenciennesi than A. gouldii presumably reflects, in part, its far shorter lifespan, earlier maturity and possession of gonochorism rather than hermaphroditism.

Platycephalus endrachtensis spawns in the Swan River Estuary between late spring and early autumn and completes the whole of its life cycle in this system. Although females attain a far larger length (615 mm) than males (374 mm), females and males were present in each age class. These data, together with a detailed examination of histological sections of a wide size and age range of individuals, demonstrated that this species, unlike some of its relatives, is not a protandrous hermaphrodite, i.e. it does not change from male to female with increasing body size. The combination of the presence of females and males in all age classes and the observation that all of the large number of individuals between 374 and 615 mm were females shows that the far greater length attained by that sex is largely related to its faster growth rate. The fact that females outnumbered males in each age class of P. endrachtensis in which the sample size was substantial, i.e. &gt; 25, with the overall sex ratio being 2.7 females: 1 male, indicate that there has been strong selection for egg production in this species. As the minimum legal length for retention of P. endrachtensis is 300 mm, and relatively few males exceeded this length, the recreational fishery which targets this species is based largely on its females. 

The estimates of mortality and results of per recruit analyses provided no evidence that P. endrachtensis is currently overfished. From a management point of view, it is advantageous that the current size limit for this species exceeds the average length at which its females (259 mm) attain maturity. Furthermore, this species appears to be resilient to capture and release. 

The data presented in this thesis demonstrate that A. gouldii possesses biological characteristics which make it potentially more prone to the effects of fishing than is the case with either N. valenciennesi or P. endrachtensis. This presumably accounts, at least in part, for the indications that A. gouldii is the only one of these three species that is likely to be close to or at full exploitation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Western Blue Groper</field><field name="subject">Queen Snapper</field><field name="subject">Yellowtail Flathead</field><field name="subject">age</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">reprouction</field><field name="subject">mortality</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090324.143252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A behavioural finance perspective on trade imbalance and stock prices</field><field name="creator">Henker, Julia, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis I examine, within a behavioural finance framework, the impact on stock prices of order and trade imbalance in three separate but related studies. The first study, chapter two, begins with a question that plagues behavioural finance theories???do the investors most likely to be influenced by the behavioural biases described in the literature, i.e., individual investors, affect stock prices? My data enable me to consider the impact of net individual investor trading for the entire market over several years. I find that net individual investor purchasing Grangercauses stock price changes. The correlation is negative, however, contradicting common sense by demonstrating that individuals investor buying pressure makes prices go down and selling pressure forces them up. More investigation is required. Chapter three references order imbalance results from experimental finance. I use field data to test a robust laboratory model and my modified versions. My findings suggest that, with appropriate modifications, laboratory results can be applied to real financial markets. Chapter four combines the data from the chapters two and three to revisit the question of individual investor impact on stock prices. Other studies have argued that individual investor influence is strongest in smaller capitalization stocks. Moreover, various theories propose that individual investors are the driving force behind the irrational stock prices of a bubble. I focus on the stocks from chapter three, bubble stocks, and ask whether, in the context of the trading of the entire market, individual investor trades are influential. Once again I find Grangercausality, but in the wrong direction. Moreover, the activity and volume of the individual investor category of the holdings data is completely overshadowed by that of the two large investor categories, domestic and foreign institutions. I conclude that individual investor trades are not influential in determining stock prices. This conclusion has important implications for some behavioural finance models of asset pricing. I suggest that emphasis might be better placed on educating individual investors about the errors to which they are prone, rather than on trying to explain market anomalies with those errors.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stocks -- prices -- psychological aspects; investments; speculation; business cycles; financial crises; balance of trade</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation genetics and reproduction in three Australian marsupial species</field><field name="creator">Miller, Emily Jane, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Many Australian marsupial species require active population management to ensure their survival in the wild. Such management should be based on a sound understanding of species biology. This thesis explores how knowledge of reproduction and genetics can be applied to the management of three Australian marsupial species faced with contrasting management scenarios. The ??vulnerable?? greater bilby is the sole remaining desert bandicoot in Australia. They are a secretive, solitary species whose mating system is unclear. This research examined temporal changes in genetic diversity within two captive breeding programs utilising different management strategies. Using seven microsatellite loci, this study found the regular translocation of new individuals into the population maintained genetic diversity. Parentage analysis revealed the bilby to have a promiscious mating system. Sires and non-sires could not be distinguished by morphological traits.  The tammar wallaby is a polygynous, solitary species that is threatened on mainland Australia, but overabundant on some offshore islands. The population genetics of tammars from the Abrolhos Islands in Western Australia were examined using nine autosomal and four Y-linked microsatellite loci, and mitochondrial DNA. There was a relationship between island size, population size and genetic diversity. The Abrolhos populations have significantly lower genetic diversity and are more inbred than mainland tammars and all sampled populations were significantly differentiated. The Abrolhos and mainland populations should be treated as separate Management Units.  The eastern grey kangaroo is a gregarious, polygynous species that is often locally overabundant. To determine traits influencing male reproductive success, behavioural, morphological, physiological and genetic data were examined and showed dominance status, body size and testosterone concentrations were important factors. Sires were also significantly more heterozygous and genetically dissimilar to females, than non-sires. As body condition influences individual fitness, and management decisions; five body condition indices (BCI) calculated from morphological data were validated using serum biochemistry and haematology in two kangaroo populations with contrasting body condition. Blood parameters were found to be more reliable indicators of condition, questioning the credibility of BCIs currently used in management. These studies demonstrate the importance of reproductive and genetic data in assisting wildlife management, regardless of a species conservation status.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mating system</field><field name="subject">conservation genetics</field><field name="subject">reproductive success</field><field name="subject">body condition</field><field name="subject">phylogenetics</field><field name="subject">wildlife management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42779</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cross-cultural study of Australian and Chinese university academics?? work motivation</field><field name="creator">Li, Feng Edward, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study examined university academics?? valence for teaching and research, and the relationships between the valence and self-efficacy for teaching and research, with an Australian and a Chinese sample.

In this work, new techniques and strategies were developed to improve the quality of cartilage produced in vitro by methods of tissue engineering. Chondrocytes were isolated from the hip and knee joints of aborted human foetuses. The cells were expanded and seeded into scaffolds and the seeded scaffolds were cultured in perfusion bioreactors. The quality of the final cartilage constructs was assessed biochemically by measuring their content of glycosaminoglycan (GAG), total collagen and collagen type II and histologically by staining cross-sections of the constructs for GAG, collagen type I and collagen type II. The amount of proteoglycan released in the culture medium was also measured at regular intervals.  Proteoglycans from tissue-engineered cartilage and spent culture medium were compared and analysed for degradation and capability of aggregation. During monolayer expansion, the chondrocyte differentiation indices decreased, the cell size increased and the percentage of cells present in G2/S??M phase decreased with the greatest changes occurring during the first passage. Expanding chondrocytes in PGA or PGA??alginate scaffolds produced cells with a higher level of differentiation than monolayer-expanded cells. However, PGA and PGA??alginate could not be justified as suitable systems for the routine expansion of chondrocytes mainly because of the relatively low cell proliferation obtained. Two new methods for seeding of cells into scaffolds were investigated using PGA and PGA??alginate as scaffold materials. Both methods produced high seeding efficiencies and homogeneous distribution of cells.  When seeded PGA??alginate scaffolds were cultured in perfusion bioreactors, they produced good quality constructs with higher concentrations of extracellular matrix (ECM) components compared with previously described methods. However, when seeded PGA scaffolds were cultured in perfusion bioreactors, they produced small constructs of poor quality. Investigation of the effect of medium flow rate on the PGA scaffolds showed that a low flow rate was needed at the beginning of the culture to enable the cells to form a framework onto which other synthesised elements could deposit. Applying a gradual increase in medium flow rate to PGA scaffolds cultured in perfusion bioreactors solved the shrinkage problem and produced constructs with quality similar to those produced using PGA??alginate scaffolds.  A novel compression bioreactor that mimicked the physiological stimulation of cartilage by joint movement was constructed. Using this bioreactor, compressed constructs showed significantly higher wet weight and higher concentrations of GAG, total collagen and collagen type II compared with non-compressed constructs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chondrocyte</field><field name="subject">Tissue engineering</field><field name="subject">Cartilage</field><field name="subject">Bioreactor</field><field name="subject">perfusion</field><field name="subject">Compression</field><field name="subject">Differentiation</field><field name="subject">Seeding</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of scaffold geometries on spatial cell distribution</field><field name="creator">Ko, Henry Chung Hung, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A limitation to engineering viable thick tissues (greater than a few hundred microns in thickness) has been the lack of vascularisation and a vascular supply. A key element in engineering such tissues is the generation of a supporting scaffold with a defined and wellcharacterized architecture. To date relatively little attention has been paid to characterization. The objective of this research was to develop well-characterized structures which will inform the rational design of the next generation of engineered thick tissues. Specifically, this research aimed to test combinations of various culturing environments, cell mono- and co-cultures, and scaffold architectures; develop improved imaging techniques and structural/spatial analytical methods to characterise porous polymer scaffolds; and use various spatial and morphological measures to quantify the relationships between scaffold geometric structure and cell distribution. Isotropic and anisotropic pore scaffolds were manufactured and then processed with nondestructive and destructive imaging methods, and characterised using image analysis methods to measure geometric parameters such as the degree of anisotropy/isotropy, porosity, and fractal parameters of pore and strut networks. Cells were introduced into scaffolds using a range of seeding methods and cultured in static and hydrodynamic environments. Quantification of the spatial cell distribution in cell-seeded scaffolds was done with first-order spatial statistics and fractal analysis. Findings comparing various destructive and non-destructive imaging methods found that cryotape cryohistology was the most accurate method for processing bare polymer scaffolds and eliminated histological artefacts common to other techniques. It was found with the various image analysis methods, surface and internal scaffold geometric architectures were strongly isotropic for porogen-fused porogen-leached scaffolds and anisotropic for TIPS scaffolds. For both isotropic and anisotropic pore scaffolds, collagen hydrogel infusion and droplet methods gave the highest cell seeding efficiencies (at 100% efficiency). The key finding in this study was that first-order spatial statistics and fractal analysis of cell distribution revealed that the geometric structure of the scaffolds had the strongest effect on spatial cell infiltration and distribution compared to the influence of culture environment or mono- and co-culture. Isotropic pore scaffolds had a higher level of cell distribution. Further work with optimizing the growth environment parameters, and utilizing collagen-infused cell-seeded scaffolds, may assist in achieving better cell growth. The work presented therefore provides the analytical basis for the rational design of tissue engineering scaffolds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tissue engineering</field><field name="subject">vascularisation</field><field name="subject">biomaterial scaffold</field><field name="subject">image analysis</field><field name="subject">scaffold architecture</field><field name="subject">spatial cell distribution</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Activation of vascular smooth muscle cells</field><field name="creator">Peden, Ryan Stephen, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in the healthy adult arterial wall are a highlydifferentiated cell type with low levels of proliferation. However, when activated these cells can undergo a phenotypic change to become proliferative, migratory and excrete higher levels of extra-cellular matrix. While this cellular change is an essential element of the adaptable vasculature, excessive proliferation of VSMC underpins the development of a number of disease states, including atherosclerosis and restenosis after balloon angioplasty. The activation of VSMC is dependent on intracellular signalling pathways broadly altering gene expression. A key feature of this process is the initial potent regulation of transcription factors such as Egr-1, c-Jun and Ets-1, which then drive further transcriptional changes resulting in phenotypic change. The aim of this thesis was to discover novel genes, particularly transcription factors, regulated early upon stimulation and to characterise their contribution to the activation of VSMC. A key stimulus for activation of VSMC is the release of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2). A microarray used to explore the effects of FGF-2 exposure demonstrated the extensive nature of transcriptional modulation. In addition, it highlighted a number of transcription factors that were not previously described in VSMC: p8, ATF-4 and SHARP-2. In particular, SHARP-2 was potently upregulated and was reconfirmed in animal models of vascular injury. The subsequent contribution these factors make to VSMC activation was also demonstrated. p8 strongly induced VSMC proliferation, while ATF-4 contributed to cytokine production and SHARP-2 potently downregulated VSMC differentiation markers. A second area that was explored related to a gene known as YRDC, which was found to be upregulated upon stimulation of VSMC. YRDC is highly conserved across almost all cellular life, however its function remains unknown. A number of novel splice variants of YRDC were discovered and demonstrated to be differentially regulated in VSMC upon stimulation. Further work to commence characterising its function showed that it interacts with key ribosomal proteins and most likely plays a role in regulating translation. The discovery of the relevance of these genes to vascular biology in addition to their transcriptional regulation makes an important contribution to increasing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind vascular remodelling.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vascular smooth muscle</field><field name="subject">Extracellular matrix</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing governance in the voluntary and community sector: a case study of organisations in the Taranaki region</field><field name="creator">Cayley, Simon</field><field name="description">Voluntary and community organisations are fundamental to society because they are major stakeholders in building the social capital that underpins healthy and well-functioning communities.  Yet many of these organisations are small and possess limited resources when measured against the challenges and needs that they address.  This raises the issue of the capacity of organisations within the sector to operate effectively.  Within the range of capacity issues, governance is consistently rated as an area requiring development.  This research seeks to contribute to a better understanding of issues impacting on the governance capacity of voluntary and community sector organisations within the overall context of capacity building.  A focused study in the Taranaki region examines the factors impacting on the governance of community organisations providing social services.  The research identifies the level of governance capacity demonstrated within the organisations studied and also explores the level of awareness around the need to enhance governance capacity.  The research examines a range of frameworks and models used to build governance capacity to see if they could be adapted for the Taranaki region.  The study suggests that, although a number of frameworks and models are useful, every situation is different, and models must be responsive to the social and cultural context and the particular history and mission of each organisation.  As a result, the study concludes that further work should be undertaken to develop a model of governance for the voluntary and community sector.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Appreciative enquiry</field><field name="subject">Unpaid work</field><field name="subject">Community organizations</field><field name="subject">Model building</field><field name="subject">Structured interview</field><field name="subject">Capacity building</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Usability of navigation tools in software for browsing genetic sequences</field><field name="creator">Rutherford, Paul</field><field name="description">Software to display and analyse DNA sequences is a crucial tool for bioinformatics research. The data of a DNA sequence has a relatively simple format but the length and sheer volume of data can create difficulties in navigation while maintaining overall context. This is one reason that current bioinformatics applications can be difficult to use. This research examines techniques for navigating through large single DNA sequences and their annotations. Navigation in DNA sequences is considered here in terms of the navigational activities: exploration, wayfinding and identifying objects. A process incorporating user-centred design was used to create prototypes involving panning and zooming of DNA sequences. This approach included a questionnaire to define the target users and their goals, an examination of existing bioinformatics applications to identify navigation designs, a heuristic evaluation of those designs, and a usability study of prototypes. Three designs for panning and five designs for zooming were selected for development. During usability testing, users were asked to perform common navigational activities using each of the designs. The &#8220;Connected View&#8221; design was found to be the most usable for panning while the &#8220;Zoom Slider&#8221; design was best for zooming and most useful zooming tool for tasks involving browsing. For some tasks the ability to zoom was unnecessary. The research provides important insights into the expectations that researchers have of bioinformatics applications and suitable methods for designing for that audience. The outcomes of this type of research can be used to help improve bioinformatics applications so that they will be truly usable by researchers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">deoxyribonucleic acid</field><field name="subject">usability</field><field name="subject">user interface</field><field name="subject">navigation</field><field name="subject">browsing</field><field name="subject">panning</field><field name="subject">zooming</field><field name="subject">user-centred design</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/948</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community small scale wind farms for New Zealand: a comparative study of Austrian development, with consideration for New Zealand&#8217;s future wind energy development</field><field name="creator">Thomson, Grant</field><field name="description">In New Zealand, the development of wind energy is occurring predominantly at a large scale level with very little opportunity for local people to become involved, either financially or conceptually. These conditions are creating situations of conflict between communities and wind energy developers &#8211; and are limiting the potential of the New Zealand wind energy industry. The inception of community ownership in small scale wind farms, developed in Europe in the late 20th Century, has helped to make a vital connection between wind energy and end users. Arguably, community wind farms are able to alleviate public concerns of wind energy&#8217;s impact on landscapes, amongst a wide range of other advantages. In Austria, community wind farms have offered significant development opportunities to local people, ushered in distributed generation, and all the while increasing the amount of renewable energy in the electricity mix. This thesis investigates whether community small scale wind (SSW) farms, such as those developed in Austria, are a viable and feasible option for the New Zealand context.  The approach of this thesis examines the history of the Austrian wind industry and explores several community wind farm developments. In addition, interviews with stakeholders from Austria and New Zealand were conducted to develop an understanding of impressions and processes in developing community wind energy (CWE) in the New Zealand context. From this research an assessment of the transfer of the Austrian framework to the New Zealand situation is offered, with analysis of the differences between the wind energy industries in the two countries. Furthermore, future strategies are suggested for CWE development in New Zealand with recommendations for an integrated governmental approach.  This research determines that the feasibility for the transfer of the Austrian framework development of &#8216;grassroots&#8217; community wind farms in the next 10 years is relatively unlikely without greater support assistance from the New Zealand Government. This is principally due to the restricted economic viability of community wind farms and also significant regulatory and policy limitations. In the mid to long term, the New Zealand government should take an integrated approach to assist the development of community wind farms which includes: a collaborative government planning approach on the issue; detailed assessment of the introduction of feed-in tariff mechanisms and controlled activity status (RMA) for community wind farms; and development of limited liability company law for community energy companies. In the short term, however, the most feasible option available for the formation of community wind farms lies in quasi community developments with corporate partnerships.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wind energy</field><field name="subject">community wind energy</field><field name="subject">small scale wind energy</field><field name="subject">grassroots</field><field name="subject">distributed generation</field><field name="subject">feed-in tariffs</field><field name="subject">bottom-up</field><field name="subject">Austria</field><field name="subject">integrated environmental management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360102 Comparative government and politics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360201 Public policy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering::291104 Environmental technologies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370102 Social policy and planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A physiological study of weed competition in peas (Pisum sativum L.)</field><field name="creator">Munakamwe, Z.</field><field name="description">Peas dominate New Zealand grain legume production and they are a major export crop. However, weeds are a major problem particularly under organic production, where the use of synthetic chemicals is prohibited. To address this limitation, a research program to study weed control in peas was done to provide both conventional and organic farmers a sustainable weed management package. This was done through three field experiments over two growing seasons, 2006/07 and 2007/08. Experiment 1, (2006/07) evaluated the effect of 50, 100 and 400 plants m&#178; on crop yield, and weed growth of Aragon, Midichi or Pro 7035 with and without cyanazine. Experiment two explored the physiology of two pea genotypes, the leafed (Pro 7035) and the semi leafless (Midichi) sown at three dates. A herbicide treatment was included as a control. In the third experiment Midichi, was used to investigate the effect of different pea and weed population combinations and their interaction on crop yield and weed growth. All crops were grown at Lincoln University on a Templeton silt loam soil. In Experiment one, herbicide had no effect on total dry matter (TDM) and seed yield (overall mean seed yield 673 g m&#178;). There was also no significant difference in mean seed yield among the pea genotypes, Aragorn, Pro 7035 and Midichi, (overall mean, 674 g m&#178;). The lowest average seed yield, 606 g m&#178; was from 400 plants m&#178; and the highest, 733 g m&#178;, from 50 plants m&#178;, a 21% yield increase. A significant herbicide by population interaction showed that herbicide had no effect on seed yields at 100 and 400 plants m&#178;. However, cyanazine treated plots at 50 plants m&#178; gave 829 g m&#178; of seed. This was 30% more than the 637 g m&#178;, from plots without herbicide. In Experiment 1 pea cultivar and herbicide had no significant effect on weed counts. In Experiment 2 the August sowing gave the highest seed yield at 572 g m&#178;. This was 62% more than the lowest yield, in October. Cyanazine treatment gave a mean seed yield of 508 g m&#178;, 19% more than from unsprayed plots. There was a significant (p &lt; 0.05) sowing date x genotype interaction which showed that in the August sowing genotype had no effect on seed yield. However, in September the Pro 7035 seed yield at 559 g m&#178; was 40% more that of Midichi and in October it gave 87% more. Weed spectrum varied over time. Prevalent weeds in spring were Stachys spp, Achillea millefolium L., and Spergular arvensis L. In summer they were Chenopodium album L., Rumex spp, Trifolium spp and Solanum nigrum L.  Coronopus didymus L., Stellaria media and Lolium spp were present in relatively large numbers throughout the season. In Experiment 3 seed yield increased significantly (p &lt; 0.001) with pea population. Two hundred plants m&#178; gave the highest mean seed yield at 409 g m&#178; and 50 plants m&#178; gave the lowest (197 g m&#178;). The no-sown-weed treatment gave the highest mean seed yield of 390 g m&#178;. This was due to less competition for solar radiation. There was no difference in seed yield between the normal rate sown weed and the 2 x normal sown weed treatments (mean 255 g m&#178;). It can be concluded that fully leafed and semi-leafless peas can be sown at similar populations to achieve similar yields under weed free conditions. Increased pea sowing rate can increase yield particularly in weedy environments. Early sowing can also increase yield and possibly control problem weeds of peas (particularly Solanum spp), which are usually late season weeds. Herbicide can enhance pea yield but can be replaced by effective cultural methods such as early sowing, appropriate pea genotype and high sowing rates.

The ability of government agencies to manage threats to their national parks is often compromised by limited resources. There is a growing need to improve decisions about how resources are allocated amongst conservation responsibilities. Multiple Criteria Analysis (MCA) techniques are integrated decision systems that have the potential to reduce the complexity normally associated with decisions about public and quasi-public goods. The explicit expression of a decision-maker&#8217;s preferences for certain decision attributes is a key stage in the MCA process. The ability of MCA to increase the understanding, transparency, and robustness of decisions has been demonstrated in many disciplines. This research describes the development of a MCA model to assist decisionmakers with the allocation of resources amongst national parks. After a thorough review of the conservation and protected area literature, a MCA model is developed to determine the utility of a group of national parks based upon environmental, economic, and social significance. The model is tested and applied to the national parks managed by the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory of Australia and to selected parks managed by the Department of Conservation of New Zealand. The research highlights the need for protected area management agencies to take lessons from the commercial sector and incorporate elements of business practices, particularly comprehensive inventory and data management, into conservation decision-making. It is shown that the integrated decision-making approach taken in this research aggregates complex data in a way that improves managers&#8217; ability to make better informed decisions concerning the allocation and distribution of resources.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">resource allocation</field><field name="subject">multiple criteria analysis</field><field name="subject">national parks</field><field name="subject">natural resource management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300801 Environmental management and rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A narrative landscape of a teacher's perception of the 'other' in a Korean Christian University : the courage to 'be' and to learn</field><field name="creator">Yoo, Joanne</field><field name="description">Doctor of Education</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language -- Study and teaching -- Korean speakers</field><field name="subject">Teachers -- Korea -- Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Teachers -- Australia -- Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Self-actualization (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Teaching -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental investigation of the wall deposition of food containing carbohydrates, in a pilot scale spray dryer</field><field name="creator">Ozmen, Linda</field><field name="description">Master of Engineering</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spray drying</field><field name="subject">Milk plants</field><field name="subject">Dried skim milk</field><field name="subject">Drying apparatus</field><field name="subject">Dairy products -- Drying</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Everyday negotiations for care and autonomy in the world of welfare-to-work: The policy experience of Australian mothers, 2003-2006</field><field name="creator">Blaxland, Megan</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">income support</field><field name="subject">mothers</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">welfare to work</field><field name="subject">recognition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing multi-sensory displays for abstract data</field><field name="creator">Nesbitt, Keith</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Data mining</field><field name="subject">Abstract data types (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Data structures (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Visualization</field><field name="subject">Human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">Virtual reality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies towards the total synthesis of the fumonisin B natural products</field><field name="creator">Issa, Fatiah</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fumonisins</field><field name="subject">Mycotoxicoses</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perinatal and late neonatal mortality in the dog</field><field name="creator">Gill, Marilyn Ann</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Puppies -- Mortality</field><field name="subject">Puppies -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">Veterinary pediatrics</field><field name="subject">Dogs -- Diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insight into estrogen action in breast cancer via the study of a novel nuclear receptor corepressor : SLIRP</field><field name="creator">Hatchell, Esme Claire</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Breast cancer is the cause of significant suffering and death in our community. It is now estimated that the risk of developing breast cancer for an Australian woman before the age of 85 is 1 in 8, with this risk rising for unknown reasons. While mortality rates from breast cancer are falling due to increased awareness and early detection, few new treatments have been developed from an advanced understanding of the molecular basis of the disease. From decades of scientific research it is clear that estrogen (E2) has a large role to play in breast cancer. However, the basic mechanism behind E2 action in breast cancer remains unclear. E2 plays a fundamental role in breast cancer cell proliferation and is highly expressed in breast cancers, thus, it is important to understand both E2 and its receptor, the estrogen receptor (ER). The ER is a member of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily. The NR superfamily consists of a large group of proteins which regulate a large number of homeostatic proteins together with regulator proteins termed coregulators and corepressors. SRA (steroid receptor RNA activator) is the only known RNA coactivator and augments transactivation by NRs. SRA has been demonstrated to play an important role in mediating E2 action (Lanz et al., 1999; Lanz et al., 2003) and its expression is aberrant in many human breast tumors, suggesting a potential role in breast tumorigenesis (Murphy et al., 2000). Despite evidence that an alternative splice variant of SRA exists as a protein (Chooniedass-Kothari et al., 2004), it has been conclusively shown that SRA can function as an RNA transcript to coactivate NR transcription (Lanz et al., 1999; Lanz et al., 2002; Lanz et al., 2003). The precise mechanism by which SRA augments ER activity remains unknown. However, it is currently hypothesized that SRA acts as an RNA scaffold for other coregulators at the transcription initiation site. Several SRA stem loops have been identified as important for SRA function, including structure (STR) 1, 5 and 7 (Lanz et al., 2002; Zhao et al., 2007). Previously, I sought to identify SRA-binding proteins using a specific stem-loop structure of SRA (STR7) that was identified as both important for its coactivator function (Lanz et al., 2002) and also as a target for proteins from breast cancer cell extracts (Hatchell, 2002). From a yeast E. Hatchell Abstract iii III hybrid screen using STR7 as bait, I identified a novel protein which was named SLIRP (Patent Number: WO/2007/009194): SRA stem-Loop Interacting RNA-binding Protein (Hatchell, 2002; Hatchell et al., 2006). '...' This thesis demonstrates that SLIRP modulates NR transactivation, provides mechanistic insight into interactions between SRA, SRC-1, HSP-60 and NCoR and suggests that SLIRP may regulate mitochondrial function. These studies contribute significantly to the growing field of NR biology, and contribute more specifically to the elucidation of estrogen action in breast cancer. Furthermore, it lays a strong and exciting foundation for further studies to evaluate SLIRP as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target in hormone dependent cancers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer -- Endocrine aspects</field><field name="subject">Estrogen -- Receptors</field><field name="subject">Estrogen -- Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Heat shock proteins</field><field name="subject">Nuclear receptors (Biochemistry)</field><field name="subject">RNA-protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Suppressor cells</field><field name="subject">Coregulator</field><field name="subject">Estrogen</field><field name="subject">SLIRP</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation for articular cartilage injury : biology, histology and clinical outcomes</field><field name="creator">Willers, Craig Robert</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Articular cartilage has no vascular, neural, or lymphatic supply, and hence no intrinsic capacity to self-repair following injury. These physiological limitations, combined with the inability of local chondrocytes to contribute to the repair process, translate to poor structural and functional outcomes in these troublesome defects, and osteoarthritic deterioration with time. Subsequently, many surgical therapies have been trialed to stimulate cartilage repair, but none have produced reliable outcomes. Hence, cartilage repair research has been broadened, with many investigators now focused on cell-based treatment. Smith began a revolution of autologous cell research when in 1965 she isolated chondrocytes from articular cartilage and transplanted them into fresh cartilage nodules (Smith, 1965). Since, new technologies and improved techniques have seen autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) widely accepted for use in clinical orthopaedics (Bentley et al., 2003; Brittberg et al., 1994; Grande et al., 1989; Peterson et al., 2002). At present, matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) is the most surgically simple form of ACI, boasting clinical outcomes comparable to any technique on the market, and far less complications compared to the first generation of ACI - periosteal ACI (Bartlett et al., 2005; Behrens et al., 2006; Gigante et al., 2006; Henderson et al., 2004; Marlovits et al., 2005; Minas, 2001; Willers et al., 2007; Zheng et al., 2007). But whilst MACI has been adopted by the orthopaedic surgeon for articular cartilage repair, many of the molecular, histological, and clinical factors governing patient outcomes are still largely understudied. Firstly we assessed the bioactivity of fibrin sealant (FS - Tisseel&#174;), a critical component of MACI, on the migration and proliferation of human articular chondrocytes in vitro. We also looked to elucidate the associated molecular mechanisms of thrombin, a key active ingredient in FS, by examining the expression and activation of proteaseactivated receptors (PARs), established thrombin receptors. All four PAR isoforms were detected in human chondrocytes, with PAR-1 being the major isoform expressed. '...'  This thesis has demonstrated biological, histological, and clinical features of the MACI technique. Our in vitro has supported the use of fibrin sealant and collagen membrane as the major material components of MACI, illustrating improved chondrocyte proliferation, migration, and chondrogenic differentiation. We have evidenced that MACI stimulates successful production of hyaline-like cartilage by 6 months, while also showing that revised and clinically failed repair tissues are predominantly hyaline-like and fibrocartilage with inferior composition. Clinically, we have documented significant improvements in patient repair structure, function, symptoms, quality of life, and satisfaction, whilst concurrently confirming sentiment within the literature regarding the importance of exercise/ rehabilitation for maximising MACI outcome. In summary, the findings presented in this thesis suggest that MACI is a biologically sound and clinically efficacious cell-based treatment option for repairing articular cartilage defects.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cartilage -- Diseases -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Cartilage -- Regeneration</field><field name="subject">Cartilage cells</field><field name="subject">Osteochondrosis -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation</field><field name="subject">Cartilage repair</field><field name="subject">Biology</field><field name="subject">Histology</field><field name="subject">Clinical outcomes</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">British infiltration of Ceylon (Sri Lanka) in the nineteenth century : a study of the D'Oyly papers between 1805 and 1818</field><field name="creator">Somasunderam, Ramesh</field><field name="description">The proposed study is to examine the contribution made by John D'Oyly, a British Civil Servant, to the British acquisition and control of the whole of Ceylon.  It is also aimed to examine the history of this period (between 1805-1818) in Ceylon as a part of British colonial expansion in South Asia focusing on the policy of infiltration which was used by the British as a method of expanding and consolidating their power and influence. In The Cambridge Illustrated History of the British Empire, published in 1996, P.J. Marshall submitted that the British had become a major political force on the south east coast of the Indian subcontinent, and had become the real rulers of the wealthy province of Bengal by the end of the eighteenth century.  He further submits that the success of the British was mainly due to their ability to infiltrate into the internal politics of local states and kingdoms, and thereby dominate some of these political entities rather than overcome and destroy them by the use of military force.  This process of infiltration will be examined in detail in the study of British relations with the Kandyan Kingdom, which was situated in the centre of Ceylon (Sri Lanka), and was the only local kingdom then in existence as an independent political entity. The primary documents to be studied are those that relate to the British relations with the Kandyan Kingdom between 1805 and 1818, which covers the career of John D'Oyly as a civil servant working in Ceylon.  He was the principal figure used by the British in their dealings with the Kandyan Kingdom, due mainly to his proficiency in the Sinhalese language and his knowledge of the customs and manners of the local people.  His official diary, covering between the periods of 1810 and 1815, is one of the major sources of this study, examining the methods of infiltration.   What is attempted in this Thesis is to examine this new theoretical approach of infiltration (submitted by P.J. Marshall) to the history of British relations with the Kandyan Kingdom between the periods of 1805 to 1818.  This study is associated therefore with giving a new dimension to D'Oyly's work as a civil servant, and also to give a deeper reason for British expansion in Ceylon (as much as in Asia) in the context of the broader British strategic objectives.  It strives to give a new meaning to the primary documents available in studying British Kandyan relations, as a part of the successful political expansion of the British in India and Asia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">D'Oyly, John, -- Sir, -- 1774-1824</field><field name="subject">British -- Sri Lanka -- History</field><field name="subject">Kandy (Sri Lanka) -- History</field><field name="subject">Sri Lanka -- History -- 1505-1948</field><field name="subject">Sri Lanka -- Politics and government</field><field name="subject">D'Oyly, John</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Orbit complexity and computable Markov partitions</field><field name="creator">Kenny, Robert</field><field name="description">Markov partitions provide a 'good' mechanism of symbolic dynamics for uniformly hyperbolic systems, forming the classical foundation for the thermodynamic formalism in this setting, and remaining useful in the modern theory. Usually, however, one takes Bowen's 1970's general construction for granted, or restricts to cases with simpler geometry (as on surfaces) or more algebraic structure. This thesis examines several questions on the algorithmic content of (topological) Markov partitions, starting with the pointwise, entropy-like, topological conjugacy invariant known as orbit complexity. The relation between orbit complexity de nitions of Brudno and Galatolo is examined in general compact spaces, and used in Theorem 2.0.9 to bound the decrease in some of these quantities under semiconjugacy. A corollary, and a pointwise analogue of facts about metric entropy, is that any Markov partition produces symbolic dynamics matching the original orbit complexity at each point. A Lebesgue-typical value for orbit complexity near a hyperbolic attractor is also established (with some use of Brin-Katok local entropy), and is technically distinct from typicality statements discussed by Galatolo, Bonanno and their co-authors. Both our results are proved adapting classical arguments of Bowen for entropy. Chapters 3 and onwards consider the axiomatisation and computable construction of Markov partitions.

In areas of covered terrain, however, soils are less reliable as a sampling medium because they do not always develop the geochemical signature of the buried mineralisation; possibly a result of limited upward transport of ore related elements into the surficial overburden. As economic demands on the resources industry grow, mineral exploration continues to expand further into areas of covered terrain where the rewards of finding a new deposit relative to the risks of finding it may be comparatively low. Thus, improving the costeffectiveness of a geochemical exploration program requires a sound understanding of the mechanisms by which soil geochemical anomalies form in transported overburden. This thesis examines the deep biotic uplift of ore related elements by deep rooting vegetation as a mechanism for the development of soil geochemical anomalies within transported overburdens, in semi-arid and arid regions. '...' Vegetation and soils were analysed at two Au prospects in Western Australia: Berkley, Coolgardie and Torquata, 210 km south-east of Kambalda, in semi-arid Western Australia to complement both the mass balance and the differential modelling. At Berkley, both the vegetation and soils located directly over the mineralisation showed high concentrations of Au. There may be indirect evidence for the operation of the deep plant uptake flux taking effect from the field evidence at Berkley. Firstly, anomalous concentrations of Au were found in the surface soils, with no detectable Au in the transported overburden. Secondly, the trace element concentrations in vegetation showed correlation to the buried lithology, which to our knowledge has not been reported elsewhere. The results from the samples at Torquata, in contrast, were less conclusive because the Au is almost exclusively associated with a surficial calcrete horizon (at &lt;5 m soil depth). Strong correlations of Ca and Au in leaf samples however, suggest that the vegetation may be involved in the formation of calcrete and the subsequent association of Au with the calcrete. Among the vegetation components, the litter and leaf samples gave the greatest anomaly contrast at both prospects. Finally, three main drivers for the deep biotic uplift of elements were identified based on the results from the mechanistic numerical modelling exercise: i) the deep uptake flux; ii) the maximum plant concentration and; iii) the erosional flux. The relative sizes of these three factors control the rates of formation and decay, and trace element concentrations, of the soil anomaly. The main implication for the use of soils as exploration media in covered terranes is that soil geochemical anomalies may only be transient geological features, forming and dispersing as a result of the relative sizes of the accumulative and loss fluxes. The thesis culminates in the development of the first quantitative, mechanistic model of trace element accumulation in soils by deep biotic uplift.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geochemical analysis</field><field name="subject">Geochemistry</field><field name="subject">Biogeochemistry</field><field name="subject">Mineral cycle (Biogeochemistry)</field><field name="subject">Biogeochemistry -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Biogeochemical prospecting</field><field name="subject">Geobotanical prospecting</field><field name="subject">Minerals -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Trace elements</field><field name="subject">Mineral exploration</field><field name="subject">Biogeochemical modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thinking the commodity through the moving image : a philosophical investigation into cinematic consciousness and the commodity as a mode of communication</field><field name="creator">Mercer, Nicholas R</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the historical, theoretical and philosophical development of cinematic media as a collective form of technological perception and consciousness. Central to my inquiry is the philosophical notion that with the invention of cinema emerges a cyborg vision, a new modern mechanics of thinking that extends the phenomenological and epistemological experience of human perception and knowledge into hitherto unknown realms of thinking, sensation and being. Drawing on some of the key cultural thinkers and philosophers of the twentieth century, including Walter Benjamin and Gilles Deleuze, as well as contemporary philosophers of media such as Jonathan Beller, Sean Cubitt, D.N. Rodowick and Mark B. Hansen, my research into the philosophy of cinema and digital media articulates a branch of media theory that reads the political economy of the moving image through an amalgam of continental philosophy, marxist theory and film studies. Coterminous with the investigation into the philosophical object of cinematic or media consciousness, the thesis also endeavors to map the historical genealogy of the moving image as it evolves from the industrial mechanics of cinematic technologies to the virtual informatics of digital culture. Central to this inquiry is the idea that the history of cinematic and visual media is inextricably connected with the rise, towards the end of the twentieth century, of postmodern consumer culture and the global information society. The transition from a modern industrial economy to a postmodern information economy that reorganises the logic of production according to the 'variables' of scientific knowledge, communication and informational technologies, parallels a metamorphosis in our media consciousness as the representational ontology of cinematic moving image is transformed by the virtual ontology of the digital image. The first part of my thesis looks at the period of industrial cinema, focusing on Soviet constructivism and the films of Dziga Vertov and Sergei Eisenstein. In this section I trace the origins of cinema as a mode of communication for the commodity, examining how the modern cinematic imaginary opens up new economies of vision and sensation for capital. Following this investigation into what Jonathan Beller calls the cinematic mode of production, the second part of my thesis proceeds to investigate how cinematic consciousness is transformed from the industrial to the post-industrial era. Taking Deleuze's historiographical demarcation of cinema into the two regimes of the 'movement-image' and the 'time-image' as a philosophical frame, the second section of my thesis investigates how in the post-war films of the Italian neorealists and Michelengelo Antonioni our cinematic consciousness develops a new way of thinking the ontology of time and space. This analysis leads into my discussion of how in the age of digital special effects and the Hollywood blockbuster, cinematic consciousness is further expanded with the time-consciousness of the 'virtual' as our bodies attempt to accommodate the heightened flows of information that bombard our senses in the interfaces of digital culture.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motion pictures -- Aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Motion pictures -- History and criticism</field><field name="subject">Motion pictures -- Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Motion pictures -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Philosophy of film</field><field name="subject">Commodity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0261</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creatine - an accidental metabolite in sows' colostrum and milk or an important component of lactation?</field><field name="creator">Kennaugh, Linda May</field><field name="description">The efficiency of lactation (including milk composition and milk yield) in the sow, and the environment of the piglet is taken into consideration in an attempt to maximise sow performance and improve piglet survival and growth. In many commercial intensive piggeries, the sow suckles up to 12 piglets for about three and a half weeks. During this time, the piglets' major source of nutrition is sows' milk, often supplemented with 'creep food' and electrolyte solutions. However, in some piggeries, there is a tendency towards early segregated weaning. Piglets are removed from the sow often in the second week of lactation, and placed in a new location and fed a diet modelled primarily on the composition of cows' milk. This type of artificial rearing may increase piglet performance by minimising death by infection, but it can reduce sow performance by compromising her return to oestrus.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creatine</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Respiratory health effects of occupational exposure to bushfire smoke in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">De Vos, Johanna B. M.</field><field name="description">Bushfires are an integral part of the Australian environment, and consequently Australian fire fighters are regularly confronted with the challenge of bushfire fighting activities. Bushfires can be extensive and long-lasting, and as a result fire fighters can be exposed to bushfire smoke for long periods without respite. Anecdotal evidence suggests that bushfire smoke exposure can lead to respiratory symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. In an optimal environment, fire fighters are equipped with respirators and protective filters to prevent the inhalation of the air toxics in bushfire smoke. Yet, reports from the fire ground indicate that the protective filters are not effective in preventing the inhalation of bushfire smoke. As a result, fire fighters have increasingly expressed concern about the ineffective equipment and the resultant respiratory symptoms during and after bushfire fighting. This research aims to establish a scientific data base to support the anecdotal evidence. The objectives of the research were: (1) to identify and quantify the air toxics in Western Australian bushfire smoke; (2) to profile the acute respiratory health effects associated with bushfire smoke exposure; (3) to assess the effectiveness of three different types of filters under controlled conditions in a smoke chamber, and in the field during fuel reduction burn-off; (4) to formulate recommendations for reducing fire fighters' exposure to bushfire smoke; and (5) to inform policy decision makers about the most effective form of respiratory protective equipment for bushfire fighting. Exposure trials were conducted in an experimental setting utilising bushfire smoke conditions in a smoke chamber and during prescribed burn-offs. Repeated measurements of respiratory symptoms, pulmonary function and oximetry were undertaken before and after bushfire smoke exposure. In addition, personal air sampling inside the respirators was undertaken to quantify and compare the levels of filtered air toxics. The analysis of the collected data demonstrated that, of those compared, the particulate/organic vapour formaldehyde filter was most effective in protecting fire fighters' respiratory health during the smoke exposure period of maximally 120 minutes. Further research would be useful to determine the v effectiveness of the filters under more realistic conditions during bushfire fighting activities. The findings of this research have resulted in a policy review in Western Australia. In 2006, the Fire and Emergency Services Authority of Western Australia (FESA) reviewed its Bush Fire Smoke Exposure Standard Operational Procedures 51, and now issues the recommended particulate/organic vapour/formaldehyde filters to the 1,000 FESA career fire fighters. The use of protective equipment for bushfire fighters is inadequately regulated worldwide and the recommendation implemented by FESA can be seen as proactive and in advance of national and international best practice. In conclusion, this project was instrumental in the translation of public health research into best practice that protects occupational health, without the need for the lengthy process of legislative reform. Fire fighter organisations in other countries with high frequencies of bushfires could learn from this example, and move to review their policies and introduce adequate personal protection for fire fighters.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forest fire fighters -- Health risk assessment</field><field name="subject">Forest fires -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Health risk assessment -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Industrial safety -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Smoke -- Health aspects -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Smoke -- Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Wildfires -- Health aspects</field><field name="subject">Bushfire smoke</field><field name="subject">Respiratory health effects</field><field name="subject">Occupational exposure</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Real-time collaborative volumetric virtual sculpting with haptic force-feedback</field><field name="creator">Prior, Anthony</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Virtual sculpting is an interactive 3D modeling process that allows users to create and modify solid objects in a virtual world, with applications in art, rapid proto- typing and design. This thesis investigates methods for a collaborative, voxel-based virtual sculpting with haptic force-feedback. The objective is to devise such a system that operates in real-time. I make three main contributions in the fields of voxel-based virtual sculpting, haptics and collaborative virtual environments. First, I have devised a method for virtual sculpting where a voxel-based sculpture is created using a tool to build up or erode material. In existing real-time systems, due to the complexity of the algorithms that determine which voxels have been touched by the tool in a given time-step, the size or shape of the sculpting tool is limited and can often only be applied at a fixed orientation. My solution allows the tool to take the shape of any arbitrary triangle-based polyhedron that can be applied at any orientation. To determine which voxels are intersected by the tool, the tool is voxelized (converted into its discrete voxel representation) at each time-step against the voxels of the sculpture, which are then modified according to the desired operation. To give the resulting voxel-based sculpture a realistic appearance, I use the well-known Marching Cubes algorithm to form a triangular- mesh isosurface where the voxels representing sculpture material meet free-space.  '...' For this I have borrowed concepts from the existing Voxmap-PointShell (VPS) model where the tool is represented by an array of points that cover its surface, each of which is tested for collisions with the sculpture. Each colliding point will form a component force, and the overall collision force is the vector sum of these components. My model is unique in that the component forces are formed in a direction tangential to the isosurface nearest the voxel of collision and can operate while the voxels of the sculpture are changing. While the VPS model is designed for force-feedback on a 6- degrees-of-freedom haptic device (delivers translational and rotational forces to the user), my model is designed to suit commodity 3-degrees-of-freedom (translational forces only) devices which are much more common. Third, I have developed a collaborative virtual sculpting paradigm to allow several users to simultaneously work on the same sculpture from different locations. This allows collaborative design without the requirement of being co-present. I will discuss methods for relaying the rapidly changing voxel and isosurface data between workstations, such that the local environment on each is synchronized in a manner that is immediate and transparent to the users. In addition, collisions between the different users' tools are felt through force-feedback. I implemented a collaborative haptic virtual sculpting simulation using the above methods in order to validate the system. The simulation was used to test the capabilities and limits of each contribution, as well as the real-time capability of the overall system. Ultimately this thesis demonstrates that it is possible to combine these technologies to form a flexible and intuitive collaborative virtual sculpting experience that operates in real-time.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer-aided design</field><field name="subject">Human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">Rapid prototyping</field><field name="subject">Virtual reality</field><field name="subject">Virtual sculpting</field><field name="subject">Collaborative virtual environment</field><field name="subject">Haptics</field><field name="subject">Real-time</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The problematic of video art in the museum (1968-1990)</field><field name="creator">Manasseh, Cyrus</field><field name="description">This thesis discusses how museum structures were redefined over a twenty-two year period in specific relation to the impetus of Video Art. It contends that Video Art would be instrumental in the evolution of the contemporary art museum. The thesis will analyse, discuss and evaluate the problematic nature and form of Video Art within four major contemporary art museums - the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, the Georges Pompidou National Centre of Art and Culture in Paris, the Tate Gallery in London and the Art Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW) in Sydney. By addressing some of the problems that Video Art would present to those museums under discussion, the thesis will reveal how Video Art would challenge institutional structures and demand more flexible viewing environments. As a result, the modern museum would need to constantly modify their policies and internal spaces in order to cope with the dynamism of Video Art. This thesis first defines the classical museum structure established by the Louvre during the 19th century. It examines the transformation from the classical to the modern model through the initiatives of the New York Metropolitan Museum to MoMA in New York. MoMA would be the first major museum to exhibit Video Art in a concerted fashion and this would establish a pattern of acquisition and exhibition that became influential for other global institutions to replicate. MoMA's exhibition and acquisition activities are analysed and contrasted with the Centre Pompidou, the Tate Gallery and the AGNSW in order to define a lineage of development in relation to Video Art. This thesis provides an historical explanation for the museum/gallery's relationship to Video Art from its emergence in the gallery to the beginnings of its acceptance as a global art phenomenon. Curatorial strategies, the influx of corporate patronage and the reconstruction of spectatorship within the gallery are analysed in relation to the unique problematic of Video Art. Several prominent video artists are examined in relation to the challenges they would present to the institutionalised framework of the modern art museum and the discursive field surrounding their practice. In addition, the thesis contains a theoretical discussion of the problems related to Video Art imagery with the period of High Modernism; examines the patterns of acquisition and exhibition, and presents an analysis of global exchange between four distinct contemporary art institutions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Museums -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Video art -- Exhibitions -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Art museums -- Exhibitions -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Changing museum frameworks</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A stereological study assessing the validity of using endobronchial biopsies to assess mast cell density in the central and peripheral bronchial tree</field><field name="creator">Carroll, Mark</field><field name="description">[Tuncated abstract] There has been longstanding concern over whether endobronchial biopsies adequately represent inflammation throughout the bronchial tree in diseases such as asthma, despite the endobronchial biopsy technique having been used frequently to assess airway inflammation in research settings. There has also been ongoing debate about whether endobronchial biopsies should be assessed by new, unbiased, three-dimensional (3D) stereological techniques instead of traditional, two-dimensional (2D) non-stereological techniques. Therefore, the aims of this study were: (i) to investigate whether endobronchial biopsies represent the density of mast cells in the large and small airways, in alveolar walls and in the lung as a whole (ii) to use both stereological and non-stereological methods to address this question, and where possible, to compare the results of these two approaches. '...'  Mast cell density in biopsies was not related to mast cell density immediately adjacent to the biopsy site or to mast cell density in the total airway wall in the large airways, the inner airway wall in the small airways, the walls of the alveoli or the lung as a whole. In general, measurements of mean mast cell density on biopsies to a depth of 100&#181;m below the basement membrane were poorly related to mean mast cell density in other compartments of the lung. Mean 3D and 2D mast cell densities were strongly correlated (r  0.9, p &lt; 0.005) and where both methods were used, results were similar. The mean height and area profile of a mast cell were approximately 12&#181;m and 68&#181;m2 respectively. In disk-shaped IUR lung samples, percent shrinkage in height due to paraffin processing was systematically greater than percent radial shrinkage by an average of approximately 4 times. Cavalieri lung volumes were systematically smaller than displacement volumes by an average of 14%. Any given endobronchial biopsy is unlikely to represent mast cell density around the airway wall generally in the vicinity of the biopsy site. However, the average of at least 4 biopsies from different sites in the proximal airways can be used to both represent mean mast cell density in the inner airway wall of the large airways, and act as the basis for inter-subject comparisons of mean mast cell density in the total airway wall of the small airways. On biopsies, mast cell counts should be measured over the entire inner airway wall not just to a depth of 100&#181;m or less below the basement membrane. 3D mast cell densities obtained by stereological methods are closely related to 2D mast cell densities obtained by non-stereological methods and are likely to result in similar conclusions. Lung volumes are smaller when measured by the Cavalieri method than when measured by fluid displacement. Shrinkage of isotropic uniform random samples of human lung tissue due to paraffin processing is anisotropic. The mean volume of a mast cell in the human lung is likely to be much smaller than that reported previously for monkey lungs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lungs -- Biopsy</field><field name="subject">Airway (Medicine) -- Inflammation</field><field name="subject">Endobronchial biopsies</field><field name="subject">Stereology</field><field name="subject">Mast cells</field><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Crafting of Text on Emblematic Objects: Jewellery and Tableware</field><field name="creator">Bartley, Roseanne</field><field name="description">This project examines the historical use of text on emblematic objects and through a studio-based practice investigates the signifying properties of   object, text and material in the communication of symbolic message. It involves the manufacture of contemporary jewellery and tableware in traditional and non-traditional materials and references cultural and political themes. The symbolism of these themes has been explored through the visual and material applications of selected text, the collection and manipulation of found material (found with or without text), and how meaning can be symbolised through the transcendent manipulation of form.      In my research I examined the established history of emblematic objects, which through their incorporation of text, their function and scale in relation to the body, organise, distinguish, categorise, unite or isolate groups of people.      In my research I established that text has been employed by gold and silversmiths through out history and in a variety of ways - to narrate   messages, as an abstract decoration, or as a means of identifying the maker but the graphic potential of text as a visible sign was rarely demonstrated. With this studio based project I was interested in investigating the signifying   properties of text and the creation of a dynamic relationship between text, form and material as a means to communicate symbolic meaning.

The idea that it may be possible to synthesise robotic control systems using an automatic design process is appealing. However, ER is considerably more challenging and less automatic than its advocates would suggest.      ER applies methods from the field of neuroevolution to evolve robot control systems. Neuroevolution is a machine learning algorithm that applies evolutionary computation to the design of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The aim of this thesis is to assay the practical characteristics of neuroevolution by performing bulk experiments on a set of Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems. This thesis was conducted with the view of applying neuroevolution to the design of neurocontrollers for small low-cost Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV).      A general approach to neuroevolution for RL problems is presented. The is selected to evolve ANN connection weights on the basis that it has shown competitive performance on continuous optimisation problems, is self-adaptive and can exploit dependencies between connection weights. Practical implementation issues are identified and discussed.      A series of experiments are conducted on RL problems. These problems are representative of problems from the AUV domain, but manageable in terms of problem complexity and computational resources required. Results from these experiments are analysed to draw out practical characteristics of neuroevolution.      Bulk experiments are conducted using the inverted pendulum problem. This popular control benchmark is inherently unstable, underactuated and non-linear: characteristics common to underwater vehicles. Two practical characteristics of neuroevolution are demonstrated: the importance of using randomly generated evaluation sets and the effect of evaluation noise on search performance. As part of these experiments, deficiencies in the benchmark are identified and modifications suggested.      The problem of an underwater vehicle travelling to a goal in an obstacle free environment is studied. The vehicle is modelled as a Dubins car, which is a simplified model of the high-level kinematics of a torpedo class underwater vehicle. Two practical characteristics of neuroevolution are demonstrated: the importance of domain knowledge when formulating ANN inputs and how the fitness function defines the set of evolvable control policies. Paths generated by the evolved neurocontrollers are compared with known optimal solutions.      A framework is presented to guide the practical application of neuroevolution to RL problems that covers a range of issues identified during the experiments conducted in this thesis. An assessment of neuroevolution concludes that it is far from automatic yet still has potential as a technique for solving reinforcement problems, although further research is required to better understand the process of evolutionary learning.      The major contribution made by this thesis is a rigorous empirical study of the practical characteristics of neuroevolution as applied to RL problems. A critical, yet constructive, viewpoint is taken of neuroevolution. This viewpoint differs from much of the reseach undertaken in this field, which is often unjustifiably optimistic and tends to gloss over difficult practical issues.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">artificial neural networks</field><field name="subject">autonomous underwater vehicles</field><field name="subject">CMA-ES</field><field name="subject">evolutionary computation</field><field name="subject">evolutionary learning</field><field name="subject">evolutionary robotics</field><field name="subject">evolution strategies</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">neuroevolution</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090331.143104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Caffeine on Cognitive Tasks</field><field name="creator">Valladares, Lorraine</field><field name="description">The effects of caffeine (250 mg) and placebo on healthy controls were studied in a double-blind, cross over study on 24 healthy subjects who performed a working memory n-back task.

This research yielded a comparison of the digestibility of different feed additives.      P digestibility was determined from in vivo studies of pigs. The animal feed in the in vivo studies contained P levels below the nutrient requirements. The basal diet was a corn soybean meal base.  Assessment was performed on 6 different inorganic P sources, rock phosphate (tricalcium phosphate (TCP)), meat and bone meal (MBM), mono/dicalcium phosphate (MDCP) and three different dicalcium phosphates (DCPs).  Eight pigs where selected and placed into separate pens.  Two were given basal diets and the other 6 diets were randomly selected and supplied with the different inorganic P sources. P digestibility was calculated by difference. The apparent P digestibility of the sources were: TCP at 46 %, the MBM at 85 %, MDCP at 71 % and three DCPs ranged from 49 % to 73 %.  This substantiated that the apparent P digestibility in the major inorganic sources of P is significantly less than 100%.      The in vitro or chemical methods of assessing phosphorus availability in animal feed included the commonly used feed extraction methods of water solubility and 2 % citric acid. These two methods showed significant differences between each other. Other chemical methods used included calcium chloride, ammonium acetate, sodium bicarbonate extractions, and a double extraction using hydrochloric acid (HCl) followed by sodium bicarbonate.  The chemical methods showed non-significant correlation coefficients when compared to in vivo P digestibility of the six phosphate ingredients used.        Infra-red spectroscopy is now commonly used in feed production for many other nutritional tests. NIR, although being able to obtain an R2 above 0.999 for correlation curves and factor prediction curves, could not obtain a self prediction of the calcium phosphates due to the large Mahalanobis Distance.  P digestibility predicted by MIR showed close agreement with the in vivo P digestibility. Again due to the small number of ingredients tested in the pig trial, the prediction of digestibility using MIR could only be compared to it self. Hence MIR can only be used as an estimate until more data can be obtained.        The P31 SS-MAS-NMR indicated one of the DCPs was made up of 3 or more P compounds by displaying 3 major peaks. All the P chemical shifts from the faeces had different positions to the P peaks in the ingredients, indicating some sort of change in the P form.      Overall the chemical methods were unable to predict P digestibility, and while the spectroscopic techniques showed promise, they still require more work to examine many more feed additives.Invitro, invivo, phosphorus, digestibility, swine, infra-red spectroscopy, solid state NMR</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Invitro</field><field name="subject">invivo</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">digestibility</field><field name="subject">swine</field><field name="subject">infra-red spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">solid state NMR</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090401.141751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children's film viewing practices : a qualitative investigation into engagement with a feature film : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Education at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Finch, Brian Thomas</field><field name="description">This study investigates the ways that children engage with a repeatedly viewed film in domestic settings. The research questions focus on the children's language, their multimodal behaviours while viewing and the understandings they form about a film. The study aims to provide insights for educators by demonstrating the range and nature of the educationally significant understandings, about film, that children construct. An initial survey of 9 and 10 year olds produced 17 children who nominated Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Columbus, 2002) as a favourite film that they had viewed at least 10 times. A video illustrating the research procedures was used to inform and to stimulate discussion with these children, to ensure that they were able to give educated consent. Observations of pairs of children viewing the film in their homes, followed by a series of activities to elicit discussion, created a set of rich data on the children's engagement practices and understandings of the film. Framed within the interpretivist paradigm, social semiotics and a sociocultural model of learning informed the generation and analysis of the data. A viewing practices engagement framework adapted existing frameworks in literature, literacy and critical literacy to better analyse viewing behaviours, responses and understandings. The engagement practice categories (literal, connotative, aesthetic, structural and critical) enabled multimodal and transcribed verbal data to be meaningfully linked. Several analytic approaches (including multimodal analysis and discourse analysis) were used to provide a full description of viewing engagement. The findings revealed variable levels of overt behaviour during viewing which did not relate to levels of understanding about the film. The range of understandings included aspects of characters, narrative, causation in the film and special effects. Discourse analysis revealed a range of viewing positions taken and social languages used, as well as gender differences in the balance of language used to attribute the film&#8217;s emotional effects. The findings provide evidence that children construct a range of educationally relevant understandings through their repeated home viewing of favourites, although structural and critical engagement was not well developed in this group. The findings are relevant to children's learning, audience research and the culture of childhood. The study has implications for parents, for primary school teachers and for education policy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">motion pictures</field><field name="subject">engagement</field><field name="subject">appreciation</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">multimodal analysis</field><field name="subject">Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330103 Sociology of education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The organisational world of emergency clinicians</field><field name="creator">Nugus, Peter, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background: The last 30 years have seen considerable growth in the scope of emergency medicine and the size, scale and expectations of emergency departments (EDs) in the USA and other countries, including Australia. The emphasis has changed from direct referral to departments in the hospital to treatment in and disposition from the ED. At the same time, emergency clinicians face increasing pressure to address patient needs with greater efficiency. Within this context, this project describes the character of the unique domain of work and collective identity that emergency clinicians carve out in their interactions with other emergency clinicians and with clinicians from other departments.  Methods: Fieldwork was conducted over 10 months in the EDs of two tertiary referral hospitals in Sydney, Australia. It comprised approximately 535 hours of unstructured and structured observation, as well as 56 field interviews.  Results: Emergency clinicians have a unique role as "gatekeepers" of the hospital. This ensures that their clinical work is inherently organisational - that is, interdepartmental and bureaucratic work. Emergency clinicians explicitly and implicitly negotiate the "patient pathway" through the hospital which is organised according to the "fragmented" body. This role demands previously under-recognised and complex immaterial work. Emergency clinicians seek to reconcile the individual trajectories of patients present in the ED with the ED?s broader function as a "carousel" in order to seek to provide the greatest good for the greatest number of future patients. The research uniquely charts the socialisation processes and informal education that produce tacit organisational expertise with which emergency nurses and doctors, both separately and jointly, negotiate the bureaucracy of the hospital.  Conclusion: EDs are destined to struggle to provide the greatest good for the greatest number, reconciling shortcomings in the structure and provision of public and community health care. However, recognition and support for the unique clinical-organisational domain of ED care presents an opportunity for improved holistic care at the front door of the hospital. Our ageing population and its promise of more patients with complex health issues demand further research on the interdepartmental work of other whole-body specialties, such as Aged Care.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emergency medical personnel.</field><field name="subject">Emergency medicine -- Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mounting evidence: Traces of things to come</field><field name="creator">Chan, Janet Bick Lai, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis documents a project that investigates the nature of painting in the digital age. Accounts of ??what painting is?? have focused on the quality of its product, its production process, and its relationship with the artworld. This thesis describes how the student has developed a form of digital painting practice that consciously engages with and reconstructs the aesthetic space once occupied by Chinese landscape painting. The works combine both realist and surrealist techniques in a way that transgresses the processes and conventions of traditional Chinese painting while at the same time appropriates its presentation format. Drawing on popular culture??s fascination with forensic science, the artist plays with physical evidence and literally generates mountains out of molehills. In manipulating proofs of where things have been, she creates a fantasy of how things can become when taken out of context. Focusing on the legal system as a symbol of the superiority of Western civilisation, the project explores the ??majesty?? of justice as it is manifested in the everyday administration of criminal cases, where the prosecution builds its argument out of the fragments of evidence collected, analysed and presented as a coherent story of actions and intentions.  Mountains are evocative symbols for the justice system. Lofty mountains depicted in Chinese painting are, like Western justice, fascinating, awe-inspiring and spiritual realms that are beyond the reach of most ordinary people.  Mountains are often sacred places where believers pay pilgrimage to seek health and longevity and where scholars and intellectuals seek self-improvement and enlightenment. If drawing is a way of making marks, this project turns the act of drawing upside down. Just like the forensic scientist, the artist makes visible the traces created by objects by ??dusting?? objects with powder and ??lifting?? the traces on sticky tapes. These traces are then converted into digital images using a computer scanner. In the same way that a prosecutor puts together a criminal case, the artist builds cases from the evidence that has been made visible. Instead of making a direct mark, the artist ??paints?? the image using the palettes of physical traces as pigments.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Digital art</field><field name="subject">Painting</field><field name="subject">Fine arts</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42058</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What attributions do teachers ascribe to student academic achievement?</field><field name="creator">Thomas, David Anthony, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study seeks to provide empirical evidence regarding teacher attributions of achievement for gifted students and those students not considered gifted. An examination is made of the extent to which teachers hold an entity or incremental theory of intelligence. It is also considered that the entity view of intelligence may be varied to come into line with the incremental approach. Concurrently, teacher attributions are examined to determine if there is a relationship between attributions for achievement and the gender of the student and teacher, the length of teaching experience, and the major subject area taught. The teachers?? attributions of achievement in four separate disciplines (English, Mathematics, Science and HSIE) are examined to determine if a difference exists amongst teachers in these four disciplines with reference to the attribution of achievement. This study investigates the possibility that teachers?? concern for their own self-interest to some extent influences their attributions of student achievement. The respondents are more than 200 high school teachers in the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), New South Wales Chapter, who completed three questionnaires, each comprising 20 questions. Questionnaire 1 sought to discover high school teachers?? general views of intelligence, while Questionnaires 2 and 3 considered the attributions made by teachers for student academic achievement (among the gifted and those not identified as gifted respectively). This study finds that teachers are more likely to see effort as the major indicator of student academic achievement. As well, teachers attribute male student success to ability and failure to lack of effort, and female student success to effort and failure to a lack of ability. Female teachers are more likely to consider that student achievement is more due to effort than are the male teachers and it is found that teachers across the four major subject areas are more likely to hold an incremental view of intelligence and will thus focus upon a learning approach to education rather than to a performance approach. The findings of this study provide a greater understanding of the attributional influences that affect the achievement levels of gifted students and students not considered gifted, and may have significant implications for educational practices in schools.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42783</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chris Marker:  A stylistic analysis of his film and media work</field><field name="creator">Broad, Lynne, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the poetics of editing in the films and multimedia works of Chris Marker.  From his first essay films of the 1950s to his 1998 CD-ROM Immemory, the director&#146;s work has attracted critical attention for its beauty and originality of expression.  Much existing analysis engages with this work in terms of its subject matter and themes and their relationship with its associational, rather than linear, narrative form, with relatively little focus on the stylistics of Marker&#146;s editing.  While questions of the director&#146;s thematic concerns also arise in my study, I argue that Marker&#146;s contribution to cinema and the visual arts cannot be fully appreciated without a systematic understanding of his stylistics&#151;his expressive use of cinematic forms and patterns.  In developing such an understanding, this thesis utilises the work of a number of film writers explicitly concerned with the expressive use of cinematic space and time.  From Andr?? Bazin, I take the idea of rapprochement to mean the way the comparison between two juxtaposed events or images suggests or expresses the meaning of their juxtaposition.  From Jean-Andr?? Fieschi, I draw on the idea that the dialectical interaction of the plastic, formal and narrative elements of a film gives meaning to its cinematic space and time.  My approach synthesises and builds upon both ideas for its account of the stylistics of Marker&#146;s work.   Starting with a preliminary analysis of one cinematic comparison in The Case of the Grinning Cat (2004), I then consider Marker&#146;s exploration of the imaginative potential of a single image sequence in The Last Bolshevik (1993).  After this, I explore examples of the stylistic figure of rapprochement in Letter from Siberia (1958), and the stylistic figure of transformation in Sunless (1982).  The thesis then studies articulations of rapprochement and transformation in the museum installations Zapping Zone: Proposals for an Imaginary Television (1991), Silent Movie (1995) and the CD-ROM Immemory.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stylistic analysis</field><field name="subject">Chris Marker</field><field name="subject">Essay film</field><field name="subject">Media work</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial data quality management</field><field name="creator">He, Ying, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The applications of geographic information systems (GIS) in various areas have highlighted the importance of data quality. Data quality research has been given a priority by GIS academics for three decades. However, the outcomes of data quality research have not been sufficiently translated into practical applications. Users still need a GIS capable of storing, managing and manipulating data quality information. To fill this gap, this research aims to investigate how we can develop a tool that effectively and efficiently manages data quality information to aid data users to better understand and assess the quality of their GIS outputs. Specifically, this thesis aims:  1.	To develop a framework for establishing a systematic linkage between data quality indicators and appropriate uncertainty models; 2.	To propose an object-oriented data quality model for organising and documenting data quality information; 3.	To create data quality schemas for defining and storing the contents of metadata databases; 4.	To develop a new conceptual model of data quality management; 5.	To develop and implement a prototype system for enhancing the capability of data quality management in commercial GIS.  Based on reviews of error and uncertainty modelling in the literature, a conceptual framework has been developed to establish the systematic linkage between data quality elements and appropriate error and uncertainty models. To overcome the limitations identified in the review and satisfy a series of requirements for representing data quality, a new object-oriented data quality model has been proposed.  It enables data quality information to be documented and stored in a multi-level structure and to be integrally linked with spatial data to allow access, processing and graphic visualisation. The conceptual model for data quality management is proposed where a data quality storage model, uncertainty models and visualisation methods are three basic components. This model establishes the processes involved when managing data quality, emphasising on the integration of uncertainty modelling and visualisation techniques. The above studies lay the theoretical foundations for the development of a prototype system with the ability to manage data quality. Object-oriented approach, database technology and programming technology have been integrated to design and implement the prototype system within the ESRI ArcGIS software. The object-oriented approach allows the prototype to be developed in a more flexible and easily maintained manner. The prototype allows users to browse and access data quality information at different levels. Moreover, a set of error and uncertainty models are embedded within the system. With the prototype, data quality elements can be extracted from the database and automatically linked with the appropriate error and uncertainty models, as well as with their implications in the form of simple maps. This function results in proposing a set of different uncertainty models for users to choose for assessing how uncertainty inherent in the data can affect their specific application. It will significantly increase the users' confidence in using data for a particular situation.  To demonstrate the enhanced capability of the prototype, the system has been tested against the real data. The implementation has shown that the prototype can efficiently assist data users, especially non-expert users, to better understand data quality and utilise it in a more practical way. The methodologies and approaches for managing quality information presented in this thesis should serve as an impetus for supporting further research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Data quality management.</field><field name="subject">Data quality.</field><field name="subject">Uncertainty model.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The great houses of Kolkata  1750- 2006</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Joanne Lea, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">British colonial rule in India provided opportunities for certain indigenous groups to profit in both wealth and status. With the rise of the East India Company in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) during the eighteenth century, the mainly Hindu merchant class embraced British rule in many ways, a significant and lasting one is the architecture of their residential mansions and palaces, known as the Great Houses. This study traces the architectural history of these buildings through the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries and examines the style that developed as a consequence.  The main objectives of the thesis are to demonstrate that:  1.	The architecture and style of the Great Houses of Kolkata&#146;s indigenous elites were inspired by their colonial experience. 2.	Despite the British architectural models available during the colonial period, the Great Houses feature hybrid designs and eclectic architectural forms. The thesis examines the meaning behind this anomaly. 3.	The Great Houses embody a particular time and place in the history of Kolkata and are unique. They are part of Kolkata&#146;s heritage. 4.	In spite of the influence of British colonial rule, traditional Hindu ways of life continued unabated in the private domains of the Great Houses. 5.	Their rise and decline parallels the socio-economic and political history of Kolkata.   The thesis approaches the complex reasons behind the transition and decline of the Great Houses by examining the history and architecture of these buildings in a chronologically linear order, beginning in 1757 with the Battle of Plassey, the political changes of the nineteenth century, and the subsequent relative decline of the importance of Bengal in the twentieth century to focus on the relevance of the Great Houses in the twenty first century.  The research has been undertaken on a number of levels. Primary and secondary sources have been used, both colonial and post Independence, in India and Australia. These methods have been supplemented by archival material including drawings of plans, by interviews with descendents of the Great Families, historians and architects in Kolkata and by an extensive photographic documentation of the houses as they are today.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">India</field><field name="subject">Architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42691</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of low-cost systems for safe drinking water in areas of Bangladesh and India affected by arsenic</field><field name="creator">Chowdhury, Ahmedul, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Safe water options for five arsenic-affected villages (Sarupie, Manikganj; Daniapara, Shirajdekhan; Babutepara, Muradnagar; Iruaien, Laksham; Rahulllabad, Nabinagar) in central Bangladesh were studied in order to assist the local people and to obtain an indication of general solutions to the arsenic problem that is currently affecting ~100 million people on the Indian subcontinent. Arsenic concentrations were measured in all drinking waters believed to be safe and in a random sample of "red" (unsafe) tubewell waters. Depending on geography, history of safe water sources and availability of pond/river, the options of dugwells, deep tubewells and sand filters were recommended for core village areas, combined with sustainable output testing and a distribution system to maximise the benefits of sustainable water output. Very shallow tubewells were recommended for testing in villages where dugwells were successful. Rainwater harvesting was not recommended, due to expense, small storage capacity and summer dry periods. Two dugwells of optimised design were constructed in Iruaien and Daniapara, each serving 50-100 families. The knowledge gained in the villages was incorporated into the first draft of a "Safe Water Book" for dissemination of honest and accurate information about solutions to the arsenic problem.  An air/iron treatment system was developed for removal of arsenic from tubewell water in locations where water treatment is the only option available. The system is based on the Bangladeshi "three kalshi" method, but optimised for efficient contact of water with air and iron. It can be constructed like a sand filter, and requires no chemical input, except for clean scrap iron. Spent scrap iron containing arsenic can be incorporated into concrete for safe disposal. A model air/iron system was constructed and run for two years to demonstrate the long-term viability of the device.  A colorimetric method, using silver diethyldithiocarbamate, was developed for determination of arsenic in the villages of Bangladesh. The equipment was adapted for rugged field use, and performed successfully without electricity or running water in improvised laboratory space in villages, providing linear calibrations 0-500 ??g/L and a 2&#963;  limit of detection of 5 ??g/L.  The appropriate technologies that should be developed or optimised for the arsenic affected region are described and preliminary suggestions are given about means by which self-propagating solutions might be developed in villages to solve the arsenic problem.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arsenic</field><field name="subject">Bangladesh</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of precise microbiological reference materials</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Charlotte Ann, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Quality Control (QC) reference materials are widely used in microbiology to demonstrate the efficacy of testing methods and culture media.  The current method for preparation of QC materials is by serial dilution of a microbial broth culture to obtain a suspension that contains an estimated number of colony forming units (cfu).  Commercial reference material products are available with dried microbial cells, however, the numbers of cells are variable between batches as the production processes are reliant on cell suspensions of estimated cell number.  This study developed a method to produce precise microbial reference materials with a accurate number of viable cells.  Flow cytometry was used to count and dispense precise numbers of cells into a single droplet of fluid.  The droplets were then mixed with a lyoprotectant solution and subjected to freeze-drying.  The resultant freeze-dried pellets showed consistent average cfu counts between 28-33 cfu with a standard deviation &lt; 3 cfu.  The freeze-drying methodology and developed conditions of cell growth enabled &gt; 90% of the cells to survive freeze-drying and remain viable for one year at a storage temperature below -18??C.  The methodology for the production of freeze-dried pellet was applied to a range of genera including, different E. coli strains, Gram positive bacteria such as Listeria and Staphylococcus, the yeast Candida albicans and a spore-producing Bacillus cereus.  The precision of cell numbers was comparable between different microbial genera and strains and a consistent standard deviation below 3 cfu was achieved.  The same freeze-dried pellet method was used for the different micro-organisms, except for changes to preparation of cell suspensions.  Different methods of broth culture were developed to ensure freeze-dried cell survival.  A measurement of method reproducibility was obtained when 99 batches of pellets were produced, and within batch and between batch variation was determined.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Freeze drying.</field><field name="subject">Flow cytometry.</field><field name="subject">Precision.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41848</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The incidence of and risk factors for contact lens related microbial keratitis in Australia and New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Catherine Patrice, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Microbial keratitis is the most serious, and only potentially blinding complication of contact lens wear. To further understand and reduce the risk of this disease, incidence rates and risk factors have been estimated in numerous studies.  Since these studies were conducted, new lens types have been introduced designed to reduce the risk of infection. It was hypothesised that the issues of contact lens related hypoxia and poor lens hygiene could be addressed by the introduction of silicone hydrogel and daily disposable lenses respectively. This thesis describes the incidence of and risk factors for contact lens related microbial keratitis in Australia and New Zealand.  The incidence of infection was determined by capturing all cases of contact lens related presumed microbial keratitis in a 12-month surveillance study, and by estimating the number of lens wearers using a population-based phone survey. Characteristics of the cases and controls were compared to estimate risk factors. In Australia, rates of infection with daily and overnight wear of hydrogel lenses were similar to previously published reports (1.9 [95%CI]:1.8-2.0] and 19.5 [95%CI:14.6-29.5] per 10,000 wearers respectively). Compared to the incidence of infection with hydrogel lenses, silicone hydrogel lenses had a higher rate in daily wear (11.9 [95%CI: 10.0-14.6]), and a similar rate in extended wear (19.5 [95%CI:14.6-29.5]). Daily disposable lenses had a similar rate of infection to daily wear of hydrogel lenses (2.0 [95%CI:1.7-2.4]), but appeared to reduce the incidence of severe or vision loss keratitis (0.5 [95%CI: 0.5-0.6] and 0.0 [95%CI: 0.0-0.0] respectively).  Conducting the study in New Zealand confirmed the increase in incidence for overnight use of lenses, irrespective of lens type.  Comparison of the incidence rates in New Zealand and Australia show that the rates in the two countries are comparable, bar an unexplained lower rate of infection for extended wear of soft hydrogel lenses in New Zealand. Risk factors for infection were overnight use of lenses, from occasional overnight to extended wear use, poor lens case hygiene, smoking, high socio-economic status and less than 6 months experience in current lens type. Amongst daily wearers, Internet or mail order purchasing of lenses was also associated with a higher risk of infection. This study is unique in terms of the study design and sample size, and the wide scope of risk factors considered. The determination of these incidence rates of infection and identification of risk factors is of extreme value to lens wearers and lens care practitioners around the world, particularly as the strongest and most prevalent risk factors are modifiable.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microbial keratitis</field><field name="subject">contact lenses</field><field name="subject">incidence</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetrical dispersal in simulation analysis</field><field name="creator">Maio, Gianluca, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Asymmetrical dispersal is when dispersal rates differ in opposite directions. This is expected to be common in natural populations. This work aims to study the symmetrical and asymmetrical dispersal through the use of a simulation program, simuPOP. The main questions were (i) "what are the differences between asymmetrical and symmetrical dispersal in relation to genetic differentiation and equilibrium?" and (ii) "Is it possible to identify asymmetrical dispersal structure from observed patterns of genetic differentiation between populations, and variation within populations?". To address these questions, simulations were conducted with two and three subpopulations subject by three different dispersal rate contrasts and several spatial patterns of dispersal. Variables were estimated at drift-dispersal equilibrium included genetic differentiation between subpopulations (&#952;) and heterozygosity. With pairwise &#952; for three subpopulations it was possible to determine whether the metapopulations were subject to symmetrical or asymmetrical dispersal and sometimes to identify the structure of dispersal. Equilibrium heterozygosities did not aid diagnosis of asymmetrical dispersal patterns. I also checked the applicability of two predictions originally made for symmetrical dispersal: Wright's expectations for &#952; at equilibrium, and Whitlock's expectations fro time to half of equilibrium &#952;. In most cases these expectations were not applicable.

However, the use of 1, 25 (OH)2VD3 is hampered due to the development of hypercalcaemia. Current treatment using hepatic arterial delivery of drug solution is inconvenient since repetitive invasive treatments are required. This work aims to tackle this problem by utilizing crosslinked microspheres prepared by suspension polymerization as a carrier to control the release of 1, 25 (OH)2VD3 or hydrophobic drug in general at targeted sites over a long period. Poly(vinyl neodecanoate crosslinked ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate) microspheres in the size range of 35 &#61549;m were prepared via suspension polymerization. Different parameters in suspension polymerization such as temperature, concentration and crosslinker percentage were studied in details. The effect of stabilizer on the formation of spheres was carefully investigated by using RAFT polymerization to produce various structures of the stabilizer, poly (vinyl pyrrolidone). Core- shell microspheres were also produced to enhance the hydrophilicity of the surface of microspheres. Hydrophobic drugs were loaded to these microspheres after reaction by the evaporation method. These microspheres were then used for drug loading and drug release study. Release study has shown that up to 10% of drug was released after 40 days. Cytotoxicity test reveals the suitability of this polymer for application in biomedical field.

It builds on current research which highlights the tendency for community concerns about proposed developments to escalate into long-term protests that have far-reaching implications for both the construction industry and the local community. A theoretical framework merges the facilitative role of movement networks, contagion theory and the cultural experience of activism to investigate their relationship with protest movement continuity. Three research propositions emerged from the model and are investigated within a grounded theory framework. The research method adopts a single case study of a mature protest movement and utilises a triangulation of methods that integrates qualitative and ethnographic approaches across two interrelated phases of data collection that continues to the point of theoretical saturation. The data is analysed in three ways: A thematic story telling approach is used to ground the data derived so as to identify patterns of influences on protest participation and their effect on movement continuity. Concept maps and network diagrams are also used to connect the themes and guide the use of stories to reveal influences on movement continuity.  The research concludes by proposing a refined theoretical model of protest movement continuity against construction projects. The model also forms the basis for a grounded theory which consisted of three interrelated parts. The first part concludes that protest networks are deliberately complex and dynamic to cope with the transient nature of protest participation and promote movement continuity. The second part points to the contagious influence of network to generate two opposing network conditions that are both conducive and detrimental to movement continuity. The last part points to the importance of social relationships as shaping the context in which cultural meanings of activism are understood and have a direct effect on sustaining movement continuity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Protest</field><field name="subject">Construction projects</field><field name="subject">Stakeholder management</field><field name="subject">Community</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust speaker verification system</field><field name="creator">Nosratighods, Mohaddeseh, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Identity verification or biometric recognition systems play an important role in our daily lives. Applications include Automatic Teller Machines (ATM), banking and share information retrieval, and personal verification for credit cards. Among the biometric techniques, authentication of speakers by his/her voice is of great importance, since it employs a non-invasive approach and is the only available modality in many applications. However,the performance of Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) systems degrades significantly under adverse conditions which cause recordings from the same speaker to be different.The objective of this research is to investigate and develop robust techniques for performing automatic speaker recognition over various channel conditions, such as telephony and recorded microphone speech. This research is shown to improve the robustness of ASV systems in three main areas of feature extraction, speaker modelling and score normalization. At the feature level, a new set of dynamic features, termed Delta Cepstral Energy (DCE) is proposed, instead of traditional delta cepstra, which not only greatly reduces thedimensionality of the feature vector compared with delta and delta-delta cepstra, but is also shown to provide the same performance for matched testing and training conditions on TIMIT and a subset of the NIST 2002 dataset. The concept of speaker entropy, which conveys the information contained in a speaker's speech based on the extracted features, facilitates comparative evaluation of the proposed methods. In addition, Frequency Modulation features are combined in a complementary manner with the Mel Frequency CepstralCoefficients (MFCCs) to improve the performance of the ASV system under channel variability of various types. The proposed fused system shows a relative reduction of up to 23% in Equal Error Rate (EER) over the MFCC-based system when evaluated on the NIST 2008 dataset. Currently, the main challenge in speaker modelling is channel variability across different sessions. A recent approach to channel compensation, based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) is Nuisance Attribute Projection (NAP). The proposed multi-component approach to NAP, attempts to compensate for the main sources of inter-session variations through an additional optimization criteria, to allow more accurate estimates of the most dominant channel artefacts and to improve the system performance under mismatched training and test conditions. Another major issue in speaker recognition is that the variability of score distributions due to incompletely modelled regions of the feature space can produce segments of the test speech that are poorly matched to the claimed speaker model. A segment selection technique in score normalization is proposed that relies only on discriminative and reliable segments of the test utterance to verify the speaker. This approach is particularly useful in noisy conditions where using speech activity detection is not reliable at the feature level. Another source of score variability comes from the fact that not all phonemes are equally discriminative. To address this, a new score re-weighting technique is applied to likelihood values based on the discriminative level of each Gaussian component, i.e. each particular region of the feature space. It is found that a limited number of Gaussian mixtures, herein termed discriminative components are responsible for the overall performance, and that inclusion of the other non-discriminative components may only degrade the system performance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Delta Cesptral Energy</field><field name="subject">Speaker Recognition</field><field name="subject">Score Modiffication</field><field name="subject">Channel</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42796</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting the citation impact of clinical neurology journals using structural equation modeling with partial least squares</field><field name="creator">Yue, Weiping, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The ongoing debate on the evaluative role of citation analysis and the theory of citation recognizes that the citation process is complex and that citation counts are affected by certain extra-scientific or external factors. To date, little effort has been made to explore the effects of various external factors; this thesis addresses this lack. In the context of the various perspectives on citations and citation analysis, this study uses journals as the unit of analysis and investigates what, how, and to what extent extra-scientific factors influence the citation impact of journals. An integrated conceptual model of Journal Citation Impact that takes into account current theoretical positions and prior empirical research findings is developed. It addresses the interrelationships between Journal Citation Impact and a range of external factors (Journal Properties, Journal Visibility, Journal Accessibility, Journal Internationality, Journal Selectivity, Journal Promptness, Journal Editorial Prestige, and Perceived Journal Quality). The proposed conceptual model is novel in that it: (1) incorporates nearly all possible external factors that affect Journal Citation Impact; (2) addresses the complex interrelationships between a number of external factors and Journal Citation Impact in one model; (3) regards both Journal Citation Impact and its external factors as theoretical constructs; and (4) identifies the observed variables of the external factors and Journal Citation Impact. However, because of the difficulties in operationalizing all the theoretical constructs, this conceptual model is simplified to an operational model for empirical testing. The operational model includes the construct Journal Citation Impact and four of its external factors, Journal Properties, Journal Accessibility, Journal Internationality, and Perceived Journal Quality. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with Partial Least Squares (PLS) is used to test the operational model with empirical data from 41 research journals in clinical neurology. Data are collected from bibliographic database searching, web searching, printed journals, and from a web-based survey that was conducted to obtain information on perceptions of journal quality. Empirical results of the operational model show that Journal Accessibility, Journal Internationality, and Perceived Journal Quality have large, medium, and small effects respectively on Journal Citation Impact, thus indicating that certain extra-scientific factors can influence Journal Citation Impact significantly. The findings suggest that great care should be taken in interpreting and evaluating the results obtained from citation analysis. In terms of Journal Citation Impact, this research also suggests that various journal citation indicators should be ii used to reflect different aspects of citation impact. By exploring the phenomenological domain in the citing process, this exploratory study not only provides a better understanding of citation analysis, it also contributes to the development of the theory of citation. From the methodological perspective, introducing SEM with PLS to Informetrics and Scientometrics also contributes to the knowledge base of these fields. Pragmatically, the research findings will enhance the judgment of researchers and practitioners such as editors, publishers, librarians and other information specialists in assessing journal performance. Finally, the worldwide survey findings on peer assessment of journal outlets in clinical neurology will be useful for researchers, academics or clinicians in this field.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bibliographical citations</field><field name="subject">Multivariate analysis</field><field name="subject">Medicine</field><field name="subject">Periodicals.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20821</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Archaeology of sacred space : the spatial nature of religious behaviour in the Blue Mountains National Park Australia</field><field name="creator">Kelleher, Matthew</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Archaeology and religion -- New South Wales -- Blue Mountains</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Blue Mountains (N.S.W. : Mountains)</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- New South Wales -- Religion</field><field name="subject">Religion, Prehistoric -- New South Wales -- Blue Mountains</field><field name="subject">Sacred space -- Blue Mountains (N.S.W. : Mountains)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinematics and degenerative change in ligament-injured knees</field><field name="creator">Scarvell, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knee -- Mechanical properties</field><field name="subject">Knee -- Pathophysiology</field><field name="subject">Knee -- Wounds and injuries</field><field name="subject">Anterior cruciate ligament -- Wounds and injuries</field><field name="subject">Ligaments -- Wounds and injuries</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cooking quality: physical and biochemical properties of lentils (Lens culinaris).</field><field name="creator">Sheung-kei, Winnie S,</field><field name="description">Lentils, one of the cool-season pulses, are consumed as a staple food in most developing countries. The demand for pulses in western societies is increasing because of its valuable nutritional quality and an increased awareness of health issues. Australia has a good reputation for producing clean low moisture legume products and could increase as market share of lentil production by identifying, developing and promoting good quality varieties.Lentils which are graded as good quality varieties must have a short and uniform cooking time, without 'hard to cook' seed, have the hull stay attached to the seed during cooking, and have a final acceptable taste, texture, flavour and appearance after cooking (Bhatty 1990). Cooking quality in this study is defined as the maximum force (N) that is required to compress the whole seed cooked product after cooking for a standard period of time. This study aims to develop an objective measurement to determine the cooking quality of lentils and thereby evaluates the relationships between lentil cooking quality and some of its physical and biochemical properties. Four cultivars used (Cassab, Digger, ILL 7180 and Matilda) were grown during 1999 at Mullewa and Pingaring, Western Australia. The relationship between the cooking quality of lentil and water absorption, seed size, seed coat thickness, phytic acid, mineral composition and initial moisture content was investigated.Texture measurement was carried out using the TA.XT2i meter as an alternative to the subjective method "Cooking time test". By comparing the cooking time determined by 'Cooking time test, 220 N was established and suggested as an optimal peak compression force to determine the adequate cooking time for lentils. Both methods showed that 35 minutes cooking time was adequate for red lentils (Cassab, Digger, and ILL 7180), and 45 minutes for green lentils ++</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cooking quality, physical properties, biochemical properties, Lens culinaris, lentils.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=10354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on the adoption and diffusion of information and communication technologies in the banking industry in Thailand using multiple-criteria decision making and system dynamics approaches.</field><field name="creator">Intrapairot, Arunee</field><field name="description">The main objective of this study is to develop requisite models for information and communication technology (ACT) adoption and diffusion in the banking industry in Thailand. The research, combining two study areas of multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) and system dynamics (SD), is conducted using two research methodologies: system development and a case study of the Siam Commercial Bank PCL in Thailand.The study shows how to combine the two decision-making tools of MCDM and system dynamics effectively. The requisite group models of ICT adoption and diffusion provide ways to select the most preferred technology and to allow forward planning to diffuse the adopted technology more effectively. With an embedded decision support tool, decision-makers are able to apply the models with their available information, intuition, knowledge, and experience to improve their decision-making and enhance their learning.Initially, the research revealed that the Siam Commercial Bank currently employs various types of information and communication technologies (ICT) to facilitate work processes, fulfil customers' requirements, and retain its competitive advantage. However, the bank still confronts problems relating to technology adoption and diffusion.A requisite group model of ICT adoption was developed using MCDM as a decision making tool. The model illustrated how to select the most preferable technological alternative that fulfilled the mission of the bank. Results from the MCDM analysis revealed that the preferred technology was Extranet banking followed by a data warehouse. The requisite group model of ICT diffusion was further developed using the system dynamics approach in order to enhance understanding of system behaviour of the selected technology and then provide ways to diffuse it more effectively.

The alpha-stable (alpha-S) family of distributions is used as a model of this interference due to its physical interpretation and its general form. Despite its attractive features, difficulties arise in using this distribution due to, amongst other things, the lack of a general closed form expression for its probability density function. Relevant to the detection scheme used, this affects parameter estimation, signal detector design and goodness-of-fit tests. Significant contributions are made in the latter through the introduction of characteristic function based test that uses the parametric bootstrap. A modification of this test is then made to define a test of the level of impulsive behaviour - again the parametric bootstrap is employed to maintain levels of significance for this and another test based on testing the alpha-S parameter values. The performance of these tests is examined under simulated and two sources of real, impulsive data, namely human heart rate variability and fluctuations in stock prices. Once the appropriateness of the model assumption has been verified, the final, signal detection process may take place. Detectors based on the locally optimum criterion and approximations to it are described and compared to their rank-based counterparts. Results are presented that suggest compelling arguments based on performance and computational complexity for the consideration of rank-based techniques.Keywords: Impulsive behaviour, alpha-stable distribution, stable laws, Gaussianity testing, parameter estimation, goodness-of-fit, parametric bootstrap, signal detection, locally optimum detectors, rank-based detectors.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">signal detection, goodness-of-fit, impulsive behaviour.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=9750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microsphere distribution and radiation dosimetry in human liver following Yttrium-90 microsphere therapy.</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Andrew M.</field><field name="description">The microscopic distribution of microspheres and the resulting radiation dose deposition patterns in human liver following hepatic arterial infusion of 90Y labelled microspheres have been investigated. Tissue samples from normal liver, the tumour periphery and tumour centre were taken from a patient following infusion of 3 GBq of 32 pm diameter resin microspheres labelled with 90Y as treatment for an 80 millimetre diameter metastatic liver tumour. Microspheres were found to deposit inhomogeneously in tissues, preferentially lodging in a region approximately 6 mm wide around the periphery of the tumour. A relative concentration of microspheres of 50 to 70 times that of normal hepatic parenchyma and 65 to 94 times that in the tumour centre was measured in this region. The deposition of microspheres in the tumour periphery was not uniform, and cluster analysis showed that the spheres could be classified into clusters. The number of microspheres in a cluster was skewed towards low numbers and cluster sizes varied from 20 pm to 1500 pm. Microsphere deposition in normal liver was demonstrated to be non-uniform, there being significant variations in concentration over distances on the order of 3 to 4 millimetres. The observed microsphere distributions in three dimensions were used to calculate radiation dose patterns, and the results showed that heterogeneous doses were delivered to all tissues. Within the tumour periphery average doses ranged from 200 Gy to 600 Gy with minimum doses between 70 Gy and 190 Gy. The maximum and minimum doses for the tumour centre sample were 920 Gy and 3.7 Gy respectively, the median dose was 5.8 Gy.

This study details work that I carried out in the period 1995-1999 which examined the effect of culture on students' conceptualisations of nature. It is framed as the creation of my own 'living educational theory' as I, a teacher-researcher, dealt with what I perceived were the cultural inequities experienced by students in my classroom. I carried out my first study with a group of seven rural high school students in the Far North of Queensland in Australia, where I was teaching in 1995. Later, in two visits to China, I was able to carry out the same sort of research with a group of seven Chinese college students in Jinan, Shandong Province, PRC, largely using the Chinese language. I used a naturalistic inquiry approach and a semi-structured interview technique to determine students' conceptualisations of nature. I have chosen to embed the results of these two studies within narratives that describe my experiences in the two cultures as I carried out my research. For each culture, I have also developed an epic description of the role of science from the literature and history of that culture. From my three sources of data, interview, narrative and historical description, I have made knowledge claims about the students' beliefs about the natural world.My research findings are ironic to me since they are diametrically opposite to what I had expected. Initially I had believed that Mainland Chinese students would possess a world view full of alternative perspectives to that of Western school science. My research indicates however that students in rural Mainland China hold a traditional and integrated modem Western scientific world view.

This national competition aims to provide students with a sense of achievement in mathematics and to emphasise the importance of this subject in the high school curriculum.Vygotsky's zone of proximal development refers to the difference between a student's actual developmental level and the student's potential developmental level given adult assistance. In effect, this means that while students may achieve to a plane commensurate with their actual developmental level, they will progress into their zone of proximal development with assistance and their level of achievement will rise. Vygotsky's concept of Intervention coupled with Siegler's concept of heuristic-based strategy learning provided a methodology suitable for enhancing and maximising developmental effects in this study.The study involved three distinct stages: the preparatory phase, the treatment phase and the concluding phase.In the preparatory phase, student's actual developmental levels were determined based on their performance in the 1979 Junior level Australian Mathematics Competition paper. This data facilitated identifying the paths that learning should follow in order that students' problem solving skills should improve.

Concern has arisen over the increased incidence of cardiovascular disease that has been reported in individuals with nephrotic syndrome, particularly since the syndrome may occur early in life and become a chronic illness. The presence of proteinuria is a prognostic indicator for the progression of renal disease, but its possible contribution as a cardiovascular risk factor in patients with nephrotic syndrome is not known. In contrast, disordered lipoprotein metabolism, in isolation, is a conventional risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. An early phase of atherosclerosis, vascular endothelial dysfunction, has been identified. Endothelial function can be measured non-invasively using ultrasonography and plethysmography allowing the impact of risk factors to be assessed in vivo.Aim: To test the hypothesis that endothelial dysfunction occurs in the nephrotic syndrome primarily as a consequence of dyslipidaemia.Methods: A cross-sectional design was used to study vascular function of the peripheral circulation in 45 individuals: fifteen patients with nephrosis (NP), 15 control subjects with primary hyperlipidaemia (HL) and 15 normolipidaernic controls (NC). The groups were matched for age, gender and body mass index. The NP group and the HL group had similar serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations. High-resolution ultrasonography assessed endothelial function of the brachial artery. This non-invasive technique measured post- ischaemic flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and endothelium-independent vasodilatation in response to glyceryl trinitrate (GTNMD).

Learners were chosen purposefully from three academic levels-senior secondary school (Year-13, age range 17-18 years old), undergraduate (age range 19-21 years), and postgraduate (comprising MSc and PhD; age range 22- 27 years). The principal research goal was to establish learners' preferred mental models for the concept of chemical bonding. Other research goals were to establish if and how learners made use of analogy to understand chemical bonding and to establish the prevalence of learners' alternative conceptions for chemical bonding. The research inquiry was conducted from within a constructivist paradigm; specifically the researcher ascribed to a social and contextual constructivist belief system.Based on a review of the science education literature a decision was made to classify mental models into four classes according to the typology of Norman (1983), namely, the target system, a conceptual model, the users' or learners' mental model and the scientists' conceptualisation. A conceptual theme for the inquiry was developed based on this typology resulting in the identification of target systems-metallic, ionic and covalent bonding. Subsequently, target models for each of the three target systems were identified, namely, the sea of electrons model and the band theory for metallic bonding; the electrostatic model, and the theoretical electrostatic model for ionic bonding; and the octet rule, the valence bond approach, the molecular orbital theory and the ligand field theory for covalent bonding. A conceptual model, consisting of a summary of the salient points of the target models, was developed by the researcher.

The basic structure of all the arsenopyrite compositions studies, has been shown to be monoclinic P2(subscript)1/c, regardless of the variation in stoichiometry. An increase in the arsenic to sulfur ratio in the natural arsenopyrites was found to be associated with an increase in unit cell dimensions accompanied by expansions within the iron-centred octahedra along the [101] direction of the monoclinic cell and concommitant contractions of the octahedra in the (101) plane. There was no obvious relationship between variation in stoichiometry and structure of arsenopyrite which could provide information as to possible substitution of gold in its structure. However, atomic displacements caused by twinning or disorder, may help to incorporate gold.The synthesis of auriferous arsenopyrites showed that gold has to be in an ionic form to be taken up in the structure. The form of the gold species affects the distribution of gold in the structure, being chemically zoned when derived from a dichloro complex and more evenly distributed when derived from a hydrosulfido complex. It is suggested that rapid crystallisation, with resultant displacement faults along the b-axis, may contribute to higher concentrations of gold in the natural arsenopyrite structure. Electron probe microanalysis showed a possible slight iron-deficiency in some of the auriferous arsenopyrite grains analysed.

In terms of hardware, a large number of processors connected with high speed networks are put together to solve large scale computationally intensive applications. The computer performance improvements made so far have been based on technological developments. In terms of software, many algorithms are developed for application problem execution on parallel systems to achieve required performance. Clustering and scheduling of tasks for parallel implementation is a well researched problem. Several techniques have been studied to improve performance and reduce problem execution times. In this thesis, a new clustering and scheduling scheme, called flexible clustering and scheduling (FCS) algorithm is proposed. It is a novel approach where clustering and scheduling of tasks can be tuned to achieve maximal speedup or efficiency. The proposed scheme is based on the relation between the costs of computation and communication of task clusters. Vital system parameters such as processor speed, number of processors, and communication bandwidth affect speedup and efficiency. Processor speed and communication bandwidth vary from system to system. Most clustering and scheduling strategies do not take into account the system parameters. The low complexity FCS algorithm can adapt itself to suit different parallel computing platforms and it can also be tuned to suit bounded or unbounded number of processors. The analytical, simulation and experimental studies presented in this thesis validate the claims.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parallel processing, flexible clustering and allocation scheme.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=10493</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of FFT geoid determination techniques and their application to height determination using GPS in Australia.</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Kefei</field><field name="description">A new, high resolution, high precision and accuracy gravimetric geoid of Australia has been produced using updated data, theory and computational methodologies. The fast Fourier transform technique is applied to the computation of the geoid and terrain effects. The long, medium and short wavelength components of the geoid are determined from the OSU91A global geopotential model, 2'x2' (residual gravity anomalies in a 3 degrees cap and 1'x1' digital terrain model (DTM), respectively.Satellite altimeter gravity data have been combined with marine gravity data to improve the coverage of the gravity data, and thus the quality of the geoid. The best gridding procedure for gravity data has been studied and applied to the gravity data gridding. It is found that the gravity field of Australia behaves quite differently. None of the free-air, Bouguer or topographic-isostatic gravity anomalies are consistently the smoothest. The Bouguer anomaly is often rougher than the free-air anomaly and thus should be not used for gravity field gridding. It is also revealed that in some regions the topography often contains longer wavelength features than the gravity anomalies.It is demonstrated that the inclusion of terrain effects is crucial for the determination of an accurate gravimetric geoid. Both the direct and indirect terrain effects need to be taken into account in the precise geoid determination of Australia. The existing AUSGEOID93 could be in error up to 0.7m in terms of the terrain effect only. In addition, a series of formulas have been developed to evaluate the precision of the terrain effects. These formulas allow the effectiveness of the terrain correction and precision requirement for a given DTM to be studied.

Although curriculum development in mathematics in this State has been an ongoing process for at least two decades, the outcome of an extensive literature review conducted as part of the study revealed that only a cursory evaluation of the current upper school mathematics curriculum change process had ever been undertaken. Neither has any formal appraisal of the suitability or otherwise of the variety of new upper school mathematics courses introduced during the last decade ever been carried out.This study was designed to 'fill these gaps' by not only documenting the history of the change process, but also by seeking out teachers' and other educators' views about those curriculum and strategy changes as well as the views of the students who were so intimately involved in the process.Tertiary lecturers' perceptions regarding the mathematical preparedness of first year university students were also considered a relevant source of information in this quest to first, record the events that preceded the establishment of the current State mathematics curriculum, and second, record those events that occurred subsequently. Major reports which have influenced the direction of mathematics education were examined, and underlying didactical principles were identified to determine the origins of previous and current educational policy.To determine upper school mathematics teachers' attitudes to curriculum and strategy changes, and the impact of the present curriculum upon students' choice of mathematics subjects, use was made of a variety of instruments - questionnaires and interview proformas - which were used to interview students prior to questioning them on such matters as their reasons for selecting specific units.Upper school ++</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Western Australia, mathematics curriculum, secondary education.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=9514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between individual type, underachievement and the attributional motivation of secondary school science students : intervention approaches for underachievers.</field><field name="creator">Restall, Leonard J.</field><field name="description">Relationships between underachievement, individual type and attributional motivation were investigated among 37 underachieving senior science students from a boys' college, a girls' college and a coeducational college in New Zealand. An adaptation of the Myers-Briggs type inventory was used to identify individual type, and attributional motivation was determined by using two questionnaires, based upon attributional constructs established by Weiner (1979). Students in the sample were also interviewed. Results show a significant difference, too great to be attributed to a sampling fluctuation, between the observed number of students and the greater than expected number of students, particularly for the ESFJ (Extrovert-Sensing- Feeling-Judging) and ISFJ (Introvert-Sensing-Feeling-Judging) individual 'types' within the sample of underachieving students. A difference also was found between the observed number of Function Pairs, derived from the Myers-Briggs descriptions, and the expected number of Pairs within the sample. These differences were also too great to be attributed to a sampling fluctuation.A general lack of motivation was found among the students, with 'lack of effort' being attributed as a major cause of underachievement. Differences in attribution trends were found between different 'types'. Most of the students indicated that they were passive learners and generally were unaware of how to use metacognitive strategies to improve their learning and motivation.Implications from this research suggest that intervention approaches should be made by educators to improve accountability and reduce underachievement by students.

It is particularly suitable for investigating enacted premise and received practice contexts. A research design is applied in putting these paradigmatic assumptions into motion.

The process of change compelled a local industry with its own peculiarities to conform to standards imposed by central authorities with priorities which were not necessarily in harmony with local practice or custom.In part this was the result of the inexorable forces released by Federation. After the creation of the Commonwealth, there was no isolation for anyone from the Commonwealth government's powers to legislate change if it was deemed to be in the national interest. Power, therefore, would flow towards central authorities: for the shipowners and their stevedores this meant to a central organisation, the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour (AEWL); for the labourers it meant, eventually, to the national executive of the Waterside Workers Federation (WWF).The Commonwealth government had the power and the will to intervene in stevedoring when the national interest dictated. The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court started the process in 1914. The Commonwealth government in the War of 1914-18, in 1928, made further inroads into curtailing the levels of local autonomy. In the 1939-45 War the process was completed by the creation of government stevedoring industry commissions and boards. The final impact to local autonomy came in 1950 when the policies of a new conservative Commonwealth government forced the Fremantle Lumpers Union to seek the protection of a national union, the WWF.This thesis follows the path taken by the Fremantle stevedoring industry on its way to complete integration and absorption into the national port cargo-handling service.

However, research has shown that for many students, analogies engender misconceptions rather than scientists' science. It is believed that misconceptions arise when students reconstruct their knowledge within the context of their prior conceptions, and that misconceptions arise whenever the student has a different conception of the analog to the teacher or the student applies the analogy beyond its limits.The literature is richly endowed with descriptions of how it is thought that analogies generate meaning and contain a range of suggestions for improving classroom pedagogy when analogies are used. Five teaching models have been identified which claim to improve analogical instruction, and one of these, the teaching-with-analogies (TWA) model (Glynn, 1989) has been modified at the Science and Mathematics Education Centre of Curtin University for use in secondary science classrooms. To date, no empirical studies have been performed to determine the efficacy of this modified TWA model.This study set out to evaluate the modified TWA model in a qualitative interpretive manner by observing teachers, who had been in-serviced about the model, using analogies in their lessons. Data were generated from the verbatim transcripts of each teacher's in-class performance, each teacher's post-lesson interview and interviews with a number of the students who received the analogical instruction. The emergent data were interpreted from a constructivist perspective with attention being given to credibility, dependability and confirmability.The data derived from one teacher teaching four analogies to Year 8 and 10 science students were reported in this thesis.

This study also incorporates an examination of teacher attitudes towards Aboriginal students and culture with an ethnographic study as well as a qualitative survey of the attitudes of Aboriginal students towards school and the curriculum process.This thesis begins with an explanation for the choice of Aboriginal students and their experience at school as my research topic. Some autobiographical details of the author and my position on staff at school, 1994-97, then follows. A general background to Aboriginal Education and metropolitan senior high school is provided, with a specific discussion of the role of Aboriginal students and the place of Aboriginal Studies in the life of the school. A concise analysis of the secondary literature is then undertaken which provides, inter alia, a knowledge base for the 'ethnographic' interviews. The various strategies introduced in an attempt to improve the attendance and participation at school of Aboriginal students are then analysed, including an assessment of the success of the Aboriginal Studies programme.The next section focuses on the attitudes and actions of Aboriginal students and their teachers, giving a detailed account and appraisal of a series of interviews.My thesis then concludes by outlining some of the major factors influencing Aboriginal attendance and participation at school, as well as examining some of the key areas where Aboriginal education may be improved. My thesis does not purport to provide definitive answers to these issues, but rather points to an embryonic strategy for improvement, based upon the necessarily limited focus provided by this research.A ++</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high school, Western Australia, Aboriginal students, Nyungar, education.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=9561</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ozone concentration profile retrieval from ground-based high-resolution thermal infrared spectra.</field><field name="creator">Van Delst, Paul F.</field><field name="description">Simulations of the Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI), a ground-based, high-resolution infrared detection system, are used to produce retrieved atmospheric ozone concentration profiles.

Virtually no investigations have been reported into the learning environment of the secondary mathematics classroom.The study reported in this thesis focusses on the perceptions of 490 grade 9 mathematics students in 23 classrooms in 14 schools in Adelaide, South Australia. Students' perceptions of their mathematics learning environment were measured using a new classroom environment instrument which has been developed in both a Personal Form (which focusses on students' perceptions of their personal interaction with the learning environment) and a Class Form (which focusses on students' perceptions of the class's interactions with the learning environment).This study confirmed the reliability and validity of both forms of the new instrument in its use with this sample of students, and examined the differences between the Personal and the Class Forms of the instrument. The sub-populations of male and female students were also profiled and differences between their perceptions of the classroom learning environment were examined. Differences between students' perceptions of their teacher's interpersonal behaviour in the classroom were also explored.The study identified associations between students' perceptions of their mathematics classroom learning environment, their perceptions of their teacher's interpersonal behaviour, and student outcomes.

These genetic and ecological factors often act in concert to influence reproductive success and thus the ability of a species to maintain its presence in the community. Paramount among the array of factors influencing a species' fitness are mating system considerations and their interaction with ecological processes. Both mating systems and ecological processes are influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic forces that may operate synergistically to constrain pollen transfer, gametic union and the provisioning of progeny. Plants respond to these constraining forces, which typically vacillate, through mechanisms that minimise random effects while maximising the quality and quantity of progeny.Mating system values indicated that B. tricuspis is an obligate outbreeder. The extent to which populations of this Banksia indulged in mixed mating was associated with habitat disturbance and its impact on pollinators. A reduction in outcrossing in one disturbed population was ascribed to an increase in inbreeding promoted through pollinator/pollen limitation. Conversely, a reduction in the diversity of pollinator types which enhanced the opportunity for outbreeding was the favoured interpretation of elevated outcrossing in another disturbed population.Disparity in outcrossing among inflorescences was driven by pollinator/pollen limitation considerations. Inconsistency among outcrossing values between inflorescences was ascribed to incongruity in floral attractiveness and sympatric assortative pollinator/pollen limitations. Augmentation of the floral display, as inferred through greater inflorescence size and presentation height, was positively associated with maternal fecundity and progeny fitness.

Reducing the externality of Locus of Control is seen as an innovative means of addressing some behavioural aspects of A-D/HD.The study involved 77 A-D/HD boys with A-D/HD and 23 boys who were not A-D/HD, but who demonstrated similar levels of disruptive behaviours, from schools in Western Australia. Australian norms were established for the Locus of Control instrument (CNS-IE) using 300 male classmates of the participants.Each boy was assessed by parents and teachers on established measures of A-D/HD (the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Attention Deficit Disorders Evaluation Scale (ADDES)). The boys completed the CNS-IE both before and after the intervention. The boys with A-D/HD were medicated with Dexamphetamine or Ritalin, as prescribed by an appropriate medical practitioner.The association of A-D/HD diagnostic subtypes, (Predominantly Inattentive Type, Predominantly Hyperactive Type, Combined Type) with Locus of Control was also investigated.The results demonstrate that a significant (p &lt; 0.001) correlation exists between attention deficit (assessed by the two parallel measures, CBCL and ADDES) and Locus of Control.

That representation is to be achieved through the coupling of Expert System methods and Geographic Information Systems. Instead of representing resource information using entities such as soil types, defined by rigid boundaries on a map, a more fluid presentation is proposed. Individual resource attributes will be represented by surfaces that describe their probability of occurrence, at a number of levels, across a landscape. Such flexible representations, which are designed to better capture the mental models behind their creation, are capable of being combined and synthesised to answer a wide range of resource queries.An investigation of methods of knowledge representation in a number of fields of research, led to the belief that a Bayesian Network provides a representational calculus that is appropriate to the "fuzzy" and imprecise conceptual models used in resource assessment. The fundamental mathematical principles of such networks have been tailored to provide a representation that is in tune with the intuitive processes of a surveyor's thinking.Software has been written to demonstrate the method and tested on a variety of data sets from Australia and overseas. These tests and demonstrations have used a range of densities of knowledge and range of acuity in evidential data. In general the results accord with the mental models used as drivers.

These minerals are pyrite (FeS2), pyrrhotite (Fe1-nS, where n = 0 to 0.125), pentlandite ((FeNi)9S8) and violarite ( Ni2FeS4 ).The characteristic behaviour of these sulfides has been examined using Thermogravimetry-Differential Thermal Analysis (TG-DTA) under normal oxidation conditions ( l0&#186;C/min, air atmosphere). By increasing the heating rate to 40&#186;C/min and using an oxygen atmosphere, the tendency of the sulfides to ignite was established. Ignition was characterised by a highly exothermic reaction which occurred in association with a rapid mass loss over a short time span. Significant overheating of the samples beyond the temperature of the surroundings was observed. Pyrite, pyrrhotite and violarite all exhibited ignition behaviour while pentlandite did not.Using Isothermal Thermogravimetry (TG) the sulfides were subjected to shock heating conditions (heating rate = 3000-5000&#186;C/min, oxygen atmosphere) analogous to those which exist in an industrial flash smelter. The order of reactivity of the sulfides agreed with that observed during TG-DTA ignition trials. Even under these more intensely oxidising conditions pentlandite did not ignite. The effect of particle size on the ignition temperature was determined, larger particles igniting at a higher temperature. The magnitude of this effect varied according to the characteristics of the minerals.Products collected during Isothermal TG were examined by optical microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA). Using these techniques it was possible to establish the morphology of the products and hence, to propose mechanisms for the reaction of the four sulfide minerals under ignition conditions.In order to ++</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thermal analysis, characterisation of minerals, ignition reactions, flash smelting.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15923</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The information resource needs of undergraduate distance education students and the academic library's role in meeting these needs.</field><field name="creator">Vautier, Lynne Margaret</field><field name="description">This research examines the reading and information needs of undergraduate distance education students at Curtin University of Technology and the academic library's role in meeting those needs. Twelve undergraduate units offered at Curtin in second semester were selected as the prime units of this research. The research was conducted in three phases in 1996. First, the documents supplied to the distance education students were examined to determine what reading was specified and/or suggested to the students. Next, the unit co-ordinators responsible for the units were interviewed to find out what reading and information literacy expectations they held for their distance education students. Finally, the non-metropolitan area students enrolled in the units were interviewed to find out if they felt they could complete the units using only supplied readings and prescribed texts. They were also asked about obtaining resources through Curtin University Library and Information Service or other sources. Their use of telecommunications and computers was also examined.This research found there were as many models of the practice of distance education as there were units surveyed. There was a high degree of agreement between the unit co-ordinators and students on the possibility of completing their associated units using only the supplied reading plus the textbooks. The students could not complete their units using only the supplied reading but many could successfully complete units using the supplied reading and set texts.Although all students were using computers there was a significant difference in the number of students that had access to a computer linked to telecommunications and the number of students that were using this access.

The objectives of the research were: (1) to conduct an impact evaluation of the Programme; (2) to explore and develop the conceptual and theoretical bases of mentoring; and (3) to identify sources of stress anticipated and experienced by new graduates in their transition into the profession. This evaluative research represents the first report in the research literature to date in which a group mentoring programme of this kind has been evaluated using a quasi-experimental research design. The population comprised all graduates in librarianship from the two Western Australian universities offering these courses in 1996. Subjects in the experimental group were self-selected, and the remainder of the population made up the comparison group.

In lessening these adverse effects, the manufacturing industry continually seeks to develop machining techniques incorporating liquid-less (dry) methods or environmentally benign coolants. Air-jet cooling is widely regarded as a viable alternative for liquid coolants in machining processes. This thesis proposes a novel air jet cooling arrangement, and assesses its thermal effectiveness and operational compatibility for specific requirements in metal cutting operation. For tests, steel rods were machined on a standard lathe workbench at selected cutting depth, feed and speed. Type 1040 steel, which is commonly used in automobile industry, was chosen as work piece material. Instead of traditional liquid coolant, a specially designed compressed air jet is used to dissipate heat generation in the cutting zone at the tool tip. The tool tip is presented orthogonally to the work piece to maintain conformity with relevant established cutting tool theories. A special air jet configuration based on a Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube was designed and developed for cooling the cutting zone and tool tip. The tool tip temperatures were measured by installing thermocouples at strategic locations on the tool piece and recorded on a data-logger for a range of cutting depths, feeds and speeds. The cutting power was measured with a power meter attached to the electrical power supply to the lathe. For comparison purposes, tests were also conducted with conventional single-nozzle air jets in place of the vortex-tube jets, using traditional liquid coolant and without any cooling applied to the tool tip.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">liquid coolants, metal machining, chemical carcinogens, health risks, machine operators, waste disposal, environment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns of absence of compulsory age students : a retrospective study.</field><field name="creator">Ioannakis, Irene</field><field name="description">This study focusses on the examination of the recorded absences of compulsory age students. The main purpose was to identify emergent patterns of school non-attendance, critical periods of absences and key factors within and beyond the school that might contribute to school non-attendance and the impact such non-attendance has on student achievement and perceptions of schooling.A review of literature on school non-attendance was undertaken and presented to highlight the number of factors that are often linked with non-attendance. As a result of the literature review a comprehensive list of factors for further investigation was distilled and a conceptual framework was developed. It was this conceptual framework, together with the research questions, that guided the research design and the subsequent collection and analysis of data.The research was undertaken in Perth, Western Australia utilising one State Government secondary school and five of its contributory (or feeder) primary schools.

Conventional method, steam reforming, though still dominant, requires a considerately high capital investment and an intensive energy input. Reforming natural gas by partial oxidation, potentially one of the most attractive alternatives, has been investigated vigorously for decades, mainly focusing on looking for suitable catalyst and understanding of the mechanisms of methane partial oxidation. This work focuses on the feasibility of methane partial oxidation reforming from gas phase reaction under fuel-rich conditions.Firstly, a detailed thermodynamic analysis has been conducted, which covers a broad range of operation conditions of temperature up to 2073 K, pressure up to 100 atm and initial O(subscript)2/CH(subscript)4 ratio of 0 to 2.5. It has been found that high syn-gas (H(subscript)2 and CO) yields can be achieved when the temperature is above 1073 K and the initial O(subscript)2/CH(subscript)4 ratio close to 0.5. High pressure is not favoured. However, high temperatures can suppress the effect of high pressures.Carbon deposition, a crucially important factor in methane partial oxidation, is mainly examined by means of thermodynamic analysis. Solid carbon was identified the major carbon deposition form, which could severely happen if the initial O(subscript)2/CH(subscript)4 ratio is less than 0.5. This feature was also indirectly proven during the experimental tests.Secondly, a series of CHEMKIN simulations were performed using various CH(subscript)4 oxidation reaction mechanisms. The general trend of the CH(subscript)4 partial oxidation reforming was revealed by simulations using the GRI, NIST and Konnov mechanisms.

The software was designed and constructed by the author and incorporated sixteen digital video clips, primarily focussing on projectile motion, showing difficult, expensive, time-consuming or dangerous demonstrations of mostly real-life, out-of-classroom scenarios. The program used predict-observe-explain (POE) strategy to structure the students' engagement with each scenario-the clips acting as stimuli for the sixteen POE tasks. This strategy involves students predicting the outcome of a demonstration and discussing the reasons for their prediction, observing the demonstration and finally explaining any discrepancies between their prediction and observation (White &amp; Gunstone, 1992). The choice and sequence of the video clips, as well as the multiple-choice options available to students in the prediction phase of each task, were informed by alternative conception research and the history of science literature.This interpretive study uses constructivism as a theoretical perspective to explore three main issues relating to the use of the multimedia-supported POE tasks: firstly, the students' learning conversations during their use of the POE tasks; secondly, the use of the program as an instrument to probe students' science conceptions; and thirdly,' the affordances and constraints of the computer-mediated environment for the POE strategy.

The study is divided into two phases. In the first phase, the factors influencing science program delivery are identified through (1) a questionnaire survey of 122 teachers in the Central Districts of New Zealand; (2) a questionnaire survey of 155 pre-service teachers at a New Zealand College of Education; (3) a case study of a large intermediate school in the Central Districts; and (4) a review of the research literature pertaining to curriculum, in particular primary science, delivery. Factors influencing science program delivery are identified as being both personal (intrinsic) and environmental (extrinsic). Intrinsic factors identified include teacher professional self-efficacy; interest and motivation; and multidimensional aspects of knowledge. Extrinsic factors influencing science program delivery include multidimensional aspects of time availability and resource adequacy; the availability and adequacy of professional support and leadership; and the priority placed on science as a curriculum area by the school, especially by the administration. The second phase of the study built on this initial phase by focusing on the development of an instrument, the Science Curriculum Implementation Questionnaire, which assists schools in identifying factors influencing science program delivery. The development of the SC1Q initially involved the use of a Focus Group to identify and prioritise items to include in the instrument.

Despite this, there is a paucity of research evaluating the effectiveness of participatory ergonomics in reducing occupational injury outcomes. In particular, a review of the literature fails to identify research that reports a change in the risk of injury at the level of the individual worker. The objectives of this study were to determine whether a participatory ergonomics approach to the control of workplace hazards and manual hazards in particular, could reduce the occurrence and severity of injury among a working population at risk.The research design was that of a longitudinal pre-post intervention study, with one intervention and three comparison groups. The observational period between 1 July 1988 and the 31 October 1995, comprised a 4.3 year pre-intervention period and a 3- year post-intervention period. The Intervention Group was a population of hospital cleaners at a high risk of injury. Three comparison groups were used, namely orderlies from the same hospital, cleaners from a similar hospital, and all the cleaners in the State of Western Australia. The primary outcome measure of occurrence was that of a lost- time injury (LTI).To obtain parameters of injury severity, each LTI was measured in terms of the associated CP1-adjusted workers' compensation claim cost and the number of hours lost from work (duration). The data were obtained three years after the observational period, to improve the likelihood that the claims had been finalised. Aggregate level LTI data were obtained for all four groups. Individual-level data were also obtained for the Intervention Group and the Orderly Services Group, whether injured or not.

While standards do not explicitly refer to constructivist learning theory, they are entirely consistent with the view that knowledge is a human construction, learning is based on prior knowledge, and students respond to their environment to build new understandings. Paralleling the NSES reforms, with their constructivist underpinnings, there is also a strong and often contradictory pressure on teachers to prepare students for national and state standardised tests. The need for teachers to balance these competing demands while trying to teach for understanding sets the context for this research.The purpose of this research has been to focus on "how" teachers determine students' understanding and "why" they employ the instructional and assessment strategies that they do. Interpretive case studies of five teacher participants from one school district are used to describe how these teachers teach for understanding in the face of the competing pressures of conforming to the NSES and preparing students for success on standardised multiple-choice achievement tests. These case studies are analysed to identify common themes and propositions about teaching for understanding.The teachers in this study used a variety of instructional and assessment strategies. Their choices of strategies made a difference in the degree of understanding that their students achieved. Frequently, the teachers' decisions were affected by their grasp of science concepts and ideas about how students learned.

In addition, the study aimed to discover whether, and to what extent, children and adolescents at risk of DCD experience more trait and state anxiety than their peers. Fifty-eight children aged 8- to 10-years identified as being at risk of DCD were matched with 58 control children on age and gender, and fifty-one adolescents aged 12- to 14-years at risk of DCD group were matched with 51 control adolescents. Children and adolescent at risk of DCD were compared to the control group on measures of perceived competence, perceived control, perceived social support, self-worth and anxiety. Multivariate Analysis of Variance revealed that children and adolescents at risk of DCD performed significantly more poorly than the control group on measures of perceived competence, perceived control, perceived social support, self-worth and state and trait anxiety. In addition, significant differences were found on some measures for age, whilst only the self-perception profile differentiated gender.Based on the assumption that children and adolescents with poor motor coordination do have negative views of self and experience relatively high levels of anxiety, a second aim of the study was to test an aetiological model of anxiety. Harters (1987) model of the determinants of self-worth provided a sound theoretical basis for investigating the relationships between self-perceptions and affect.

These authors established that the odour, variously described as "swampy", "sewage" or "cooked vegetable" was caused by dimethyltrisulfide (DMTS) which has an odour threshold concentration of 10 nanograms per litre (ng/L). Investigations described in the present Thesis extend the work of Wajon and co-workers in attempting to establish the origin and cause of DMTS formation in Perth drinking water distribution systems.The DMTS problem appeared to be confined to water originating from a particular type of groundwater, specifically groundwater sourced from shallow, unconfined aquifers, which contain relatively high concentrations of sulfide, dissolved natural organic matter (NOM) and dissolved iron. DMTS was not present in the groundwater, but only formed in the distribution system, after treatment of groundwater via alum coagulation-filtration and oxidation processes. One objective of the present work was to determine the reasons for the observed association between DMTS formation and this specific groundwater type. A primary focus was to investigate the chemistry and biochemistry of sulfur species and NOM which might act as precursors to DMTS. The work was driven by the view that increased understanding of the problem might lead to more effective and acceptable treatment solutions than those presently in use.The observation that DMTS forms in distributed water that originates from groundwater, but not in water from surface sources has led to the hypothesis that groundwater NOM may contain precursor(s) to DMTS For example, it was proposed that methyl esters and ethers within humic substances might be a source of methyl groups that ++</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dimethylpolysulfides,  groundwater,  Perth (Western Australia), drinking water distribution.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12576</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Graphs that are critical with respect to matching extension and diameter</field><field name="creator">Ananchuen, Nawarat</field><field name="description">Let G be a simple connected graph on 2n vertices with a perfect matching. For 1 &#8804; k &#8804; n - 1, G is said to be k-extendable if for every matching M of size k in G there is a perfect matching in G containing all the edges of M. A k-extendable graph G is said to be k-critical (k-minimal) if G+uv (G-uv) is not k-extendable for every non-adjacent (adjacent) pair of vertices u and v of G. The problem that arises is that of characterizing k-extendable, k-critical and k-minimal graphs.In Chapter 2, we establish that &#948;(G) &#8805; 1/2(n + k) is a sufficient condition for a bipartite graph G on 2n vertices to be k-extendable. For a graph G on 2n vertices with &#948;(G) &#8805; n + k 1, n - k even and n/2 &#8804; k &#8804; n - 2, we prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for G to be k-extendable is that its independence number is at most n - k.

For k = n - 1 and n - 2, we completely characterize k-extendable graphs on 2n vertices. We conclude Chapter 2 with a variation of the concept of extendability to odd order graphs.In Chapter 3, we establish a number of properties of k-critical graphs.

Consequently, project managers may encounter difficulty in being &#8216;recognised&#8217; by employers and moving from one professional discipline to another. The current research examines knowledge areas applied &#8216;in the field&#8217; by project managers (PMs), and provides them with knowledge about the constancy of application of project theories; further, a new model of what constitutes PM and enables flexibility for PMs is suggested. As there was little extant literature about PMs being able to transfer from one professional discipline to another, or to what degree different knowledge areas were applied, it was determined that exploratory research was appropriate. The results strongly indicate that organisations that rely on programs and projects to support the delivery of their strategic objectives will benefit from implementation of the project management revised hypothetical model (Figure 13). The model incorporates the nine knowledge areas of The Project Management Institute (USA) and six knowledge areas extracted from the PM methodology PRINCE2. Further, the additional focus of People Specific Management (PSM) at Level 3 of the revised hypothetical model (Figure 13) is recommended. Qualifications for PMs do make a difference! In addition to demonstrating the importance of PM qualifications to augment PM&#8217;s successful transfer across disciplines, further research is suggested regarding the need for training to be &#8216;compulsory&#8217; and follow the developmental levels described in the up-to-date model developed during the research (Figure 13).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">project management, project managers, technical training, theories on project processes, transferability, knowledge, Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=21429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A software based mentor system</field><field name="creator">Marriott, Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the architecture, implementation issues and evaluation of Mentor - an educational support system designed to mentor students in their university studies. Students can ask (by typing) natural language questions and Mentor will use several educational paradigms to present information from its Knowledge Base or from data-mined online Web sites to respond. Typically the questions focus on the student&#8217;s assignments or in their preparation for their examinations. Mentor is also pro-active in that it prompts the student with questions such as "Have you started your assignment yet?". If the student responds and enters into a dialogue with Mentor, then, based upon the student&#8217;s questions and answers, it guides them through a Directed Learning Path planned by the lecturer, specific to that assessment. The objectives of the research were to determine if such a system could be designed, developed and applied in a large-scale, real-world environment and to determine if the resulting system was beneficial to students using it. The study was significant in that it provided an analysis of the design and implementation of the system as well as a detailed evaluation of its use. This research integrated the Computer Science disciplines of network communication, natural language parsing, user interface design and software agents, together with pedagogies from the Computer Aided Instruction and Intelligent Tutoring System fields of Education. Collectively, these disciplines provide the foundation for the two main thesis research areas of Dialogue Management and Tutorial Dialogue Systems. The development and analysis of the Mentor System required the design and implementation of an easy to use text based interface as well as a hyper- and multi-media graphical user interface, a client-server system, and a dialogue management system based on an extensible kernel. The multi-user Java-based client-server system used Perl-5 Regular Expression pattern matching for Natural Language Parsing along with a state-based Dialogue Manager and a Knowledge Base marked up using the XML-based Virtual Human Markup Language. The kernel was also used in other Dialogue Management applications such as with computer generated Talking Heads. The system also enabled a user to easily program their own knowledge into the Knowledge Base as well as to program new information retrieval or management tasks so that the system could grow with the user. The overall framework to integrate and manage the above components into a usable system employed suitable educational pedagogies that helped in the student&#8217;s learning process. The thesis outlines the learning paradigms used in, and summarises the evaluation of, three course-based Case Studies of university students&#8217; perception of the system to see how effective and useful it was, and whether students benefited from using it.

The above results confirm that both organisational culture and internal corporate governance are positively related to performance, but are not statistically significant. This weak linkage to performance is contested with the mixed results identified in Western countries and may be explained by the different construct definition and measurement methods applied in the various studies. There is a need to look at the longitudinal view of the relationship of the constructs in future research to provide fresh evidence and also to reveal the extent to which the new concept of internal corporate governance has been embraced by corporate officers over time.

Without these constraints, the shortest path problem can be solved in polynomial time; with them, the CSPP is NP-hard and thus far no polynomial-time algorithms exist for solving it optimally. The problem arises in a number of practical situations. In the case of vehicle path planning, the vehicle may be an aircraft flying through a region with obstacles such as mountains or radar detectors, with an upper bound on the fuel consumption, the travel time or the risk of attack. The vehicle may be a submarine travelling through a region with sonar detectors, with a time or risk budget. These problems all involve a network which is a discrete model of the physical domain. Another example would be the routing of voice and data information in a communications network such as a mobile phone network, where the constraints may include maximum call delays or relay node capacities. This is a problem of current economic importance, and one for which time-sensitive solutions are not always available, especially if the networks are large. We consider the simplest form of the problem, large grid networks with a single side constraint, which have been studied in the literature. This thesis explores the application of Constraint Programming combined with Lagrange Relaxation to achieve optimal or near-optimal solutions of the CSPP. The following is a brief outline of the contribution of this thesis. Lagrange Relaxation may or may not achieve optimal or near-optimal results on its own. Often, large duality gaps are present.

A third purpose was to examine students' attitude to their courses on three specific scales, namely, Satisfaction, Difficulty and Speed. A sample of 504 students and24 instructors from Canada and the Australian Capital Territory completed the CUCEI. The students also responded to an attitudinal questionnaire. Statistical analysis confirmed the reliability of the CUCEI. The Cronbach alpha reliability figures, using the individual student as the unit of analysis, ranged from 0.73 to 0.93 and from 0.76 to 0.94 for the actual and preferred versions respectively. Good alpha reliability figures were also apparent for instructor versions, ranging from 0.72 to 0.90 for the actual version and from 0.72 to 0.93 for the preferred version. When the two levels were compared, students at the higher level had a less favourable perception of their learning environment. Hardly any difference in perceptions was seen in the learning environment between male and female students. There were significant differences in the perceptions of the classroom environment by mature students. Mature students perceived task orientation and equity more favourably than did younger students. Senior secondary students were generally more satisfied with their science courses than post secondary students. There was no difference in their attitude to the speed of delivery of science courses.

Inherent in this assessment process was the interpretation of multispectral data collected by several medium resolution satellite systems and evaluation of the quality of the resulting change information. Each dataset was acquired for a single date and classified at two levels of detail using standard classification algorithms. The optimum classification approach for each date was identified and the changes in land cover evaluated in several ways. The contribution of spatial and thematic errors and their propagation through the analysis process was investigated.Data for this research were acquired over an area approximately 4.5 km square located in the southern metropolitan area of Perth, Western Australia. At the time of the initial data acquisition in 1972 the area was predominantly rural and comprised mostly dense pine plantations, however by the final stages of data acquisition in 1991, the area was almost completely given over to urban residential land use. Changes were interpreted from classified Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and SPOT (System Pour l'Observation de la Terre) High Resolution Visible (HRV) multispectral data, and were compared to reference maps compiled from medium scale aerial photographs. The geometric properties of high resolution panchromatic IRS1-D data were also evaluated to test the geometric potential of high resolution satellite data.Supervised and unsupervised classification algorithms were used for derivation of land cover maps from each multispectral dataset at two levels of detail.

These classes were taught an energy-related module by the researcher. In the preliminary phase, which involved two classes, resources were developed to produce a more student-centred module. These resources, and the constructivist approach which informed their development, are described. In the subsequent comparative phase, the reformed module was taught using two contrasting strategies - one teacher-directed and the other, student-managed. During this phase individual achievement and group investigative skills were assessed. Student perceptions of classroom environment were probed using an existing instrument, the ICEQ. The range of classroom activity and level of student engagement was continuously monitored by independent observers using a specifically developed instrument, termed the SALTA.No overall learning advantage was demonstrated to either teaching strategy. A small strategy advantage favouring Year 10 students in the student-managed strategy was offset by a similar disadvantage to the Year 9 cohort. A cohort penalty was found to apply to Year 9 students under either strategy, with a paradox in its application. The role of the teacher was found to change significantly under each strategy, with a consistent hierarchy of student engagement with activity emerging. Boys were found to have significantly higher levels of engagement than girls under either teaching strategy. However, this was associated with only modest advantages in achievement.

These adverse outcomes are problematic for both the patient and the nurse. Specifically, site-pain causes the patient discomfort and bruising limits possible sites for subsequent injections. It is important that nurses use an injection technique that minimises the incidence of adverse outcomes when administering subcutaneous heparin injections. This study examines the effect of duration of subcutaneous heparin injection on site-pain intensity and bruise size experienced by a group of patients being treated with heparin for ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attacks.A quasiexperimental design with subjects serving as their own control was used to address the study objectives. The independent variable was the duration of the injection and the dependent variables were site-pain and bruise size. A convenience sample of 34 subjects receiving 5000 units of a subcutaneous Fragmin injection twice a day were recruited from a large teaching hospital. Subjects rated the level of perceived site-pain intensity during injection using the vertical Visual Analogue Scale. Injection-site bruising was measured at 48 and 60 hours after injection. Data were analysed using the Wilcoxon Sign-Rank test. Results indicated that injection technique B (30-second injection duration) resulted in significantly less intense site-pain during administering the injection and fewer and smaller bruises.The findings of this study indicate that injecting subcutaneous heparin over a longer duration may reduce injection site-pain and bruising.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">subcutaneous heparin injection, bruising, pain.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=9868</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of organic fouling agents on activated carbon by evolved gas analysis.</field><field name="creator">Fisher, Nicholas G.</field><field name="description">Activated carbon is widely used in the gold processing industry as an adsorbent for the gold cyanide complex, [Au(CN)(subscript)2]. However, many other processing reagents are also adsorbed (termed fouling), which compete with the gold cyanide complex for active sites on the carbon. So far the only way of assessing the amount of fouling due to organic compounds that has adsorbed on the carbon is through the use of thermogravimetry (TG). Unfortunately, thermogravimetry only gives the percentage total of organic fouling agents adsorbed and no information can be obtained on the identity of the individual organic fouling agents. Thus this current work reports the development of analytical methods capable of identifying specific fouling agents.In this thesis the identification of two types of common organic fouling agents adsorbed on activated carbon during gold processing has been established using three thermal analysis techniques, namely thermal desorption-pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-py-GC-MS), thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry (TG-MS), and thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared (TG-FTIR) spectroscopy. TD-py-GC-MS was used to identify the individual decomposition gases of each sample. TG-MS and TG-FTIR were used to obtain the decomposition temperatures of the fouling agents, and to identify/monitor the gases evolved as a function of temperature. All analyses were performed in an inert atmosphere.The organic fouling agents studied were xanthates and frothing agents, which are used as flotation reagents. The xanthates studied were sodium ethyl xanthate (SEX), sodium isobutyl xanthate (SiBX), potassium ethyl xanthate (PEX), and potassium amyl xanthate (PAX).

However, it has its draw-backs when subsets of observations are jointly influential and offset each other's influence. Another approach is local influence proposed by Cook (1986).The local influence methodology of Cook (1986) is based on the curvature of the likelihood displacement surface formed by model/data perturbations. Wu and Luo (1993a, 1993b) further developed the idea and proposed the study of the perturbation-formed surface of a variable by evaluating the curvature of the surface in addition to its maximum slope. This thesis utilizes the local influence approach to develop influence diagnostic methods for four different topics.Firstly, we proposed a stepwise confirmatory procedure for the detection of multiple outliers in two-way contingency tables. The procedure begins with the identification of a reliable set of candidate outliers by evaluating the derivatives of the perturbation-formed surface of the Pearson goodness-of-fit statistic. An adding-back iterative algorithm is then applied to the candidate set to assess their relative discordancy. Using two real data sets, the proposed procedure is shown to be less susceptible to both masking and swamping problems than residual based measures. In a Monte Carlo study, the local influence diagnostics are also found to outperform standard residual-based methods in terms of efficiency and other criteria.Transformations of covariates are commonly applied in regression analysis. When a parametric transformation family is used, the maximum likelihood estimate of the transformation parameter is often sensitive to minor perturbations of the data.

Although its use is widespread in educational and clinical settings, some nurse clinicians display negative attitudes towards the use of the nursing process. They claim that both the structure and language that underpins this process is cumbersome and unreflective of the way in which nursing care is planned and delivered. To date, there has been no study cited that has examined its use within a clinical setting and determined if and how the nursing process is being used and whether there is substance in the clinicians' claims. Additionally, some of the research on problem solving has used laboratory based designs that are limited as they are not sensitive to contextual factors that affect the use of a problem solving process, nor are they sensitive to the efficacy of the communication process. As patient care involves many nurses working under diverse contextual conditions, these factors need to be taken into consideration when studying this phenomenon.Using grounded theory methodology, this study examined the clinical application of the nursing process in acute care hospital settings. Specifically, it sought to answer the following two questions: (1) How is the nursing process used by nurse clinicians in acute care hospital settings? and in the absence of its use, (2) How is nursing care determined, delivered, and communicated in acute care hospital settings in Western Australia?Data were obtained from semi-structured interviews with predominantly nurse clinicians, patients, and patients' relatives, as well as participant field observations of nurse clinicians, and in-depth audits of patient records.

Additional and related purposes were to determine whether more advanced chemistry students, for example, junior college (Grade 11 and 12) students, undergraduates and graduate trainee-teachers have a better understanding of basic qualitative analysis than secondary students, and to develop appropriate teaching strategies and materials on qualitative analysis based on the findings of this study and a review of the literature on practical work.The results from the administration of the diagnostic instrument showed that Singapore Grade 10 students had many alternative conceptions related to qualitative analysis, and these were grouped under the headings of 'Displacement', 'Redox', 'Dissolution', 'Addition of acid' and 'Heating'. The cross-age study showed that the more advanced chemistry students generally had a better understanding of basic qualitative analysis but had similar alternative conceptions as the Grade 10 students. However, the alternative conceptions identified were consistently held by only a small number of students across all contexts examined in the diagnostic instrument, suggesting that a number of students either had more than one conception for a particular concept or no conceptions at all. The results from the trial of the qualitative analysis teaching package indicated that the teaching package was feasible.

Spradley's (1979) ethnographic method was utilised to investigate the meaning of lay care, the lived experiences of 10 individuals who had suffered a stroke and their family caregivers in caring for the sick person at home.The meanings and perceptions of self-care from the individuals' and their families' perspectives, were explored, including the practices and cultural issues relating to care at home. The data collection was undertaken over a 10 month period in Songkla Province, southern Thailand. The major sources of data were the transcripts of semi-structured informal interviews, focus group discussions, field notes of participant observations and interviews with other individuals who were knowledgeable of health services and cultural issues relating to care and treatment in the community.Data analysis revealed a number of themes related to family relationships, and home and community care. These themes included the lived experience at both home and healing centres, experiences with change and loss after the stroke and coping with these, perceptions of care-receiving and caregiving, scope of the family's responsibilities in the caregiving role, caregiving burden, factors influencing the quality of care and the recipient's satisfaction with care. Other themes related to support and health services: Western and traditional medicine, social networks and religion. These themes were discussed from three perspectives: the individual, the family and community resources.The results of the study support the concept of interdependence of family members, and to a lesser extent their wider social network, in health and illness.

The necessity that students to be prepared for life and work in a computer technology based society is widely acknowledged and has highlighted the importance of computer literacy in the high school curriculum. While the definition of computer literacy varies widely, this study defined computer literacy in terms of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes required to use computers to facilitate the completion of necessary tasks presently associated with life and required to enhance perceptions of the future use of computers. If schools are to achieve the aim of encouraging students to use computers to help them solve problems and complete tasks, it is important that educators know the factors which affect this use. This study involved an investigation of: student-computer interaction; the development of knowledge, attitudes and skills associated with computer use; and the present and perceived future utilization of computer technology.A variety of data were collected from a Year 8 class which was observed for a year as it participated in a computer literacy course. The data sources were: classroom observation; student interviews at the beginning and end of the course; an attitudes questionnaire; a background questions sheet; and student mathematics and computing class grades. In addition, to test assertions which emerged during the study, a group of Year 12 students was interviewed and data were collected from four Year 8 students who were given experience on a more state-of-the-art computer system than those used by the computer literacy class.

Data were collected from three separate surveys conducted over a 15 month period from September 1984 to December 1985. The first survey, a National Workforce survey, provided a profile of the demographic and employment characteristics of the dietetic profession in Australia. The second survey was undertaken to determine the role of the dietitian as perceived by dietitians themselves and in the third survey a group of general practitioners was surveyed to determine what they perceived to be the role of the dietitian and to what extent they utilised the services of dietitians.Results of the surveys suggest that dietitians in Australia are not realising their full potential contribution to health care. Firstly, there are too few dietitians in Australia and it is unlikely, despite the best intentions, that the profession will be able to meet consumer need and demand for nutritional care and education. There was considerable disparity between what dietitians considered to be their ideal role versus their actual role. Role disparity among dietitians was highest for professional development, education and research activities and low or moderate for nutritional care activities. A lack of time was most frequently cited as the major deterrent preventing dietitians performing activities which they perceived to be part of their ideal role.The results of the third survey indicated that in general, the doctors surveyed had favourable opinions of dietitians but that they held rather traditional views of the role of the dietitian, expecting them to be more involved in food preparation and service than dietitians expected to be.

In this procedure, aqueous quaternary alkylammonium hydroxides are made to react with a wide range of complex molecular species, including synthetic and natural polymers, under high temperature flash heating conditions. The hydrolysis products are converted to derivatives, such as alkyl esters or alkyl ethers. The reaction forms the basis for a modified pyrolysis gas chromatography (Py-GC) identification technique. Although the process is primarily intended for the rapid identification of polymers which are susceptible to hydrolysis, it is also valuable for characterisation of a variety of hydrolysable lower molecular weight species, such as polymer additives, triglycerides and natural waxes.The reaction takes place when an intimate mixture of an aqueous quaternary alkylammonium hydroxide solution is flash heated with the analyte in a conventional pyrolysis unit, and "on-line" GC-MS is used to separate and identify the reaction products. Analytes included synthetic polyester resins and phenolic polymers, natural products such as lipids and wood extractives, and natural polymers including lignocellulose, proteins and kerogen.Reaction variables, such as temperature, pH analyte particle size, substrate, and the derivatising reagent were studied, in order to find the optimum conditions for the reaction. While the reaction occurs at temperatures as low as 358 degrees celsius, a 770 degrees celsius reaction temperature was adopted to allow direct comparison with Py-GC data.

Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) has been commercially produced with this technology since the early 1980s and it appears that the process also has application for Ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) and other ethers. However, the combination of reaction and distillation in a single unit operation produces a process complexity that inhibits expeditious design and tight control, and presents a technology risk for potential developers. This particularly applies to hybrid reactive distillation where both reactive and non-reactive column sections are employed.The steady state simulation of a series of reactive distillation columns and processes for the production of ETBE and MTBE illuminated a number of important issues related to the optimal design techniques. Many of these issues are peculiar to reactive distillation and would not reasonably be anticipated without a priori knowledge of the phenomena involved. For example, the addition of theoretical equilibrium stages and an increase in the reflux ratio do not always have a directionally equivalent effect. The trade-off between energy consumption and capital cost which is the basis for most distillation designs cannot always be applied to reactive distillation. Importantly, the use of standard modelling techniques for equilibrium processes was also validated for reactive distillation design.The use of residue curve diagrams and reactive residue curve diagrams for the design of reactive distillation processes was investigated and shown to provide useful information regarding the feasibility of reaction-separations. Combined with simulation tools (e.g. Pro/II and SpeedUp), these techniques form the basis of a proposed design strategy for hybrid reactive distillation.

Two groups of students in a school were followed simultaneously, a junior cohort through Years 8 to 10 and a senior cohort through Years 10 to 12. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from 20 students; five girls and five boys from each cohort. A strong positive relationship was found between changes in students' interest and enjoyment and changes in their motivation, and both these variables increased, in an overall sense for the combined student population, during the study period. All students generally held a high perception of both the normality of scientists and the importance of science in society throughout the study period.

It examines this cultural phenomenon from eight angles: the outlaw hero as constructed by history, literature and folklore; outlaws constructed as archetypal heroes; social and cultural contexts; outlaw heroes and revolution; a comparative case study of outlaws in Northeast China and Australia; underground cultural products (the "lore" and 'law"); ballads and proverbs reflecting values of outlaw heroism; and the fate of outlaws and the outlaw hero.Historical and folkloric explanatory frameworks are applied to outlaw hero traditions. Archetypal outlaw heroes and their successors, praised or criticised, are all constructed through a long process which combines reality recreated and fiction made real. Characteristics of archetypal outlaw heroes are inherited by later outlaws in China and the West. Though there are common codes and values of outlaw heroes in China and the West, different attributes are manifested in their attitudes towards brotherhood, organisation and women, and also in bandit sources and bandit categories.Western outlaw heroes are seldom involved in revolution, but their Chinese counterparts are connected with the Taiping revolutionary movement, the republican revolution and the Communist revolution. Some Communists are no more than outlaw heroes in the eyes of the poor and bandits in the eyes of the Kuomintang However, the alliance between outlaw heroes and revolutionaries is a fragile one.Northeast China and Australia have some parallels in their outlaw hero traditions. Convicts and immigrants play an important part in frontier banditry. The environment of both provides fertile soil for banditry and immigration.

This involves building systems which learn to recognise patterns from the content of unconstrained data such as handwritten schematic symbols, photographic, and video images.The efficiency of spatial interpretation systems is measured not only in terms of their ability to learn to classify patterns, but their computational complexity and capacity to accommodate different patterns. This is reflected in the ease of human factors involved in the interactive process of inputting and manipulating training patterns, particularly if large numbers of patterns are used.This thesis focuses on the theoretical and procedural issues involved in applying machine learning to computer vision for efficient spatial interpretation. Two different approaches to evidential learning are consolidated in how they apply to generalising relational data structures. Relational Evidence Theory integrates information theoretic methods from, decision trees with graph matching methods from constraint interpretation. It offers an evidence-based framework for evaluating and updating relational representations suitable for spatial applications.A new algorithm is developed, Rulegraphs, which combines graph matching with rule-based approaches from machine learning. This algorithm reduces of the cardinality of the graph matching problem by replacing pattern parts by rules. Rulegraphs not only reduce the search space but, also improve the uniqueness of the matching process. The system is demonstrated for difficult two-dimensional pattern recognition and three-dimensional object recognition problems.

For convenience, attention is restricted to the first-order stationary autoregressive (AR(1)) model in which the response random variables are subject to right-censoring. In their present form, currently available methods of estimation in regression analysis with censored autocorrelated data, which includes the MLE, are applicable only if the errors of the AR component of the model are Gaussian. Use of these methods in AR processes with non-Gaussian errors requires, essentially, rederivations of the estimators. Hence, in this thesis, we propose new estimators which arerobust in the sense that they can be applied with minor or no modifications to AR models with non-Gaussian. We propose three estimators, two of which the form of the distribution of the errors needs to be specified. The third estimator is a distribution-free estimator. As the reference to this estimator suggests, it is free from distributional assumptions in the sense that the error distribution is calculated from the observed data. Hence, it can be used in a wide variety of applications.In the first part of the thesis, we present a summary of the various currently available estimators for the linear regression model with censored independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data. In our review of these estimators, we note that the linear regression model with censored i.i.d. data has been studied quite extensively. Yet, use of autoregressive models with censored data has received very little attention. Hence, the remainder of the thesis focuses on the estimation of parameters for censored autocorrelated data.

In particular, these techniques are all digital in nature or can be implemented in digital integrated circuit technology.Presented first is a frequency measurement technique which involves sampling at regular intervals a binary quantized narrow band signal. The binary quantized samples are digitally processed to obtain the instantaneous frequency of the signal.It is shown that small phase movements in the signal can be detected even though the sampling occurs at a rate much lower than the signal frequency; that there are no frequency offsets in the frequency measurement technique; that the phase error in the technique is small and bounded provided the signal frequency is maintained within derived limits. Other properties of the technique are also derived.The frequency measurement technique is experimentally demonstrated in a number of typical applications.Secondly, a new phase tracking system is presented, which has similarities to conventional phase locked loops. However, unlike phase locked loops, the new system incorporates a local reference source which effectively stabilizes the phase estimate of the signal input being tracked.It is shown that the new system has the following advantages: Precise centre frequency, controllable lock range, and elimination or reduction of the effects of imperfections like voltage controlled oscillator phase noise. General behaviour in noise of the new phase tracking system is derived.An implementation of the new system is presented which employs the frequency measurement technique described above. This implementation is characterized by very precise centre frequency, high phase noise suppression, and can be built almost entirely in digital integrated circuit technology.

The study found that, while used sparingly, analogies were employed more frequently in the beginning of textbooks and that the analogies used concrete analog domains to describe abstract target concepts. There was considerable use of pictorial-verbal analogies although simple analogies comprised a substantial proportion and stated limitations or warnings were infrequently employed.Study Two involved interviews with the authors of eight of the above mentioned textbooks to determine authors' views on analogies and their use in textbooks and teaching. The study identified a relationship between how frequently analogies were used by the author and what he or she considered to be the characteristics of a good chemistry teacher. Each author had a good understanding of the nature of analogy and each sought a flexible environment for its use - most arguing that analogies are better used by teachers than printed in textbooks.

A case-control study of body mass index (BMI) and maximal oxygen uptake (VO(subscript)2max) in heat exhaustion was also undertaken. A history was obtained using a structured questionnaire. Pulse rate, blood pressure, tympanic temperature and urine specific gravity were measured before treatment. Venous blood was analysed for haematological and biochemical parameters, during the acute presentation and after recovery. BMI and VO(subscript)2max were measured after recovery and in a group of controls. Psychrometric wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and air velocity were measured at the underground sites where heat exhaustion had occurred. Air cooling power and psychrometric wet bulb globe temperatures were derived. Surface 24-hour mean wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures were recorded. Surface 24-hour mean wet bulb globe temperatures were derived.Results - 106 cases were studied in the case series. The incidence of heat exhaustion during the year was 43.0 cases per million man-hours. In February it was 147 cases per million man-hours.

From a monitoring perspective, this thesis considers approaches for improving the accuracy of land condition monitoring by incorporating other data into the interpretation process.Digital elevation data provide one potentially useful source of information. The use of digital elevation data are extensively considered here. In particular, various methods for deriving variables relating to landform from digital elevation data and remotely sensed data are reviewed and new techniques derived.Given that data from a number of sources may need to be combined in order to produce accurate interpretations of land use/condition, methods for combining data are reviewed. Of the many different approaches available, a Bayesian approach is adopted.The approach adopted is based on relatively new developments in probabilistic expert systems. This thesis demonstrates how these new developments provide a unified framework for uniting traditional classification methods and methods for integrating information from other spatial data sets, including data derived from digital elevation models, remotely sensed imagery and human experts.Two applications of the techniques are primarily considered.

This study was undertaken in Perth, Western Australia. The grounded theory method was chosen to undertake this research.The study's informants consisted of nurses. Theoretical sampling led to the inclusion of patients and patients' relatives. Purposive and theoretical sampling were used to choose the informants. Data were obtained using field observations and formal and informal interviews with nurses and post-discharge patients. Data analysis was conducted using the constant comparative method (Glaser and Strauss, 1967), writing memos and drawing a schema. The Ethnograph software package (Seidel, 1988) was used to organize and manage the data.The findings of the study indicated that nurses were stymied in their person-centered interactions with patients in the presence of technology. Nurses used the process of navigating the course of interaction to deal with this problem. The process of navigating the course of interaction consisted of three phases. These were the phases of embarking, steering and veering and disembarking. The action/interaction of the process occurred during the steering and veering phase and four specific strategies of interaction became evident in this research. These strategies of interaction were steadying, demurring, coasting and maximizing. The strategies of interaction used by nurses did not center on one type. There was rather a movement between strategies during and between interactions with patients in the presence of technology. This movement was termed oscillating connections. Conditions that modified the core process of navigating the course of interaction were also identified.

Southwestern Australian Hakea species possess two contrasting leaf morphologies (broad or terete leaves) and fire-related life forms (non-sprouting (fire-killed) or resprouting (fire-surviving)), with each species representing one of four leaf morphology-life form groups.Representative species within each group were studied to determine whether they display similar distribution and ecophysiological patterns at both the adult and seedling stages. The distribution of species within these groups was best based on averages and variations in annual temperature and rainfall. The highest percentage of terete leaved non-sprouters (25 species) occurred in areas of low-moderate rainfall with large annual temperature ranges, whereas terete leaved resprouters (14 species) displayed a patchy distribution. Broad leaved resprouters (28 species) dominated areas of strongly seasonal rainfall, with few species occurring in the drier regions. Broad leaved non-sprouters (33 species) were best represented in areas of low annual temperature. The distribution of non-sprouters/resprouters may be due to the effect of climatic factors on seedling recruitment and/or fire frequencies. Leaf morphology appears to have a more direct influence on species distribution, as broad leaves are favoured in regions of medium-high, seasonal rainfall (less stressful habitats) while terete leaves are better adapted to tolerate hot, dry environments.Terete leaves are either simple (needle-like) or 2-3 pronged, and, apart from their narrow width, are characterised by their greater leaf thickness (&gt; 1 mm), smaller projected area and mass, higher leaf mass per area (a measure of sclerophylly) and a ++</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">leaf morphology, ecology, ecophysiology, Southwestern Australia, Hakea.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the effect of culture on the learning of science in non-Western countries.</field><field name="creator">Baker, David A.</field><field name="description">The research for this thesis was born of a desire to understand how a student's cultural background might influence the outcomes of science education. Of particular interest to me was the apparent paucity of academic achievement by many indigenous students as they study science through Western style schools and curricula, resulting in what I have termed 'educational alienation', which is evidenced by poor grades and slow rates of progression through the curriculum, and by some students displaying a high degree of antagonism toward the education system. 1 have sought to understand the causes of educational alienation by means of an interpretive inquiry based on a Grounded Theory methodology, using an Integrative Research Review as the primary means of data collection, supplemented by personal experience, data analysis and interview methods.The outcomes of the Grounded Research have caused me to re-think my understanding of culture and my tacit acceptance of conceptual change theory. Three distinct themes emerged as being significant to learning: Language Use, Traditional Beliefs and Life-world Knowledge. I have presented evidence suggesting that Language Use, Traditional Beliefs and Life-world Knowledge are largely subsumed within one's worldview, and that the term 'culture' lacks the specificity needed to explore the notion of educational alienation. I suggest that worldview is not only cultural, but is a dynamic belief system of the individual that is shaped by cultural forces and personal reflection, resulting in a reorganisation of knowledge throughout one's life. I propose that a constructivist view of learning and knowing presents us with a plausible explanation of worldview development and educational alienation, and I conclude with suggestions for further research and pedagogy that might develop the discourse and consequently improve the outcomes of science ++</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learning,  non-Western countries,  cultural background, science education.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12090</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A grounded study of the experience of detoxification from psychoactive drugs.</field><field name="creator">Bartu, Anne E.</field><field name="description">The main objective of this thesis was to develop a substantive theory that explained the phenomenon of detoxification from psychoactive drugs such as alcohol, tranquillisers, opioids, and amphetamines in a medical treatment unit for licit and illicit drug users. The other objectives were to (a) determine if the differences reported in earlier studies between licit and illicit drug users in terms of socio-demographic and drug use variables remain extant, and (b) assess the extent of minor psychiatric morbidity among the participants. Both grounded theory and quantitative methods of data collection and analysis were used in the study.The findings of the quantitative component of the study indicated that there were significant differences between licit and illicit drug users in regard to age, drug use characteristics, and completing the treatment program. That is, illicit drug users were younger than licit drug users, more likely to be poly drug users, and drop out of the program. The prevalence of minor psychiatric morbidity among the participants was 93.6%, and was largely independent of socio-demographic and drug use variables. The high prevalence of minor psychiatric morbidity suggests that the majority of participants warranted further follow-up support in the community after they left the treatment unit. The uptake of referrals for follow-up support, however, was 55.9%.The basic or core social psychological problem identified by the constant comparative method of grounded theory was found to have two parts, both of which were interpreted as forms of disequilibrium.

Overall, all stages have been completed successfully with several breakthroughs in the areas of Special Core Analysis (SCAL), reservoir engineering and reservoir simulation technology.Initially, a literature research was conducted to survey all available core analysis techniques and their individual characteristics. The survey revealed that there are several core analysis techniques for measuring residual gas saturation (Sgr) and hence, the lack of a commonly agreed method for measuring Sgr. The often-used core analysis techniques are steady-state displacement, co-current imbibition, centrifuge and counter-current imbibition. In this research, all centrifuge tests were performed with a decane-brine system to investigate the possibility of replacing gas with a 'model fluid' to minimise errors due to gas compressibility. Furthermore, Sgr is a function of testing temperature and pressure, types of fluid, wettability, viscosity, flow rate and overburden pressure. Consequently, large uncertainties are associated with measured Sgr and the recoverable gas reserves for water-driven gas reservoirs.Due to the lack of a common method for measuring Sgr, the first important step is to clarify which is the most representative core analysis technique for measuring Sgr. In Stage 2 of the research, core analysis experiments were performed with uniform fluids and ambient temperature. In the core flooding experiments, four different sets of core plugs from various gas reservoirs were selected to cover a wide range of permeability and porosity.

The use of linear control techniques is valid only in a narrow range of operation. Therefore, in this thesis, multivariable nonlinear control techniques are considered. The target process is the single effect evaporative process of the liquor burning unit in Alcoa's alumina refinery in Kwinana and the proposed triple effects unit in the Wagerup refinery. Two types of nonlinear control strategies using differential geometry were studied, namely, the input output linearization (Kravaris and Soroush, 1990) and the input state linearization (Hunt et al, 1983a). The research has successfully demonstrated the superiority and simplicity of the nonlinear controller through simulations and plant implementations. An integrated software package using MAPLE V.3 as the computing environment was developed to automate the solution algorithms and to graphically simulate the closed loop dynamics of different processes using the two nonlinear control strategies.The issue of robustness of the nonlinear controller was addressed by developing a procedure called uncertainty vector adjustment. The effectiveness of the new strategy was successfully demonstrated on the simulated liquor burning process. Furthermore, the stability of the adjustment technique was proved and its theoretical bounds were established using Lyapunov function analysis.A comparative study of geometric nonlinear filter and extended Kalman filter was conducted to reduce the requirement of full state feedback necessary for nonlinear control using either input output linearization or input state linearization. The simulation of the single effect evaporation unit of the liquor burning process showed that the geometric nonlinear filter is superior to the extended Kalman filter in terms of nonlinear tracking performances.The plant trials of the input output linearization ++</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alumina refinery operations, evaporative process, nonlinear control.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrient cycling in a montane moist evergreen broad-leaved forest (Lithocarpus/Castanopsis association) in Ailao Mountains, Yunnan, Southwestern China.</field><field name="creator">Liu, Wenyao</field><field name="description">This study was conducted at the Ailao Mountain National Natural Reserve (NNR) in natural vegetation described as: Lithocarpus xylocarpus/Castanopsis wattii (Oak /Chestnut association) forest. Study sites were located in the Xujiaba area of the reserve at an altitude of ~ 2450 m with slopes of 10-15 degrees. This type of forest is believed to be unique to the NEAR area. The forest is floristically characterized by multiple families and genera. It has two tall tree layers, a well-developed bamboo (Sinarundinaria nitida) layer and evergreen fern species. Bryophyte, ferns and lichen occur and abundant epiphytic bryophyte is present on tree boles.A number of important aspects of nutrient cycling, including patterns of biomass and nutrient accumulation; nutrient return in litterfall and release from decomposing leaf litter; annual nutrient uptake and retention, and nutrient input and output budgets through hydrological flux in natural Lithocarpus/Castanopsis forest in the reserve, were investigated.This natural forest is characterized by high biomass accumulation of living and dead materials. Trees account for &gt;90 % of total biomass. Dead wood comprises a high proportion (9-41 %) of total stand biomass. The sequence of inorganic nutrient element content decreased in the order leave s&gt;b ranche s&gt;roots&gt; stems. Elemental content of the total stand decreased in the order of C&gt;Ca&gt;N&gt;K&gt;AI&gt;Mg&gt;P&gt;Fe&gt;Mn. The elements C, Ca and N were mainly in stems while AI and Fe were mainly in roots.Litterfall was sampled using traps during the period 1991-1999. High variations in litter production between years were associated with masting years of canopy species, and exceptional physical events (strong winds and snow). The mean annual litterfall is 7.12 t ha-1 with a bimodal seasonal pattern in litterfall: the main litterfall peak occurred in April-May and a lesser one in October-November.

The problem addressed in this study concerned the apparent inability of large- scale reforms to meet equity goals. The purpose of the study was to increase understanding of this problem from both theoretical and practical perspectives. The study was influenced by feminist perspectives in the choice of theoretical framework and methodology. Focusing specifically on gender equity, the study was set in the context of a large-scale reform in the USA, Ohio's Statewide Systemic Initiative, Project Discovery.There were three major objectives in this study. First was to synthesise the literature concerning gender equity in mathematics education to produce a definition of the ideal Connected Equitable Mathematics Classroom (CEMC). There were two parts to the literature review: one concerning explanations for observed gender differences in mathematics education, and another concerning initiatives implemented to try to bring about gender equity in mathematics education.The second objective was to use the definition of the ideal CEMC, derived from the literature, to determine the extent to which reform had occurred in mathematics classrooms in Ohio. This was accomplished through the analysis of quantitative data collected from a random sample of teachers and principals across the state, and qualitative data collected from seven case study sites. The third objective was to determine the barriers to and facilitators of the realisation of equity goals in middle-school mathematics classrooms involved in Project Discovery. This was accomplished through a cross-site analysis of data collected at the seven case- study sites, with the analysis framed around the characteristics of the CEMC.The outcomes of the study are ++</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gender equity, educational reform, mathematics education.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effective shear strength of artificially fissured overconsolidated clays.</field><field name="creator">Sabzalisenejani, Ali</field><field name="description">The effective shear strength of artificially overconsolidated clays with continuous fissures, or with discontinuous or partial fissuring, has been discussed from both the experimental and numerical points of view.Direct shear and triaxial tests have been conducted on a range of unfissured, partially and fully fissured specimens of artificially overconsolidated clay samples in the laboratory. Specimens subjected to direct shear tests have been prepared in three different preconsolidation pressures and two or three different Overconsolidation ratios (OCR) for unfissured, partially and fully fissured specimens. Specimens subjected to triaxial tests also were prepared for three different preconsolidation pressures and overconsolidation ratios. In order to investigate the effect of orientation of fissures, artificially overconsolidated fissured triaxial specimens were prepared in three different orientations at 30 degrees, 45 degrees and 60 degrees to the direction of minimum principal stress (sigma[subscript]3).For both direct shear and triaxial tests, special tools and devices were designed and constructed to prepare unfissured, partially and fully fissured specimens.Taking into account the number of parameters which influence the effective shear strength of overconsolidated clays, and the time which is needed to artificially prepare the overconsolidated specimens and to run drained tests, as well as the impossibility or impracticality of the laboratory simulations for some specific cases, numerical methods were used to complement the experimental component of the investigation.Numerical modelling of direct shear and triaxial specimens utilised the FLAC (Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua, Itasca, 1993) program for two dimensional simulation of the direct shear tests and the ANSYS (1996) program for three dimensional simulation of triaxial tests.

Between 1978 and 1997, an in-service science-teacher training project, which is known as the PKG IPA Project, was developed by the Directorate of General Secondary Education. The successful PKG IPA project implemented its own in-service science teacher training system within its own training network across Indonesia, without the involvement of the PPPG IPA as the existing official teacher-training agent. The existence of the project was discontinued when the World Bank loan ended. Unfortunately, the expensive infrastructures developed by the PKG IPA project could no longer be utilized because the PKG IPA project was excluded from the official structure of organization of the Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC) which is now known as Ministry of National education (MNE). In addition, the ignorance of the staff of the PPPG IPA about the PKG IPA project is one indicator why that the PPPG IPA is facing some problems, which affect the implementation of its duties and functions.Based on this indicator, this study was implemented with two objectives, namely, to investigate and analyze current problems facing the PPPG IPA, and to make recommendations for formulating appropriate policies and strategies in order to rationalize the future roles of the PPPG IPA. The study involved seven research questions, which were grouped into three concerns, namely, the quality of the environment, a needs analysis, and analysis of the Directorate's policies.

The study has revealed that the processing procedures played an important role in the microstructural development of A/CA6 composites. The microstructure-property relationships of these materials were found to be strongly influenced by the presence of CA6 phase.The A/CA6 composites were synthesised by in-situ reaction sintering of alumina powder and (0, 5, 15, 30, 50 and 100 wt%) CA6 precursor. The phase relations and development of this system were monitored using quantitative x-ray diffraction (XRD) and neutron diffraction (ND). Rietveld analysis which showed the CA6 content to increase in proportion with the increase of CA6 precursor added. The XRD study revealed that the CA and CA2 phases started to develop at approximately 1000 and 1100&#176;C and transformed to CA6 phase at 1400T. Similarly, the dynamic high temperature ND study showed that the corresponding calcium aluminates phases commenced to develop at 1000&#176;C and 1200&#176;C and then eventually transformed to CA6 at 1400&#176;C.The presence of the plate-like CA6 grains in the system was revealed by the back-scattered SEM imaging and confirmed by the Ca x-ray map. Although the presence of CA6 caused the reduction of hardness, the fracture toughness of A/CA6 composites were improved when compared with alumina.

The then Commonwealth Government called for policy-induced consortia to submit applications as a means to implement the report's recommendations.

In the modern world such problems arise in several contexts such as distribution of goods, transportation of commodities and/or people etc.In this thesis we focus on two classical routing problems, namely the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). The TSP can be described as a salesman travels from his home city, visits each of the other ( n - 1) cities exactly once and returns back to the home city such that the total distance travelled by him is minimised. The VRP may be stated as follows: A set of n customers (with known locations and demands for some commodity) is to be supplied from a single depot using a set of delivery vehicles each with a prescribed capacity. A delivery route starts from the depot, visits some customers and returns back to the depot. The VRP is to determine the delivery routes for each vehicle such that the total distance travelled by all the vehicles is minimised.These routing problems are simple to state in terms of describing them in words. But they are very complex in terms of providing a suitable mathematical formulation and a valid procedure to solve them.

Methods tested included improving spoil conditions and trialing an alternative method for seeding.Twelve species of native plants were tested for tolerance in two acid overburden materials in pot and field trials. Eucalyptus robusta is the most tolerant, Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus cladocalyx are highly tolerant, Eucalyptus rudis and Melaleuca hamulosa demonstrate potential, provided adequate soil moisture is available.An important growth restriction factor in acid soils is the presence of free aluminium ions. A glasshouse trial performed on seven species for tolerance to aluminium toxicity revealed E. robusta as most tolerant and E. camaldulensis and Kunzea ericifolia a highly tolerant.

Teacher interviews were conducted with a sample of participants in order to further illuminate the impact of the professional development. Data from the study were examined for changes in the learning environment and to cross-validate the QTI and WIHIC with this specific population. Results indicate that the QTI and WIHIC are valid and reliable with the middle-school population is this study. Statistical analyses of learning environment data indicate that any pretest-posttest changes that were observed are mostly likely too small to be of educational significance. This study contributes to a better general understanding of the impact of this professional development, and its findings could be utilized in the preparation of future professional development opportunities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">professional development, educational reform, classroom learning environment, middle-school mathematics teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=21410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanism of Bayer residue flocculation.</field><field name="creator">Jones, Franca</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism of Bayer residue flocculation. Hematite was chosen as the test substrate as it is a common Bayer residue mineral. Batch settling tests were used to gain an understanding of the aggregation mechanism and to compare the effect of different parameters on flocculation performance. Flocculant adsorption isotherm measurements were related to changes in flocculation performance. Infrared spectroscopy was used to ascertain the configuration of adsorbed flocculant on the hematite surface.Batch settling tests showed that under strong caustic conditions hematite is naturally coagulated and that flocculation occurs via a bridging mechanism. This was confirmed by results which showed that factors which affect the bridging efficiency of the flocculant had an impact on aggregation. In particular, temperature and caustic concentration were found to greatly influence flocculation performance. This is due mainly to changes in the viscosity of the liquor, but may also be linked to the kinetics of particle-particle and particle-flocculant collisions resulting in a less efficient aggregation process. Ionic strength did not impact on performance as the flocculant was at a limiting size for synthetic liquors containing TC &gt;/= 50 and TA &gt;/= 10.Increasing ionic strength did not increase the adsorption density of the flocculant on hematite nor did altering the salt cation species from Na(subscript)2+ to Ca(subscript)2+. It can be concluded, therefore, that the flocculant is chemisorbed through surface complexation, since if it were electrostatically bound an increase in flocculant adsorption should have been observed with increasing ionic strength or cation charge. The surface complexation mechanism was supported by infrared results which showed that the flocculant vibrational bands were shifted on adsorption.

The thesis is organized as follows.In Chapter 1 a general literature review is presented, including motivation and development of the problems, and existing results. Furthermore, some existing computational methods for optimal control problems are also discussed.In Chapter 2 the design of a semiconductor device is posed as an optimization problem: given an ideal voltage-current (V - I) characteristic, find one or more physical and geometrical parameters so that the V-I characteristic of the device matches the ideal one optimally with respect to a prescribed performance criterion. The voltage-current characteristic of a semiconductor device is governed by a set of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE), and thus a black-box approach is taken for the numerical solution to the PDEs. Various existing numerical methods are proposed for the solution of the nonlinear optimization problem. The Jacobian of the cost function is ill-conditioned and a scaling technique is thus proposed to stabilize the resulting linear system. Numerical experiments, performed to show the usefulness of this approach, demonstrate that the approach always gives optimal or near-optimal solutions to the test problems in both two and three dimensions.In Chapter 3 we propose an efficient approach to numerical integration in one and two dimensions, where a grid set with a fixed number of vertices is to be chosen so that the error between the numerical integral and the exact integral is minimized. For one dimensional problem two schemes are developed for sufficiently smooth functions based on the mid-point rectangular quadrature rule and the trapezoidal rule respectively, and another method is also developed for integrands which are not ++</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">numerical solutions, dynamic optimization, static optimization.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=10284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A neural fuzzy approach for well log and hydrocyclone data interpretation.</field><field name="creator">Wong, Kok W.</field><field name="description">A novel data analysis approach that is automatic, self-learning and self-explained, and which provides accurate and reliable results is reported. The data analysis tool is capable of performing multivariate non-parametric regression analysis, as well as quantitative inferential analysis using predictive learning. Statistical approaches such as multiple regression or discriminant analysis are usually used to perform this kind of analysis. However, they lack universal capabilities and their success in any particular application is directly affected by the problem complexity.The approach employs the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Fuzzy Logic to perform the data analysis. The features of these two techniques are the means by which the developed data analysis approach has the ability to perform self-learning as well as allowing user interaction in the learning process. Further, they offer a means by which rules may be generated to assist human understanding of the learned analysis model, and so enable an analyst to include external knowledge.Two problems in the resource industry have been used to illustrate the proposed method, as these applications contain non-linearity in the data that is unknown and difficult to derive. They are well log data analysis in petroleum exploration and hydrocyclone data analysis in mineral processing. This research also explores how this proposed data analysis approach could enhance the analysis process for problems of this type.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrocyclone data interpretation, well log interpretation, neural fuzzy analysis, data analysis.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=10344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zero average current error control methods for bidirectional AC-DC converters.</field><field name="creator">Borle, Lawrence J.</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned primarily with the optimization of the current regulation in bi-directional ac-dc power converters through the use of appropriate current control methods. Following a review into prior current control technology, current control methods which attempt to achieve Zero Average Current Error (ZACE) in each switching period are presented. A ZACE controlled converter offers independent real and reactive power flow control with negligible low order current harmonics, a relatively narrow switching frequency band, and relative immunity to power circuit parameter variations, including DC link or AC line voltage harmonics. ZACE and other desirable characteristics in a current control method are discussed. The single phase ac and dc ripple current is characterized.Two new types of ZACE current control techniques for directly controlling the inductor current in switched power converters are introduced in this thesis together with variations for certain applications. Slope-generated hysteresis (SGH), the first to be developed, is a hysteresis method which uses the slopes of the current error signal alone to generate a hysteresis band which will result in a fixed switching frequency. Slope-generated hysteresis-clock (SGHC) is presented as an alternative with a dual clock to force a narrow switching frequency band.Ramptime current control is the second type of ZACE current control presented. Developed as an improvement over SGH, ramptime produces ZACE in each switching period by using the timing of a previous switching instant relative to the coincident previous current error signal excursion time to determine each switching instant. The digital current error polarity signal is the only variable input required to produce a pwm output.Variations of ramptime current control are also presented.

This research examines the influence of teachers' science content knowledge on how they make judgements about students' conceptual understandings and the extent to which follow-up activities they suggest reflect a conceptual change approach to teaching science.Primary and secondary teachers, from a range of science education histories and experiences teaching students of different ages, responded to a science task involving concepts of heat energy, combustion and ignition. They were asked to judge a student work sample about the same task, and suggest follow-up activities to support further learning.How teachers made their judgements was found to vary in accord with their science knowledge, categorised as high, midrange and low. Teachers with high science knowledge were the most adept at making accurate and appropriate judgements and had the lowest frequency of problems with their judgements. Teachers with high and midrange science knowledge were more able to link their suggestions for follow-up activities to students' science concepts, and showed greater familiarity with activities commensurate with a conceptual change orientation to teaching. Non-recognition of students' concepts as critical evidence of development was a key aspect of the judgements of teachers with low science knowledge.Recommendations are made for professional development to assist teachers to develop appropriate science content knowledge they can use to support their pedagogical content knowledge so they are able to foster students' conceptual development.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science student assessment, teachers' pedagogical knowledge, teachers' science knowledge.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=10249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of Eucalyptus victrix in grassland in the floodplain of the Fortescue River.</field><field name="creator">Florentine, Singarayer K.</field><field name="description">The WA coolibah tree, Eucalyptus victrix L. Johnson &amp; K. Hill forms an unique and pristine woodland in the Fortescue Valley, in the Pilbara district of Western Australia. Until recently, no research had been done on E. victrix ecology and concern had been expressed by pastoral managers and others about the condition of the woodland occupied by this species. This research was an attempt to understand the ecology of coolibah using a multi-disciplinary approach.A population demographic study of stands in E. victrix woodland reveals that the present tree populations occupy larger areas than saplings and seedlings. Soil moisture and warm summer temperatures are believed to be stimulating factors for seedling recruitment of E. victrix. Different size classes (height/diameter) reflect different recruitment events and these reflect past availability of seeds and adequate soil moisture in that particular area of the woodland. Occasional grasshopper outbreaks and drought cause canopy shrinkage. Presence of hollow boles, restrict dendrochronological examination of tree ages.An important population study was of a post-seedling cohort at Roy Hill, where height distribution reflected a typical single recruitment event. In subsequent years (1995 - 1998) height measurement showed several peaks, suggesting that seedlings were now growing at different rates. Uniform and steady height growth was observed on saplings found at the edges of gilgai. During May 1998 several saplings flowered, it was assumed that E. victrix attained its reproductive maturity at mean height of 2.50 m and with a stem diameter of 50 mm.Seedling recruitment and subsequent growth mainly depend on heavy rainfall flooding events. Seedling recruitment occurs only from current seed rain. Seed longevity reduces after 54 days of burial at 50 mm depth.

Clinical education is a vital component in the curricula of pre-registration nursing courses and provides student nurses with the opportunity to combine cognitive, psychomotor, and affective skills. Clinical field placement is an integral element in the overall pre-registration nursing program. Clinical practice enables the student to develop competencies in the application of knowledge, skills, and attitudes to clinical field situations. However, the time allocation for the clinical component of pre-registration nursing courses can be rather limited. It is, therefore, vital that the short but valuable clinical time be utilised effectively and productively.One of the objectives of this study was to develop and validate an instrument, the Clinical Learning Environment Inventory (CLEI), to assess nursing students' perceptions of hospital learning environment during clinical practice. Data were collected from 138 second year nursing students in a major university school of nursing in South Australia. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. The study confirmed the reliability and validity of the CLEI for use in the hospital learning environment.A second objective was to investigate associations of the CLEI with outcomes. Students' perceptions of the outcome of their clinical placement were found to be strongly associated with all five scales of the CLEI namely; Individualisation, Innovation, Involvement, Personalisation, and Task Orientation. The quantitative and qualitative findings reinforced each other.

With the ever-increasing growth of computer networks and the Internet in particular, it is imperative that GIS take advantage of distributed data technologies to provide users and applications with shared and improved access to geographic data.Geographic data distribution design is concerned with determining what data gets placed at which computer network sites and involves the issues of data partitioning, allocation and dynamic migration. Partitioning is concerned with how data, or fragments of the data, are apportioned to partitions. These partitions must then be assigned to network sites in an allocation process. Because data usage and access changes by applications in a dynamic environment, migration strategies are necessary to redistribute the data. In order for data distribution to reflect current usage patterns of applications, the design process must obtain and accumulate data usage information from applications.This dissertation first details the predicate fragmentation (PF) model. The core of the model is the PF tree that has been developed and implemented to store and maintain usage information. User predicates, obtained from application queries, are inserted into the tree and primitive predicates can be identified from the tree. These primitive predicates define the fragmentation from which a data distribution can be determined. Predicate insertion and pruning operations are essential to the maintenance of the tree structure.A methodology that uses the PF model to obtain a partitioning, allocation and migration strategy is then outlined. The fragments identified from the PF trees are aggregated into partitions that are then assigned to individual network sites using a site access allocation strategy.

Ultimately, a system that integrates MODSS, ES and GDSS is generated, which is then evaluated in a laboratory experimental setup. This integrated system contains a sufficient number of MODM methods to solve MODM problems, provides an ES-based guide to select and use the most suitable MODM method, and has the capability to aggregate individual decision makers' preferences to produce a compromise solution of an MODM problem in different forms and styles of group meetings. The system is supported by a set of group decision making (GDM) methods which combine the preferences of the individual group members and thus increases the confidence of each group member in the compromise solution.The research is conducted using a multiple-methodologies approach using the system development methodology as the backbone. The conceptual framework of the integrated system is elaborated to integrate multiple system elements into one facility at the application system level based on functional and resource integration. A prototype implements this conceptual framework as an intelligence-based and graphical user interface (GUI)-based MODSS that works in an individual/group environment.

In this thesis, we introduce three new methods to design spreading sequences, which can be optimised to achieve the desired characteristics.We show that the level of MAI for the DS CDMA systems utilising the example sets of sequences designed by the use of these techniques can be relatively low, compare to the case when the well known Gold-like sequences [29] are used. In addition, we show that by using one of the methods introduced in the thesis, we can construct sets of orthogonal sequences possessing acceptable correlation properties, even for an asynchronous operation, while another of the introduced methods can be used if design of sequences of an arbitrary length is required.Our new methods to design complex polyphase sequences are orientated towards the short length sequences, as a target application for them are high data rate wireless networks. Those methods are based on using discretised chirp pulses, pulses consisting of discretised multiple chirps, or linear combinations of them. In order to achieve orthogonality among the designed polyphase sequences, we combined the sequences based on superimposed chirps and double chirps with the sequences derived from the orthogonal Walsh functions.Finally, we utilise the three most promising sequence sets designed by the use of die introduced methods to simulate the multiuser DS CDMA systems. We compare performance of those simulated systems with the performance of the simulated system utilising 15-chip Gold- like sequences. The comparison results indicate that by using our design methods, we can produce useful sequence sets for applications where short spreading sequences are required.

Seismic physical modelling is used to study the effects of seismic wave propagation in isotropic and anisotropic media and is particularly suited to isolating the effects of a single parameter independently from all others in an infinitely complex geological system. Seismic physical modelling has also been used for the testing of numerical processing algorithms, aid to evaluate interpretations of field seismic sections with scaled representations of geological formations. For this project, I set about developing methods to combine these two independent modelling techniques for the first time. However, previous attempts to use sand as a seismic modelling material failed due mainly to problems with understanding and controlling the distribution of the grain packing.This research has addressed a number of these problems through systematic laboratory experimentation that has provided new insight into the factors that affect unconsolidated sediment acoustics. An innovative technique of recording seismic physical modelling surveys has been developed so that it is now possible to successfully record ultrasonic reflections within analogue sandbox models in three-dimensions (3-D), providing benefits for both analogue sandbox and seismic modelling disciplines. For sandbox modelling, the recording of seismic images allows more detailed analyses of the structures than previously possible. For seismic modelling, more geologically realistic settings can be modelled at a fraction of the cost and construction time of conventional models.

In particular it clarifies for me the process through which State-wide science curriculum reform was enacted in the late 1950s and into the 1970s. This period is interesting because of a continuing perception amongst science teachers that the system-wide changes of the time were widely supported by teachers and influenced classroom practice. My aim in this study was to explore how the characteristics of this cultural change process may be applied in the current climate of school reform.The members of the local science teacher community of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s engaged in similar activities and conversations as they attended the same University then continued to enter into similar school-based activities. As a group of people with shared experiences and values, who made decisions based on similar understandings and priorities, this group may be regarded as an identifiable culture.The day to day activities of this community of science teachers were underpinned by each teacher's beliefs about scientific knowledge and processes and school science, as well as understandings about the teaching and learning process. Many of these beliefs were so fundamental as to be unquestioned, and may be referred to as referents, or myths. For the members of a culture to change their practice then, new referents must be introduced, or existing referents modified.In searching for the process by which this culture was able to access new understandings, this study examined the comparative influence of two highly visible science educators who promoted science curriculum change in the State.

One particular approach, qualitative spatial reasoning, investigates the usage of abstract representation to facilitate the representation of and the reasoning with spatial information.This thesis investigates the usage of intervals along global axes as the under-lying representational and reasoning mechanism for a spatial reasoning system. Aspects that are unique to representing spatial information (flow and multi-dimensionality) are used to provide a method for classifying relations between objects at multiple levels of granularity. The combination of these two mechanisms (intervals and classification) provide the basis for the development of a querying system that allows qualitative queries about object relations in multi-dimensional space to be performed upon the representation.The second issue examined by this thesis is the problem of representing intervals when all the interval relations may not be known precisely. A three part solution is proposed. The first shows how the simplest situation, where all relations are explicit and primitive, can be represented and integrated with the above mentioned querying system. The second situation demonstrates how, for interval relations that are primitive but are not all explicitly known, an effective point based representation may be constructed. Finally, when relations between intervals are disjunctions of possible primitive interval relations, a representation is presented which allows solutions to queries to be constructed from consistent data.Our contribution is two-fold:1. a method of classifying the spatial relations and the means of querying these relations;2. a process of efficiently representing incomplete interval information and the means of efficiently querying this information.The work presented ++</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intervals, spatial reasoning.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=9539</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of the learning outcomes in environmental science from a field-based water quality environmental unit.</field><field name="creator">Pohl, Raimund R.</field><field name="description">This thesis validates the Science Laboratory Environment Inventory for the first time in a field based environmental setting using a water quality-monitoring program within a girls' high school and compares the cognitive achievement of students in the water quality-monitoring school with those in non-water quality-monitoring schools.

The transmission error of gears in mesh is considered to be one of the main causes of gear noise and vibration. Numerous papers have been published on gear transmission error measurement and many investigations have been devoted to gear vibration analysis. There still, however, remains to be developed a general non-linear Finite Element Model capable of predicting the effect of variations of gear torsional mesh stiffness, transmission error, transmitted load and load sharing ratio. The primary purpose of this study was to develop such a model and to study the behaviour of the static torsional mesh stiffness, load sharing ratio, and transmission error over one completed cycle of the tooth mesh.The research outlined in this thesis considers the variations of the whole gear body stiffness arising from the gear body rotation due to tooth bending deflection, shearing displacement, and contact deformation. Many different positions within the meshing cycle were investigated and then compared with the results of a gear mesh having a single cracked tooth.In order to handle contact problems with the finite element method, the stiffness relationship between the two contact areas must be established. Existing Finite Element codes rely on the use of the variational approach to formulate contact problems.

This aim was monitored by Concept Learning Test Sequences (CLTSs), developed for each of ten fundamental chemical concept-clusters, selected from ten theory-practical work-units of an expressly written book. The concept-clusters were: density, mixture/compound, structure/bonding, base/salt, redox, mole, rate, metal, halogen, hydrocarbon. Each CLTS comprised a pre-instruction item; two-tier multiple-choice item(s); a post-instruction item; each provided data from a class of 21 students of widely different backgrounds. Separate chapters discuss class results and individual results.Concept-learning Improvement Categories that estimated individual improvement in each CLTS were quantified by assigning numerical values. Summation of these numerical values for all ten CLTSs produced individual Concept-learning Improvement Indices (CLIIs). Improvement in concept-learning appears independent of prior academic background. Rankings by CLIIs and by final assessment percentage were strongly correlated. The mean CLII for the class assessed concept-learning improvement (per concept) at Moderate-to-Intermediate.Various probes revealed that factors which influenced learning included: pre-laboratory reports; practical work; learning partnership(s); positive personal qualities; mathematical skills; confidence; visualisation; integration of theoretical and practical studies; bench problem-solving; a relaxed tutorial atmosphere; historical approaches to chemical concepts.

Large volumes of petroleum have been generated from land-plant organic matter in many parts of the world, but especially in the Tertiary deltaic provinces of the USA, Canada, Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Compared to oils from other regions, these oils have a relatively complex pattern of biomarkers or molecular fossils, a feature reflecting the diversity of deltaic depositional environments and the advanced state of plant evolution during late Mesozoic and Tertiary time. The molecular and carbon isotopic composition of these oils is useful in identifying the character of their source beds and also in understanding the conditions that give rise to oil-prone sediments generally.Despite their widespread occurrence in oils and sediments, land-plant biomarkers have been used less frequently than compounds of algal origin as markers for source, depositional environment and thermal maturity. The present work sets out to extend the range of land-plant biomarker and isotope tools available to the petroleum geochemist and to provide a firmer foundation for some of the existing tools. A systematic study of the biomarker and n-alkane carbon-isotope composition of a set of late Mesozoic/Tertiary-age oils was carried out as a preamble to more focussed investigations. A comparison of the biomarker and n-alkane isotope data showed that parameters such as the oleanane/hopane ratio overestimate the higher plant contribution to marine deltaic oils. The abundance of bicadinane isomers was found to be much more variable than that of the oleananes, probably because of their close association with the highly resinous, dipterocarp hardwoods of ++</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">crude oils, land-plant compounds, carbon isotopic composition.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=10771</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative analysis of lectures versus interactive computer-assisted learning packages for the teaching and learning of anatomy by tertiary students.</field><field name="creator">Lee, Harry B.</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this study was to validate interactive computer-assisted learning packages (ICALP) in a self operated computer controlled educational resource (SOCCER) to undergraduate (UG) physiotherapy students of anatomy. The development of ICALP, Test and FeedBack items for SOCCER are described, as well as the mechanism of delivery with continuous positive reinforcement to randomly selected students. To meet this requirement, a computer managed learning environment (CMLE) was established to affirm the value of ICALP and SOCCER materials to replace traditional lectures in anatomy. Quantitative data is given to verify this hypothesis during the education of UG physiotherapy students of anatomy. Throughout 1992, the UG population was randomly divided into Lecture and ICALP groups, with mutual exclusion of each to the other, for ten areas of study. These results were validated by re-application to the succeeding UG population in 1993. The secondary aim of this study was in two-parts. Firstly, to verify that ICALP materials can be applied to transfer 2-D cognitive anatomical information in a self-paced format of autonomous learning. Secondly, to investigate a premise that previously acquired 2-D anatomical information may be transferred into a 3-D psycho-motor skill. Ample data is given to verify the first hypothesis, with sufficient evidence to support the second. The subsidiary aim of this study compared the educational and administrative cost-effectiveness of ICALP and SOCCER with traditional lectures used in anatomy. Evidence is given to demonstrate that the time saved in lectures can be replaced by a lecture-seminar approach to problem-based learning to empower UG2 students to achieve at a level beyond that which would normally be expected.

Munoz &amp; Mann (1982) described this practice as unique. The uniqueness of this practice, however, has remained shrouded in superficial descriptions featuring service delivery at a one or two-nurse-post, the physical distance of nursing posts from hospital facilities and the autonomy with which nursing is performed. Only glimpses of the reality of nursing practice in a remote area have been revealed through the study of the educational needs of remote area nurses (Munoz &amp; Mann 1982, Cameron-Traub 1987, Philp 1988, Kreger 1991a, Bell, Chang &amp; Daly 1995). A key problem is the lack of a systematic description and detailed analysis of nursing as it is practised in a remote area.The purpose of this study was to explore, describe and analyse nursing practice in a remote area. The research was undertaken at Warburton, an isolated community mainly inhabited by the Ngaanyatjarra people in the Central Desert of Western Australia. An ethnographic design was chosen for this exploratory inquiry into the social and cultural pattern of everyday nursing practice. In a pre-entry study a suitable setting and informants were found. Fieldwork was conducted at the Warburton nursing post by the researcher and involved living on site for a year.

The expectations that employers hold for graduate generic skills are of interest, therefore, to graduates and the institutions they attended. Communication and thinking are recognised widely as the most important generic skills, however the application of these skills will occur in the workplace where academic skills may not be totally appropriate. In addition, many graduates of Australian institutions; e.g., international students, are likely to be employed by foreign organisations. Therefore, not only is the workplace a very different environment to academia but graduates could be expected to satisfy the expectations of employers working in culturally different environments.This investigation describes the expectations participating Singaporean and Perth employers held for recently graduated business graduates with particular attention given to graduate communication and thinking. The exploratory research used interviews and surveys to assemble contextual descriptions of employer expectations. The interview data was used to construct a questionnaire that was administered across a larger sample of employers to see whether the surveys corroborated the interview findings. Contextual descriptions of the communication and thinking capabilities that the Singaporean and Perth employers expected recent business graduates to possess are provided by this study.

In the current economic climate, the costs of creating learning environments that foster these aims is also a major consideration. Further, in this era of rapid technological development and change, there are increasing numbers of students of divergent age, experience and ability entering the tertiary sector. Teachers at this level are therefore faced with real problems in providing students with interesting and innovative learning environments that influence and encourage the use of a deep approach to learning and the development of real understanding.This longitudinal research project sought, through the development and introduction of various teaching and learning interventions, to influence nursing students' attitudes towards microbiology and consequently their approaches to learning and achievement. The instruments used in the intervention practices were developed as a result of suggestions by students and staff during the course of this study and were fashioned along the lines of two models of student learning developed by Kember and Gow (1989) and Biggs (1993a). The study also attempted to elucidate the major factors affecting student attitudes towards teaching and learning with multiple media and the relationship between students' attitude, achievement and their learning approach.Significant relationships were established in the study between positive attitudes towards microbiology, higher scores for higher level learning approaches and higher academic grades.The major factors that appeared to influence students' attitudes towards microbiology included: (1) students' interest in microbiology; (2) the relevance students perceived microbiology had to nursing; (3) ++</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">student achievement, student attitudes, tertiary education, instructional interventions.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=11980</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exposition of the apprentice assessment systems in Western Australia.</field><field name="creator">May, Roger N.</field><field name="description">This study assessed the dilemmas associated with apprentice assessment systems in the New Apprenticeship Training and Assessment System (NATAS), (State based system), and the Modular system (National system) in Western Australia. Although both were described as competency-based systems these different schemes showed the variations that existed under this general description of training and assessment. The Modular system was a competency-based system which emphasised outcomes rather than the process of training.The emphasis on the process of training was what sustained decades of traditional apprenticeship training. The competency-based approach, discussed in detail later, was a performance-based methodology. Conceptually the apprentice either could perform a given task or task element as set by a specific performance criterion, or s/he could not. The person was judged, based upon the performance outcome to be either competent or incompetent. The basic assumption was that the person could not be partially competent.The competencies approach was a cornerstone of the Australian National training provision. It was administered by the National Training Board through an Australian Standards Framework. The key target group in this assessment of the competency area and the focus of this study was the young apprentice who would become a skilled tradesperson in a relatively short period of four years.Supporting the apprentices in the NATAS system were monitors, lecturers, and employer's members of these groups, who together with apprentices were used to gain insights into the new training initiatives.A previous study Williamson, Lowe and Boyd (1990) had looked at the Western Australian New Apprenticeship and Training System (NATAS).

The research activity involved team teaching for a total of two days per week for one school year (1996) with a group of five teachers who were attempting to implement constructivist-referenced innovations such as portfolio assessment, integrated curriculum and teacher collaborative planning in their teaching practice. I chose a narrative methodology including impressionist tales to both conduct and represent this research into my own and others' teaching practices and values - a 'novel' woven from those narratives forms Section Two of this thesis. In addition, five conjectures for further investigation emerged from the research: (1) one significant constraint to constructivist-referenced innovation is 'conceptual inertia' on the part of teachers, (2) students' epistemologies and expectations must be explicitly addressed where innovation is attempted, (3) the complexity of educational contexts extends beyond the mechanical details of schooling to the webs of expectations stakeholders bring to schools, (4) it is difficult for teachers with limited backgrounds in science to use constructivism as a referent in their science teaching, and (5) the narrative methodology chosen has value in providing a rich, complex account of schools, teachers and curricular innovations.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">narrrative methodology,  constructivism, science education.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=11790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sedimentary Processes Involving Aromatic Hydrocarbons</field><field name="creator">Bastow, Trevor</field><field name="description">Sedimentary organic matter contains many compounds that have no obvious biogenic precursors, so their formation and occurrence are of geochemical interest. The first part of this thesis (chapters 2-5) discusses the results obtained from studying hydrocarbon racemates. Some of the compounds identified are also suggested as intermediates in the formation of alkylnaphthalenes identified in chapters 6-7. The second part of this thesis (chapters 6-11) covers the identification of a range of alkylnaphthalenes and alkylphenanthrenes in sedimentary organic matter. Possible pathways for the formation of these hydrocarbons are outlined and their application as probes into the processes of petroleum formation are described.In chapter 2 the use of permethylated cyclodextrin capillary gas chromatography columns to separate hydrocarbon racemates are reported. Chapter 3 reports the synthesis of 1,2,2,5-tetramethyltetralin and 1,2,2,5,6-pentamethyltetralin and identifies them as racemates in crude oil. They are proposed as intermediates in the formation of sedimentary alkylnaphthalenes (identified in chapters 6 and 7).The identification of isodihydro-ar-curcumene in sedimentary organic matter is described in chapters 4 and 5. It co-occurs in crude oil with dihydro-ar-curcumene and is suggested to originate from this compound via a sedimentary rearrangement process. Chiral GC-MS techniques have been used to show the presence of both enantiomers of these compounds in crude oils. The elution order of the enantiomers has been established using reference compounds of known configuration. The effects of maturity and biodegradation on dihydro-ar-curcumene and isodihydro-ar-curcumene enantiomers is reported.

The literature review undertaken for the study revealed much research into restraints showing evidence of the harm they cause, and their ineffectiveness as a safety measure. The literature indicates that the prevalence of restraint use is high - about a third of all hospital patients over the age of eighty-five years may be restrained at some time during the period of their admission.The main emphasis in my investigation was to uncover an understanding of how the use of restraints has remained possible, despite negative reports on their efficacy and questions about their possible abuse of human rights. Primarily, 1 set out to provide vide an understanding of restraint practice, and of how it is maintained and legitimised in a metropolitan teaching hospital.The study was guided by a Foucauldian approach to discourse analysis. The study reports on in depth studies of three patients. The case studies extend beyond observations of the patients to include interviews with members of the multidisciplinary team: nurses, doctors, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. Medical and nursing notes were another source of data.A discursive formation was identified by which restraint use is justified, and legitimised by the health professionals who use it. Five discourses were established, constituting: inability to 'self govern'; an appropriate environment; treatment; duty of care; and marginalisation.The study concludes that restraint use can be understood as a complex discursive practice. Through this discursive practice we can understand how staff maintain a monopoly over the truth and perpetuate claims about the inevitability of restraint use.

As historical coal extraction (bord and pillar) methods did not generally give rise to large scale subsidence, there were very few details on mining subsidence in the Collie Basin available to base any design methodology on. Consequently, the investigation was conducted on a Green fields basis. Firstly, the mechanisms involved in the development of mining subsidence needed to be investigated and identified. It was then necessary to determine the effects that mining subsidence would have on mine and ground mass (specifically aquitards) structures and surface features. Once these two areas of work were completed, design criteria were formulated to manage the effects of mining subsidence by controlling the critical mechanisms of subsidence development.The results from this study have greatly enhanced the level of understanding of the subsidence mechanisms involved, and allowed for the development of predictive models which can be used for the design of coal extraction by the panel/pillar mining method in the Collie Basin.

A preliminary investigation into the standards set by one university revealed that there was no statement, policy or, public document describing an appropriate level of language use; and that the university concerned defined language proficiency entirely in terms of bands, scores or grades provided by external testing organisations.Commencing with the assumption that there is an entry level of English language competence, below which students have little chance of success in their studies (at least, within the accepted timeframe), this qualitative case study into one tertiary institution utilises a number of data collection strategies in order to develop a description or definition of a 'gatekeeper' level of English competence.

The studies sought to determine whether taking the practice test affects performance on later CML assessed tests for first year university students and to determine the characteristics of the most effective CML practice test. The study was carried out in the context of CML testing at Curtin University of Technology. Because data were collected in a real testing environment, the research questions were addressed using a series of small studies, each focusing on a one-semester unit for first year students. Those students who sat a practice test improved their performance from the practice to the assessed test. Further, they outperformed the non practice test group on the assessed test. The effect was statistically significant in eleven of the twelve studies where CML test results were investigated. Student ability, anxiety level, and sex did not affect test performance or choice to sit the practice test. Students preferred to be given the correct answer for an incorrect response and to have a practice test that was the same length as the assessed test but students continued to show improved performance regardless of these conditions. They reported that they used the feedback in a variety of ways including identifying important areas of content, identifying their own error areas and as a motivator for further study. The findings suggest that using the CML system as a formative assessment tool improves student performance on summative assessment. The practice test is contributing to improved performance, however this improvement cannot be attributed to a single factor.

The sedimentary rocks are rich in carbonate minerals and the crude oils were reported to have been derived from carbonate source rocks. These samples are from a variety of geographical origins, geological ages and depositional environments. They consistently contain a homologous series of 30-nor-17 [alpha] (H)-hopanes. Seven homologues (C28 - C34) of the 30-nor-17 [alpha](H)-hopane series have been identified. These compounds appear to be useful biological markers for samples having carbonate associations.A series of 25,30-bisnor-17 [alpha] (H)-hopanes has been observed in a severely biodegraded crude oil of probable carbonate origin. This observation, together with the well-established enrichment of normal hopanes demethylated at position 25 in severely biodegraded crude oils, suggests that the presence of this series of hopanes indicates severe biodegradation of crude oils originating from carbonate-rich source rocks.Another series of hopanes which was previously unreported, the 2-methyl-30-nor-1 [alpha] (H)-hopanes, has also been observed in the carbonate samples. Seven members (C29-C35) of this homologous series have been identified in this study. This series appears to be associated with carbonate rocks deposited under extreme reducing conditions.The biological marker compounds in another sample suite comprising twelve sediments and three crude oils from the North Sumatra Basin, Indonesia, have also been analysed by GC-MS as part of a correlation study.

The purpose of the study is to investigate whether the key governance mechanisms within this process are factors which may contribute to successful reorganization and how they affect a firm's post-bankruptcy performance. Using agency theory, a sample of III filing companies whose plans have been confirmed by the Thai Central Bankruptcy Court during 1999-2002 provide the data of the study. Descriptive statistics and ordinary least squares regression analysis are employed for data analysis. The results indicate that among three types of governance mechanisms in the bankruptcy reorganization process, namely, monitoring, incentive and restructuring mechanisms, monitoring and incentive mechanisms are significant determinants of a firm's post-bankruptcy performance. The key monitoring mechanism is ownership concentration of common shares held by the largest shareholder, whereas the critical incentive mechanisms are cash compensation for the plan administrator and percentage of common shares held by the plan administrator. Asset restructuring is statistically insignificant but positively links to post-bankruptcy performance. The results indicate that these mechanisms can mitigate agency problems of insolvent companies and increase post-bankruptcy performance over a three year period.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">post-bankruptcy performance, insolvent firms, 1940 Thai Bankruptcy Act, governance mechanisms, successful reorganization</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=21411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Restricted spanning trees and graph partitioning.</field><field name="creator">Lam, Bee K.</field><field name="description">A network is a system that involves movement or flow of some commodities such as goods and services. In fact any structure that is in the form of a system of components some of which interact can be considered as a network. In network design the problem is often to construct economical and reliable networks which satisfy certain requirements and which are optimal according to some criterion such as cost, output or performance. Graph theory is useful when the requirements of the network can be expressed in terms of graph parameters, usually as bounds. Some of the graph parameters that have been considered include: degree; distance; diameter; and connectivity. Problems with these parameter restrictions are usually from a class of NP-complete problems with instances that require exponential computer time to solve by available algorithms.The major focus of this thesis is to develop fast and efficient heuristics for some of these NP-complete problems. The two main topics analysed are Restricted Spanning Trees and Graph Partitioning. The aim of the Restricted Spanning Trees section is to construct the most efficient spanning tree (connected network) subject to various degree constraints. These degree constraints imposed are usually in the form of an upper bound. The upper bound represents the maximum number of connections allowed on a particular vertex. The Graph Partitioning section considers the problem of clustering vertices of the graph into sets such that the overall cost of the edges in the different sets is minimised.Chapter 1 provides the notation and terminology used throughout the thesis and a review and summary of the thesis.A literature review of related work that has been carried out to date is presented in Chapter 2. Some of the more promising results are discussed.

Cultural dissonance is defined in this study as:A sense of discord or disharmony, experienced by participants in cultural change where cultural differences are found to occur which are unexpected, unexplained and therefore difficult to negotiate and which inhibit behavioural adaptation.The study utilised case histories of children from forty-seven families. The respondents in the research were the children's parents. The families had emigrated from the United Kingdom to Western Australia during the period 1985-1995.The families reported receiving little information about education systems in Western Australia prior to migration. In the post-migration period, little official information was provided at system or at school level. Because placing the children in schools was a priority for the families, encounters with Western Australian education systems took place within a few weeks of their arrival as migrants.This lack of prior information meant that cultural differences in educational provision were unexpected and unexplained. In particular, families encountered unexpected problems in the appropriate placement of their children in Western Australian schools. Accented English and differences in word usage led to unexpected rejection and teasing. The perceived failure on the part of schools to address these and other differences caused confrontations between parents and many schools and disrupted the children's educational progress. These discordant experiences and difficulties led to what, in this study, is characterised as cultural dissonance.The implications for the study are discussed on two levels.

Even today many areas of shallow inshore ocean, some which encompass potential oil and gas fields, are only minimally charted. There is a need for reconnaissance systems which can effectively direct more expensive detailed surveys to best effect. Remote spectral bathymetry is one such system.A review of candidate sensor systems and processing algorithms highlighted problems due to changing bottom cover types and water quality parameters. A method, proposed and theoretically validated by other workers, was chosen for further investigation. This method develops an approximate relationship between the spectral content of the satellite data and water depths and then, by an iterative phase in the spatial domain, seeks to minimise the effect of spatially dependant variations.A study site in Cockburn Sound, Western Australia was chosen for a demonstration of this method. Spectral data are from the Landsat Thematic Mapper instrument and depth data are taken from Admiralty Charts. A variation on the originally proposed algorithm introduces spatial preprocessing phase, in which the image is segmented into zones where spectral relationships are expected to be more uniform. Two different methods of spatial mapping are used.The results demonstrate the capability of spatial modelling to improve remotely sensed depth estimates in the depth range of 5 to 12 m. The need for further research to better understand the shallow water spectral relationships is identified.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cockburn Sound, Western Australia, satellite remote sensing, passive spectral bathymetry.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=10329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A soft approach to management of information security.</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, Helen L.</field><field name="description">The key theme of this research is the planning and management of information security and in particular, the research focuses on the involvement of information stakeholders in this process.

The rationale for the research was that ethnic minority group students often experience difficulties in adapting to modern science education. The study was restricted to forms three, four and five of the New Zealand education system in order to focus attention primarily on the development of recommendations for enhancement of science education outcomes which relate to the early years of science education.The study aimed to investigate student attitudes towards science and their perceptions of their learning environments by using questionnaire surveys and interviews in order to produce complementary information about students' attitudes and perceptions. The study produced some unexpected findings. For example, Maori and Pacific Island students displayed more positive attitudes towards science than others, and female students displayed more positive attitudes than males. These findings contradict those of many previous studies.The findings of the study are used to provide input to the development of recommendations for the enhancement of educational outcomes for all students, but especially for ethnic minority students in science.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand, secondary school, science education, Pacific Island students, Maori students, attitudes.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=9832</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a mixing device for red mud flocculants.</field><field name="creator">Dougherty, David J.</field><field name="description">The performance of flocculants used in the solid-liquid separation of red mud is often compromised by the methods used to mix the fast acting polymers into the slurry. A simple model of the relationship between flocculant performance and intensity of mixing is proposed and a device for mixing flocculant and slurry has been developed on the basis of the model.The intensity of mixing at the point of distributing the flocculant into the slurry is arguably the most important variable influencing the final flocculant performance. This relationship is established using data from flocculation tests in an agitated tank. The flocculant performance is monitored using an optical sensor and the settling rate of the solid-liquid interface is used as a comparison for the optical sensor. The difficulties, errors and merits of the optical sensor to study the flocculation of red mud and automatic control of flocculation processes are also assessed.The mixing device is connected to a pipe for flocculation tests with red mud. For the tests carried out, a high level of flocculation was recorded.The mixing device combines the flocculant and slurry as thin annular jets directed into one another. The opening for the slurry jet can be altered to provide a variation of the mixing that is achieved. The capability of the device to mix rapidly has been assessed using the diazo coupling reactions between l-naphthol and diazotised sulphanilic acid in alkaline, aqueous solution at room temperature. Variables studied included flow rate and slurry jet opening. Better mixing was indicated at higher flow rates and at reduced jet opening. The use of the diazo coupling reactions for studying micromixing is also assessed.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flocculant performance, mixing device, red mud flocculants.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=9922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A strategy for enhancing girls' attitudes towards professional careers in the mining industry.</field><field name="creator">Somerville Brown, Carolyn M.</field><field name="description">The problem addressed in the study concerned the lack of attraction of girls into professional Mining Industry (MI) careers. The study had four main objectives. The first was to review the literature to determine the reasons why there were so few women currently in MI careers, and then to describe strategies that have been successfully used to increase their participation. It quickly became apparent that while little research could be located relating directly to MI, the broader fields of science, engineering and technology (SET) could be reviewed to include the subset of mining-related careers.The second objective was to determine the attitudes towards MI careers of a select group of Year 10 schoolgirls, with the ability to proceed to the tertiary prerequisites for MI courses. This was accomplished through the development, implementation and statistical analysis of an instrument, the Mining Industry Attitude Survey (MIAS), designed specifically to focus on MI-related careers, rather than SET generally.The third objective was to develop and implement appropriate intervention strategies aimed at enhancing the attitudes of the group of girls, as determined through analyses of MIAS and related research. Under the auspices of the Western Australian School of Mines Engineering and Technology Camp, conducted annually in Kalgoorlie, a program of strategies was adapted and implemented over a period of five days at the residential camp.The final objective of the study was to determine if the intervention program did, in fact, enhance participating girls' attitudes. Using quasi-experimental research methods, quantitative data were collected and analysed from girls attending the camp, as the experimental group, and from applicants that did not attend as the control group.

Through the details of family and social history, I aim to tell another version of settlement of Perth from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. This story belongs to my family, starting with great-grandparents who travelled from London to Australia in the 185Os: one as a convict, one a free settler; both were Jewish, and the convict was Polish.The writing is textured with forgotten voices, is self-reflexive, and tackles the paradoxes involved in telling stories from within the family I belong to, one that resists telling its own stories because of shame and the lack of an authoritative, or socially given, voice. From family history to social history, my interest is in the material that sits on the margins: the unspoken and generally unwritten histories of people on the edges of this society. This material, which is not recorded or spoken, nonetheless "speaks" a shame that shapes the ever-developing identity of a family and a community.The work is informed by feminist ideas about voice and the hierarchy which licenses select people in our society to speak. Relying on the varied materials that sit between historical writing and personal memories, it follows evidence, both written and oral, recognising how malleable memory can be. One of my purposes is to explore ideas about memory, from the individual act of memory to its transmutation into collective memory-to recover, recuperate, and explore what is involved in forgetting and remembering, and do this through a layering of stories, of voices, of form.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Theodore Krakouer, Brina Israel, Perth, Western Australia, fiction, family history.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=10151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of climate on the choice of wool based fabric.</field><field name="creator">Banfield, Gregory J.</field><field name="description">The research question addressed in this study is "what outerwear fabric types are preferred by consumer segments in each of the major climatic zones in Australia?" objectives are to:1. examine consumer preference for fabric in each of the five major climatic zones in Australia, using fabric attribute levels as the choice criteria, in order to provide information to Stormboy on fabric attributes most preferred by consumers, and the market segments in each zone, based on these fabric attribute preferences; and2. determine any significant differences in fabric preference between the climatic zones so as to indicate to Stormboy whether climate should be taken into consideration in the marketing of wool based fabric.This information on preference for fabric type, will enable Stormboy design wool based fabrics that match the fabric attribute requirement of consumers. The information on market segments will not only provide the fabric attribute requirements but also the possible size of the market.This study will develop a method to monitor consumer trends in fabric preference so that Stormboy can make informed decisions about their design and choice of wool based fabric.This study provides the required consumer information to Stormboy. It illustrates a method of research which can be used in decisions making by producers of products or services where there is heterogeneity in buyers' preferences, for:the development of new products or services;the renewal of a product or service;the positioning of a product or service; andthe ongoing monitoring of consumer preferences and retail compatibility with consumer preferences.As Green and Kreiger (1985) conclude, once preference and segments have been identified companies can react to (or possibly produce to) preference heterogeneity by modifications of their current product/service attributes (including price), distribution, and ++</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumer preference, wool based fabric, wool fabric, climate.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=10198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The business idea: problems of readiness and abandonment as a prerequisite to scenario thinking and planning.</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Paul</field><field name="description">Documenting organisational history and heritage, it is argued, is an increasingly critical precursor to effective corporate and scenario planning. This study proposes that organisational history and heritage can be encapsulated in any local setting through the application of van der Heijden's (1996) conceptual framework i.e. the "business" idea. The study demonstrates that documenting the organisational business idea in use is a valid and meaningful planning activity. Secondly, the possession of multiple perspectives on the business idea in use, means that current and future planning teams will collectively be better informed, more competent and ready to abandon established ways of doing business and to strategise about unknown futures.Interpretivist methodology utilising an embedded single case study method was applied to an organisation undergoing change: the Family Planning Association of Western Australia, Inc. (FPWA). A stratified sample of thirty-four members from FPWA's institutional (Board of Management), corporate, organisational (service managers and coordinators) and technical (service delivery) organisational levels were interviewed, with the intent of capturing broad perceptions from each organisational level of the derived categories of the business idea framework. The categories investigated were those of organisational purpose, customer value created, distinctive competencies, competitive advantage, organisational uniqueness, positive and negative forces, and results. The study sought evidence to support each of the derived categories, as well as looking to elaborate on the process and task of business idea investigation and articulation.Interview outcomes were transcribed, coded and analysed using NUD*IST, the intent being to craft a consolidated model of the business idea in use at FPWA.

Problems in this class are typically concerned with selecting from a set of given items, each with a specified weight and value, a subset of items whose weight sum does not exceed a prescribed capacity and whose value is maximum. The specific problem that arises depends on the number of knapsacks (single or multiple) to be filled and on the number of available items of each type (bounded or unbounded). The classical 0-1Knapsack Problem arises when there is one knapsack and one item of each type.Knapsack Problems have been intensively studied over the past forty years because of their direct application to problems arising in industry (for example, cargo loading, cutting stock, and budget control) and also for their contribution to the solution methods for integer programming problems.Several exact algorithms based on branch and bound and dynamic programming have been proposed to solve the Knapsack Problems. For some types of data instances, very efficient algorithms have been found. However, a number of hard knapsack instances have been identified. For example, subset sum and strongly correlated data types. This has motivated some researchers to develop specialized algorithms for particular hard problems.This thesis considers a number of hard Knapsack Problems with a single constraint. A number of specialized algorithms are developed. Our work focuses on some hard instances of the 0-1Knapsack Problem, the Bounded Knapsack Problem, the Unbounded Knapsack Problem and the Change-Making Problem.Chapter 1 provides the background of the Knapsack Problem including some important Knapsack Problems and standard types of data instances, terminology, and a summary of our work.

Newly erupted permanent molars are particularly at risk. Oral hygiene measures have been shown to be able to reduce the incidence of caries. The aim of this study was to compare the caries preventive effects of a professional tooth cleaning and oral health education programme (test) with a standard preventive programme (comparison), comprising selective fissure sealing and application of topical fluorides on newly erupted first permanent molars. School Dental Service clinics of the Health Department of Western Australia, in Perth, were assigned to test (4)or comparison (4) clinics. Schoolchildren, mean age 6.3 plus or minus 0.3 (s) yr with, sound, newly erupted first permanent molars were included in the study (n=404; 207 test; 197 control).Children were examined after twelve and twenty-four months by an examiner who was 'blind' to the test or control status of the children. After twelve months, 186 test and 163 control children were examined, and after twenty-four months, 179 test and 156 control children were examined. Three hundred and twenty children were examined in both years. After twenty-four months, 32 children in test and 31 children in control developed caries of the first permanent molars, the estimated risk ratio was 0.90 (95% CI 0.58, 1.41); and children in the test group had an average DFT score of 0.30 plus or minus 0.75 compared with 0.30 plus or minus 0.70 DFT in the control group (t-test, p=0.96).

Many mathematics teachers are very dissatisfied with the level of understanding displayed by students who pass traditional examinations. The Keller Plan requires mastery demonstrated by almost perfect performance on a sequence of tests which students repeat until they reach the high standard required.The study compared students in the same mathematics subject in the year before a change to Keller Plan teaching, and in the year of the change. Achievement scores, defined in terms of the completeness and consistency of solutions to test problems on the whole of the syllabus, were higher for the Keller Plan group. Measures of attitudes and approaches to study, which were positively related to achievement, indicated that the Keller Plan group had stronger intrinsic motivation, and more diligent study methods. Their confidence tended to be lower than that of the traditionally taught group, but was not low in absolute, and appreciation of the greater challenge of the Keller Plan appeared to be worked out via diligence.

The purpose of seismic data acquisition is to record these effects in such a manner that their relation with the initial disturbance can be interpreted as a guide to the earth's subsurface structure (Nettleton, 1940).The validity of data interpretation depends upon the fidelity of recording. A better seismic interpretation can result from correctly collected data using instrumentation which faithfully records the seismic signal. Subsequent computer processing cannot reconstruct information which is not contained in the recorded field data. Hence, the quality of field data recording must be at an optimum level, otherwise the result will be an inferior interpretation (Donnell,1957).A reflection seismic data acquisition system was assembled and put into operation. The basic instrument was a Texas Instruments DFS IV, obtained from marine vessel M/V Banksia, and commissioned for land application.The system was tested and evaluated. The instrument analog filter phase distortion was studied in detail. The study indicated that phase distortion can be a major cause of seismic misties. Without a knowledge of the particular recording instrumentation filter transfer function, data processing bureaux may not compensate for phase distortion effects adequately (Gray et al., 1968).Once testing was completed satisfactorily, the operational system was applied to several practical field situations of commercial standard. A series of noise studies was performed to evaluate not only source generated noise, but also to study the effect of different types of energy sources on seismic data.

This is a more in-depth and participant-orientated focus than some past research. Past GSS research has been dominated by single occasion usage with settings often involving student subjects. Longitudinal research is necessary because changes take place over time and groups, teams, and meetings are ongoing. Research in field settings is necessary to acknowledge the complexity of real world GSS activity and improve the relevance of findings to GSS practice and research.An original and significant aspect of the research was that the inquiry process was conducted in an interpretivist paradigm where emphasis was placed on participants' constructions of the GSS experience. An inductive approach was adopted where findings were grounded in, and generated from, qualitative data. The criteria for assessment of the relevance and rigour of the research were credibility, transferability, confirmability and dependability (Guba &amp; Lincoln, 1989). The primary research data came from in-depth interviews with participants.The field setting concerned a group of seven participants from a local government organization, meeting face-to-face, and undertaking a strategic planning task. The process of the strategic planning task involved five GSS sessions held at the GSS Facility at Curtin University in Perth. Active process and technical facilitation was provided by an experienced two person facilitation team, who were external to the client organisation.There were two major findings.

An optimisation problem often posed to achieve this result is to minimise the array processor mean output power (or variance) subject to a fixed response in the array look direction. The look direction requirement can be met by imposing a set of linear constraints on the processor weights to yield what is known as the Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) processor. It has been found, however, that LCMV processors are susceptible to errors in the assumed direction of arrival of the desired signal. To achieve robustness against directional mismatch, additional constraints known as derivative constraints can be introduced. These constraints force the first and second order spatial derivatives of the array power response in the look direction to zero. However, constraints corresponding to necessary and sufficient (NS) conditions for these spatial derivatives to be zero are in general quadratic, and the resulting weight vector solution space is non-convex. One approach to this complex problem has been to consider conditions which are only sufficient for the spatial derivatives to be zero. Whilst this results in linear constraints, it exhibits certain anomalous behaviour, for example, dependence on the choice of array phase centre.Recent work in the area of derivative constraints has resulted in a method for efficiently solving the non-convex output power minimisation problem with quadratic derivative constraints. The optimisation problem addressed assumes that the input signal statistics and hence the input signal autocorrelation matrix R are known.

Approximately 80% of the Australian continent is covered by regolith that contains some of the most conductive clays on Earth. As a result, frequency-domain methods are only effective for near surface investigations and time-domain methods, that are capable of deeper exploration, require the measurement of very small, late-time signals. Both methods suffer from the fact that the currents in the conductive Earth layers contribute a large portion of the total measured signal that may mask the signal from a conductive target. In the search for non-layered structures, this form of geological noise is the greatest impediment to the success of EM surveys in conductive terrains. Over the years a range of data acquisition and processing techniques have been used in an effort to enhance the response of the non-layered target and thereby increase the likelihood of its detection.The combined use of a variety of survey configurations to assist exploration and interpretation is not new and is practiced regularly. The active nature of EM exploration means that the measured response is determined to a large degree by the way in which the Earth is energised. Geological structures produce different responses to different stimuli. In this work, two new methods of data combination are used to transform the measured data into a residual quantity that enhances the signature of non-layered geological structures. Based on the concept of data redundancy and tested using the results of numerical modelling, the new combinations greatly increase the signal to noise ratio for targets located in a conductive environment by reducing the layered Earth contribution.

The rearing environments included aquaria under controlled laboratory conditions, cages in purpose-built commercial ponds, purpose-built earthen ponds and battery culture called the intensive crayfish culture system (ICCS).High levels of dietary cod liver oil in the semi-purified diet depressed the specific growth rates of juvenile marron under laboratory conditions. The dietary lipid levels were reflected in the lipid levels of the hepatopancreas of the marron. Dietary fatty acid profiles were also reflected in the fatty acid profiles of the hepatopancreas and subsequently in the tail muscles. Under cage environment in a purpose-built pond, dietary supplementation with cod liver oil (4%) plus sunflower oil (4%) increased the total biomass of juvenile marron. The specific growth rate under these condition had a strong positive correlation with all condition indices measured in the study (dry and wet hepatosomatic indices, dry and wet tail muscles to body weight ratio and moisture content of the hepatopancreas and tail muscles). The lack of protein in formulated practical diets, under commercial farm conditions, did not significantly influence the specific growth of juvenile marron but a diet containing fish protein source and fish oil resulted in a significantly higher survival. Feeding a diet containing fish protein and fish oil resulted in significantly higher wet tail muscles to body weight ratio than was observed with other diets. The inclusion of plant protein in formulated diets had an impact on the pond environment due to significantly higher ammonia levels that resulted in lower survival.

Merging these perspectives into a viable foundation for our classroom practices led to the successful development of our collaborative peer interactive classroom learning environment.Working in groups of three or four, the students developed their social norms and utilised a collaborative approach to their learning of mathematics. Groups engaged in discussion, explanation, negotiation, peer teaching, giving help, receiving help and consensus building as part of their daily routine in our classroom. I kept qualitative and quantitative records of our progress as we worked to improve our collaborative peer interactive classroom learning environment during the first six months of the school year. I collected daily fieldnotes, audio and video recordings, observations taken by researcher colleagues, learning environment surveys and a variety of other artefacts. All of this data was analysed daily, weekly and monthly, so producing the monthly narratives upon which we based our determination of the success of this implementation.By adopting a Vygotskian perspective we utilised our peer interactive environment to develop and enhance 'scientific' and 'everyday' concepts through individual and group dynamic, overlapping (multiple) 'zones of proximal development' as well as our classwide 'zone of proximal development'. Our constructivist perspective aided us in focusing on our prior knowledge and experiences, which in turn enhanced the effectiveness of our collaborative ++</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interactive learning, highschool students, collaborative learning, mathematics education.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=9735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical models and numerical techniques for plasticity flows of granular media.</field><field name="creator">Collinson, Roger</field><field name="description">A mathematical study has been undertaken to model various kinds of granular flows including the perfect plasticity flow and the viscous elasto-plasticity flow. The work is mainly based on the double-shearing theory originated by Spencer and developed by many others. The focus of the project is on the formulation of the theory, the construction of mathematical models and the development of robust simulation techniques.Based on a general formulation of the double-shearing theory, the perfect plasticity flow is shown to be governed by a set of highly nonlinear first order hyperbolic partial differential equations with two distinct characteristics. A sophisticated numerical algorithm is then developed based on the method of characteristics to determine the stress discontinuity and the velocity and stress fields. With the method developed, a numerical study is then undertaken to model the flow of granular materials in a hopper in the presence of stress discontinuity and to investigate the influence of various parameters on the distribution of hopper wall pressures.Utilising the double shearing theory, a set of stress-strain constitutive equations in explicit form has been derived, which makes it possible to formulate the double-shearing theory within the framework of the finite element method. Thus, consequently, a sophisticated finite element technique has been developed to solve the general boundary value problem governing the viscous elasto-plasticity flows obeying the double-shearing theory. Numerical implementation of the frictional boundary condition is also presented. The model is then illustrated with a numerical example demonstrating the influence of wall friction on the distribution of pressures on silo walls throughout the dynamic process of material discharge from silos.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematical models, numerical techniques, granular flows.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=10697</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanism of gibbsite crystal growth in Bayer liquor.</field><field name="creator">Lee, Mei-yin</field><field name="description">Although the precipitation of aluminium trihydroxide as gibbsite, via the Bayer process has been widely studied, the mechanism of crystal growth is poorly understood. This work focus on the morphology of gibbsite and the relative growth rates of individual crystal faces.Initial work was carried out to characterize aluminium trihydroxide and it was found that bayerite, another polymorph, precipitated at temperatures below 50 [degrees] C and its morphology depended on the method of precipitation. Gibbsite however, precipitated above this temperature and its morphology depended on the type of alkali aluminate solutions used. The method of precipitation does not affect the morphology, only the size of the precipitate formed. The morphology of gibbsite can be altered by the addition of organic compounds which are known to inhibit gibbsite precipitation. Some of these compounds were found to selectively inhibit the growth of individual crystal faces, thus altering the overall morphology of gibbsite. Boehmite, a polymorph of aluminium hydroxide, can be produced by partial dehydration of gibbsite at 300T. The morphology of boehmite consisted of diamond shaped crystals.The influence of cation incorporation on the morphology of gibbsite was studied experimentally and computationally (molecular modelling). These studies showed that there is a linear relationship between the amount of cation incorporated and atomic radii and between the amount of cation incorporated and the defect energy calculated. The equilibrium morphology of gibbsite predicted in the absence of media matched the morphology of gibbsite grown slowly from sodium aluminate, implying that the amount of sodium incorporation is low in these crystals.The growth rates of individual crystal faces were measured in situ, and found to be a function of supersaturation squared for the prismatic faces, possibly indicating ++</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gibbsite crystal growth, Bayer liquor,  Bayer process.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=10719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variable selection in principal component analysis : using measures of multivariate association.</field><field name="creator">Sithole, Moses M.</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the problem of selection of important variables in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in such a way that the selected subsets of variables retain, as much as possible, the overall multivariate structure of the complete data. Throughout the thesis, the criteria used in order to meet this requirement are collectively referred to as measures of Multivariate Association (MVA). Most of the currently available selection methods may lead to inappropriate subsets, while Krzanowskis (1987) M(subscript)2-Procrustes criterion successfully identifies structure-bearing variables particularly when groups are present in the data. Our major objective, however, is to utilize the idea of multivariate association to select subsets of the original variables which preserve any (unknown) multivariate structure that may be present in the data.The first part of the thesis is devoted to a study of the choice of the number of components (say, k) to be used in the variable selection process. Various methods that exist in the literature for choosing k are described, and comparative studies on these methods are reviewed. Currently available methods based exclusively on the eigenvalues of the covariance or correlation matrices, and those based on cross-validation are unsatisfactory. Hence, we propose a new technique for choosing k based on the bootstrap methodology. A full comparative study of this new technique and the cross-validatory choice of k proposed by Eastment and Krzanowski (1982) is then carried out using data simulated from Monte Carlo experiment.The remainder of the thesis focuses on variable selection in PCA using measures of MVA.

The CPIPP was designed to improve children's pedestrian safety knowledge, their road related behaviors - crossing and playing, and to reduce their risk in, and exposure to, traffic. This thesis addresses the process evaluation of the CPIPP school-based intervention. The Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee provided ethics approval for this project.Evaluation of previous school-based pedestrian safety programs has focused mainly on assessing outcomes with little or no process evaluation. An absence of process evaluation increases the likelihood of Type III error, that is, incorrectly attributing null or weak outcomes to a program that has not been adequately implemented.In each of the three study years, following a teacher training, teachers were asked to implement the school-based intervention. Each year this comprised nine 40-minute pedestrian safety lessons and home activities. Lessons included road crossing practise on real and simulated roads.Data were collected from the student cohort (n=1049) and their Grade 2, 3 and 4 teachers. Four process evaluation instruments were developed and administered in each of the three study years. These included one student instrument (work samples) and three teacher instruments (lesson log, teacher post-implementation questionnaire and classroom observation).

Specifically, the research investigated the sexuality knowledge, attitudes and skills of parents to provide education to their pre-school (5 years of age) or year seven (12 years of age) children. Investigation of parents' active participation in the sexuality education of their children and analysis of the factors which determined their involvement was the main objective of the study. The comfort level of parents in their communication with their children and plans for further sexuality education were also considered. Predictive models of sexuality communication were empirically tested and from this a conceptual model was derived which explicates sexuality education in the home.The research involved both a qualitative and quantitative approach to the investigation of parents' contribution to the future sexual health of their children. The first phase of the study involved focus group interviews with 11 parents to discuss their issues and concerns in providing sexuality education. Thematic analysis of the focus groups and review of the literature informed development of the instrument used in the second phase of the study.Face validity of the instrument was established and 371 parents participated in phase two of the study. One hundred and ninety five (195) mothers and 176 fathers responded voluntarily to an anonymous, self-administered questionnaire on their involvement in their child's sexuality education.In the second phase of the study the instrument used included demographic data and general questions regarding sexuality education.

The existing ward stock drug distribution system was assessed and a new system designed based on a novel use of failure mode and effects analysis. The existing system was compared to the new unit supply individual patient dispensing system on two wards in terms of medication errors, nursing time, pharmacy time, drug costs, drug security and nurses' opinion. A review of a one year sample of reports submitted under the existing incident reporting scheme was also undertaken. Errors were categorised according to drug group, error type, reason cited for the error, and probability ranking (probability of occurrence, detection and harm). In addition, a "no-blame" medication error reporting scheme was implemented and assessed.Results of the study showed that in the newly designed individual patient dispensing system there was a reduction in nursing time associated with medication activities of approximately 29%, an increase in pharmacy staff time of 64%, a reduction in drug costs and an increase in drug security. Using the disguised observer methodology a reduction in medication errors by 23.5% (including timing errors) and 7.3% (excluding timing errors) was seen on Ward A. Similarly a reduction of 21.1% (including timing errors) and 9.8% (excluding timing errors) was observed on Ward B. Significant support for the individual patient dispensing system was given by nursing staff. Of the errors self-reported under the existing incident/accident reporting scheme the most common type of error was omissions (32.2%), the most common drug group was cardiovascular drugs (19.8%), and the most common cause of the error cited was a faulty check (42.3%).

A constructivist-related theory of pedagogical reform was derived from the research literature in the fields of teacher cognition and conceptual change theory for the purpose of facilitating the radical reconstruction of teachers' centralist classroom roles and the development of pedagogies aimed at enhancing students' conceptual development. The thesis reports a collaborative action research study which was conducted with a teacher of high school mathematics who attempted to develop a constructivist- oriented teaching approach in his Grade 12 mathematics class.An interpretive research approach (Erickson, 1986) was employed to generate an understanding of the complex network of teacher beliefs and their constraining influence on the radical reform of the teacher's centralist pedagogy. An emergent research focus was the efficacy of the theory of pedagogical reform, especially its underpinning constructivist theory which shaped my discourse with the teacher during the collaborative phase of the study. Data were obtained from classroom participant- observations, teacher and student interviews, the teacher's report on the study, and an application of the repertory grid technique that was designed to investigate the teacher's implicit pedagogical beliefs.The major pedagogical reforms that resulted from the collaborative phase of the study included (1) the teacher's adoption of the role of teacher as learner; and (2) the refinement, rather than radical reform, of his centralist classroom role of teacher as informer.

Plasmid-mediated resistance to cationic agents, which are important biocides, has been described in antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Multi-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are often found to express resistance to a range of cationic biocides including quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), biguanides, diamidino compounds, cationic dyes and nuclear stains. Three resistance determinants, qacA, qacB and smr genes, have been identified that confer resistance to cationic biocides in staphylococci. These genes encode multi-drug efflux pumps that remove the cationic biocides from the cytoplasm using a membrane bound pumping mechanism dependent on the cell's proton-motive force (PMF). This prevents the build up of lethal concentrations of cationic compounds within the cytoplasm avoiding cell death.This research project has focused on the S. aureus strain WBG4364, a transcipient strain carrying the cationic biocide resistant plasmid pWBG1773. The plasmid encodes resistance to several QACs, including benzalkonium chloride and CTAB, and cationic dyes rhodamine 6G, crystal violet and safranin O but not to the dye ethidium bromide and therefore differing from other cationic biocide resistant plasmids previously identified in staphylococci (Emslie et al. 1986). This unique phenotype was further classified in this study alongside those strains carrying the qac gene families, qacA/B and smr.Plasmid pWBG1773 was cloned, sequenced and analysed to reveal a unique plasmid of 2,916 bp in length. Plasmid pWBG1773 was placed with the pC194 family of rolling-circle replicating plasmids.

While the modified Austin bunionectomy and the Youngswick osteotomy/cheilectomy respectively, are often used to correct these conditions, insufficient research has been published regarding the effects of these procedures on plantar pressure distribution of the foot. This thesis involves a series of six studies investigating topics relating to radiographic measurements and plantar pressure distribution over a two-year period, in normal feet and in hallux valgus and hallux limitus feet before and after corrective surgery.A review of the literature is presented relating to the development of plantar pressure measurement technology, the aetiology and surgical management of hallux valgus and hallux limitus, the reliability of the EMED system used in the studies, and the related clinical uses of plantar pressure measurement.An initial study was designed to investigate the reliability measurements using a simplified two-step method of data collection as compared to the traditional mid-gait technique of ten normal asymptomatic subjects. Intra-class correlation coefficients were calculated and compared for the pressure variables of contact area, contact time, maximum force and peak pressure of ten regions of the foot.A study to determine normal reference range values for the EMED-SF system was then conducted using thirty healthy subjects and the two-step method of data collection. Descriptive statistical reporting of peak pressure, mean pressure and pressure-time- integrals were presented for ten regions of the foot.Three related studies on radiographic and plantar pressure measurement differences, and their relationships were made using thirty normal, hallux valgus and hallux limitus feet.

A self-administered baseline questionnaire was completed by 556 mothers prior to discharge. Those mothers who were breast-feeding at the time of completing the baseline questionnaire were followed-up by telephone interview at 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 and 24 weeks postpartum, or until they ceased to breast-feed.In total, 88.1% of mothers commenced breast-feeding whilst in hospital. On discharge from hospital 83.8% of women were breast-feeding either fully (77.7%) or partially (6.1%) but by six months this figure had decreased to 49.9% of mothers breast-feeding.Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine which factors were associated with the initiation of breast-feeding. There was a strong association between the father's reported preference for breast-feeding and the initiation of breast-feeding (OR=10.18). The Cox's proportional hazards model was used to estimate the effect of independent variables on the duration of breast-feeding. The factor most strongly associated with breast-feeding duration was intended duration. Women who intended to breast-feed for less than four months were more likely to stop breast-feeding at any time compared with women who intended to breast-feed for at least four months (RR=5.01).The results of this study suggest that breast-feeding initiation and duration rates in Perth have remained relatively stable over the last decade. However, breast-feeding duration continues to fall well short of the target of 80% of infants being either partially or fully breast-fed at six months.

At the high transmission bit rates that these systems use, the mobile radio channel exhibits frequency-selective fading characteristics. Under such conditions, the received signal could experience significant intersymbol interference (ISI) from severe distortion to the waveform of the received baseband signal. Therefore, such techniques as adaptive waveform equalisation or adaptive maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) are used in modern digital mobile radio telephone systems to combat this undesirable ISI. These adaptive schemes have almost always been used in conjunction with coherent demodulation in the receivers.This study examines the application of noncoherent demodulation, in the form of frequency discriminator detection, as an alternative to coherent demodulation. The GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) standard has been used as the basis for this investigation. It has been shown analytically that in the presence of frequency-selective fading, a propagation environment common to the GSM system, the use of frequency discriminator detection gives rise to nonlinear ISI in the demodulated signal. It has also been shown that frequency-selective fading could cause large unwanted "spikes" to appear in the demodulated signal, thus leading to a severe degradation in the bit-error-rate (BER) performance. Consequently, several waveform distortion cancellation schemes for combatting the nonlinear ISI have been formulated. The BER performances of these proposed schemes, under various propagation conditions, have been studied by computer simulation.Furthermore, it has been observed that the undesirable "spikes", that occur in the demodulated signal due to frequency-selective fading, could be ++</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">digital mobile radio telephone, frequency-selective fading, frequency discriminator detection.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of achievement, attitudes, teaching practices and learning environments in secondary school science laboratory classes in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Waldrip, Bruce Gordon</field><field name="description">The study combined qualitative methods (observation, interview and case study techniques) and quantitative methods (use of questionnaire and survey instruments) methods to (a) identify and describe current teaching practices in Papua New Guinea (PNG) secondary science laboratory classrooms; (b) investigate the effect of specific teaching practices on academic success on an external science achievement examinaton; and (c) investigate whether an educational productivity model for investigating factors associated with learning is applicable to a developing country context, namely, PNG.

Many of these reforms arose as a result of demands placed on governments for improved use of public funds. These reforms, which have been wide ranging, have involved important improvements in the methods in which public sector agencies collect and report information related to accountability, particularly in the area of performance measurement. This study seeks to add to the literature on public sector accountability and performance measurement by undertaking a comparative cross-country study involving Australia and Malaysia, a developed and a developing country. Each of these countries have adopted, in varying degrees, reforms to their public sector reporting mechanisms as a result of major demands for changes to public sector funding, accountability and reporting methods. Within the study, a multiple theory approach is undertaken which uses aspects of both agency theory and institutional theory to provide a more informed understanding of the impact specific influential parties have on the level of disclosure and dissemination of accountability related information. This study examines the impact of agency and institutional related variables on the extent and frequency of the disclosure and dissemination of performance measurement information by Australian and Malaysian government departments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public sector accountability and performance measurement, Australia, Malaysia, agency theory, institutional theory, government departments</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=116043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catalysed aeration of reduced ilmenite.</field><field name="creator">Ward, Justin M.</field><field name="description">A study has been conducted on the aeration of reduced ilmenite with emphasis on increasing the aeration speed and understanding the mechanism of the aeration based on laboratory scale experiments. These issues were highlighted by comparing the currently operating Becher process which incorporates the use of an ammonium chloride catalyst in the aeration process.The speed of production of synthetic rutile from the Becher process is currently dictated by the time the reduced ilmenite remains in the aeration tank. As these times can vary greatly for no obvious reason, experiments were conducted to find which parameters could be changed to increase the speed of leaching. It was found that by increasing the oxygen content to 100 per cent the aeration time was reduced by at least half.By replacing ammonium chloride with various other amine compounds as the catalyst it was found there was a relationship between pK[subscript]a and aeration time. It was also found that the more sterically hindered the amine group, the slower the leaching. The use of ethylenediammonium chloride has shown that, when used at two thirds of the ammonium chloride concentration, aeration can be completed an hour (17%) faster than with the ammonium chloride catalyst. Furthermore, when ethylenediammonium chloride was used with a 100 per cent oxygen gas flow the aeration time was reduced by two thirds.Other compounds that did not contain amine groups were also investigated as catalysts in reduced ilmenite aerations. Of those tested only a citric acid / trisodium citrate mixture managed to aerate the reduced ilmenite substantially faster than the standard ammonium chloride catalyst. Other compounds with similar structure to the citrate ion failed to aid the aeration at all.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">catalysed aeration, reduced ilmenite.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=10316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance enhancement of AC machines and permanent magnet generators for sustainable energy applications.</field><field name="creator">Chen, Jianyi</field><field name="description">Sustainable energy solutions are aimed to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels by using renewable energy sources and energy efficiency techniques. This thesis presents two new sustainable energy applications in the field of electrical machines.Polyphase induction motors dominate the energy usage spectrum for industrial and commercial applications. The conventional winding structure used in both synchronous and induction machines has a basic unit of the winding with a 60 degree phase belt and a three phase connection either in star or delta. A new winding structure using an innovative Star-Delta Series Connection (SDSC) which has a high winding coefficient and low harmonic content is presented in this thesis. The principle of the SDSC winding is described. The Electro-Magnetic Belt and Electro-Magnetic Space diagram are two important means to be used for optimization of the new winding. Experimental results from two prototypes confirm the theoretical analysis. The efficiency of the new machine at rated load increased by about 3.8% as compared to the standard machine with a conventional winding structure.Wind energy is one of the most attractive renewable energy options. Wind turbines are designed to couple either synchronous or asynchronous generators with various forms of direct or indirect connection with grid or diesel generators. Permanent magnet (PM) generators using high energy Neodymium- Iron-Boron magnets offer advantages such as direct coupling without gear box, absence of excitation winding and slip rings, light weight and smaller size. This thesis presents the design and development of an outer-rotor PM generator suitable for wind energy conversion. The initial electromagnetic design followed by a Finite Element Analysis is presented in detail. A 20 kW prototype machine was built and extensively tested.

This approach is limited, however, by the transfer characteristics and errors in the implementation of practical analogue sub-systems. These practical limitations result in undesirable in-band frequency-dependent shaping of the transmitted signals. In the case of FM (Frequency Modulation) signals, this leads to the generation of unwanted side-lobes in the transmitted RF signal spectrum that interfere with signals in adjacent frequency channels. This results in the transmitted signal failing to meet transmission standards requirements.The digital compensation techniques developed and presented in this thesis allow the reduction of undesirable in-band frequency-dependent signal shaping. It is shown that this enables strict requirements on the spectral emissions from the FM transmitter to be met using a flexible and cost effective DSP based modulator system.The contributions of the thesis are in three primary areas:(i) The development of a structure for frequency dependent digital compensation.(ii) The formulation and solution of an optimisation problem that allows the free parameters within the structure to be determined such that effective reduction of unwanted in-band frequency-dependent signal shaping is achieved.(iii) The development of techniques that allow the digital compensation procedure to be successfully implemented on a practical DSP platform.The new digital compensation structure that is proposed uses two digital FIR (Finite ++</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">digital compensation,  frequency modulation signals, digital  quadrature modulators.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=9787</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of reading performance on high school science achievement.</field><field name="creator">Ireland, Julie D.</field><field name="description">This study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between student reading performance and achievement in science. Many students have difficulties comprehending written materials presented to them in science and many tests used to measure achievement in science rely heavily on reading ability. Students may have trouble demonstrating their science knowledge due to their lack of reading skills.In this study, the reading ages and science achievement scores of students were calculated. Twenty activity cards used to teach the science topic Plants and Animals were modified to reduce the language difficulty level. All students in two Year 8 science classes used the modified activity cards and modified science achievement measures. Five students were selected to form a sub-sample of the class group for in-depth observations, interviews, and analysis. These students were low performance readers who achieved poorly on science topic tests even though they had excellent work habits. The student reading ages in the class groups ranged from 8 years 1 month to above 16 years 10 months.The reading performance data were found to correlate significantly with science achievement as measured on topic tests. Class 1 produced a correlation coefficient of 0.46, while Class 2 produced a correlation coefficient of 0.75. In this study it appears that science achievement is related to reading performance.Qualitative analysis of data from the five students in the sub-sample showed that the modified activity cards were relatively easy to use. Students could work on the cards independently. This study demonstrated that textual material needs to be presented at an appropriate reading level for independent learning to occur.All of the students in the sub-sample demonstrated improved science achievement on the modified Plants and Animals topic test.

Several new problems and conjectures are stated.A union-closed collection of sets is a collection of sets which contains the union of each pair of sets in the collection. A completely separating system of sets is a collection of sets in which for each pair of elements of the universal set, there exists a set in the collection which contains the first element but not the second, and another set which contains the second element but not the first. An antichain (Sperner Family) is a collection of distinct sets in which no set is a subset of another set in the collection. The size of an antichain is the number of sets in the collection. The volume of an antichain is the sum of the cardinalities of the sets in the collection. A flat antichain is an antichain in which the difference in cardinality between any two sets in the antichain is at most one.The two outstanding conjectures considered are:The union-closed sets conjecture - In any union-closed collection of non-empty sets there is an element of the universal set in at least half of the sets in the collection;The flat antichain conjecture - Given an antichain with size s and volume V, there is a flat antichain with the same size and volume.Union-closed collections are considered in two ways. Improvements are made to the previously known bounds concerning the minimum size of a counterexample to the union-closed sets conjecture. Results are derived on the minimum size of a union-closed collection generated by a given number of k-sets. An ordering on sets is described, called order R and it is conjectured that choosing a collection of m k-sets in order R will always minimise the size of the union-closed collection generated by m k-sets.Several variants on completely separating systems of sets are considered.

It is divided into two sections. Section A reports on studies of the saturate UCM and Section B reports on studies of the aromatic UCM. UCMs are mixtures of very large numbers of compounds of low individual abundances, hence structural information on individual components is difficult or impossible to obtain using conventional GC or GC-MS techniques. The investigations reported in this thesis used a combination of GC-MS techniques (Section A) and oxidations of UCMs followed by GC-MS characterisation of the oxidation products (Section B) to develop a more detailed picture of the structures of components of the saturate and aromatic UCMs. UCMs are present in all crude oils, and may account for the vast majority of the material present in heavily weathered or biodegraded oils. An understanding of the types of compounds present may have a bearing on the refining processes an oil is subjected to, as well as assessing its potential environmental and toxicological effects.Single branched C(subscript)18 isomers were prepared to establish the chromatographic behaviour and mass spectral fragmentation patterns of open chain compounds with ethyl-, propyl-, butyl- and pentyl- substituents. All open chain structural isomers with a single n-alkyl branch larger than methyl in the range C(subscript)10 to C(subscript)20 were identified at each carbon number in a series of crude oils of varying ages, source types and depositional environments. Also, C(subscript)21 to C(subscript)25 structural isomers containing an ethyl branch were identified in all of these samples. This represents a total of 163 compounds.

Specifically, it combined studies of the physical and psychosocial learning environments operating within these 'technological settings' and investigated interactions among the selected physical and psychosocial factors in influencing students' satisfaction with their learning. Further, the study described how both the physical and psychosocial domains may effectively enable, or alternatively, constrain the teaching methodologies used in these classrooms. The study involved two phases of investigation. The first phase involved a broad examination of the learning environment as measured with a questionnaire containing items measuring aspects of the psychosocial learning environment and with ergonomic site evaluations using a specially designed worksheet and inventory for computerised classrooms. In the second phase of the study, interactions among the physical and psychosocial variables in these measures were explored through the use of selected and detailed case studies from the original sample. Case studies included a more detailed assessment of the physical classroom environment in tandem with classroom observations and student/teacher interviews. The study was conducted in Australian and Canadian secondary schools and so, offers additional insights in the different approaches to technology implementation and teaching practice. The results of the study reveal a number of statistically significant and independent associations between physical and psychosocial factors and further, between psychosocial factors and students' satisfaction with learning.

This viscometer consists of a rotating ribbed rotor surrounded by a stationary slotted sleeve; this system is then placed eccentrically within an inclined rotating bowl. It, is claimed that this overcomes most of the difficulties encountered when attempting to obtain accurate measurements for these types of mixtures. If the mixture being sheared within the annulus does not represent the true composition of the slurry being, tested then the results are expected to be inaccurate. The presence of sediment at the bottom of the rotor or the formation of large masses of particles within the flow domain will affect the accuracy of the measurements obtained. This dissertation studies the amount of flow through the slotted sleeve and the region, or regions, of low shear rate within the flow domain. Assuming that end-effects are unimportant and that the slurries can be replaced by a single-phase fluid, three two-dimensional models are proposed. These models are designed to capture the large-slot construction of the sleeve and the, approximate, non-Newtonian behaviour of the slurries. The first two models solve analytically (using a regular perturbation scheme) and numerically (using a finite volume method) the moderate-and large-Reynolds-number flow, and the third model uses a finite volume method to study the flow patterns developed by pseudoplastic fluids. The results show that the mixing of the slurry is expected to be enhanced by moving the concentric system (i.e., the rotor and the slotted sleeve) close to the rotating bowl and using low to moderate speeds for the rotor and bowl. In addition, when the cylinders rotate in the same directions, two (counter-rotating) eddies are present within the flow domain; whereas, only one eddy (rotating counter-clockwise) is ++</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">viscometer, rotating cylinders, slotted sleeve, flow field.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=11104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Job-related affective well-being and its relation to intrinsic job satisfaction.</field><field name="creator">Sevastos, Peter P.</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the structure of job-related well-being; the identification of variables that contribute to either psychological well-being or distress; and the causal connections among elements of job-related well-being and intrinsic job satisfaction.Two large samples (n=3,044 and 3,709) from a white-collar public sector organisation were used to test a four monopolar model of affective well-being, and the two bipolar model (enthusiasm-depression and anxiety-contentment) proposed by Warr (1990). Structural equation modelling (LISREL) was used to test both models, and results strongly supported a monopolar structure of affective well-being (enthusiasm, depression, anxiety and relaxation). Following the testing of the models, canonical correlation analyses related the set of the four affective variables and intrinsic job satisfaction to a set of predictors. The predictors were drawn from Wan's (1994) sub-categories of nine features of jobs that purport to enhance psychological well-being at work. Two dimensions were extracted from this analysis. The first dimension was mainly defined by intrinsic job satisfaction (from the dependent variable set) and supervisory support and skill utilisation (from the independent variable set). The second dimension was defined mainly by anxiety (dependent variable set) and job demands (independent variable set). From these results a model was developed based on the additive influences of the independent variables on the outcome variables (i.e., affective well-being and intrinsic job satisfaction) that helped explain psychological well-being and distress at work. Finally, a model was also developed that assumed a causal direction from intrinsic job satisfaction to affective well-being.

The primary focus is on the use of EIS and ENA to monitor inhibitor film performance and to evaluate inhibitor film persistency.EIS was shown to be a suitable technique to study CO(subscript)2 corrosion product scale, and inhibitor films. The formation and deterioration of protective scales and inhibitor films is found to be accompanied by characteristic spectral changes and a rapid change in electrode impedance. EIS data were used to calculate corrosion related parameters such as the resistances and capacitances of inhibitor layers, and the charge transfer resistance and double layer capacitance. These parameters were used to analyse inhibitor mechanisms, determine corrosion rates and the persistence of inhibitor films.ENA is also a suitable technique to monitor the formation and deterioration of inhibitor films. It has the advantage of being able to monitor rapid processes which occur within one second. Several technical and theoretical developments were made in this thesis including the development of a new method of instantaneous corrosion rate measurement to study fast corrosion processes (the continuous noise resistance calculation method). Experimentally, the noise resistance was confirmed to be similar to linear polarisation resistance in the systems studies. The theoretical background and the advantages and disadvantages of the ENA technique are also discussed.Corrosion product scales formed under different conditions were investigated using EIS and surface analysis techniques.

This transformation was first proposed in 1987 by the Hon. John Dawkins, Minister for Employment, Education and Training in the Hawke Labor Government. The proposals appeared in the form of a 'Green' policy discussion paper which drew substantial amounts of criticism from the academy, but nonetheless were swiftly transformed into policy as a 'White' paper or policy statement. Since that time, Australian higher education institutions have been subject to a series of changes that have fundamentally changed the patterns of tertiary education provision established over the previous forty years. They have experienced a re-allocation of research funds which has eroded the established advantage of the traditional universities; they have been obliged to accept amalgamations; and, student numbers have expanded at a rate and to a proportion never previously imagined. All of this has been achieved under the banner of improving Australia's place in the highly competitive international economy. The champions of a restructured higher education sector have argued that this competitiveness is greatly dependent upon Australia's ability to improve the scientific and technical base of its human capital: higher education must move towards a more efficient and effective provision of education which will meet the needs of the market.The transformation of higher education has been achieved without the unanimous blessing of the academy. Many of the most strident critics of what have come to be known as the Dawkins Reforms are academics who have expressed dismay at these changes.

Under State government legislation, all mined land must be rehabilitated to a stable and sustainable landform at the completion of mining activities.There was little land rehabilitation carried out in the mining industry until the mid1980s. At that time, legislation was introduced and, in due course, guidelines were issued on recommended approaches to rehabilitation. Today, rehabilitation of disturbed areas is usually integrated into the mining program and has become the rule rather than the exception. There has, however, been limited innovation in recent years and the established methods are not suitable for every land rehabilitation scenario, especially those where very high salinity is an important factor. The aims of this thesis were to make a contribution towards a better understanding of the ecology of halophytes suitable for use in revegetation and the likely physical requirements for their sustainable establishment on post-mining landforms.In terms of germination, many of the halophytes currently used for rehabilitation of saline substrates are well suited in that they are able to germinate in solutions of up to 20 g L(subscript)-1 NaCl. Furthermore, when higher salinities are encountered, seed dormancy is induced until salinity is reduced to a level at which germination can occur.

Generally, it has been recognized that the development of a sound financial market is necessary to sustain and support a high growth economy. In turn, a growing economy will drive financial market growth. This research is designed to shed light on this unique relationship by investigating the links between China's booming national economy and the domestic stock returns.Using both time-series and cross-section regressions, several identified macro economic variables are shown to be significant in their influence on stock returns. These variables include the growth rate of industrial production, the growth rate of total social retail sales, the growth rate of terms of trade and the growth rate of total social saving deposits. Stock market indexes are found significantly related to the stock portfolio returns in time-series regressions.Overall, the empirical results suggest that the rapid growth of the Chinese economy is factored into stock returns by the market. It also indicates that the market index has strong explanatory power over, the time-series returns, providing empirical support for the market model Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).

B. chamaephyton is gazetted as rare under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia and B. elegans has been recorded by various authors as restricted in range and habitat.Data were collected on the distribution, habitat, reproduction and fire responses of each species. Both were found to occur predominantly in the Irwin Botanical District. B. chamaephyton is found in low heath on sand over laterite and B. elegans in scrub or thickets on deep, yellow sands. Data on species co-occurring with B. chamaephyton were gathered for the purpose of identifying habitats with actual or potential populations of the rare species. Several species appeared to be reliable indicators.Both species are represented in areas set aside for conservation although some populations are vulnerable and their loss would considerably reduce the range of each species. Of particular concern are the southernmost populations of B. chamaephyton and the northernmost populations of B. elegans. The latter appears to represent a size variant within the species. Although neither species is currently endangered, it is recommended that B. chamaephyton remain a gazetted rare species and that consideration be given to the gazettal of B. elegans.Both species are xenogamous and probably bird-pollinated although pollination by small mammals is a possibility. Both also have very low fruit and seed set. In B. chamaephyton, this is probably related to resource availability but B. elegans possesses a malformed stigma which may prevent the normal reproductive process from taking place. Most populations of B. elegans are sterile. Further research into the sexual reproduction and propagation of B. elegans is recommended.Fire is important to both species.

The study trialled TA by using it with a group of at-risk students to discover whether its use would bring about positive change.A group of ten at-risk students became part of a mentoring programme, using TA. This programme focussed on the behaviour and academic progress of the students, and sought to empower them to make positive changes.

This situation exists even while the achievement of health is generally identified as the goal or purpose of nursing. In Australia, the requirement that nurses become health-promoting practitioners assumes that nurses understand health in positive ways, which can be translated into nursing practice. Given the myriad definitions of health, confusion among nurses about the nature of health as it is to be promoted appeared possible, even probable.This phenomenological research aimed to illuminate the nature of nurses' understandings of health and the ways such understandings are translated into nursing practice. The purpose of the study was to describe and interpret nurses' experiences of health, and their experiences of giving health care to someone in their care, in order to illuminate the nature of health for nurses and in nursing.The manner in which this research was carried out was informed by the human science approach to phenomenology described by van Manen, which is derived from the traditions of Husserl, Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty. Thus, the inquiry was grounded in the hermeneutic phenomenological philosophical perspective, which began with the work of Husserl who recognised the need to return to the grounding of truths in human experience. The thesis is informed by two views of phenomenology. The first involves the traditional approach to phenomenology advocated by the European phenomenological philosophers while the second approach is referred to by Silverman as arising from 'American continental' philosophy.Data were generated from multiple audiotaped interviews with each of nine participants, and from personal reflection and journalling undertaken ++</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health care, nurses, nursing practice, health experience.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=10531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">March-type models for the description of texture in granular materials.</field><field name="creator">Sitepu, Husinsyah</field><field name="description">Texture in crystalline materials, i.e. preferred orientation (PO), is of interest in terms of texture-property relationships and also in X-ray diffraction science because PO can cause serious systematic errors in quantitative phase analysis using diffraction data. The single- parameter, pole-density distribution function (PDDF), proposed by March (1932) to represent PO in diffraction analysis, is used widely it Rietveld pattern-fitting following a suggestion by Dollase (1986). While the March model is an excellent descriptor of PO for gibbsite [AI(OH)3] x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data (O'Connor, Li and Sitepu, 1991), the model has proved to be deficient for Rietveld modelling with molybdite [Mo03], calcite [CaCO3] and kaolinite [A12O3.2SiO2.2H2O] XRPD data (Sitepu, 1991; O'Connor, Li and Sitepu, 1992; and Sitepu, O'Connor and Li, 1996). Therefore, the March model should not be regarded as a general-purpose PDDF descriptor.This study has examined the validity of the March model using XRPD and neutron powder diffraction (NPD) instruments operated, respectively, by the Curtin Materials Research Group in Perth and by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation at the HIFAR reactor facility at Lucas Heights near Sydney. Extensive suites of XRPD and NPD data were measured for uniaxially-pressed powders of molybdite and calcite, for which the compression was systematically varied. It is clear from the various Rietveld refinements that the March model becomes increasingly unsatisfactory as the uniaxial pressure (and, therefore, the level of PO) increases.The March model has been tested with a physical relationship developed by the author which links the March r-parameter to the uniaxial pressure via the powder bulk modulus, B.

The sample from lower secondary science classrooms in Australia consisted of 3,215 students in 158 classes in 43 schools in two Australian states, namely Tasmania and Western Australia. The sample was chosen carefully so as to be representative, though only co-educational classes were used in order to permit an unconfounded test of sex differences. Students and teachers completed a questionnaire which included the QT1, an attitude to class scale based on the Test of Science Related Attitudes (TOSRA), a cognitive achievement measure based on items from the Test of Enquiry Skills (TOES) and a five-item cultural background survey. The study follows the current trend in the field of classroom environment research of combining qualitative and quantitative methods. The qualitative component of the study involved about 100 interviews. This study is unique in that it provides a very large database of teacher-student interaction data in science classrooms and provides new insights into the relationships between teacher-student interpersonal behaviour with student sex, cultural background and student outcomes. The study found that there were associations between teacher student interpersonal behaviour and student sex and that there were differences in the way that students from different cultural backgrounds perceived their learning environments. Student achievement and student attitude to class were also found to be positively associated with teacher-student interpersonal behaviour.

The methodology used was a multi~method approach utilizing both quantitative and qualitative techniques.Two separate classrooms of students in a 10th grade general science program were selected to serve as the experimental and control groups. One group was taught the material using traditional teaching methods in a traditional learning environment, functioning as the control group. The second group was taught the same basic material using constructivist methods in a constructivist learning environment.The most significant finding of the study was that students in the constructivist classroom scored higher on the achievement test than students in the more traditional classroom, even though constructivist approaches tend to focus on different assessment tools. Although the study lends support to the major hypothesis, it should be noted that further research must be conducted in this area. Samples of larger than 23 would ideally be chosen and more classes in multiple schools should be used.

This thesis outlines the successful characterisation of ultrahigh molecular mass polyacrylamide solutions in terms of discrete solvated polymer coils and coil agglomerates. These features were correlated with the observed flocculation, demonstrating a number of solution state features required to improve flocculation activity.Aqueous solutions of polyacrylamide exhibit time-dependant behaviour affecting viscosity and polymer agglomeration. Improving the solvation of the polymer suppressed the agglomerates, as did manipulation of hydrogen bonding through the presence of salts. Limiting agglomeration through improved solvation apparently lowers a barrier to polymer interaction, such that the coils disperse but become more susceptible to reagglomeration under mild shear. These solvent modifications did not fully suppress the agglomerates.To fractionate polyacrylamide into a molecular mass distribution, flow field-flow fractionation (flow FFF) was chosen, coupled to a multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) photometer and a differential refractometer for molecular mass and concentration sensitive detection, respectively. For the first time, the analysis of high molecular mass polyacrylamides in water using the flow FFF-MALLS technique has been reported. However, a number of difficulties needed to be overcome, including shear artefacts, sample agglomeration and polymer-membrane interactions.Both polyacrylamide standards and commercial flocculants were amenable to the technique. Commercial flocculants were found to vary not only with regard to viscosity and mean molecular mass, but also with sub- and supramicron size agglomerates.

In digital systems, where timing transfer between systems is required, synchronization is an important function. In this thesis new results on the performance and design of synchronization processes are presented.An inescapable consequence of the synchronization of external autonomous inputs in digital systems is the possibility of failure of digital devices used to capture the external signal. The anomalous behaviour of these devices is referred to as metastability. The most commonly used approach to controlling the problem of metastability is the use of synchronizers. A synchronizer can be designed to reduce the probability of metastable: failure but cannot eliminate it altogether. New high performance synchronizer designs are presented and analysed in this thesis.Another consequence of synchronization is the resulting disturbance of the significant epochs of timing signals. This disturbance is referred to as jitter. The characterization of jitter produced in synchronization processes is important in the design of digital systems. In this thesis, jitter characteristics are derived for two important applications that arise in digital communications systems.

The relationships between their value systems and decision styles, and between their value systems and certain demographic variables (such as level of education, social group, etc.) and organizational variables (such as company size, kind of ownership, etc.) are also investigated. Both quantitative and qualitative methods are applied in this study and the following analyses are undertaken:a one-way univariate and multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA and MANOVA) are used to test the hypotheses developed in Chapter 1.Mean differences are examined, using multiple discriminant analysis (MDA), when significant results are obtained.Pearson Partial Correlation analysis is performed to elucidate the relationships between the managerial value systems and their status of individualism/collectivism.Case study analysis is conducted for an in-depth investigation into the data.In the quantitative portion of the study, a sample of 768 managers in various organizations was surveyed. Statistical analysis of the survey data classified managerial value systems into tribalistic, egocentric, conformist, manipulative, sociocentric, and existential. This classification was conducted in accordance with the framework developed by Flowers et al. (1975). Furthermore, following Ali's questionnaire (1993), managerial decision-making styles were classified into autocratic, pseudo-consultative, consultative, participative, pseudo-participative, and delegative.The findings indicate that an average Iranian manager represents a mix of all six value systems in roughly equal proportions.

This study was designed to establish criteria for a practical remote sensing system using the visible, reflected and shortwave infrared for the early detection and mapping of salinity. The results are principally from a group of study sites on the CSIROs Yalanbee Experiment Station, and from other significant sites during the agricultural cycles of 1985-7.Analysis of imagery from the Geoscan Multispectral Airborne Scanner showed that best discrimination between study sites affected by salinity, and those not affected, was provided by bands 3 (650-700 nm), 4 (830-870nm) and band 6 (1980-2080nm). The maximum discrimination occurred in a September 1986 flight (spring-flush). Although excellent discrimination was also evident in August and November in 1985, this could not be reproduced in November 1986. The visible and reflected infrared bands 3 and 4 featured prominently, but the significance of the short wave infrared bands was evident especially when vegetative ground cover became a less dominant factor.Field spectra collected over the same period with the Geoscan Portable Field Spectroradiometer (PFS) supported the aircraft data to a certain extent. Detailed analysis of the fine non-correlated structure of narrow constructed bands, from PFS data, indicated that improved discrimination between sites could be provided over a wider time window extending into the summer and autumn. This is when weather-related conditions, i.e. cloud, soil moisture and sun angle, are more conducive to extensive surveys.The importance of at least one narrow band centred near 1985 nm was determined.

The research literature on philosophy of science and its impact on science education identifies the persistence and pervasiveness of traditional philosophies of science, such as inductive-empiricism and positivism, that misrepresent the practice of science. Although researchers have expressed concern about the influence of teacher beliefs in inductive-empiricism and positivism on teacher practice in the science classroom, the results of research in this field are inconclusive.This thesis reports an interpretive research study of three high school science teachers. An interpretive framework was developed in order to assist in the identification of teachers personal philosophies of science. The framework comprises philosophical theories of ontology, epistemology, and theory building, and the key assumptions of major philosophers of science.Interpretive analyses were conducted on classroom discourse in order to examine the influence of the three teachers personal philosophies of science on their teaching practice. Data were collected by means of participant-observation, audio-tape recordings, and teacher and student interviews. The validity of the research was optimised by using triangulation methods.The results of the thesis in the form of general assertions, indicate that experienced teachers personal philosophies of science comprise well-established and strongly integrated networks of ontological, epistemological, and theory building beliefs based on the traditional philosophies of science of inductive-empiricism and positivism.

A number of important aspects of the seed fixed oil, its composition in developing seeds, its triacylglycerols molecular species in the oil, the nutrition and toxicity of the oil feeding, and the possible bioactivity of ximenynic acid in mice were investigated.The identification of cis and trans isomers of ximenynic acid in the seed oil, and the metabolite of ximenynic acid in mouse liver lipid fractions were achieved using 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol to form 2-substituted 4,4-dimethyloxazoline derivatives, which were analysed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection.Changes in proximate and fatty acid composition were investigated in developing seed collected weekly from about seven days after flowering to maturity. It was determined that moisture and carbohydrate contents decreased significantly during the development sequence, while fixed oil content increased from 0.3% to 50% (by weight) with seed development. A corresponding increase in the proportions of both oleic and ximenynic acids occurred suggesting a precursor/product relationship. Mature seed collected from different locations in Western Australia showed minor differences in characteristics and lipid composition, which may have been influenced by geographical origin and harvesting year of samples.The lipid components from the seed oil were separated using thin-layer chromatography and the individual triglyceride bands were characterised by high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography using flame ionisation and mass spectrometric detection after removal from the plate.

Despite this, there are still efforts to improve the efficiency of the process, particularly as ores become more difficult to treat. Many investigators have studied the cyanidation process, although a large proportion of these studies have obtained contradictory results. This thesis presents a kinetic and electrochemical study of the leaching of gold in cyanide solutions, and emphasis is placed on rationalising the conflicting results which have been published in the past.The leaching rate of gold was measured using a rotating electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance, an instrument which allows the simultaneous measurement of electrochemical data and mass changes at the solid-solution interface in real time. A proportion of this project was devoted to the on-going design of this instrument, and a number of modifications are discussed in detail. Initially, the leaching of gold in cyanide solutions was investigated under conditions of high purity. Under these conditions, it was found that the gold surface is blocked by a passive film, presumably AuCN. The presence of such a film results in the reaction being chemically controlled, and under typical cyanidation conditions (4 mM cyanide, pH 10.0), the rate of dissolution is very low. These kinetic results were supported by complimentary electrochemical studies, which showed that gold is passive in the potential region where cyanidation occurs.The second part of this thesis presents a study of the effect of system purity on the leaching of gold in cyanide solutions. Solution phase purity was investigated by adding controlled amounts of lead or silver to the leach solutions.

To this stage, the current study is the only prospective randomised clinical trial of its type conducted with a sufficiently large sample size and over a long study period. The results of the current study clearly demonstrated that the subjects in the immobilised group recovered from their pain-related symptoms and returned to their normal duties sooner than those in the other two treatment groups. In addition to this, those subjects who received the immobilisation regimen did not show adverse effects on either the range of motion or the strength of the neck muscles. Thus, the immobilisation regimen was clearly shown to be the preferred option when compared to the other two treatment methodologies investigated in the current study.Although the primary interest of the current study was to compare the efficacy of three different treatment regimens, a series of statistical analyses were performed to establish the prognostic significance of several factors associated with "whiplash" injury.

From an ethical standpoint, science teachers have an obligation to ensure that their students develop the skills to enable them to evaluate and make decisions about ethical issues associated with scientific advances so that they can make informed choices as adults. An appropriate forum for such a pedagogical concern is the subject of bioethics education.The purpose of this doctoral study was to investigate the teaching of bioethics in science. Specifically, the study attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of a range of innovative pedagogical strategies utilised by teachers who were incorporating bioethics education into their secondary science curricula. Bioethics education is concerned with enabling students, firstly, to appreciate the range of ethical issues associated with the life sciences and, secondly, to develop decision making skills based on ethical theories.Using an interpretive case study approach underpinned by a constructivist theoretical framework, I examined the teaching practice of three science teachers in different school systems. Each of these teachers taught Year 10 or Year 11 science courses that included a bioethics component. The research process was informed by an ethic of care and the constructivist criteria of credibility, transferability and ontological authenticity.As a result of the early data generated, I adopted the role of a bricoleur and used alternative research methods to pursue emergent research questions.

Due to its limited solubility, sodium oxalate can co-precipitate with alumina trihydrate during precipitation. This can have detrimental effects on the final product quality, especially if it occurs in the initial stages of precipitation.Quaternary amine type cationic surfactants can prevent sodium oxalate co-precipitation and increase the tolerable concentration of sodium oxalate in Bayer liquor. Their action is via the inhibition of nucleation or/and the inhibition of crystal growth. This study presents work detailing the effect of quaternary amines on sodium oxalate crystal growth in Bayer liquor.A series of quaternary amines were tested and classified as strong, medium or weak crystal growth inhibitors in plant liquor. The octadecyltrimethylammonium bromide was found to be the most effective under plant conditions.Results will show that while quaternary amines inhibit crystal growth in Bayer liquor, they have no effect on crystallization in synthetic liquor. It has been postulated that the presence of certain organic molecules is required for quaternary amines to crystallization and therefore stabilize the liquor. The inhibition of oxalate crystal growth in Bayer process liquors is due to the plant organics present, and the stabilizing effect of quaternary amines is the result of an interaction between quaternary amines and plant humic material on the oxalate surface. A series of organics, anionic macromolecules and anionic surfactants, have been tested to simulate the behaviour of plant humates, and their inhibitory effect on sodium oxalate crystal growth has been measured.A method for the analysis of the strongest quaternary amine has been adopted, improved and modified in order to fulfil experimental conditions.The CMC of quaternary amines has been determined in liquor.

Legislative reform, royal commissions and new policies aimed at enhancing public sector accountability, transparency and efficiency have served to highlight the critical role of CEOs in delivering change. Underpinning sustainable organisational change is cultural change, which in-turn is most effectively driven by a transformational leadership style. There has been little research into CEOs' perceptions of their role in leading cultural change in their organisations. This thesis details an exploratory study of WA public sector CEOs. It discovered that CEOs identified with elements characterising the theoretical construct of a transformational leader. They perceived cultural change as the realignment of organisational values and behaviour with mission, government and community expectations, efficiency and effectiveness. CEOs actively deployed a number of strategies to bring about cultural change but were uncertain about the extent which substantive cultural change was taking place within the public sector. Factors they saw as impacting on their capacity to lead such change included the Government's policy agenda, management theory and potentially, peer support. CEOs who participated in the study were predominantly career public servants, male, over the age of fifty, had worked exclusively in the public sector and only led a small number of organisations.

In doing so, the study investigated which types of learning environments were most likely to strengthen student outcomes in computer-related courses and identify ways in which the university could enhance the teaching and learning process.The study examined whether relationships exist between students' cognitive and affective outcomes and four productivity factors: the learning environment; the quality of teacher-student interactions; students' aptitude; and students' motivation to select their chosen subject. To measure the four productivity factors, 422 students from 12 classes were asked to respond to four questionnaires that were modified to suit tertiary-level computing students: (1) the What is Happening in this Class? questionnaire (WIHIC) to measure students' perceptions of the learning environment, (2) the Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction (QTI) to measure students' perceptions of the student-teacher interaction; (3) the Test of Logical Thinking (TOLT) to measure the students' aptitude; and (4) a scale that was developed to measure students' motivation towards their course. To measure students' cognitive outcomes, information was retrieved from the university database and, to measure students' attitudes towards their computer-related subjects, four modified scales from the Test of Science Related Attitudes (TOSRA) were used.Each of the instruments was found to be valid and reliable in the Indonesian language for use at the university level in terms of factor structure, internal consistency reliability, and ability to differentiate between the perceptions of students in different classrooms.

First, to validate the Oral Individualized Classroom Environment Questionnaire (OICEQ) which is used to assess students perceptions of the learning environment in secondary chemistry classes in the U.S.A. The OICEQ is a modified version of the actual and preferred versions of the Individualized Classroom Environment Questionnaire (ICEQ) (Fraser, 1990). Second, to investigate associations between three types of science educational assessments; predictors of performance, perceptions of the classroom environment, and chemistry academic performance. Third, to address the following two questions:1. Are chaos and constructivism allies of adversaries to assessments (predictors, perceptions, and performance)?2. Is action research a valid process of evaluating a constructivist chemistry classroom (examining associations between chaos and constructivism)?A sample of 473 students from 21 chemistry classes took the Test of Logical Thinking (TOLT), the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), the Individualized Classroom Environment Questionnaire (OICEQ), pretests, post-tests, and final examinations. The statistical analyses confirmed the reliability and validity of the OICEQ and ICEQ when used with senior chemistry students. Investigation of associations between predictors, perceptions, and performances revealed 29 significant associations with OICEQ and 21 significant associations with the ICEQ. Findings from the study indicated that: (1) chaos is an adversary to social assessment and personal constructivism is an ally to personal assessment; (2) action research is a valid process for evaluating a constructivist chemistry classroom it is a unifying concept for constructivism, chaos, and assessment; (3) through an action research-constructivist process and a cyberchaos research perspective, the impact of a constructivist teaching paradigm and chaos ++</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">assessment, constructivism, chemistry education, chaos, classroom environment.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advancements in the technique of low fold three dimensional seismic reflection surveying.</field><field name="creator">Evans, Brian J.</field><field name="description">Three dimensional (3-D) seismic reflection surveying is accepted as the preferred method for imaging complex geology for proving and developing commercial oil and gas fields. However, the cost of 3-D seismic recording and processing is substantial and often can be as expensive as the cost of production drilling. This is particularly the case for land oil field development, where the cost of 3-D surveying is often unacceptably high. Such high costs also restrict its application in coal exploration, where 2-D seismic methods have long been accepted.During the early 1980's, a low fold technique for recording land 3-D data was devised which offered significant cost savings. The technique was adapted by the author for land 3-D surveying over coal fields. Inherent in the technique was a requirement that the data must have a high signal-to-noise ratio, which is not generally the case in land surveying due to the presence of strong source generated surface wave noise. A further major impediment to the technique was its inability to perform an acceptable stacking velocity analysis because of the low number of seismic traces generated. This thesis defines three data collection and processing advancements in low fold 3-D technology which go some way towards resolving these impediments.The first advancement is a method to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the stacked seismic data, and consists of a Radon-based transform which stacks shot domain data along a curved trajectory, thereby attenuating surface waves on swath recorded data. This transform is termed the 'Radial Transform' of 3-D data.The second advancement is a statics method to improve the stacked image from a low number of input traces. The method uses the concept that if both the reflected and refracted waves pass through a weathering layer with very similar travel paths, then static corrections to remove the ++</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">three dimensional seismic reflection surveying, low fold three dimensional  surveying.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Classroom environment and the transition to secondary schooling</field><field name="creator">Hine, Paul</field><field name="description">This study was undertaken to investigate changes in classroom environment as students move between upper primary and lower secondary school in selected schools in South Australia. A new instrument, the Middle School Classroom Environment Indicator (MSCEI), was devised to measure students' perceptions of particular aspects of classroom environment that were considered important in this transitional phase along the educational continuum. Actual and preferred versions of the instrument were used longitudinally with students in Grade 7 and again in Grade 8 in order to determine whether students perceived an improvement or deterioration in salient aspects of their classroom climate. Also, student satisfaction was assessed before and after transition. Quantitative data from the questionnaire were supported by qualitative data gathered through discussions with teachers, students and administrators, as well as classroom visits before and after transition into secondary school.Research questions were answered through numerous statistical analyses of questionnaire data: item analysis, factor analysis and analysis of variance for establishing the reliability and validity of the MSCEI; simple correlation and multiple regression analyses for investigating associations between student satisfaction and classroom environment scales; and paired t tests to compare and contrast perceptions of classroom environments in Grade 7 and Grade 8.The sample consisted of 311 students in six schools in Grade 7 and 575 students in six schools in Grade 8. The schools represented different enrolment profiles and 'distinctive settings. The schools involved were two single-sex boys' schools, one single-sex girls' school, and three co-educational schools.

It is proposed in this thesis that this is unnecessary, as occupant comfort expectations do not warrant it and energy is wasted as a result. A comfort-based approach to design is advocated, as a means of balancing user needs with the objective of energy conservation.This issue of how perception of comfort is linked with indoor stability emerged from the question, 'why do office buildings, despite Bioclimatic prescriptions for hot humid conditions, continue to be predominantly climate rejecting and active-run?' The literature was found to be polarised by arguments for architectural solutions that are climatically responsive and present lower energy costs, and those for engineered solutions that deliver greater, more consistent comfort, albeit through reliance on electro-mechanical systems.It is argued that comprehending the gaps in the literature, and between theory and application, requires a better understanding of occupant comfort. This would be an inside-out view of comfort and climate, predicated on how the occupant is affected by the building and the cognitive nature of comfort itself.Relying on a sample of office buildings, the thesis set out to establish the following:Prevalence of the climate-based approach, specifically Yeang's Bioclimatic ModelPrevalence of uniformity and stability of the indoor environmentOccupant perception of indoor comfort, both thermal and visual, particularly with regard to variability of ambient conditionsOccupant perception of various operational modes: passive, mixed and activeThese goals were addressed through observations of form, envelope and layout, occupant surveys and the monitoring of buildings in passive and active modes.It was found that the Bioclimatic approach is non-existent in the context of the Singapore office ++</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">indoor conditions, office buildings, Singapore, occupant comfort.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The clinician manager in rural Western Australia: a sensemaking perspective of the role.</field><field name="creator">Lewis, Janice A.</field><field name="description">Economic, political and social forces are driving the implementation of reforms in health service systems worldwide. As the health industry concentrates on ways to improve operations and to achieve overall cost effectiveness, health service organisations are developing and implementing structural changes to address issues of cost containment, utilisation and resource allocation. One approach has been to devolve resource allocation and utilisation decisions to the program or unit level. Clinical practitioners have been required to assume general management responsibilities in addition to their clinical role. A new type of clinician, the clinician manager has emerged to take on this task. Despite the trend towards the clinician manager role in many sections of health care world wide, there is little research in the area and a poor understanding of the experience of the role.The aim of this research was to explore clinician managers' perceptions of their experiences in their adaptation to and their enactment of the new role. The study was based in the symbolic interactionist paradigm. Sensemaking, the process by which individuals ascribe meaning to the events in their environment, provided a theoretical context that directed the inquiry. Grounded theory was the methodological approach. The research sample was made up of Directors of Nursing/Health Service Managers, a clinician manager role that had emerged from the restructuring of rural health services in Western Australia. Data was gathered from in-depth interviews.Findings suggested that sensemaking was influenced by structural and personal elements. Structural elements were created by the stakeholders, individuals and groups who relied on the clinician manager for the achievement of their goals but upon whom, in turn, the clinician manager relied upon for their support and cooperation.

The theoretical framework has drawn upon Rest's (1983, 1986) model of moral behaviour, with particular interest in the components motivation and moral judgment. The theoretical framework also integrates agency theory, with its emphasis on the individual as a psychological egoist, as a perspective from which to test hypotheses about determinants of moral choice and the motivational typologies arising from moral choice. Such hypothesis testing is undertaken in the setting of the banking and financial services industry in the People's Republic of China.The development and empirical testing of a set of motivational typologies is a major focus of this study. Such a set of typologies effectively replaces the singular concept of the agent as a self-serving individual. It enables the identification of other realist moral predispositions that may strongly influence the choices business operatives make. These predispositions range from altruism to thinly disguised self-interest. An individual's predisposition to be altruistic or to display strongly disguised self-interest has long been recognized in the ethics literature, but these notions have received little attention in agency theory testing. In addition, an attempt was made to incorporate human judgment theory, including Simon's (1992) concept of "bounded rationality", as a basis for decision making as part of the proposed model.This research study has been conducted in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone of the People's Republic of China during the period 1999 to 2001 and has involved a sample of 400 business operatives employed within national state-owned banks, regional commercial banks, insurance companies and securities companies.

A survey methodology is used and the survey instrument includes a self-administered questionnaire and a short auditing ethical case. A sample of Chinese CPAs with auditing experience was drawn from accounting firms located in Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Beijing, and Kunming cities during 2006-7. Three hundred and twenty-five useable responses were received. The theoretical framework for this study is based on Forsyth&#8217;s (1980) model of ethical ideologies. This study identifies Chinese auditors&#8217; cultural values as (1) Chinese traditional cultural values, (2) interpersonal relationships (guanxi), and (3) attitudes towards money. This study posits that Chinese auditors&#8217; cultural values will impact on their ethical ideologies and that their ethical judgments and intentions are, in turn influenced by the ideologies they prefer. In this study, Chinese auditors&#8217; ethical judgments and intentions are examined using a well understood ethical dilemma in auditing, specifically whether an auditor should accept a client&#8217;s suggestion to inappropriately alter the financial position or to adhere to accounting and professional standards. Four research questions are proposed in this study: 1. What national cultural values best describe Chinese auditors? 2. How do Chinese cultural values impact ethical ideologies (i.e., Idealism and Relativism) as they apply to practicing auditors? 3.

Traditionally, concrete uses Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) as binder, water as the activator of cement and aggregate. Finding an appropriate replacement for traditional concrete is a desirable solution to obviate the environmental problems caused by cement production. The use of fly ash as a partial replacement for Portland cement is a method to maintain the properties of concrete and reduce the need for cement. Fly ash is a by-product from coal-fired power plants and is abundantly available. The percentage of cement replacement can be varied according to application and mix design. One of the potential materials to substitute for conventional concrete is geopolymer concrete (introduced by Davidovits in 1979). Geopolymer concrete is an inorganic alumino-silicate polymer synthesized from predominantly silicon, aluminum and byproduct materials such as fly ash. Geopolymer properties have been investigated for several years and it is still a major area of interest among researchers and industry partners as it does not contain cement and uses fly ash and alkali liquids as binders to produce a paste to consolidate aggregates. Furthermore, the aggregate comprises a substantial portion of concrete. Including coarse and fine aggregates it is normally obtained from natural sources. Fine aggregate in Australia is usually mined from sand quarries. As the demand for concrete production increases, more natural sand is needed. The need for fine aggregate should be addressed in an environmentally friendly manner, considering the diminishing sources of natural sand. Red sand is a by-product generated from the manufacture of alumina from bauxite by the Bayer process.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">concrete, ordinary portland cement (OPC), geopolymer concrete, coarse and fine aggregates, red sand</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=115093</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of a professional development program on integrating technology into middle schools : classroom environment and student attitudes</field><field name="creator">Biggs, Ellyn M.</field><field name="description">The Alliance+ project is a teacher professional development program that integrates technology into mathematics and science lessons.

In particular, the work has emphasized the idea of computer modelling techniques combining with ex- observations to provide greater insight than either could separately. Chapter One provides an overview and introduction to the fields of solid state chemistry, crystallization and computer modelling. These ideas are extended in Chapter Two to include a more detailed discussion of the theoretical principles behind the modelling in this project. The development of transferable oxalate and hydroxide potential models, intended primarily for sodium oxalate and gibbsite, is described in Chapter Three. Both ab initio hypersurface fitting and lattice fitting techniques were utilized, with an average structural fitting error of under two percent. In addition, the potentials were used to successfully reproduce several (related) crystal structures, thus establishing the quality of the model. In Chapter Four, the model for gibbsite was employed in generating equilibrium and growth morphologies. The equilibrium morphology was found to give excellent agreement with experiment, with all observed faces present. However, the importance of the prismatic planes is underestimated. Also discussed in the chapter is a method for predicting the phenomenon of crystalline twinning. This technique was successfully applied to a number of systems, including gibbsite and sodium oxalate. In Chapter Five, the equilibrium morphology calculations performed earlier were extended by probing the effects of cation incorporation on the habit of gibbsite.

A number of authors have raised concerns that these programs are not responsive to the professional development needs of developing country teachers, suggesting that participants remain unaffected by their overseas experiences. There are similar concerns about teachers from developed countries also being unable to implement new ideas for teaching in their classrooms. This may be due to a number of reasons including feelings of powerlessness in overly prescriptive programs, high demands on teachers' time, a lack of resources, and a general lack of encouragement. These issues raise a number of questions about the nature of teacher professional development and in particular about appropriate ways to implement these programs.In response to these concerns, this thesis examines the responsiveness of a science education postgraduate program conducted in Australia to the needs of local and developing country participants and the influences of differences between Australian and developing country science teachers in terms of their professional, personal and social development. The assumption being that programs in developed countries are largely orientated towards the needs of home-country students. The conceptual framework for the thesis is a recent approach to science teacher professional development that provides a holistic perspective on science teacher professional development, focusing not only on individual teachers but also on the educational environment in which they operate.

Both facets require students to have a thorough understanding of arithmetic equality ' properties' if the developed procedures and techniques are to be adequately understood. The same can be claimed also with respect to arithmetic inequality and the solving of inequations.The specifics of the research described in this thesis entailed: (i) the identification of the properties of the equality and inequality relations considered to be the arithmetic roots from which algebraic procedures emanate; and (ii) consideration of what could constitute 'understanding' of the properties identified in (i).The research activity involved the design and development of an instrument referred to as the Mathematical Equality and Inequality Understanding Survey (the MEIUS). Specifically, the MEIUS has the following design features: (a) for the Equality Relation, the properties are exemplified using 'small numbers', 'larger numbers', and 'algebraic numbers; (b) for the Inequality Relation the properties are exemplified in 'small number' and algebraic numbers' only. The resulting Survey consists of three Stages for the Equality Relation and two Stages for the Inequality Relation.Through consideration of MEWS responses, levels were devised in order to determine 'understanding' of the relation properties. The levels were associated with the developed MEWS Thought Process Model.

For different perturbation receiver structures the performance is determined under idealised conditions and importantly also when practical implementation issues are taken into account.The arrays performance is characterised by analysing the transient performance of the weight covariance matrix and by determining the misadjustment. By drawing similarities between two established analysis techniques a new misadjustment analysis technique is introduced.Practical implementation can impact on the arrays performance such that the benefit of the projected perturbation approach is lost. By characterising the array's sensitivity to perturbation noise additional projections which counteract some implementation effects are identified.

The objective is to achieve minimal noise enhancement where the shape of the filter output to a specified input signal is constrained to lie within prescribed upper and lower bounds. Traditionally, problems of this type were treated by using the least-square (LS) approach. However, in many practical signal processing problems, this "soft" least-square approach is unsatisfactory because large narrow excursions from the desired shape occur so that the norm of the filter can be large and the choice of an appropriate weighting function is not obvious. Moreover, the solution can be sensitive to the detailed structure of the desired pulse, and it is usually not obvious how the shape of the desired pulse should be altered in order to improve on the solution. The "hard" EC filter formulation is more relevant than the "soft" LS approach in a variety of signal processing fields such as robust antenna and filter design, communication channel equalization, and pulse compression in radar and sonar. The distinctive feature is the set of inequality constraints on the output waveform: rather than attempting to match a specific desired pulse, we deal with a whole set of allowable outputs and seek an optimal point of that set.The EC optimal filter design problems involve a convex quadratic cost function and a number of linear inequality constraints. These EC filtering problems are classified into: discrete-time EC filtering problem, continuous-time EC filtering problem, and adaptive discrete-time EC filtering problem.The discrete-time EC filtering problem is handled using the discrete Lagrangian duality theory in combination with the space transformation function.

As a result, the Internet is not limited to computers that are physically connected but is also available to users that axe equipped with mobile devices. This ubiquitous access fuels the growth and the usage of the Internet even further, and thus the realisation of dynamic Internet. With the realisation of the dynamic Internet, increasing support is needed for Internet protocol (IP) and transmission control protocol (TCP) over wireless/mobile networks.Two areas of interest in this thesis are unicast and multicast routing in connectionless and connection-oriented networks. To address the problems of routing protocols in mobile computing environments, the active networks (ANs) paradigm is employed. ANs provide an alternative paradigm to solving network problems and comprise programmable network elements that allow enhancement of existing protocols and the execution of active protocols which run for the duration of the communication session.This thesis investigates the viability and advantages of ANs when applied to routing in mobile communications. Two new AN-based protocols, for IP and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks, that address the problems of multicast routing with mobile group members are outlined. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) mobile IP has been augmented with active programs in order to enhance its operation further. Also, a novel model for rerouting connections in ATM networks is presented.Results of extensive simulation studies comparing performances of conventional as well as some recently proposed protocols with those of AN-based protocols are presented. The results obtained from these simulation studies show that AN-based protocols have the following benefits: (i) efficient adaptation to mobility, (ii) reduced signaling overheads, ++</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mobile computing environment, active networks.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=9761</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lossless statistical data service over Asynchronous Transfer Mode.</field><field name="creator">Van Luinen, Steven M.</field><field name="description">Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) can provide deterministic channels as required for real time signals, as well as statistical multiplexing. For this reason, ATM has been chosen as the underlying technology for providing a Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN). Two main classes of services are expected to be supported over a B-ISDN. These classes are real-time services and data services. Data services include computer communications (Local Area Network (LAN) interconnections) and general non-real time traffic, such as file transfer and small transactions.The provision of data services over ATM are better served with statistical multiplexing, provided that the service is loss-free. For multiplexing to be loss-free and still statistical, while the maximum service rate is fixed, the multiplexer tributaries must be controlled in flow, to assure no overflow of the multiplexing buffer. Provision of a service over ATM is accomplished by an ATM layer. Transfer Capability (ATC).This thesis investigates and reports on the operating characteristics of an ATM layer Transfer Capability proposed to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), and called Controlled Cell Transfer (CCT). CCT uses credit window based flow control on links and a quota based control in switches, and will give loss free statistical multiplexing for data. Other ITU defined ATCs are examined in regard to data service provision and compared with CCT. It is found that only CCT can provide a fast and at the same time efficient data service.The thesis also examines the impact that support of the CCT capability would have on an ATM switch, through determination of required functionality, and mapping of the required functions into a switch design. Finally, an architecture and implementation of an ATM switch is described that would support the CCT as well as the Deterministic Bit Rate (DBR) ++</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">statistical data service, controlled cell transfer, asynchronous transfer mode, ATM.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=9898</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the physiological and biochemical responses elicited by Panulirus cygnus to harvesting, holding and live transport.</field><field name="creator">Spanoghe, Patrick T.</field><field name="description">The western rock lobster (WRL), Panulirus cygnus is a decapod crustacean which is found in abundance in the coastal waters of Western Australia and which supports a major fishery of economic importance for the State, with an annual harvest ranging between 10-12 million kilograms. The growth of the existing markets in Asia for live exports and the competition exerted by other countries marketing spiny lobsters prompted the need for the Industry to assess and develop post-harvest handling procedures likely to contribute to an improved quality of live product. The physiological responses of P. cygnus to handling and transportation were virtually unexplored.The objectives of this project were, (i) to generate information with regard to the biological phenomena underlying morbidity and mortality of lobsters during live export shipments, (ii) to investigate the physiological responses of P. cygnus to the post-harvest handling practices currently used by the WRL industry in their five export program and, (iii) to identify protocols by which post-harvest handling techniques could be modified to reduce the occurrence of morbidity and mortality during five export.These objectives were achieved through, (i) a field survey conducted during the course of the 1992/93 fishing season, investigating the relative influence of environmental factors and processing techniques on the incidence of lobster morbidity+mortality during simulated live shipments and, (ii) a series of field experiments that monitored the physiological responses elicited by lobsters to post-harvest handling procedures and simulated live shipment conditions.From the field survey, it appeared that the rate of morbidity+mortality experienced in simulated live shipments, within the three processing units surveyed, averaged 5.22 +/- 0.63 %, with a highly significant difference (p [less than] 0.001) between the ++</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">western rock lobster industry, post-harvest handling, physiological responses, Panulirus cygnus.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=11350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of stoichiometry on the thermal behaviour of synthetic iron-nickel sulfides.</field><field name="creator">Chamberlain, Anthony C.</field><field name="description">The effect of stoichiometry on the pyrolytic decomposition, oxidation and ignition behaviour of synthetic violarite and pentlandite has been established.

Pentlandite can also show some variation in metal:sulfur ratio. A series of samples, ranging in stoichiometry from Fe(subscript)0.96Ni(subscript)1.97S(subscript)4 to Fe(subscript)0.20Ni(subscript)2.72S(subscript)4 and Fe(subscript)5.80Ni(subscript)3.15S(subscript)8 to Fe(subscript)3.40Ni(subscript)5.55S(subscript)8, were synthesised and characterised using wet chemical analysis, electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area analysis.The thermal behaviour of these sulfides was examined using simultaneous Thermogravimetry-Differential Thermal Analysis (TG-DTA) at different heating rates and in different atmospheres. Partially reacted samples were collected at various temperatures and analysed using XRD, EPMA, SEM, optical microscopy (OM), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.

The sieve provides a shape-selective window which distinguishes between the various pentacyclic components, thus fractionating them on the basis of molecular shape differences. This sieving technique has been applied to isolate various pentacyclic triterpanes from sedimentary organic matter to enable better analysis of these biomarkers to be carried out.Biodegraded crude oils from three Australian basins were analysed to assess the geochemistry of their rearranged hopanes. Enhanced abundances of 25-norhopanes, 18(alpha)-30-norneohopane and diahopanes relative to the regular hopanes were observed in the most severely biodegraded samples. Geochemical interpretation of these results suggests that the enhanced abundances are due to the greater resistance of rearranged hopanes to biodegradation compared to regular hopanes. These studies also indicate that enhanced relative abundances of 25-norhopanes in these samples is most likely due to selective bacterial demethylation of (alpha beta)-hopane precursors.A branched and cyclic alkane fraction from a higher plant-derived crude oil was subjected to the US-Y chromatography procedure and the fractions eluted from the column were analysed using GC-MS. The compositions of the first two eluted fractions were markedly different from the initial branched and cyclic alkane mixture in that they were enriched in higher plant-derived triterpanes, such as bicadinanes, spirotriterpane and the oleananes and other, previously unreported, C(subscript)29 and C(subscript)30 triterpanes.

In some situations, linear constraints are imposed on the filter weights such that the filter is forced to exhibit a certain desired response. Several algorithms for linearly constrained least-squares adaptive filtering have been developed in the literature. When implemented with finite precision arithmetic, these algorithms are inevitably subjected to rounding errors. It is essential to understand how these algorithms react to rounding errors.In this thesis, the numerical properties of three linearly constrained least-squares adaptive filtering algorithms, namely, the linearly constrained fast least algorithm, the linear systolic array for MVDR beamforming and the linearly constrained QRD-RLS algorithm, are studied. It is shown that all these algorithms can be separated into a constrained part and an unconstrained part. The numerical properties of unconstrained least-squares algorithms (i.e., the unconstrained part of the linearly constrained algorithms under study) are reviewed from the perspectives of error propagation, error accumulation and numerical persistency. It is shown that persistent excitation and sufficient numerical resolution are needed to ensure the stability of the CRLS algorithm, while the QRD-RLS algorithm is unconditionally stable. The numerical properties of the constrained algorithms are then examined. Based on the technique of how the constraints are applied, these algorithms can be grouped into two categories. The first two algorithms admit a similar structure in that the unconstrained parts preceed the constrained parts. Error propagation analysis shows that this structure gives rise to unstable error propagation in the constrained part. In contrast, the constrained part of the third algorithm preceeds the unconstrained part.

We can no longer say that a gene is a sequence of DNA that continuously and uniquely codes for a particular protein - it is the phenotype that defines the gene, rather than the other way around. Research into learning in genetics has largely focussed on issues such as problem solving and the process of meiosis. The central concept of the gene, however, has had little attention. How do students learn about the concept of the gene during an introductory high school genetics course? Is it possible to justify an analogy between the historical development of the concept of the gene and student learning? Can student learning about the gene be described as conceptual change and what are the factors that might influence this process? These are the issues that are addressed in this thesis.The general purpose of this study was to investigate Year 10 students' learning about the concept of the gene. The theoretical framework is embedded in the personal and social paradigms of constructivism and a multidimensional interpretive framework for conceptual change was utilised, enabling the data to be interpreted from ontological, epistemological and social/affective perspectives.A total of eight classroom sites were used to collect data as a series of linked case studies. Data from three of these cases were used to investigate Year 10 student learning about the concept of the gene and one of the cases was used to make an in-depth examination of individual student learning and conceptual change. The larger series of eight cases was drawn upon to provide data to support assertions made about the factors influencing conceptual change.

It was considered that the most effective research method would be a qualitative approach in order to gain insight into the offender's understanding of their offending behaviour and to attempt to identify their areas of treatment need. Through personal observations in working with exhibitionists and supported by the literature, an interview schedule was developed to combine a detailed social history with questions on communication, childhood issues, father issues and stress. Twenty voluntary participants were interviewed, having been accessed through the correctional community and prison environments. The objectives were (1) To identify any categories of exhibitionists and therefore better utilise treatment resources, (2) To identify the role of stress and communication deficits in offending behaviour of exhibitionists, (3) To determine whether exhibitionists would be more effectively treated within their own discrete population or with other types of sex offenders and (4) To identify a more appropriate treatment model. Another area of interest which was not specifically focussed on was whether findings would emerge which could predict which exhibitionists would progress to more serious sexual offending.The study found 3 categories of exhibitionist (1) Adolescent Onset Career Exhibitionists, (2) Adult Onset Career Exhibitionists and (3) Situational Response Exhibitionists.

In particular, water bottom multiples can be very difficult to attenuate. This is because there often exists a strongly reflective sea floor which gives multiples large amplitudes when compared with the primary events they overlay, and secondly, because of a widely occurring velocity inversion, which seriously reduces the effectiveness of a very important class of multiple attenuation techniques.Multiple attenuation techniques can be classified according to the characteristic of the data which is used to discriminate against the multiples in conjunction with the operation behind the demultiple process. Common multiple attenuation processes include FK demultiple, Radon Demultiple, predictive deconvolution, wave equation based demultiple procedures and the family of techniques which come under the umbrella of Surface Multiple Attenuation (SMA). All of these techniques, given the right conditions, can be very effective. They also vary in price from very cheap (FK demultiple) through to expensive (wave equation based demultiple procedures).However, despite these procedures, and fifty odd years of research, there is no effective general solution to multiple problems off the coast of Western Australia and indeed in many regions around the world.Two new wavefield transformations, Multiple MoveOut (MMO) and IsoStretch Radial Trace (ISR), have been developed in this research to precondition data prior to the removal of surface related multiples by existing techniques. These form the basis of a new multiple attenuating procedure.MMO shifts the data so that the water bottom primary event is flattened and the simple water bottom multiples are also flat and periodic.

A quasi-experimental study, with both a control group and an experimental group, was developed to examine the effects of peer assisted learning on the cognitive, psychomotor and affective components of clinical competence.On a more specific level, the main aim of the study was to investigate two models of clinical learning used in physiotherapy: the individualistic and reciprocal peer coaching models. Differences in history taking, physical examination and clinical reasoning were studied by having individual students, and pairs of students, complete an assessment of a simulated patient followed by a clinical reasoning test. A conceptual framework illustrates the main theoretical implications of this study. This framework incorporated current knowledge about clinical reasoning in medicine and the allied health sciences, in particular, reasoning from a novice practitioner's perspective. The conceptual framework, however, was expanded to demonstrate how peer assisted learning can influence the knowledge, cognitive and metacognitive aspects of clinical reasoning and performance.The main findings of the study were that reciprocal peer coaching led to statistically significant improvements in performance and clinical reasoning in the experimental group. In most cases, positive effect size differences appeared in favour of the experimental group. Most noteworthy differences were in the areas of physical examination and overall thoroughness of the patient encounter.

The bombardment of the lunar surface by cosmic rays produces secondary neutrons which are thermalised by the lunar soil. These thermal neutrons are captured by trace elements with large neutron capture cross sections such as cadmium, gadolinium and samarium. Measurements by thermal ionisation mass spectrometry of the changes in the isotopic abundances of cadmium, gadolinium and samarium due to neutron capture are presented in this thesis. Evidence is also presented of the first observations of mass fractionation in cadmium in lunar soils.Changes have been observed in samples from the Apollo 14, 16 and 17 missions. In 114 [superscript 114]Cd/[superscript 113]Cd changes of 0.3% to 0.5% have been observed in lunar samples 60501,105, 65701,23 and 72161,73, of 0.4% and 0.8% in [superscript 158]Gd/[superscript 157]Gd in samples 14163,848 and 60501,105 and of 0.8%, 1.2% and 0.06% in [superscript 150]Sm/[superscript 149]Sm in samples 14163,848 and 60501,105 and 74220,125 respectively.

Less attention has been paid to how people determine whether or not the decisions taken by other parties (e.g., politicians, government agencies, industry, etc.) to address risk issues are acceptable decisions.After examining the structure of risk perception and acceptability, this study researched the judgement strategies which individuals employ when assessing the acceptability or unacceptability of risk related decisions. It also investigated whether or not individuals directly affected by risk related decisions utilise similar judgement strategies to those of individuals not directly affected by the same decisions. This provided insights as to the reasons why local communities often reject risk related decisions that others in the broader community consider acceptable.Questionnaire data were collected relating to a number of risk scenarios based on real world issues and decisions. The survey included Curtin University students, residents of a Perth suburb, and members of a resident action group involved in a local risk issue at the time of the study.Unlike previous studies of heterogeneous hazard sets, exploratory factor analyses of 8 hazard domains did not reveal a global factor structure that could represent the construct 'risk'. Instead, each of the hazard domains revealed a qualitatively different factor structure, highlighting the context specific nature of risk.Through the use of correlation, linear regression, and path analysis the relationship between perceived riskiness, risk acceptability and other risk attributes or characteristics was explored. These analyses revealed that a relationship between perceived risk and risk acceptability exists to varying but significant degrees across different types of hazards.

The aim of the current study is to establish the profile of Medical Radiation Science (MRS) practitioners as lifelong learners and to examine the implications of these findings for MRS undergraduate programs in Australia. The study builds on Candy et. al.'s 1994 report, Developing Lifelong Learners through Undergraduate Education, by drawing on the report's profile of lifelong learners and the features of the undergraduate program that promote lifelong learning. This present study used both quantitative and qualitative approaches, including collating the stakeholders' views on lifelong learning via surveys, one-to-one interviews and focus group discussion.Findings from this study indicate that all stakeholders (MRS practitioners, Heads of MRS Departments, students and teaching staff) viewed lifelong learning to be relevant to the profession and are important attributes for MRS practitioners to attain. However, attributes that were directly related to clinical competencies were more highly valued than attributes which were perceived to be associated with learning competencies. For each of the 25 attributes surveyed, the actual level of attainment fell below the nominated level of importance. Furthermore, the workplace culture was found to be non-supportive of lifelong learning. All MRS courses in Australia promote lifelong learning as one of their course objectives. There is a general trend towards adopting teaching approaches that promote lifelong learning, while assessment methods that promote and evaluate lifelong learning attributes were lagging behind.These findings have implications for both the MRS workplace and the MRS undergraduate courses in Australia.

It argues that, for much of this century, Australian governments were committed to the development and maintenance of export orientated agriculture and stable rural communities. While the agricultural industry, and the rural society that it supported, were periodically affected by economic downturns, wars, and technological changes, the full socio-economic impacts were often tempered by interventionist agricultural, social and regional development government policies. Since the early 1970s, however, the Central Wheatbelt, and rural Australia more generally, have experienced profound economic, social and political changes. During this period, the rapid transformation of the global economy has contributed to a series of problems in the Australian economy, such as low levels of economic growth, rising interest rates, and increasing unemployment. In the case of agriculture, the upheaval in the global economy contributed to world surpluses of agricultural commodities, declining returns for food and fibre production, and the rising cost of farm inputs.Since the early 1980s, the response of Federal and State governments to the turmoil in the Australian economy has been to argue that the only workable solution to globalisation was the adoption of policies based on the principles of economic rationalism. However, this thesis argues that, in the Central Wheatbelt, the combination of global restructuring and policies based on economic rationalism have contributed to: the declining viability of family farming; farm amalgamation; labour force adjustments; the contraction of local economies; depopulation; public service rationalisation and withdrawal; and uneven economic and social development.

Hasluck is a Western Australian writer whose work takes seriously, while at the same time parodies, the institutions of both Western Australia and Western society.The initial section comprises three chapters, in which Hasluck's novels are read through the commonly used frameworks of the mystery-thriller genre and satire. The second part of the thesis, which covers four chapters, is a reading of Hasluck's narratives through the shift from modernism to postmodernism, drawing particularly on the work of theorists such as Linda Hutcheon, Michel Foucault and Brian McHale. This interpretation reveals how Hasluck's work increasingly uses the marginal, regional narratives of Western Australia to contest the mega-narratives of the West.The significance of this thesis is twofold. Firstly, this is currently the most in-depth examination of the work of a neglected Western Australian writer, and, secondly, the combining of Hasluck's literary themes and this thesis's critical framework provides a productive format for exploring issues of Western Australian history and literature.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Western Australian literature, Nicholas Hasluck, literary criticism.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=10562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The phenomenon of patient participation in their nursing care : a grounded theory study.</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Saraswathy</field><field name="description">In recent times there has been an emphasis on patients participating in their own nursing care. Studies have demonstrated that when patients participate in their own care, they experience positive outcomes, such as greater satisfaction with care, a sense of control, decreased vulnerability, and being effectively prepared for discharge. Practising nurses are of the view that patients should be involved in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of care in keeping with nursing's philosophy of provide holistic or patient-centred care. Despite this there is literature to show that nurses' espoused pro-participatory attitudes were not always enacted in the practice setting. There was a paucity of research to explain why this situation existed. Therefore, the purpose of this grounded theory study was to explore, describe, and analyse nurses' and patients' perspectives on the phenomenon of patient participation within the context of hospital nursing practice in Western Australia.Data were collected through formal and informal interviews with nurses, patients, non nurses, a doctor and relatives, focus group interview with nurses, participant observation, listening to nurses' handovers, examination of nurses' notes, and published literature. Thirty three Registered Nurses and 32 patients from medical, surgical, and extended care wards were formally interviewed. Additionally, 28 nurses and 17 patients were informally interviewed during participant observation. The total hours of participant observation was 142. The constant comparative method was used to analyse the data.The findings revealed that the basic social problem that faced nurses and patients was incongruence in their understandings of the meaning of patient participation and in their philosophies about nursing care.

(Rutaceae), is widely distributed as small disjunct populations throughout the sandplains of Western Australia (21 degrees 50'S, 116 degrees 12'E to 31 degrees 12'S, 117 degrees 02'E). Although the morphological forms can be genus is supposedly monospecific, three recognised in the field:(1) a small form (0.5-1 m) with small, often solitary flowers and small leaves;(2) a large form (1-2 m) with larger, more abundant flowers and larger leaves; and,(3) an intermediate form exhibiting mixed morphological characters.The patterns of morphological, reproductive and genetic variation within and between populations of these three forms were investigated. Uni- and multivariate analyses of morphological traits found the large and intermediate forms to be closely allied, and distinguishable from the small form. Responses to controlled pollination experiments indicated that the small form favours selfing but maintains some level of outcrossing, while the large form exhibits a mixed mating system. The intermediate form displays a stronger self-pollination mechanism than the small form.Patterns of genetic variation were analysed using both allozymes and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs). The allozyme analysis concurred with genetically depauperate expectations of endemic taxa (A, 1.4; P, 29.6%; H(subscript)0, 0.055; H(subscript)e, 0.097). Genetic diversity and patterns of allelic distribution, however, differed within the three forms. Lower levels of genetic diversity were found in the small form (H(subscript)T,0.192) compared with the large form (H(subscript)T, 0.254), although both forms apportioned this diversity within populations (H(subscript)S, 0.122 and 0.164, respectively) rather than between D(subscript)ST, 0.070 and 0.090, respectively).

Cioffi's model of somatic interpretation was explored in relation to this issue as it had been previously applied to predominantly physiological conditions and appeared to offer a potentially useful framework for understanding the behaviour of people with panic disorder.The first study consisted of a principal components analysis of 153 panic attack symptom checklists from the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule - Third Edition - Revised (ADIS-III-R).Five separate physiological components emerged from the analysis which mirrored common medical conditions. A cluster analysis of the symptoms of 153 individuals indicated that the sample formed five separate groups corresponding to the five physiological components identified. The results of this study supported suggestions put forward in the literature regarding the possible clustering of the physiological symptoms of panic attacks. The study also found evidence to suggest that individuals with panic disorder can be identified in distinct sub-groups according to the most predominant physiological symptoms reported.The second study was made up of two parts. Part one investigated the health utilisation behaviour and associated costs for people with panic disorder and compared them with people with social phobia. Significantly higher costs and rates of utilisation were found for the panic disorder group compared to the group with social phobia. Part two of this study investigated the relationship between a person with panic disorder's most predominant physiological panic symptoms and the type of medical specialists consulted.

G.</field><field name="description">Silica is detrimental to the recovery of zinc from zinc bearing siliceous materials. The difficulties involved in the hydrometallurgical processing of silica are well documented, the major problem being the formation of gels. These are extremely difficult to separate from solution, creating serious problems. This work investigates the mechanism of the formation of granular silica precipitates and how this differs from the mechanism of formation of the gels.Batch precipitation studies of silica from sulfuric acid solutions have revealed valuable information about the processes occurring. A solution of monosilicic acid (Si(OH)4(subscript)) was produced by leaching synthetic zinc orthosilicate (Zn2SiO4) in sulfuric acid. Precipitation was monitored by measuring the turbidity and silica concentration in solution at regular intervals. Electron microscopy was used to examine the precipitate morphology. Variables known to influence silica precipitation are supersaturation, temperature, seeding and the concentrations of sulfuric and hydrofluoric acids and zinc, iron (III) and aluminium sulfates. These were investigated by comparing their effects on precipitation with those of a control experiment. The evaluation criteria used were induction time, precipitation rate, precipitation time, product morphology and filterability. The results of this work define conditions that yield a granular silica precipitate in preference to a gel, low supersaturation being the most important condition. The product morphology is insensitive to precipitation rate over the range of conditions studied.A laboratory scale continuous crystalliser was designed and constructed and used to carry out a series of experiments to determine the operating conditions for suitable processing of natural zinc orthosilicate ore to remove the silica impurity in an easily separable form.

International education involves over 1.3 million students' world wide, and injects billions of dollars into the economies of supplier nations. Despite its importance, little empirical research is available on the international marketing of education. This study draws together research from services marketing, industrial and organisational economics, strategic management and various studies and reports relating to the management and marketing of international education.Commencing with an overview of the international market for education, the study examines the education sectors of leading supplier nations particularly Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States. It then describes the education sector of Australia and its international education industry in depth.Following a review of the relevant literature that relates to services marketing and e development of sustainable competitive advantage, a theoretical model as to how an education institution might achieve competitive advantage in international markets is proposed, along with several research propositions.' The findings of a survey of 315 education institutions in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and United States are then outlined. Initial descriptive statistics suggest that:1. Australian tertiary institutions are less confident about their international market recognition than are their Canadian, American, New Zealand or United Kingdom (CANZUK) counterparts;2.

Australia, the United States, Japan, the U.K., South Africa, China, Thailand, and many other countries have suffered office oversupply cycles. Illiquid untenanted office buildings impair investors capital and cash flows, with adverse effects on macroeconomics, financial institutions, and individuals. This study aims to develop improved methods for medium term forecasting of office market adjustments to inform individual project development decisions and thereby to mitigate office oversupply cycles. Methods combine qualitative research, econometric estimation, system dynamics simulation, and institutional economics. This research operationalises a problem solving research paradigm concept advocated by Ken Lusht. The research is also indebted to the late James Graaskamp, who was successful in linking industry and academic research through time and space specific feasibility studies to inform individual property development decisions. Qualitative research and literature provided a list of contributing causes of office oversupply including random shocks, faulty forecasting methods, fee driven deals, prisoners dilemma game, system dynamics (lags and adjustment times), land use regulation, and capital market issues. Rather than choosing among these, they are all considered to be causal to varying degrees. Moreover, there is synergy between combinations of these market imperfections. Office markets are complex evolving human designed systems (not time invariant) so each cycle has unique historical features.

In addition to the focus on this theory in particular, the study examines the relationship of national and personal values to perceptions and interpretation of organizational leadership behaviour. The underlying purpose is to increase understanding of cross-cultural variables in the field of organizational leadership.For its premise, the research undertaken makes the suggestion that leadership behaviours are influenced by national cultural variables and therefore national similarities or differences are, at least to some extent, culturally determined.

The study sought to explore alternative conceptions of the nature of schools and the processes by which they can be improved.Examination of research on school effectiveness revealed that student learning outcomes were consequential on the values and norms of the staff of schools. These values and norms constitute the culture of a school and govern the professional activity of teachers. School culture can be contrasted with the formal school organisation in which the work of teachers is prescribed by explicit rules and regulations. Viewing schools from a cultural rather than organisational perspective requires conceptualising the school as a learning community. A learning community is bonded together by common expectations about the roles of teachers and the learning of students. The predominant consideration is the educative mission of the school and not the requirements of the formal organisation. Organisational development is viewed as cultural transformation. The improvement of the school is facilitated by the growth of a school culture which is supportive of the professional needs of teachers and the educative needs of students.The study utilised a developmental mixed-method research approach to investigate the nature, temporal stability and improvement of the culture of local senior secondary schools.A quantitative instrument was developed to measure aspects of school culture identified in the school effectiveness literature.

The radical changes from traditional teaching/learning methodologies, focusing on instructor presentation, to a more learner active role could disadvantage some students. For instance, having to access information independently and problem-solve utilising material presented electronically may add considerable cognitive demands to the learning task. Many factors influence an individual learning in computerised interactive learning situations and these include motivation, previous experience, and a range of learner characteristics. The last factor includes styles of functioning which impact on both the interpretation of processes and the appraisal of performance levels. In many previous studies researching the use of media and learning, these factors have been isolated and their impact on user performance and attitude measured. However, with interactive multimedia, several elements combine to make research concentration on individual variables questionable. These elements include the range and mix of media used, the interactivity possible, and the degree of user control. Therefore, this exploratory study sought to establish some of the learning characteristics which combined to form statistical models in a range of participant navigational tasks. Multiple regression analysis was employed to determine the ways that individuals with differing personal characteristics make navigational decisions while browsing and problem-solving when utilising interactive learning materials. Case studies were employed to illustrate extreme cases. Personal characteristics measured included technological experience, cognitive style, learning style, computer awareness and computer anxiety.

It involved the development and validation of two instruments, the Computer Laboratory Environment Inventory (CLEI) and the Attitude towards Computing and Computing Courses Questionnaire (ACCC). The CLEI has five scales for measuring students' perceptions of aspects of their laboratory environment. These are Student Cohesiveness, Open-Endedness, Integration, Technology Adequacy and Laboratory Availability. The ACCC has four scales, Anxiety, Enjoyment, Usefulness of Computers and Usefulness of the Course. The instruments were administered at three universities, one in Australia, one in England and one in the United States. The classes surveyed included those in which the development of software was the focus of study, such as Information Systems and Computer Science, and others in which the computer was used as a tool. With the exception of Laboratory Availability, all the environment variables were found to correlate significantly with all attitudinal variables. The only environment variable with significant association with achievement was Student Cohesiveness. However, the results showed that there were significant associations between the attitudinal variables, Anxiety, Enjoyment and Usefulness of the Course and achievement. Regression analysis supported the findings that the environment variables made a significant contribution to the attitudinal variables, and these in turn made a significant contribution to achievement.

Within this framework, implementation is viewed as the interaction of the innovation with the characteristics of each adopting school. These interactions are viewed as occurring within two change environments. The first, the general change environment, is shared by all schools under study. This environment reflects the broader economic, political and educational pressures prompting change. The second environment is specific to each school. It forms the immediate context within which the implementation process occurs. Before examining the specific nature of the implementation process within each school site, attention is given to the general change environment from which the innovation emerged. This is accompanied by an analysis of the evolutionary nature of the innovation itself as it underwent progressive clarification at Ministry of Education level.To assess the influence that specific environmental characteristics have on the implementation process, schools with markedly differing setting characteristics were selected for study. An instrument to assess school organizational climate was developed, (SOCQ) and then administered to twenty three secondary schools in the Perth metropolitan area.

Currently, GRACE maps the Earth&#8217;s gravity field with a near-global coverage and over a five year period, which makes it possible to apply statistical analysis techniques to the data. The objective of this study is to analyse the most dominant spatial and temporal variability of the Earth&#8217;s gravity field observed by GRACE using a combination of analytical and statistical methods such as Harmonic Analysis (HA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The HA is used to gain general information of the variability whereas the PCA is used to find the most dominant spatial and temporal variability components without having to introduce any presetting. The latter is an important property that allows for the detection of anomalous or a-periodic behaviour that will be useful for the study of various geophysical processes such as the effect from earthquakes. The analyses are performed for the whole globe as well as for the regional areas of: Sumatra- Andaman, Australia, Africa, Antarctica, South America, Arctic, Greenland, South Asia, North America and Central Europe. On a global scale the most dominant temporal variation is an annual signal followed by a linear trend.

The non-oxidative dissolution reaction generates H2S(aq) or HS-(aq) species which are thought to rapidly react with sulfurous acid species, S02(aq) or HS03-(aq), to possibly produce initially sulfane monosulfonates as intermediates, followed by sulfane disulfonates and elemental sulfur. The formation of sulfane monosulfonates is postulated based upon inhibition observed in ZnS / S02 leaches which is not attributable to either H2S(aq) or occlusion elemental sulfur.At elevated temperatures (100oC - 200oC) the rate of ZnS dissolution in sulfurous acid is affected by the thermal decomposition of sulfurous acid, which produces sulfuric acid, which leaches the mineral non-oxidatively. Increasing the temperature increases the rate of thermal decomposition of sulfurous acid and consequently, the rate of sulfuric acid formation, increasing the rate of ZnS dissolution.The kinetics of the dissolution of ZnS in solutions of sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide were investigated at temperatures up to 200oC. At 100oC and 150oC, the dissolution of ZnS in H2SO4 was found to obey the relationd[Zn2+]/dt = kfAs[H+] krAs[H2S(aq)]1/2[Zn2+]1/2and equilibria and rate constants for the ZnS / H2S04 reaction were obtained over the range, 100oC to 200oC.

Rock-Eval, FTIR microscopy, and pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GCMS) indicate that the composition of the lignite and its extract are typical of immature type III organic matter with a predominance of aromatic and oxygen containing functionalities. Variation in the macromolecular composition of the three lignites are consistent with more pronounced degradation of the organic matter in the lowermost lignite horizon. Nickel boride desulphurisation of polar and asphaltene fractions of the lignites showed the presence of sulphur-bound higher plant triterpenoids, in particular olean-12-ene, n-alkanes of even predominance, C29 steranes and extended 17&#226;(H),21&#226;(H)-hopanes. Deuterium labelling experiments indicated that these components were mostly bound to a single sulphur, at sites about the original functionality in the natural product precursors. The presence of singularly sulphur-bound aromatic ring A degraded and pentacyclic triterpenoids represent the spectrum of aromatic triterpenoid intermediates undergoing diagenesis before sulphur incorporation.Stable carbon isotopic ++</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marine-influenced coals, organic geochemistry.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12911</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australia&#8217;s entrepreneurial spirit: the contribution of franchising</field><field name="creator">Bothams, Christopher M</field><field name="description">This research identifies the experiences, behaviours, attitudes, values and beliefs of Australia's most successful franchise owners in order to understand the reasons for their outstanding success in a business environment designed to encourage replication and uniformity. In this study, twelve of Australia's best franchisees have been interviewed to find out their personal qualities that have enabled them to succeed in the franchise business environment. A qualitative methodology within a constructivist ontology and interpretivist epistemology has been used. Interviews were conducted, coded, analysed and models developed using NVivo software. The coding and analysis led to the development of six key characteristics or behaviours of successful franchisees. Australia's best franchisees are successful because they are highly motivated, have outstanding business skills, are committed to franchising, demonstrate remarkable personal qualities reflected in highly ethical leadership with exceptional communication skills and create a business environment that has real customer focus. Human qualities are difficult to isolate and quantify. This research highlights those necessary to succeed in franchising and business generally. The findings from this research have been presented as a framework for franchisee success. The framework provides the basis of human characteristics and elements to consider in franchisee selection and business skill development. The title of this research is in many ways its conclusion. The contribution of franchising to Australia's entrepreneurial spirit is the growth and development of the business skills of franchisees, many of whom are entrepreneurs in the making.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">successful franchise owners, Australia, experiences, behaviours, attitudes, values, beliefs</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18679</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indoor environmental risk factors for respiratory symptoms and asthma in young children.</field><field name="creator">Rumchev, Krassi</field><field name="description">Asthma is a common chronic disorder in Western countries and is increasing in prevalence in both children and adults. Although genetic risk for atopy is an important factor for the development of asthma, it does not explain the tremendous increase in prevalence seen in recent decades. Environmental exposures in early life that affect immune maturation appear to be the key factors for the development of asthma. The indoor environment is a likely candidate since infants spend 90% of the time indoors at a time when immune deviation usually occurs. Exposure to indoor pollutants represents a potentially modifiable cause of allergic sensitization and asthma. In this context, it becomes important to establish which environmental factors might influence the development of asthma in predisposed individuals. Allergic reactions to certain environmental allergens such as house dust mites, cats, and cockroaches, have shown a high level of association with asthma prevalence, but in the last five years increasing attention is being paid to indoor environmental factors, other than allergens, that may be involved in the development of this disorder. The potential irritants include nitrogen dioxide, environmental tobacco smoke, formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds, and particulate matter (PM[subscript]2.5;10).The aim of the study was to examine the nature of the relationship between asthma and environmental exposure to indoor environmental irritants.A population based case-control study had been carried out in Perth, Western Australia. The study population consisted of young children (N = 192) aged between 6 months and 3 years old. Cases (n = 88) were asthmatic children who attended the Accident and Emergency Department at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children and were discharged with asthma as a primary diagnosis.

Of those studies which have dealt with this problem, three questions stand. First, to what degree does time contain transhistorical and historically specific elements? Secondly, to what extent does human agency or deterministic forces underpin the construction of historical time? Thirdly, what is the nature of the relationship between absolute and relative time? In attempting to answer these questions, this thesis argues that Marx saw each of these elements as playing an important role in the constitution of historical time.In particular, this thesis argues that Marx demonstrates that time is manifested in the material world through a process that expresses transhistorical features in the emanation of time through human creative activity, and historically specific elements in the socially constructed forms of time that reflect the material conditions of the particular society in which they appear. It suggests, moreover, that he shows how time is shaped by both human agency, in the form of class struggle over the appropriation and control of time, as well by deterministic forces as seen in the role of institutional structures and the movement and reproduction of capital. Again, it endeavours to show that Marx develops the notion that absolute time, which is an historically specific concept, plays a crucial role in capitalist society as a measure of exchange-value and labour time, and that it co-exists with relative time, which emanates through different production processes as multiple and discontinuous temporalities. It further argues that Marx saw capitalist society as giving rise to an historical time that is universal and directional, and that is changing in its nature in response to changes in ++</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Karl Marx, time, historical time.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Setting and timing of gold mineralization in the Jiadong and Liaodong Peninsulas, North China Craton.</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Xiao'ou</field><field name="description">The primary objective of this thesis was to date the age of gold mineralization in the Jiaodong and Liaodong Peninsulas, China. Based on SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages of dykes and host rocks at 13 gold deposits in the two peninsulas and the 40(subscript)Ar-39(subscript)Ar dating of sericite at the Cangshang deposit in the Jiaodong Peninsula, a single gold mineralization event at ca. 122 - 119 Ma has been identified.Ten gold deposits in the Jiaodong Peninsula and three gold deposits in the Liaodong Peninsula were examined. Gold mineralization can be divided into the disseminated-and-veinlet type (Jiaojla-style) and vein type (Linglong-style) and all these deposits are strongly controlled by faults. The most common host rocks are granitoids, with a SHRIMP 206(subscript)Pb/238(subscript)U age of 150 - 165 Ma. The youngest host rocks in the Jiaodong Peninsula are granodiorite, with an age of ca. 128 Ma. The oldest dated host rock in the Jiaodong Peninsula is amphibolite with a metamorphic zircon age of 1852 plus or minus 37 Ma; in the Liaodong Peninsula, the oldest host rock is metasandstone with the youngest detrital zircon giving an age of 1886 plus or minus16 Ma. The Jiaodong and Liaodong Peninsulas are underlain by Precambrian basement with components up to ca. 3.7 Ga old and these are reflected in the zircon population. There are three main peaks of inherited zircons, which yield Late Archaean (ca. 2500 Ma), Palaeoproterozoic (1800-2200 Ma) and Early Mesozoic (ca. 200-250 Ma) ages.The close spatial and temporal relationships between dykes and gold mineralization has only recently been recognized in China. Based on the cross-cutting relationship between dykes and gold lodes (and the alteration style of dykes), three types of dykes are recognized: pre-, syn- and post-mineralization dykes.

It is sited in Perth, Western Australia. Like other Australian states, Western Australia has a modern market system economy and enjoys, comparative to other countries with a market system economy, well developed social welfare and public education systems. The thesis shows how a set of fifteen people from Perth, Western Australia, who had all experienced a change in their domestic arrangements, understood time in the domestic sphere. Drawing upon their representations and constructions of their lives, and focusing on the concept of caring, this work demonstrates how temporal concepts can be utilised to control and limit choices these people have made in their lives.The evidence, collected through a series of open-ended and on-going discussions, is synthesized with theory, particularly the work of Barbara Adam. To Adam, an understanding of time involves appreciating the complexity of time. To gain such an understanding requires a research paradigm that allows this. Such an understanding requires stepping outside Cartesian dualistic thinking, including entrenched notions such as gendered time, and, an appreciation that differing temporal concepts exist and are utilised as mechanisms of control.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">domestic sphere, Western Australia, time.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Atmospheric water vapour determination from remotely sensed hyperspectral data.</field><field name="creator">Rodger, Andrew P.</field><field name="description">The accurate estimation of atmospheric water vapour and the subsequent derivation of surface spectral reflectance from hyperspectral VNIR-SWIR remotely sensed data is important for many applications. A number of algorithms have been developed for estimating water vapour content from remotely sensed hyperspectral data that do not require in-situ measurements. Two algorithms, the Continuum Interpolated Band Ratio (CIBR) and the Atmospheric Precorrected Differential Absorption (APDA) have proven to be highly effective at estimating atmospheric water vapour. Although highly successful, the two methods still exhibit unwanted or spurious results when challenging conditions are encountered. Such conditions include the estimation of atmospheric water vapour over dark targets, when uncorrected atmospheric aerosols are present and over surfaces with complex spectral signatures.A differential absorption method called the Transmittance Slope Ratio (TSR) has been developed that negates these problems. The TSR method is comprised of a weighted mean radiance that is defined between two atmospheric water absorption features which is divided by a reference channel radiance to produce a measurable ratio value. This, is turn, may be related to a reference curve, such that, the TSR value may be expressed as an atmospheric water vapour content. To test the TSR method over real terrains, AVIRIS and HyMap measured hyperspectral radiometric data were used. Three test sites were used in total with each site allowing different aspects of the water vapour estimation to be critically examined. The sites are, Jasper Ridge and Moffett Field in California and Brukunga in South Australia.The TSR method is found to significantly improve estimated atmospheric water vapour over dark targets (with less than 3.5 % error for reflectances as low as 0.5 %), improvement over nonlinear surfaces, and finally, ++</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">remotely sensed hyperspectral data, atmospheric water vapour determination.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional adaptation to exercise in elderly subjects.</field><field name="creator">Brown, Annette I.</field><field name="description">Maintenance of physical function with advancing age is vital to continued independent living, which is highly valued by older people. Although commonly associated with the ageing process, loss of functional ability may well be accelerated by inactivity and subsequent decreasing physical capacities, such as muscle performance or balance abilities. The impact of increased levels of activity on physical performance and functional ability was investigated by a single blind randomised controlled study.Two intervention programs, one based on increased levels of physical activity and the second on increased levels of social activity, were provided to a group of community-living participants aged 75 years and over. Another group, receiving no intervention was also included. The exercise intervention offered twice weekly sessions of exercise over a 16-week period. This was designed and supervised by physiotherapists. The social intervention offered a weekly, two-hour session over 13 weeks. Baseline, post-intervention and follow-up assessments measured aspects of physical performance (muscle, balance, gait and step height performance) and functional ability (tiredness of limbs, mobility tiredness and the need for assistance with mobility and activities of daily living).

An industry contaminated site - the OMEX site was selected for the study, and several extraction additives (chelating agent and surfactant) were used to investigate the application of soil washing for the removal of heavy metals and hydrocarbons. The interactions and transport of the contaminants were studied by bench-scale experiments for both heavy metals and hydrocarbons. Soil characterization was performed before the experiments.The soil characterization indicated that the OMEX soil contained large amounts of Pb, Zn (heavy metal) and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH). The contaminant concentrations were 986 mg/kg of Pb, 284 mg/kg of Zn, and 29000 mg/kg of TPH. The contaminated soil was also high in moisture content, organic content and total organic carbon (TOC). From soil analyses on different particle size fractions, most contaminants were concentrated in the fine soil fraction, below 150gm, which constituted about 35% by weight of the contaminated soil.Heavy metal removal by chelating agents was conducted first. The results showed that 3% EDTA solution offered the highest removal efficiency for both Pb and Zn. About 90% of Pb and 65% of Zn were removed by using 3% EDTA solution for 29 hours. The extraction kinetics proved to be slow, reaching equilibrium in a relatively long time (more than 10 hours). In soil washing the solution pH had some effect on the removal of both Pb and Zn with marginally better removals observed at a lower pH.

The procedures developed in this research systematically evaluates and solves several critical analytical issues involved in TIMS Zn isotopic measurements such as, reducing the size of sample needed to perform an accurate and precise measurement, minimizing the effect of interferences on the Zn fractionation, reducing the blank associated with the analyses, dissolution and purification of different natural samples, and the generally ignored issue of the effect of the ion exchange chemistry (Zn separation) to the fractionation of Zn. These procedures have allowed sub-permil fractionations in the isotopic composition of Zn to be revealed in small Zn sample (1&#181;g), and the determination of low level (ng) elemental abundance of Zn in samples to be measured accurately by the means of isotope dilution mass spectrometry IDMS.

The first study categorised visitors' use of a sound exhibit and found that 49% successfully used the exhibit. Understanding was described with a knowledge hierarchy and learning was measured using a pre-test and post-test. Findings indicated that many visitors had prior knowledge of the relevant concepts and 50% of visitors learnt a concept from the exhibit. The second study investigated young children's understanding and interaction with the Mitey Quarry, a cooperative exhibit of four elements, conveyor, elevator, auger and sorter, which were used to move balls around the exhibit. Findings indicated that children's activities and their level of understanding varied for each element, though higher levels were achieved with elements that were easily observable. The children's activities began with observation, and then vacillated between manipulation, operation and control of an element. The third study identified the educational objectives of a physical fitness exhibit, Let's Get Physical, and their achievement by high school students. Findings indicated that the instructional sequence integrated cognitive and affective objectives, and although 42% of students stated their intentions to begin new exercise activities in response to the exhibit message "to be active everyday", after two weeks, these intentions had not been enacted.

Continuous phase modulated (CPM) signals have gained attention because of their attractive power spectra (Steele, 1992). It has been shown that the trellis coded modulation (TCM) schemes could provide better bit error rate performances compared to the uncoded schemes (Ungerboeck, 1982). Therefore, the combination of TCM which improves error probability and CPM signals which yield low spectral occupancy is expected to provide good coding and modulation over bandwidth and power limited channels such as the one encountered in mobile radio communications.In this research, a Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) scheme, which combines convolutional coding and partial response Continuous Phase Modulation (CPM) such as Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK), is investigated. Also, this study concentrates on the use of rate-half convolutional codes, and GMSK (B(subscript)0T=0.3). The latter has been adopted in the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) system.Appropriate codes are selected assuming Maximum Likelihood Sequence Detection (MLSD) based on the Viterbi algorithm using an extensive computer search. The bit-error-rate (BER) performances of the selected trellis coded GMSK schemes are theoretically evaluated in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and frequency-flat fading. In the case of fading, the analysis is simplified to assume only amplitude-fading, and without considering the effect of fading on the phase of the received signal.Computer simulations are used to evaluate the BER performances of the proposed trellis coded GMSK schemes in the presence of AWGN and practical impairments, such as sample timing offset and carrier phase errors.

The effect of temperature, buffer, concentrations and complexation were investigated. Both compounds showed acceleration in rates due to general acid catalysis from buffer species. The buffer catalysis rate constants due to total phosphate and total acetate at 55 degrees celsius were 5.84x10(subscript)-1 (mol dm(subscript)-3)(subscript)-1 h(subscript)-1 and 1.53 X10(subscript)-1 (mol dm(subscript)-3)(subscript)-1 h(subscript)-1 for amoxycillin, 2.33 (mol dm(subscript)-3)(subscript)-1 h(subscript)-1 and 4.4x10(subscript)-1 mol dm(subscript)-3)(subscript)-1 h(subscript)-1 for clavulanate respectively.

The method that we describe is based on symbolic representations of the patterns. The typical representation has a spatial component that describes the relationships of the objects and a temporal component that describes the ordering of the actions of the objects in the scene. The incremental learning algorithm (ILF) uses evidence based forgetting, generates compact concept structures and can track concept drift.We also present two novel algorithms that combine incremental learning and image analysis. The first algorithm is used in an American Football application and shows how natural language parsing can be combined with image processing and expert background knowledge to address the difficult problem of classifying and learning American Football plays. We present in detail the model developed to representAmerican Football plays, the parser used to process the transcript of the American Football commentary and the algorithms developed to label the players and classify the queries. The second algorithm is used in a cricket application. It combines incremental machine learning and camera motion estimation to classify and learn common cricket shots. We describe the method used to extract and convert the camera motion parameter values to symbolic form and the processing involved in learning the shots.Finally, we explore the issues that arise from combining incremental learning with incremental recognition.

It consists of 92 named species and is an important component of some kwongan communities. Various aspects of the ecology of three threatened species of Dryandra (Dryandra ionthocarpa, D. mimica and D. serra) were studied. Threats to these species include weed invasion, inappropriate fire regimes, disturbance from roads, recreational activities, grazing, trampling, clearing and chemical drift from adjacent farms. Knowledge presented within on the ecology and biology of these three species is needed to develop appropriate conservation and management strategies.Population measurements of plant dimensions and seed bank size were assessed. Seed banks of all three species were shown to increase with increasing plant size. D. ionthocarpa and D. serra produced large numbers of viable seeds which was related to their mode of regeneration after fire. Experimental fires killed both species and seedling recruitment occurred following the death of adult plants. This indicated that both species are nonsprouters. D. mimica produced extremely small numbers of seeds, and had a high level of barren cones. Following an experimental burn, resprouting of adult plants was observed, but no seedling recruitment, indicating that this species is a resprouter.Granivore exclusion experiments showed that the seed banks of D. ionthocarpa and D. serra increased after the application of insecticide or bagging. Granivores are therefore considered to be a significant factor limiting the size of the seed bank. Timing of attack for D. ionthocarpa was shown to occur early in inflorescence development. However, the seed predators did not start to consume the seeds until after the infructescence was almost fully developed.Translocation studies were used to investigate whether D. ionthocarpa could survive and grow on ++</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">conservation biology, Dryandra serra, Dryandra mimica, Dryandra ionthocarpa.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=11564</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive behavioural cognition.</field><field name="creator">Briscoe, Garry</field><field name="description">Cognitive Science is at a crossroad. Since its inception, the prevailing paradigm in Cognitive Science (and associated fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Psychology, and Linguistics), has been a formal, computer-based model of cognition - often termed the Symbol Processing System model (SPS) or cognitivism. This view, while still accepted by the majority of researchers, has been dogged by persistent and cutting criticism by various authors over many years. As well, the initial over-inflated promises made by the early practitioners within these fields have not come to fruition, and the initial enthusiasm has in many cases been reduced to frustration.Many researchers have looked to the field of connectionism as a solution, and this discipline has found a new lease of life after a serious setback in the early 1970s. The major emphasis within this area has been on feed-forward neural networks (FFNN), but this paradigm also has its detractors.In this thesis we critically evaluate both of these research programs, especially that of SPS. We propose a new model of human and animal cognition, termed Adaptive Behavioral Cognition (ABC), which integrates many current views on cognition, and provides a single-architecture, biologically-feasible theory that overcomes many of the problems associated with current models. As well as being an accurate description of the processes relevant to the new model, the term ABC is a none-too-subtle reference to the fact that we need to closely re-examine the aims and achievements of Cognitive Science and return to basic empirical findings in developing a theory of cognition.The new model synthesises, unifies and links together many previously disjoint ideas and observations, from the neural level through to neurological structures and to observed behaviour.

The first is to investigate heuristically the sources and nature of meaning experienced by residents and staff living and working in an Australian nursing home. The second is to interpret those experiences within the context of wellness.The study utilises heuristic inquiry as the research method from an occupational science perspective. Occupational science is concerned with the ways in which humans realise their sense of meaning through both their daily occupations and their unique way of being in the world.Heuristic inquiry is utilised for both the research design and the analysis of data. The primary source of data was my own experience of working in Australian nursing homes as a nurse, educator, and grief counsellor; and of having supported the six members of my family who have lived and died in Australian nursing homes. In addition multiple other sources of data were accessed: residents and staff from three suburban Australian nursing homes; personal and professional memoirs of life and work in Australian nursing homes; novels depicting characters faced with nursing home life; and research report on the needs of elderly Aboriginal people also faced with nursing home admission.Data were collected using a diverse range of techniques: self dialogue, participant-observation, informal, semi-structured, and group interviews, analysis of staff journal entries, and analysis of the textual material - memoirs, novels, and the research report.The findings indicate that nursing home residents experience a sense of meaning when they are able to maintain a sense of connection with an enduring sense of self. Nursing home staff, on the other hand, experience a sense of meaning in association with their work when they are able to access their personally constructed vision of a professional self identity.

The thesis is drawn principally from ten separate studies and is divided into discrete sections, or experiments, that provide an understanding of the fundamental aspects of the effects of the atmosphere, water surface, water column and bottom on sensor-received reflected signal.The results show the importance of precise calculation of acquisition parameters and the absolute importance of relevant reference data. Most instrumentation for remote sensing at visible wavelengths has been developed for terrestrial applications where signal is rarely limiting and target features are relatively static. For in-water applications, where signal is small and noise can be large, the features to be sensed may be temporally dynamic and obscured.However, the work presented also shows the great benefit and spatial cost-effectiveness that can be obtained if the spectral and temporal specification is adequately considered. The prime motivation for such applications usually comes from the requirement to detect and quantify water column characteristics, such as phytoplankton forming as algal blooms, and bottom stratigraphic condition, such as benthic habitat mapping for fishery or conservation purposes.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coastal environments, water columns, remote sensing.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=10817</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managerial career development for women in health contexts : metamorphosis from quandary to confidence.</field><field name="creator">Ross, Frances M.</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to construct a theory for women's managerial career development that explained how women in health care services and health science faculties achieved senior management positions and developed their careers. It sought to discover the main barriers to career progress and achievement of senior level positions by women in health related organisations and to identify how women managers dealt with obstacles. In-depth interviews with 35 women managers in senior positions in 19 different organisations from three different cultural regions formed the major data source; observations, field notes, personal and operational journals, documents, and literature supplemented this data.This research was conducted in two phases. In phase one a descriptive approach was used to develop propositions about women managers and their careers. These propositions formed the guidelines for phase two. The second phase used grounded theory methods, incorporating feminist and interpretative perspectives to identify the previously inarticulated core problem shared by participants. The barriers that women encountered were the contradictory, inconsistent and incompatible assumptions about their potential to have long term careers and ability to move into senior level management positions.These assumptions had been received during their life and educational experiences, as well as from their organisations. The gendered context of health care organisations and university educational institutions contributed to the limited career aspirations and career progress of women with health professional qualifications. By applying grounded theory strategies for analysis of the data, it was discovered that the women managers dealt with this problem through a core process, labelled metamorphosis, a four stage process for overcoming assumptions.

The estimation procedures include classical and Bayesian methods from a parametric and a semiparametric point of view.As the theoretical importance of stationarity is a primary concern in estimation of time series models, we begin the thesis with a thorough investigation of necessary or sufficient conditions for ergodicity of a first-order STAR process followed by the necessary and sufficient conditions for recurrence and classification for null-recurrence and transience.The estimation procedure is started by using Bayesian analysis which derives posterior distributions of parameters with a noninformative prior for the STAR models of order p. The predictive performance of the STAR models using the exact one-step-ahead predictions along with an approximation to multi-step-ahead predictive density are considered. The theoretical results are then illustrated by simulated data sets and the well- known Canadian lynx data set.The parameter estimation obtained by conditional least squares, maximum likelihood, M-estimator and estimating functions are reviewed together with their asymptotic properties and presented under the classical and parametric approaches. These estimators are then used as preliminary estimators for obtaining adaptive estimates in a semiparametric setting. The adaptive estimates for a first-order STAR model with delay parameter one exist only for the class of symmetric error densities.

A number of electrode configurations such as the Schlumberger and Wenner arrays, dipole-dipole and pole-pole geometries are in common use for electrical surveying. New acquisition systems enable the convenient collection of data with a number of common configurations at the same time. It is found however that while the recovery of layered structure from electrical surveys can be effective, the sensitivity and resolving power of such systems in detecting the presence of anomalous three-dimensional (3-D) bodies is poor. This is mainly due to the dominance of conduction pathways through the layered earth compared to the influence of small 3-D conductivity anomalies.Theoretical relationships between the responses of various survey geometries to the layered earth may be established as is shown in this thesis, but their response to 3-D targets differs strongly. This thesis introduces a new procedure for anomalous target detection by the computation of an apparent resistivity residual using multi-electrode configuration survey data. This procedure, applicable to a variety of electrode geometries, reduces the dominance of the layered earth response and enhances the signal from 3-D structures.In the development and testing of this new apparent resistivity residual, numerically modelled data were used. In order to obtain suitable test data of high accuracy it was necessary to make improvements to modelling software. For this purpose, recently developed techniques in numerical modelling such as the biconjugate gradient method, new digital linear filters for computation of Hankel transforms, and spectral formalism were employed in an integral equation approach for the software developed in this thesis.The computed apparent ++</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">signal enhancement, multisystem resistivity measurement.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=10895</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cardioactive compounds from the Australian plant genus, Eremophila (Myoporaceae).</field><field name="creator">Pennacchio, Marcello</field><field name="description">For over 40 000 years, the Australian Aboriginal people relied on native plants as a source of medicinal agents. Although they employed a wide range of species for this purpose, some of the most commonly used were Eremophila species (Myoporaceae). In particular, E. alternifolia was considered the 'number one medicine'. Reportedly, infusions of the leaves were used both internally and externally as an analgesic, decongestant and expectorant. This was believed to be useful in the treatment of colds, influenza, fevers and headaches, as well as for sterilising septic wounds and for promoting general well being.A methanolic extract of E. alternifolia leaves was tested on Langendorff rat hearts and was shown to mediate significant increases in heart rate (chronotropism), contractile force (inotropism) and coronary perfusion rate (CPR). With similar responses to those induced by adrenaline, it seemed likely that the active constituents of E. alternifolia leaves may have acted through adrenergic receptors. Challenging the extract with alpha- and beta- receptor antagonists did not, however, significantly reduce the size of responses. The active compound acted through a different mechanism.The identity of the active constituent in E. alternifolia leaves was revealed and shown to be a known phenylethanoid glycoside called verbascoside. Also known as acteoside, this compound's identity was confirmed by comparison of its spectral parameters with those described in the literature and by comparative tlc behaviour with that of standard samples. Its effects on the Langendorff rat heart were similar to those induced by the methanolic extract, but were more pronounced and did not act through adrenergic receptors or slow calcium channels .

My analysis is critical because I seek ultimately to free teachers and students from repressive science cultural myths. Within this thesis, my critical analysis reveals the character of prevailing science cultural myths and provides evidence of their power within school science to legitimate specific forms of science knowledge to the exclusion of other forms. Subsequently, I propose a philosophical science framework for enabling teachers and students of science to transform their teaching and learning practices. These three aspects provide the framework of my thesis.The first step in my critical analysis involved the identification of the major characteristics of cultural myths. A cultural myth is a shared network of beliefs that regulate and order social practices that forgets how it was created. I argue that myths are characterised by their apparent invisibility once their historical evolution has been forgotten. Using this definition, I then examined the genesis of myths during the emergence of experimental philosophy in Western Europe in the 17th century and identified the following science cultural myths: myths associated with a naive realist perspective of observation and experimentation; myths that present science as justified, true knowledge; myths of a mechanical cosmology; and myths associated with the apparent transparency of language.Next, I examined literary aspects of school science, specifically textbooks, to search for the presence of these science cultural myths. I argue that the science presented in school science can be described as science stories, and that within these stories there is an iterative relationship between the 'facts' selected for the telling and science cultural myths.

A pilot study was conducted to test the possibility that the mass of a ball, the distance thrown and the size of targets were the control parameters. Based upon the results of the pilot study, only the distance was manipulated as an independent variable in the principal study.Three-dimensional motion was recorded using three video cameras in the motion analysis laboratory and later analysed using the Peak motion analysis system (software version 5.0, 1992). Sixteen right handed adult females, aged 18 - 35 years, volunteered to participate in the principal study. Subjects were seated with their trunks secured to the back support of an adjustable chair. Ten different targets (0.6 to 6.91 m) were labelled on the floor in front of the subjects. A large area for each target was defined so that the throwing skill of subjects could be ignored as a factor in the research design. Subjects were asked to throw a 0.5 kg ball to ten different distances using their own styles which allowed them to change the pattern of throwing as the distance thrown increased.All 16 subjects selected either an overarm or an underarm throw or employed both patterns. No subject used other patterns of throwing. At the shortest distance, a greater number of subjects selected an underarm throw. As the distance thrown increased, some subjects switched to the overarm throw. At the distance of 3.36 m, there were eight subjects (50%) using each style of throwing. Alteration of the throwing pattern mainly occurred from the underarm to the overarm throw.

The procedures involve isolation of the phenolic components of the sedimentary organic matter by extraction with alkaline aqueous methanol, followed by the removal of carboxylic acids using a back extraction step. Co-extracted non-polar components are removed from the alkaline extract by liquid chromatography or by extracting it with hexane. The phenol isolates thus obtained were analysed by capillary GC, GC-MS and GC-FTIR. Recoveries of 70-95% were measured for C(subscript)0-C(subscript)3 alkylphenol compounds using these procedures.Crude oil samples (45) representing a range of locations, ages, depositional environments, maturities, source types, and biodegradation levels have been analysed for their phenol contents. A range of C(subscript)0-C(subscript)5 alkylphenols (approximately 40) were identified in crude oils using co-chromatography on up to three different stationary phases and by comparison of their retention times, mass spectral and infrared spectral properties with reference compounds.

However, the literature fails to consider the role of technology in such developments. It was suggested that this was central to the development of skills.A framework was proposed that hypothesized a relationship between technological uncertainty the extent to which task activities are varied and difficult and skill requirements. It was further hypothesized that technology influences the structuring of activities within organisational subsystems. It was suggested that these would act either to facilitate or inhibit multi-skilling development.The structuring of activities within a unit consist of specialisation (the number of different tasks assigned to the unit); standardisation (the degree to which policies, rules, and procedures are formalised and used to guide action); interchangeability (the extent to which A can perform Bs job at short notice, and vice versa); locus of authority (the source of decision-making authority within the unit, for example, the supervisor rather than the worker); and skill heterogeneity (the variability in skill composition among unit members).A preliminary evaluation of the framework was carried out in an organisation engaged in the processing of mineral ore, with a largely semi-skilled workforce (N=165), where a multi-skilling programme was in progress.Evidence was presented that suggested a relationship between the level of technological uncertainty and ++</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">job flexibility, assessment, multi-skilled workers.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=11141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">People, poets, puppets: popular performance and the wong cilik in contemporary Java.</field><field name="creator">Curtis, Richard A.</field><field name="description">Many studies have analysed the ways in which the dominant forces of state and capital are shaping contemporary Indonesian political economy, social relations and cultural production. More and more of such studies have evaluated the significance of the "middle class(es)" as a burgeoning social force. Few studies specifically address the social agency of the subordinated classes, the bulk of Indonesia's population, identified as the wong cilik in this study. Only recently have some scholars begun to take seriously the rapid formation of an urban working class as an increasingly important component in Indonesian social dynamics. An underlying assumption of this study is that cultural production, in particular, popular performance, is an important window on, and component of, wong cilik social agency. This assumption is pursued by observing three principal sites of cultural contestation, poetry, the shadow play, wayang kulit, and "modem" theatre. These three, often overlapping sites, are set within a broad survey of popular performance in Java, followed by a regional focus on Tegal, located on the north west coast of Central Java.A bias in analysis towards the more formal and visible aspects of cultural production, such as performance text and conventions, has led to a distortion and insufficient recognition of wong cilik social agency. The first task of this study, therefore, is to develop a better approach to identifying and evaluating wong cilik cultural agency. The approach for which we are looking demands attention be given to the less formal aspects and social context of popular performance.

This research attempts to do so, by analysing the non-economic issues and factors involved in the financing and provision of health care. It will be argued that policy makers commonly have a unidirectional economic perspective in both policy making and in health care system reform directives, a situation which leaves issues such as the health status of the population and of equity in resource allocation to political rhetoric, while in practice, policies deal with the issue of cost reduction. Of major importance is the moral dimension in policies dealing with health and welfare, which is clearly either forgotten or is afforded too little consideration in policy making. This is particularly relevant to the issue of rationing of health care in publicly provided health care systems. While always quietly practised by clinicians in the past, rationing is now required to be overt because demand for health care has outstripped available resources.The substance of the argument comes from the analysis of a very large literature on the broader issues affecting health care policy, such as concepts of social justice, ethics of resource allocation and the physician-patient relationship, all of winch ought to underpin policies for the mechanisms of funding and provision of health care systems.A conceptual diagram of a health care system is offered to provide a framework for the discussion of how the issues are interrelated at micro, meso and macro levels in policymaking.

One of the most important decisions in the design of surface mine is the selection of mine equipment and plant. Now that increasing effort is being invested in the design and manufacture of continuous surface miners it is appropriate to examine how their performance can be related to the physical properties of the rock mass and intact rock.Over the years many attempts have been made to develop a means of assessing the excavatability of rock. Most of them are based on an empirical rating system whilst some authorities still propose the use of seismic velocity as a direct predictor of the rippability of a rock mass. On the other hand there are a number of classical models which have been developed to define the cutting force required at the pick or tooth of continuous miners.Whilst these methods have been applied with various degrees of success to the design of excavation systems there is no generally acceptable method of defining the excavatability or cuttability of a rock mass in terms of the machine power required to generate a particular rate of production.An attempt is made to overcome this deficiency by recording the intact and rock mass properties at Limestone quarry in Retznei, Austria; Openpit Gold Mines in Meekatharra and Mt Gibson of Western Australia and Openpit Coal Mine in Air Laya, Indonesia, where VASM-2D and Bucket Wheel Excavator O&amp;K SchRs(800/1.2)15 or O&amp;K S630 were in use in the first mine sites and Air Laya respectively to use this data to examine the relationships between the relevant dimensionless groups developed from a dimensional analysis of the problem.The dimensionless groups are obtained by examining the factors which influence the productivity of a surface miner.

After more than 30 years of increasing investment in educational computing researchers are concerned that there has been very little impact on the experiences of students in schools. In the 1990s, a significant development in computer technology has been the emergence of low-cost, high-powered portable computers which some schools have introduced into classrooms. It is not clear what the impact of this development might be.This study addressed issues concerning the impact of student-owned, portable computers on students, teachers, the curriculum, and the classroom learning environment. It considered the classroom learning environment as the complex set of relationships between students, teachers, the curriculum, and the technology (principally computer hardware and software) within the physical confines of a classroom.The three year study was carried out at one girls' school, which progressively introduced portable computers into its secondary education program-me. The study used an interpretive methodology involving the collection of a range of qualitative and quantitative data. In each year of the study, data were collected about students, teachers and a selection of classrooms using observations of lessons, interviews, questionnaires, and a range of data obtained from the school's administration. As the study progressed, it focussed on those features of the psycho-social environment of the school which emerged as important from interpretation of data collected earlier.The study found that, apart from isolated teacher-class combinations, there was very little change at the classroom level which could be attributed to the presence of the computers.

By improving the inventory of forest cover, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) in Perth can calculate up to date biogenic emission estimates for the photochemical smog model.Outputs from the DEP's photochemical smog model were integrated into a Geographical Information System (GIS) and subsequently visualised to show plume movement and potential environmental impact. Two datasets (nitrogen oxides and ozone) were provided to investigate the volumetric and dynamic temporal movement of photochemical smog in Perth on one day, March 16, 1994.Nitrogen oxide sources can range from industry and petroleum refining to motor vehicle exhaust emissions, and are a major precursor to photochemical smog (ozone) formation in Perth. Natural emission sources (forest or biogenic emissions) can also be an important contributing factor to the photochemical smog mix in Perth. Biogenic emissions are comprised of Reactive Organic Chemicals (ROC) or Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) which act as a catalyst to aid the nitrogen oxide conversion to ozone.Three-dimensional and four-dimensional GIS techniques were used to highlight both plume movement and environmental impact.

Although the work is primarily taxonomic, it also includes biodiversity, distribution and some aspects of ecology of the brachiopods described.The most recent information on the anatomy, physiology and ecology of brachiopods is summarised at the beginning of the thesis.Identification of brachiopods is determined primarily on internal morphological features as brachiopods tend to be homomorphic, many species looking externally the same. The morphological features used in the identification of the brachiopods described within the thesis are defined.The fossil material studied has come from four sedimentary basins in Western Australia. The Carnarvon Basin contains Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic fossil material. The Perth Basin also has Late Cretaceous and late Cenozoic brachiopods The Bremer and Eucla Basin have Cenozoic deposits. The stratigraphy of the deposits containing the brachiopods is described.Until this study commenced, eight species had been described from Western Australia. This thesis describes fifty eight species including thirty new species, one new family and two new genera.In preparing descriptions of the new species it become evident that many of the species from the Southern Hemisphere were quite different to those found in the Northern Hemisphere. Their closest affiliation was with genera and species described from the Antarctic Peninsula. Four genera and one species from the Late Cretaceous deposits of Western Australia are common to the Late Cretaceous deposits of the Antarctic Peninsula. In the examination of the Tertiary material from the Carnarvon Basin, it also became clear that there was a strong correlation with Tertiary material from the Antarctic Peninsula. At least four genera are common to both deposits.

Although various still image and image sequence compression algorithms have already been developed, it is very difficult for them to achieve both compression performance and coding efficiency simultaneously due to the complexity of the compression process itself. As a results, improvements in the forms of hybrid coding, coding procedure refinement, new algorithms and even new coding concepts have been constantly tried, some offering very encouraging results.In this thesis, Block Adaptive Classified Vector Quantisation (BACVQ) has been developed as an alternative algorithm for still image compression. It is found that BACVQ achieves good compression performance and coding efficiency by combining variable block-size coding and classified VQ. Its performance is further enhanced by adopting both spatial and transform domain criteria for the image block segmentation and classification process. Alternative algorithms have also been developed to accelerate normal codebook searching operation and to determine the optimal sizes of classified VQ sub-codebooks.For image sequence compression, an adaptive spatial/temporal compression algorithm has been developed which divides an image sequence into smaller groups of pictures (GOP) using adaptive scene segmentation before BACVQ and variable block-size motion compensated predictive coding are applied to the intraframe and interframe coding processes. It is found the application of the proposed adaptive scene segmentation algorithm, an alternative motion estimation strategy and a new progressive motion estimation algorithm enables the performance and efficiency of the compression process to be improved even further.Apart from improving still image and image sequence compression algorithms, the application of parallel ++</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">signal compression, image compression, digital television.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early childhood educators' attitudes to science and science education.</field><field name="creator">Russo, Sharon</field><field name="description">It has long been acknowledged that pre-service Early Childhood teachers enter university with a notable lack of confidence, high levels of anxiety and an aversion to science and mathematics. Unless redressed during their time spent at university, such negative attitudes may ultimately influence the quality of science education these teachers offer to young children. This study considers the affective attitudes to science and science education of those people considered to be central to the education of young children.Specifically the study investigates the attitudes and backgrounds in science/ science education, of academics, pre-service and in-service teachers together with their attitudes towards teaching science to young children. The attitudes to science of a group of young children, aged between 4 and 8 years, were also investigated in the study. The potential links between the attitudes held by each group was of great interest to the researcher who considered the ways that academics promoted the teaching of science to young children, the factors influencing the willingness of pre-service and in-service teachers to present science to young children and the effect that teachers have on the responses of young children to science.The findings suggest that in contrast to the attitudes towards science of pre- and in-service teacher groups in the study, the young children and academics displayed attitudes such as interest, curiosity, confidence and enjoyment towards their experiences in science. There was a strong link between the memory of prior experiences in science and the present attitudes to science of the adult participants. The implications of the study are that science education in the early years will be enhanced if ways can be found to provide more positive science related experiences for pre-service and in-service teachers.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science education, Early Childhood teachers,  attitudes, science.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Graphs with prescribed adjacency properties</field><field name="creator">Ananchuen, Watcharaphong</field><field name="description">A graph G is said to have property P(m,n,k) if for any set of m + n distinct vertices there are at least k other vertices, each of which is adjacent to the first m vertices but not adjacent to any of the latter n vertices. The class of graphs having property P(m.n,k) is denoted by &#950;(m,n,k). The problem that arises is that of characterizing the class &#950;(m,n,k). One particularly interesting problem that arises concerns the functionP(m,n,k) = min{&#965;(G) : G &#1108; &#950;(m,n,k) }.In Chapter 2, we establish some important properties of graphs in the class &#950;(m,n,k) and a lower bound on p(m,n,k).

These classes include the cubes, "generalized" Petersen graphs and "generalized" Hoffman-Singleton graphs.An important graph in the study of the class &#950;(m,n,k) is the Paley graph Gq defined as follows.

Traditional approaches to structural engineering education place a heavy emphasis on lecture-based delivery of the theories of structural analysis and the behaviour of common constructions materials. Design projects are given varying emphasis at different institutions, but are frequently left to the final year of the course. Assessment weighting often heavily favours examinations over project work. In recent years, the engineering profession and the bodies responsible for accrediting engineering programs have called for change in assessment and teaching practices.This study proposed that the use of design projects in structural engineering is an effective method of learning that models industrial practice. Projects enable students to understand the synthesis of structural analysis, material behaviour and availability, constructability and economic reality that occurs in the professional practice of structural engineering. To examine effectiveness of project-based learning in structural engineering a case study was undertaken in a third year undergraduate course of a civil engineering program in South Australia.This thesis first provides some background to structural engineering and current practice in structural engineering education. Project-based learning as applied to engineering is also examined. The case study design and data collection are then discussed.

Coupled with this high level of endemism, many taxa are threatened which makes them vulnerable to habitat alterations, modifications and destruction. Significant habitat alteration in many areas has resulted in 27 species becoming extinct in the South West Botanical Province, while an additional 327 species are classified as rare and endangered. In the context of stemming this loss of biodiversity, research in cryopreservation was undertaken to provide offsite protection and conservation of somatic germplasm.Cryostorage techniques were evaluated in this study to determine the key factors which may affect the ability of somatic tissues of Haemodoraceae species to survive, recover and grow following liquid nitrogen (LN) immersion and storage. Using Anigozanthos viridis as a comparator in most experiments, the base vitrification protocol was established, which involved: (1) preculturing shoot apices on 0.4 M sorbitol for 48 h; (2) incubation in a vitrification cryoprotective solution (PVS2) for 25 min at 0 degrees celsius; (3) LN immersion; (4) recovery to active growth through warming (immersion in a 40 degrees celsius water bath). Using this procedure the highest post-LN survival of shoot apices for A. viridis was 41.4 plus or minus 6.1% Four additional taxa were successfully cryopreserved with this base protocol (Anigozanthos manglesii, A. rufus, Conostylis wonganensis and A. rufus x A. pulcherrimus); a fifth taxon, Macropidia fuliginosa, however, proved unresponsive.To improve on post-LN survival, further research established that four of the six study taxa responded to the following amendments to the basic protocol: (1) longer preculture duration; (2) preculture on ++</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">somatic tissue, Haemoradaceae, Western Australia, cryopreservation.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12678</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect on teachers of using mathematical investigation tasks as tools for assessment.</field><field name="creator">Albert, Jeanne</field><field name="description">This study set out to determine the relationship between assessment practices and teaching methods.

Research tells us that standardized tests influence instruction. My research explored whether a national Assessment Task Bank of mathematical investigative tasks could influence teachers.With these aims in mind, the following research questions were formulated:1. Will the teachers' use of mathematical investigation tasks for assessment purposes influence their view of mathematics?2. Will the teachers' use of mathematical investigation tasks for assessment purposes influence the way they teach, and if so, in what ways?3. Will the teachers' use of mathematical investigation tasks for assessment purposes influence the way they assess their students, and if so, in what ways?My research was divided into two parts: 1) a national study involving teachers-leaders throughout the country; and 2) an intensive study in a small Israeli community, called Sharon. The first part examined how the national courses on assessment that I conducted affected the participating teacher-leaders in terms of their concept of mathematics, their teaching methods and their assessment practices. The second part examined the same issues with regard to the mathematics coordinators in the Sharon community.

Malnutrition is a major clinical problem in individuals with the disease. Nutritional interventions are warranted as improvements in nutritional status could improve the rates of morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. The review of the literature indicated the need to develop a behavioural-based nutrition prevention program in order for children to achieve CF dietary requirements and appropriate pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.Methods: The intervention program, Go and Grow with CF, and nutrition and pancreatic enzyme knowledge and self-management questionnaires were developed for children with CF and their carers as part of this thesis. Social learning theory constructs which particularly assist children in achieving desirable behaviours were applied during the development of the Go and Grow with CF program. The program consisted of workshops and a home-based course.Fifty eight children with cystic fibrosis, aged 2 to 11 years, and their carers participated in a clinical trial that was designed to assess the effects of the Go and Grow with CF pilot program on knowledge, self-management, behaviour, dietary intake and body composition, using anthropometry. Process evaluation was conducted on the pilot program and on the clinic-wide implementation of the revised Go and Grow with CF program. The revised program included the Australian Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy Guidelines and the effects of fat-based dosing were assessed with a cohort of 29 children with CF-related pancreatic insufficiency aged 1 to 13 years.Results: Similar to the process evaluation of the pilot program, 100% of carers who completed the revised home-based course indicated that they would recommend Go and Grow with CF to other families ++</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children, cystic fibrosis, nutrition intervention program, health behaviour change.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimation of electrochemical noise impedance and corrosion rates from electrochemical noise measurements.</field><field name="creator">Lowe, Alexander M.</field><field name="description">Electrochemical noise refers to the spontaneous fluctuations in potential and current that can be observed on a corroding metal. The use of electrochemical noise for obtaining information on the corrosion process generates much interest in research fields. One important application is the measurement of corrosion rate. This can be achieved using the electrochemical noise of a pair of electrically coupled corroding metals to obtain an estimate of electrochemical impedance - an abstract quantity that reflects various aspects of the corrosion process.There are a number of problems associated with estimation of impedance information from the electrochemical noise data, particularly regarding data pre-treatment, accuracy and precision. In addition, the present methods are incomplete: current literature does not offer information regarding the phase of the impedance; and assumptions regarding symmetry of an electrode pair cannot be tested without additional measurements.The thesis addresses the above mentioned problems. Specifically,analysis of the impedance estimation process is given to determine how precision can be affected by various factors;a novel signal processing technique is described that is shown to yield a local optimum precision;the application of the proposed signal processing to time varying systems is demonstrated by use of a time varying, frequency dependent impedance estimate;a technique for recovering phase information, given certain conditions, is suggested so that Nyquist impedance diagrams can be constructed; anda technique for testing the symmetry of a coupled pair of corroding metals is described.An integral part of electrochemical noise analysis is the software used for numerical computation.

Despite this rapid growth there has been limited research into the way people use the Internet, and the effect Internet use has on their lives (Kraut, 1996). The overall aim in the research presented in this thesis was to explore how characteristics of the individual interact with characteristics of computer-mediated communication to enable socio-emotional communication and behaviour in social text-based virtual environments. Three studies are presented. Studies One and Two are qualitative studies of social interaction in two text-based, synchronous ('real time') virtual environments: MOOs (Multi User Dimensions, Object Oriented) and Internet Relay' Chat (IRC). Grounded Theory (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967) methodology was used to develop formal theories of social interaction within these environments. Stage models of virtual environment use were developed that described changes in social interaction over time. In MOOs, changes in social interaction over time reflected the process of coming to terms with what was initially viewed by users as an alternative reality. In IRC the central feature of social interaction that emerged was the perceived ease of communication. This was attributed to the effortlessness of meeting a wide range of potential communication partners in a social context where the communication itself was simplified to text only communication. The hypotheses developed from the qualitative research in Studies One and Two were tested in Study Three.

This model decomposes the lifetime of a single learning system into a number of stages, analogous to the infant, juvenile, adolescent and adult stages of development in a biological system. This model is then applied to Kohonen's SOM algorithm.In order to better understand the operation of Kohonen's SOM algorithm, a theoretical analysis of self-organisation is performed. This analysis establishes the role played by lateral connections in organisation, and the significance of the Laplacian lateral connections common to many SOM architectures.This analysis of neighbourhood interactions is then used to develop three key variations on Kohonen's SOM algorithm. Firstly, a new scheme for parameter decay, known as Butterworth Step Decay, is presented. This decay scheme provides training times comparable to the best training times possible using traditional linear decay, but precludes the need for a priori knowledge of likely training times. In addition, this decay scheme allows Kohonen's SOM to learn in a continuous manner.Secondly, a method is presented for establishing core knowledge in the fundamental representation of a SOM. This technique is known as Syllabus Presentation. This technique involves using a selected training syllabus to reinforce knowledge known to be significant. A method for developing a training syllabus, known as Percept Masking, is also presented.Thirdly, a method is presented for preventing the loss of trained representations in a continuously learning SOM. This technique, known as Arbor Pruning, involves restricting the weight update process to prevent the loss of significant representations.

A study that bridged quantitative and qualitative methodology, it drew upon teachers' perspectives and reports of professional development activities in which they had been involved over an eighteen month period.The major focuses of the study were in exploring teachers' perceptions of their professional development activities across the following dimensions: choice, the influence of career stage, rationale for choice, equity in relation to access, levels of participation, gender factors, perceptions of effectiveness, influence of school/educational culture.The conceptual framework in this study (refer to Figure 2.1) acknowledges the teacher as the central point of reference due to his/her importance in the classroom as the architect of the learning experiences for students (Fogarty, 1999. Four aspects were identified as influences on teachers. These were professional development; factors affecting teachers' capacity to develop professionally; technological change in education; and the education system in which teachers work. Literature related to these four aspects was explored.The findings of this study, based upon in-depth interviews with teachers, indicated that the respondents were expending significant amounts of time engaged in professional development. Results demonstrated that half of the reported hours (150 hours/person/year) involved personally selected professional development.

The advent of the enterprise bargaining to facilitate labour market restructuring has led to dramatic changes within Australian industrial relations, supposedly offering employees the opportunity to participate in changes to work practices, conditions of employment and rewards in return for employer gains in productivity (Niland, 1993). Productivity improvements have been achieved, but some researchers claim this has been at employees expense and that job satisfaction and affective commitment are declining as working hours increase, work intensifies, and job security diminishes. Employee PDM influencing more positive outcomes, such as improved productivity, satisfaction and commitment is appealing, but largely untested.Research data was gathered from the public, private and local government sectors to form two separate studies to test a model of PDM developed from the literature. The first Study analysed cross-sectional data to test the influence of PDM in relation to working conditions, work practices and rewards and outcomes of job satisfaction and affective commitment, while the second Study examined these relationships on an independent longitudinal matched sample. Analysis was conducted using Structural Equation Modelling with the EQS statistical package.Findings from both studies supported that higher levels of PDM correlate with higher levels of job satisfaction and affective commitment and Autonomy is the only significant mediator in the relationship PDM and affective commitment.

Thus, the sociology of knowledge, a discipline concerned essentially with the ideological basis of knowledge, provided the theoretical underpinnings for the study.The study's overall purpose was to advance understanding of the gender/science relationship through the development and testing of a theory. Secondary school science, an area in which the problematic gender/science relationship is of particular concern and an area which suffers acutely from lack of theory in this regard, was selected as the specific focus.The problem central to the study concerned the manner in which the structure of curriculum and assessment in secondary schools appears to influence the relationship between gender and science. In addressing this problem, the study involved two major tasks. The first task was to develop a theory which reconceptualises and integrates three strands of previous research, namely, (i) theories about the sociology of knowledge and the school curriculum, drawing initially on the research of Bernstein (1971b), Young (1971b) and Broadfoot (1979); (ii) empirical research, conducted mainly by science educators, concerning the manner in which science curriculum and assessment policy and practice appear to interact with gender; and, (iii) theories developed from the postmodernist feminist critique of science.

Potential benefits which follow are diverse and include contributions to, and improved scientific understanding of, ecological systems, rangeland management, famine warning, agricultural commodity trading, and the study of global climate change.A NOAA-AVHRR data set containing monthly observations of green vegetation cover over a ten year period was acquired and analysed, to extract information on seasonal conditions. The data were supplied as a vegetation index, commonly known as the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), with a spatial resolution of approximately five km. The data set was acquired from three different satellites, and calibration problems were known to exist. A new technique was developed to estimate, and subsequently remove, the calibration bias present in the data.Monthly rainfall measurements were used as surrogate ground truth to validate the NDVI data. For regions of native vegetation, linear models relating NDVI to previous rainfall were derived, using transfer function techniques in common use in systems engineering. The models demonstrate that, in mid-latitude regions, the NDVI is a linear function of rainfall recorded over the preceding seven or eight months.Annual summaries of the image data were developed to highlight the amount and timing of plant growth. Three fundamental questions were posed as an aid to the development of the summary technique: where, when and how much? These summaries highlight the extraordinary spatial and temporal variations in plant growth, and hence rainfall, over much of Western Australia each year.Standard analysis techniques used in time series analysis, such as classical decomposition, were successfully applied to the analysis of NDVI time series.

These studies investigated the changes in circulating insulin and glucagon concentrations during lactation, the relative numbers of insulin receptors in insulin-sensitive tissues, and glucose utilisation by these tissues. However, at that time, no information was available on the structure of the mammary insulin receptor. The rationale for undertaking this study was to characterise the structure of the rat mammary insulin receptor as a means of furthering our understanding of the role insulin plays during lactation.An initial requirement of this study was the development of a method for the convenient and inexpensive preparation of A14-tyrosyl[125I]iodoinsulin. A14-tyrosyl[125I]iodoinsulin displays binding characteristics which are virtually indistinguishable from the native hormone, which is a necessary requirement for tracers which are to be used in binding studies. In Chapter 2, I describe a method for the purification of A14-tyrosyl[125I]iodoinsulin from a mixture of iodinated insulin molecules which are produced following oxidation by chloramine-T in the presence of Na125iodine. In this method I employed disposable cartridges packed with a C18 support matrix to which the iodinated insulin molecules are readily adsorbed when in an aqueous solution.A 14-tyrosyl[125I]iodoinsulin absorbed most strongly to the C18 matrix and unwanted products were removed through a sequence of washes prior to the elution of the A14-tyrosyl[125I]iodoinsulin derivative using a buffer containing 50% (v/v) acetonitrile. This prodct was unambiguously shown to be A14-tyrosyl[125I]iodoinsulin by N-terminal amino acid sequencing.

The selected coal samples for the study were also obtained from the Premier Sub-basin of the Collie Basin and the Irwin Sub-basin of the Perth Basin. The Early Permian coal measures are described as the Sue Coal Measures from the Vasse Shelf, the Ewington Coal Measures from the Premier Sub-basin and the coal measures from the Irwin sub-basin are described as the Irwin River Coal Measures.The Vasse Shelf coal is finely banded and the dominant lithotypes are dull and dull banded types, followed by bright banded and banded types, with minor bright types. The variation of dull and bright lithotypes represents fluctuating conditions of water table level during the growth of peat in the swamp. The maceral composition of the coal is predominantly composed of inertinite, followed by vitrinite and minor exinite and mineral matter. The coal is characterized by very low to medium semifusinite ratio and medium to high vitrinite content, supporting the deposition in anaerobic wet conditions with some degree of oxidation. The coal is classified as sub- bituminous to high volatile bituminous of the Australian classification. In terms of microlithotype group, the predominance of inertite over vitrite suggests the coal was formed under drier conditions with high degree of oxidation during its deposition. On the basis of the interpretations of lithotypes, macerals, microlithotypes and trace elements, the depositional environment of the coal is braided and meandering deltaic-river system without any brackish or marine influence.The maceral composition of the Collie coal predominantly consists of inertinite and vitrinite, with low exinite and mineral matter.

If a relationship between the motor control systems for feeding and communication is present, it could have implications for the early identification of communication deficits in children. Theoretical support exists for a relationship between the feeding and speech motor systems based on evolutionary theory (Blanchard, 1963), and anatomical similarities in oral motor function (Morris, 1985, 1990, 1991, 1998). However, the existence of a causal relationship between early feeding and communication development remains uncertain due to a lack of empirical research. A model proposed by Carpendale and Lewis (2004) encompasses the triadic interaction between the environment, maternal factors, and infant factors, which can influence both feeding and communication development. Clinical feeding assessments typically employed by clinicians and researchers are most often carried out with observational checklists. Data reflecting the theoretical foundation, validity, and reliability for these tools are limited. Observation tools assess specific aspects of feeding and oral motor control from a modular perspective, without regard for the infant&#8217;s total feeding system. Rogers and Arvedson (2005) highlighted the need for a single standardised assessment tool to assess infant feeding descriptively and objectively. The primary aim of the project was to determine whether the same motor control mechanisms are utilised for oral feeding and communication.

One such industry is the production of Alumina. The Alumina industry in Australia is the major producer of alumina in the western world with over 25 million tonnes of Bauxite Residue per annum. Alcoa World Alumina (Alcoa) has three refineries in Western Australia producing approximately 20,000 tonnes of Mud and a similar level of Red Sand each day. These as yet unutilised potential resources are being stockpiled, occupying a significant footprint. It is widely recognised within industry that there would be economic, environment and social benefits if a sustainable use for these materials were found. One such potential by-product is the production of coarse bauxite residue (Red Sand), neutralised and washed low in salt. The main purpose of this research was to establish a potential market for this material, through scientific evaluation of Red Sand as a replacement of natural fine aggregate (Natural Yellow Sand) in concrete mixes. For this research, the mixed stream of Bauxite Residue (fine and coarse) obtained in the Bayer process was neutralized by a process of carbonation then washed using cyclones and counter current wash towers to a value added byproduct. The coarse particles (Washed and Carbonated Sand-WCS) of the stream were separated by Wet High Intensity Magnetic Separation technique (WHIMS) so that different segments such as High Iron Sand (HIS) and Low Iron Sand (LIS) were formed. Physical, chemical and mineralogical properties of these materials have been tested and compared with that of natural sand. Several mixes of concrete were then designed using Red Sand as a fine aggregate in order to verify their effects on strength and durability indicators of concrete.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">minerals industry, alumina industry, coarse bauxite residue (red sand), natural fine aggregate, concrete mixes, potential market</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=115095</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The phytoplankton ecology of Wilson Inlet, Western Australia.</field><field name="creator">Twomey, Luke J.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the phytoplankton ecology of Wilson Inlet, Western Australia with relation to the changing physical, chemical and biological environment.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Western Australia, Wilson Inlet, ecology, phytoplankton.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=9801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender and test item-response formats.</field><field name="creator">Krueger, Barry</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to develop a better understanding of the patterns of science achievement for 154 ninth-grade girls and boys on multiple-choice and short-answer constructed-response items. The study was guided by a model, developed from an extensive review of the literature, incorporating the dimensions of generalised self-efficacy, item- specific self-efficacy and worry. These variables were operationalised through selected or specifically developed quantitative and/or qualitative research methods, and a series of equivalent multiple-choice and short-answer constructed-response achievement items was constructed for two different unit tests. The participants in the study rated their item-specific self-efficacies on 5-point Likert-type scales immediately before answering each of the achievement items, and they completed a series of worry items from Spielberger's Test Anxiety Inventory halfway through each test. Qualitative data were collected by surveying all the students and by interviewing selected students. The quasi-experimental analyses revealed the absence of any practically important gender-related differences in achievement for the multiple-choice and the constructed-response achievement items. However, the boys reported more item-specific self-efficacy and less worry than the girls for each of these item-response formats, and each of these gender-related differences was judged to be practically significant. The qualitative data provided additional evidence that the girls' self-perceptions of their efficacy for answering multiple-choice and short-answer constructed-response items was lower than that of the boys.

This study focuses on the Islamic culture of the Arab world and its influences on the architecture of the region, giving an overview of contemporary architecture in the Arab world, its situation, cultural crisis and hope for the future.This research aims to identify the principal characteristics of Islamic architecture, which embody the needs and demands of Muslims according to their Islamic teachings. Muslims form one of the biggest communities in the world, which is suggested to be more than one fifth of the world's population, about one and half billion.This community has special architectural needs related to their religious teachings, traditions and culture, because Islam is not only a religion, it is a complete way of life, which covers all social, political, economic, educational, cultural, hygienic, and behavioural aspects.For a great number of people, the concept of Islamic architecture denotes tangible characteristics of some architectural features like Mashrabiah, arch, dome, or any other architectural pattern that distinguishes this typical style of architecture. But, Islamic architecture is more than just a spectacle of domes and minarets; it is a deep expression of a rich culture that has unified countries across the globe.In the last fifty years, contemporary architecture of the Muslim world in general, and the Arab world in particular, has been exposed to several outside influences that have eventually caused it to be alienated from its particular sense of identity and, thus, to lose its character. It is believed that such matter requires immediate attention towards attempting a "revival process" by uncovering the bases and principles of Islamic architecture, as manifested throughout Islamic history. ++</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Islamic culture,  Egypt,  Arabian architecture,  Islam, contemporary architecture.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=10038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation and implementation of nonlinear control systems for mineral processes.</field><field name="creator">Kam, Kiew M.</field><field name="description">Differential geometric nonlinear control of a multiple stage evaporator system of the liquor burning facility associated with the Bayer process for alumina production at Alcoa Wagerup alumina refinery, Western Australia was investigated.Mathematical models for differential geometric analysis and nonlinear controller synthesis for the evaporator system were developed. Two models, that were structurally different from each other, were used in the thesis for simulation studies. Geometric nonlinear control structure, consisting of nonlinear state feedback control laws and multi-loop single-input single-output proportional-integral controllers, were designed for the industrial evaporator system. The superiority of the geometric nonlinear control structure for regulatory control of the evaporator system was successfully demonstrated through computer simulations and real-time simulator implementation. The implementation trial has verified the practicality and feasibility of these type of controllers. It also re-solved some practical issues of the geometric nonlinear control structure for industrial control applications. In addition, the implementation trial also established a closer link between the academic nonlinear control theory and the industrial control practices.Geometric nonlinear output feedback controller, consisting of the geometric nonlinear control structure and reduce-order observer was proposed for actual plant implementation on the evaporator system on-site. Its superior performance was verified through computer simulations, but its feasibility on the evaporator system on-site has yet to be investigated either through simulator implementation or actual plant implementation. This investigation was not performed due to the time constraint on the preparation of this thesis and the inavailability of the plant personnel required for this implementation.Robust ++</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alumina production,  mineral processing,  control performance enhancement,   multiple stage evaporator, geometric nonlinear control.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=10063</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of sodium fluoroacetate (1080) in baits and its biodegradation by microorganisms.</field><field name="creator">Kirkpatrick, Winifred E.</field><field name="description">In Western Australia dried meat baits containing 1080 are used extensively by agricultural and conservation organisations to control foxes and dingoes for the protection of agricultural production and native fauna. Field trials were conducted to assess 1080 loss from dried meat baits and this required the analysis of over five hundred baits. Because of this large number of baits it was essential to have a simple and efficient 1080 extraction procedure and method of 1080 analysis. In this study three methods of 1080 extraction and the new bioassay method for 1080 analysis were investigated. A simple and cost-effective 1080 extraction method using water with a 98% 1080 recovery rate was developed and modifications to the bioassay method were made.Factory-produced 1080 dried meat baits were laid in the field during different seasons at four locations in Western Australia, samples were collected over time and analysed for 1080 content using the bioassay. Rainfall was recorded and temperature data was collected for each site. Baits were exposed to the elements but were placed in mesh or wire cages to restrict invertebrate attack and prevent removal by vertebrates. Some baits were placed on the surface and others were buried. Initially 1080 loss from baits from all 4 sites was minimal, ranging from 0 - 21% at day 7 - 9. Further loss was gradual even when rainfall was recorded. Generally baits had to be exposed to at least 50 mm of rain before 1080 loss increased to 50%. At some sites baits continued to remain toxic to foxes even after long exposure. The mean 1080 content of baits from the Carnarvon site at day 226 was 2.0 mg (55% of the mean 1080 content of baits at day zero) with 137 mm of rainfall recorded for that period.

Processors are now both powerful and cheap, so that systems incorporating tens, hundreds or even thousands of powerful processors need not be prohibitively expensive. The weak link in exploiting parallelism is the means of communication between the processors. Shared memory systems are fundamentally limited in the number of processors they can utilise. To achieve high levels of parallelism it is still necessary to use distributed memory and some form of interconnection network. But interconnection networks can be costly, slow, difficult to build and expand, vulnerable to faults and limited in the range of problems they can be used to solve effectively. As a result there has been extensive research into developing interconnection networks which overcome some or all of these difficulties. In this thesis it is argued that a new interconnection network, Hierarchical Cliques (HiC), and a derivative, FatHiC, possesses many desirable properties and are worthy of consideration for use in building parallel computers. A fundamental element of an interconnection network is its topology. After defining the topology of HiC, expressions are derived for the various parameters which define its underlying limits of performance and fault tolerance. A second element of an interconnection network is an addressing and routing scheme. The addressing scheme and routing algorithms of HiC are described. The flexibility of HiC is demonstrated by developing embeddings of popular, regular interconnection networks. Some embeddings into HiC suffer from high congestion, however the FatHiC network is shown to have low congestion for those embeddings.

The analytical work involved developing a theory based on the truss analogy, capable of predicting the response and shear strength of such beams subjected to combined bending moment and shear force.The experimental work comprised forty-eight beam specimens in eight series of tests. Most of the beams were 250 mm wide, 350 mm deep and had a clear span of approximately 2 metres. The largest beam was 250 mm wide, 600 mm deep and had a clear span of 3.1 metres. Test parameters included the concrete cover to the shear reinforcement cage, shear reinforcement ratio, longitudinal tensile steel ratio, overall beam depth, shear span-to-depth ratio and concrete compressive strength. The loading configurations included using one, two or four symmetrically placed concentrated loads on simply supported spans.The theory predicted the shear strength of the beams in the present study well. When beams from previous investigations were included, the theory also gave good prediction of the shear strength. Apart from this, comparisons of shear strength were also made with the predictions by the shear design provisions contained in the Australian Standard AS 3600 (1994), American Concrete Institute Building Code ACI 318-95, Eurocode EC2 Part 1 and Canadian Standard CSA A23.3-94.

One facet of such flexibility is Open Learning. Currently there is little research on Open Learning within the training sector on which planning decisions can be based.A model of educational productivity (Walberg,1981) has been proposed in the research literature to investigate relationships between key factors such a student antecedents, learning environments and learning outcomes. The Walberg model has been employed in this current study to explore how these factors may be studied in an Open Learning environment and a more Traditional Learning environment within the vocational education and training sector. The research design is a comparative description, utilising techniques from both quantitative and qualitative paradigms.A major aspect of this current study has been to investigate the constructs proposed by Walberg's Productivity Model and source appropriate instruments to measure these constructs. Where the appropriate instruments were not available, a process of instrument development and validation was conducted.The research has identified Walberg's model as being a valid frame of reference within the Vocational Education and Training sector. As expected, significant differences between the Open Learning environment and the Traditional Learning environment were apparent for the measures of Classroom Environment. Of interest, however, was that the productivity factor of Quantity, for students studying in both learning environments, was shown to have a negative relationship with achievement.

The focus and type of data collected, during such assessment is central to the effectiveness of the diagnostic process and subsequent planned nursing interventions. Whilst there is a multiplicity of factors that impact upon the diagnostic process, eminent nurse theorists espouse a relationship between assessment formats and diagnostic accuracy. This study evaluates the effectiveness of two types of assessment formats by addressing the following questions. When student and registered nurses use a Gordons Functional Health Pattern (GFHP) assessment format compared to using a Review of Biological Systems (ROBS) assessment format is there a difference in: (1) the number and type of diagnoses identified? and (2) the number of criteria achieved within the Standards for Nursing Care (ANF, 1989)?A developed case study with verified diagnoses was used. Professional actors played the part of the client and followed a standard script. Volunteer student and registered nurses (N=100) were randomly assigned to the two types of assessment formats. They were required to conduct an assessment of the client and state the nursing diagnoses. Data were analysed using Multivariate Analysis of Variance.Results indicated that when both groups of nurses used the GFHP format they stated significantly more correct and more diverse categories of diagnoses and significantly fewer diagnoses which were classified as being incorrect and medical, than when they used the ROBS format. In addition, when student and registered nurses used the GFHP format, they elicited significantly more information that complied with the criteria outlined within the Standards for Nursing Care (ANF, 1989), than when they used the ROBS format.The findings of this study indicate that both student and registered nurses are guided by the cues on the assessment ++</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">evaluation, nursing assessment formats.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=11083</field></doc><doc><field name="title">For the term of its national life : the Australian (imagi)nation.</field><field name="creator">Holliday, Brian</field><field name="description">This thesis is divided into two sections; a theoretical section which looks at the analytic construction of collective identities, and a section which applies the theory to two Australian novels.

Its primary objective is to learn from the experiences of three regulated government utilities and one small private distributor that are involved in the three sectors of electricity business in power generation, transmission and distribution. How these firms survived their decline problems, and managed and sustained their turnaround efforts is the focus of this study. The results indicate the importance of change management, leadership, cost reduction and financial control in reversing the decline of these firms. Also underscored are the crucial role of efficiency improvement and achievement of profit together with winning employee commitment and broad stakeholder support in sustaining the recovery effort.These comparative case studies were undertaken at a time when crises and turbulence affected the management and organisation of electricity businesses in the Asia/Pacific region, particularly New Zealand and the Philippines. Electric utilities in both countries are regulated and less vertically integrated than anywhere else in the region. Significant changes to the ownership and control of these firms and their competitive relationships over the past decade have complicated the way strategic problems and issues have to be resolved. In the meantime, threats and pressures from all stakeholders have made the management and operations of these utilities difficult.Thus, a critical review of their specific circumstances and predicaments is in order for similarly affected enterprises to avoid past errors and to replicate only the strategies that may suit them.

Various mathematical forms have been proposed for the application of preferred orientation corrections. The most promising of these appears to be the single-parameter March (1932) model proposed by Dollase (1986).Li and O'Connor (1989) applied the March model to determine the level of preferred orientation in various gibbsites using two procedures. The first involved the Rietveld (1969) least squares pattern-fitting method. Each pattern was Rietveld-analysed in two ways, initially assuming random orientation of the crystallites and subsequently with the March model. The second procedure for preferred orientation analysis, described here as the line ratio method, determines preferred orientation factors according to the intensity ratios of carefully selected line pairs.In the thesis the procedures proposed by Li and O'Connor for texture analysis have been evaluated with XRPD data sets for molybdite, calcite and kaolinite. The results indicate that while the March formula improves agreement between the' calculated and measured patterns in Rietveld analysis, other forms of systematic error in the intensity data appear to limit the effectiveness of the March formula in general. It has been found also that the line ratio method improves agreement between the data sets, but less effectively than the Rietveld method.

The main aim of the study was to investigate ways of assisting students to be effective learners. The particular role that affect played in learning and the relationship between learning behaviour and learning outcomes, was explored. A Conceptual Model of student learning incorporating student cognition, metacognition, motivation, affect and academic performance in a specific social and cultural context, underpinned the study. The study documented the design, implementation and evaluation - from both the students' and teacher's perspectives - of an in-context learning support program for first year students, using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies.The program was based on a theoretical framework which integrated cognitive, behavioural and social learning perspectives and focussed on increasing students' repertoire of learning strategies, promoting their higher level thinking and understanding, developing their metacognitive skills and managing their affect. It included an emphasis on student goal setting and time management, reading and writing strategies, learning for tests and exams, self-management, reflecting on and evaluating learning, and dealing with test anxiety.The main findings of the study were that providing in-context learning support was associated with positive changes in students' learning strategy use, motivational orientations, and affective reactions.

Tenant company staff members in five Australian Technology Parks were surveyed about their information needs, information use, and information seeking behaviour as well as their attitudes towards university libraries which offered services to them. Three of the five Australian Technology Parks had formal relationships with universities and their libraries. The librarians of these universities were interviewed on their attitudes towards the provision of information services to the technology park community, as well as the information services they offered to this group of clients.The research results indicated that most of the respondents who were engaged in R&amp;D areas accessed university libraries' collections for technical information and valued their services and the professional help of the librarians, whereas those in other areas, particularly marketing and sales, did not place as high a value on these services. One striking finding from the research was that the respondents in the latter group use the Internet as their preferred first source of information, not informal personal contact as been expected and indicated in previous studies. A contributing factor to low use of the university libraries was poor promotion of library services.A major objective of the research was to obtain information on the relevance of the Australian data to developing and offering services to tenants in a new technology park in Thailand. Results drawn from the Australian data was used to form a model for the interaction between university libraries and tenant company staff in Thai technology parks.

This service is comprised of two major components - Newsbase and Special Databases, which provide archival Malaysian information. NSTP Online is the trade name of the online database available commercially and internally to the organisation.Quality issues are acknowledged by database producers but are often overlooked due to resource, technology and human constraints. The key quality issues include contents, data quality, customer support and database structure. The objective of investigating these issues from the users' perspective is because it is the major issue from the business point of view. The few database quality studies documented in the literature are limited to methodological development.Quality issues from the users' perspective are difficult to measure due to the intangible nature of information, the researcher's dependence on the subjective opinions of the users and the variables associated with experience and costs. The aim of the study is to investigate the problems affecting the use of information and identify areas requiring further examination by the database producer.The results of this investigation draw upon the writer's experience with NSTP Online and the feedback obtained from the questionnaire and interviews conducted in Malaysia. This paper examines the differences in usage, training, support and data retrieval among the external and internal users. Despite the fact that NSTP Online needs to be improved in terms of contents, currency, technology and telecommunication, the service is still regarded as an useful information tool by the users.The paper highlights the many problems that require further planning and improvement for internal and external users.

The experimental tests featured 56 small scale prestressed concrete beams.Some of the factors influencing prestress transfer which were considered in the current tests are as follows:(a) type of release - gradual, sudden or shock(b) surface condition of the wire - plain or indented(c) size of the wire(d) concrete compressive strength at the time of transfer(e) time dependent effectsMost of the tests involved gradual release of steel tendons with the prestressing force transferred in approximately ten equal increments. Sudden release in a single step was achieved by allowing the supporting abutments to retract rapidly. Shock release was implemented in some beams by angle grinding the wires. The type of release which gave the best quality of prestress transfer was gradual release. This was followed by sudden and shock releases respectively.There were four types of wires used in the laboratory tests: namely the 5 mm dia. Plain, 5 mm dia. Chevron indented, 7 mm dia. Plain and 7 mm dia. Belgian indented wires. Transmission lengths were determined from strain distributions for these wires. Pull-ins of the wire tendons at the ends of the beams were also measured.There was significant scatter in the experimental data. Different ranges of transmission lengths and pull-ins were obtained for the various types of wires used.Three equations were derived for the 5 mm dia. Plain, 5 mm dia. Chevron and 7 mm dia.

New approaches to the design and control of autonomous robots have shown the value of drawing inspiration from the natural world. Animals navigate, perceive and interact with various uncontrolled environments with seemingly little effort. Flying insects, in particular, are quite adept at manoeuvring in complex, unpredictable and possibly hostile environments.Inspired by the miniature machine view of insects, this thesis contributes to the autonomous control of mobile robots through the application of insect-based visual cues and behaviours. The parsimonious, yet robust, solutions offered by insects are directly applicable to the computationally restrictive world of autonomous mobile robots. To this end, two main navigational domains are focussed on: corridor guidance and visual homing.Within a corridor environment, safe navigation is achieved through the application of simple and intuitive behaviours observed in insect, visual navigation. By observing and responding to observed apparent motions in a reactive, yet intelligent way, the robot is able to exhibit useful corridor guidance behaviours at modest expense. Through a combination of both simulation and real-world robot experiments, the feasibility of equipping a mobile robot with the ability to safely navigate in various environments, is demonstrated.It is further shown that the reactive nature of the robot can be augmented to incorporate a map building method that allows previously encountered corridors to be recognised, through the observation of landmarks en route. This allows for a more globally-directed navigational goal.Many animals, including insects such as bees and ants, successfully engage in visual homing.

The study comprises three parts. Firstly, it validates the new classroom environment measuring instrument, the Cultural Learning Environment Questionnaire (CLEQ). This instrument is used for the first time to assess the cultural factors that students bring to their classrooms. Secondly, as well as providing validation data for the use of the Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction (QTI), it investigates associations between students' cultural background and their perceptions of student-teacher interactions. The third part of the study looks at whether the students' cultural background affects their attitudes and achievement. This study is significant because teachers in multicultural classrooms need to be informed about how cultural factors interact with student perceptions of their preferred student-teacher interpersonal behaviours.

The evaluation of recreation and leisure services has been focused on performance indicators associated with specific programmes and facilities. At a macro level, evaluation from the broader perspectives of organisational effectiveness and leisure theory is a neglected area of research. This study examines a model of organisational effectiveness criteria as a way of exploring the "leisure management paradox" in local government recreation services. The focus of the research was local government recreation services in Western Australia.This study had two major purposes. The first purpose was to identify a range of criteria that are appropriate for evaluating organisational effectiveness in local government recreation services. Secondly, the study investigated the perceptions of these criteria held by recreation staff in different local government recreation services in Western Australia.The specific research objectives focused on the issues of effectiveness in local government recreation services, namely:1. To identify criteria for organisational effectiveness relevant to local government recreation services in Westem Australia.2. To develop a conceptual model of organisational effectiveness criteria.3. To test the developed model to confirm the appropriateness of the selected criteria for assessing local government recreation services.4. To determine if there are differences in the perceptions of organisational effectiveness held by different groups of recreation workers in different types of local government settings.The findings revealed that perceptions of the importance of organisational effectiveness criteria held by recreation workers in local government in Western Australia are relatively homogeneous. ++</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">local government, effectiveness criteria, leisure, recreation.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15473</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimum design of open pit mines</field><field name="creator">Giannini, Luciano Mario</field><field name="description">A fundamental problem in open pit mine planning is that of determining the optimum ultimate pit limits of the mine. These limits are that pit contour which is the result of extracting a volume of material which maximizes the difference between the value of extracted ore and the total extraction cost of ore and waste whilst satisfying certain practical operational requirements, such as. safe wall slopes. The determination of the optimum pit contour provides information which is essential in the evaluation of the economic potential of the mineral deposit.A number of optimization techniques have been proposed for determining the optimum pit contour. Of these techniques, those based on graph theory, linear programming and dynamic programming are mathematically rigorous, but only those based on graph theory are more suited to solving the three-dimensional problem. Unfortunately, direct application of these techniques to large ore- bodies may cause considerable difficulties because of the exceptionally high demand on computer storage and time requirements. Indeed, 25 years of research effort has not satisfactorily resolved these computational problems.A major contribution of the work presented in this thesis is the successful implementation of a system of techniques to solve the graph theoretic model, particularly when applied to large ore- bodies. A measure of this success is the fact that pits, as much as seven times larger may be designed with a given amount of computer storage, at a fraction of the time required by current software packages. The solution strategy presented involves the application of a modified Dinics Maximum Flow algorithm, together with an efficient data reducing technique. Computational results of these techniques applied on data from gold producing mines in Western Australia are used to demonstrate the success of this strategy.The relationships ++</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pit design techniques, open pit mine planning.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15490</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of the Business Rules Diagram</field><field name="creator">McDermid, Donald</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns the development of a diagramming technique which assists in the specification of information systems requirements.

The present research contributes to the growing literature on trust by developing measures and models of how employees trust senior management. Drawing from the literature and the results of pilot studies, a six dimensional model of trust in senior management - consisting of dispositional, cognitive, affective, social and behavioural intent dimensions - was tested using confirmatory factor analysis (n = 416). The results clearly supported the convergent and discriminant validity of the measurement model. For example, all model fit indices were above minimum recommended values and all items loaded at significant levels on their specified factor.The measures were successfully cross- validated in a sample from a different organization (n = 249). Next, models portraying alternative structural relations between the dimensions were examined, before deriving a model which successfully summarized the data in a theoretically plausible way. The model showed trust in senior management, defined in terms of behavioural intentions, to be directly influenced by affective reactions and perceived social norms. Cognitive assessments about the overall effectiveness of senior management were shown to have an indirect influence on trust. This structural model was successfully cross- validated on an independent sample. The attitudinal dimensions of the model were shown to hold, longitudinally, over a twelve month period (n = 257).In contrast to previous cross-sectional research, disposition did not influence trust in senior management over time.

These assessments utilised the differences between the two forms of the enzyme in affinity for testosterone and sensitivity to the competitive inhibitor Finasteride.Although first described in the 1950s, the enzyme has never been isolated and biochemical studies generated conflicting data. In some reports the enzyme was said to operate at a pH of 5.5 whereas others considered the pH optimum was more alkaline than this. Similarly, the affinity for testosterone was reported as being around 3muM and around 0.5muM and different sensitivities to the competitive inhibitor Finasteride also were reported. These differences were resolved in the period 1989 1991 by isolation of cDNAs coding for two forms of 5AR. These were termed 5AR1 and 5AR2. It is now known that 5AR1 operates at the more alkaline pH, has the lower affinity for testosterone and is the more resistant to Finasteride. 5AR1 is present to a greater extent in the periphery with 5AR2 predominating in the prostate.Isolation of the cDNAs coding for 5AR1 and 5AR2 and the differing characteristics of the two enzymes, have provided the means to investigate structure-function relationships using site-directed mutagenesis. This approach enables identification of residues important for the binding of substrate and inhibitor by the two forms of human 5AR.At the commencement of these studies the residues -AVFA- had been identified as comprising part of the substrate/inhibitor binding site of human 5AR1. As the analogous residues, -VSIV- of rat 5AR1 also had been shown to contribute to this binding, it had been suggested that the analogous residues -GALA- in human 5AR2 may form its substrate/inhibitor binding domain.

While it is widely believed that multiple analogical models encourage students to construct appropriate mental models of chemical phenomena, uncritical use of multiple analogical models may actually be responsible for a number of alternative conceptions in chemistry. Students hear and read about electron clouds and shells, atoms that are like miniature solar systems and balls, and molecules that are simultaneously represented by balls-and-sticks, joined spheres, electron-dot and structural diagrams. A strong case has been made that students try to integrate these diverse analogical models resulting in the generation of unscientific synthetic models. Conceptual change research programs also propose that carefully designed teaching and learning activities can stimulate students to exchange their intuitive and synthetic conceptions for more scientific conceptions.This thesis investigates the occurrence of students' intuitive and synthetic mental models of atoms and molecules at both a general and specific level. The investigations consisted in the first phase of semi-structured interviews with 48 Year 8-10 science students. While the data were predominantly qualitative the interviews also generated simple quantitative data. The second phase was wholly qualitative and involved the researcher as teacher' in the Year 11 class. Portfolios were compiled for each student in the class and six portfolios were interpreted to produce a set of case studies describing the students' learning about atoms, molecules and bonds.

An interpretive research methodology was employed to generate tales about each student, in order to provide rich descriptions of the participation of these students in Science classes and in non-Science classes.A major theme was the complementarity of epistemological referents for scientific literacy. Objectivism, personal constructivism and social constructivism were identified as major referents for scientific literacy, and therefore as underpinning factors for the diversity of definitions of scientific literacy. Some authors have called for these referents to complement one another. In this study, I used the conceptual tool of metaphor to facilitate the holding together, in dialectical tension, of these often competing ideas.No a-priori notion of scientific literacy was adopted for the research, but an emergent theoretical framework for scientific literacy evolved. This metaphorical framework was shown to be a viable way of organising a diversity of literature-based definitions of scientific literacy. It was subsequently utilised to interpret the tales about the four students, and helped reveal significant themes.Foremost amongst the emerging research themes was equity of access into scientific literacy. Ten major assertions from the research provide different considerations of the ways that students access, or are denied access to, scientific literacy.

Midwives from the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia comprised the target population. These midwives were considered to be representative of the general midwifery population practising in the diverse settings of Australia.A triangulation of methods (Denzin, 1970) was used for data collection. This included observational field work, a questionnaire survey of a randomly selected sample of registered midwives (n=1754), and in-depth interviews (n=75), using a grounded theory approach (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Strauss and Corbin, 1990).The questionnaire, in-depth interviews and observational field work addressed the practice of midwives:1. as documented in policies and procedures in practice settings.2. as defined by the Australian College of Midwives Incorporated in Standards for the Practice of Midwifery (1989), based on the International Confederation of Midwives' Definition of a Midwife (World Health Organisation, 1976).Data obtained through the survey questionnaire were analysed using descriptive analysis (Wilson, 1985) to portray a summarization of the entire data set. A thematic content analysis was used for the open-ended questions of the survey (Burnard, 1991). In an attempt to discover the 'how and why' questions associated with the study's survey findings, the constant comparative method of analysis of data from in-depth interviews was deemed appropriate (Glaser, 1978; Field and Morse, 1985; Chenitz and Swanson, 1986).

The coal measures subcrop in a half- graben bounded by the Lesueur-Peron Fault in the west, and the Warradarge Fault in the east. The coal occurs within the shallow sequence of the Cattamarra Member which is also described as the Cattamarra Coal Measures of the Cockleshell Gully Formation.Six sub-seams of seam G, namely G1 to G6, from the six drill cores, were examined for petrological and geochemical investigation. The coal predominantly comprises of banded, dull banded, and dull lithotypes, with minor bright banded, bright and fusainous types. Based on maceral analyses, the dominant maceral groups are vitrinite and inertinite, whilst the exinite and mineral matter are in minor contents. The vitrinite content has a range between 47.2 % to 73.0 %, and it is composed mainly of telocollinite and desmocollinite. The inertinite is dominated by semifusinite, fusinite, and inertodetrinite, and it has a range from 10.4 % to 24.8 %. The exinite group varies between 7.2 % to 20.8 % in content, and it is represented by sporinite, cutinite, alginite and resinite.

Bilateral upper extremity isokinetic and grip strength, pain, and active range of motion were compared in 52 men with paraplegia (mean age 44 years: mean duration of spinal cord injury (SCI) 17 years) and 52 age and activity-level matched able-bodied men. The impact of upper limb pain on activities of daily living (ADL) performance was examined in the paraplegic sample. Strength was not significantly different between the two samples except for bilateral shoulder flexion (able-bodied stronger) and bilateral elbow extension (paraplegia stronger). Strength changed similarly with age in the two groups. The effect of duration of SCI on strength, excluding age, was significant for grip strength only. Duration of paraplegia and activity-level were better predictors of strength than age in 9 of 14 muscle groups, whereas in the able-bodied, age was the best strength predictor. Limited bilateral shoulder internal rotation and non-dominant external rotation were associated with paraplegia. Upper limb pain in the past week was associated with paraplegia (shoulder p&lt;.001; elbow p&lt;.00l; wrist/hand p&lt;.00l). Reported pain prevalences for the paraplegic sample were: shoulder 39%, elbow 31%, wrist/hand 40%. The paraplegic subjects' pain intensity ratings revealed them to be experiencing mild to moderate levels of upper limb pain. Shoulder pain was associated with duration of injury, exclusive of age (p&lt;.05).

The instrument was designed to identify alternative conceptions held in relation to concepts that underpin the objectives listed in each of the four content strands of the New Zealand Science Curriculum. The stem questions of the first tier were designed around the curriculum objectives for Levels 4, 5 and 6. Distracters for the second tier were developed from alternative conceptions identified from surveys, teacher predictions and telephone interviews. A 52 item instrument was built into a Microsoft Word format with drop down menu functionality, and then transferred into an on-line format on a web site. The instrument link was sent by email to a student sample in the age range of Year 9 to 11. The student responses were analysed by answer selection and alternative conceptions were identified and classified. The instrument proved to be an economical rapid response tool for identification of student alternative conceptions to inform the design and development of student science learning programmes. The instrument and the component two-tier items have the potential to be used as part of an item bank for formative assessment tests to enhance student learning in science. The on-line functionality of the instrument has the potential to provide the 21st century learner with formative self assessment opportunities to enhance personalized self-directed learning programmes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">on-line two-tier diagnostic instrument, alternative scientific conceptions, conceptual level functioning, students, New Zealand science curriculum, curriculum objectives</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=21529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural determinants of the adoption of forward contracts by Western Australian wool producers</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Elizabeth Louise</field><field name="description">Australian wool traders and researchers have little knowledge of the incomplete adoption of the price risk management strategies that are available to stabilise wool producers&#8217; incomes. Auction is by far the most popular method of selling wool in Australia with an adoption rate of about 85%. However this system exposes users (wool producers and buyers alike) to highly volatile prices and non-specific knowledge of supply and demand. Furthermore, it places differentiated wool types in the same commodity market as mass produced, homogeneous wool types. In order to address these issues, a mixed-method research design was used to develop and test a behavioural model of wool producers&#8217; intentions to adopt the use of forward contracts; a selling method alternative to auction. In the simplest terms, a forward contract is a binding agreement between a buyer and a seller that stipulates price, quality, quantity and delivery date of a product. The behavioural model developed for this research was based on the Theory of Reasoned Action, Theory of Planned Behaviour and Diffusion of Innovations as well as some farm-level constructs that were raised in focus groups with Western Australian wool producers. The focus groups were pivotal in adding a unique, farm-level decision-making dimension to the behavioural model by the inclusion of various factors external and internal to the farm business. Based on the behavioural model, 28 hypotheses were developed and tested. Data was collected via a telephone survey of 305 Western Australian wool producers and analysis was conducted using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) approach to Structural Equation Modelling (SEM).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wool traders and researchers, Australia, wool producers' incomes, selling methods, differentiated wool types, behavioural model, auction</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=21531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical and research developments in the treatment of paediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder</field><field name="creator">Watson, Hunna J</field><field name="description">It is of crucial importance to identify and disseminate effective treatments for paediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is time-consuming and distressing, and can substantially disable functioning at school, at home, and with peers (Piacentini, 2003). Children who do not receive treatment are at risk of psychological difficulties in adulthood, including continued OCD, clinical anxiety and depression, personality disorders, and social maladjustment (Wewetzer et al., 2001). Two-thirds of adult cases of OCD develop in childhood, and adults with OCD have lower employment, poorer academic achievement, and lower marital rates compared to non-OCD adults (Hollander et al., 1996; Koran, 2000; Lensi et al., 1996; Steketee, 1993). The distressing nature of OCD in childhood, accompanying psychosocial impairment and risk of future psychopathology, underscore the need to identify effective treatments. The primary aim of this thesis was to expand knowledge of evidence-based treatments for paediatric OCD. A mixed-methodology approach was employed to examine key issues in this area. The first study used meta-analytic methodology to determine the evidence supporting available treatments for paediatric OCD. An extensive literature search revealed over 100 published reports of treatments, encompassing a broad array of theoretical approaches and treatment strategies. Examples of treatments used for paediatric OCD included psychodynamic therapy, pharmacotherapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), hypnosis, family therapy, immunotherapy, and homeopathy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), effective treatments, psychological difficulties, randomised controlled treatment trials (RCTs), paediatric OCD</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=115091</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategy transformation and change : changing paradigms in Australian Catholic health and aged care</field><field name="creator">Ryan, John Joseph</field><field name="description">When I was younger I always conceived of a room where all these (strategic) concepts were worked out for the whole, company. Later I didn't find any such room .... The strategy (of the company) may not even exist in the mind of one man. I certainly don't know where it is written down. It is simply transmitted in the series of decisions made (Quinn 1978: 7). How do organisations in the Australian Catholic Health and Aged Care sector transform shared strategic thinking into formulated strategy? This research has investigated strategy formation, which can be defined as the process whereby the insights and thoughts of the key players in Catholic health and aged care are converted into formulated strategies. Specifically, the research analysed a major strategic amalgamation of the health and aged care operations of the Catholic Church in Australia, identified as Integration 2000. The concept of social constructs of meaning for the key actors is the fundamental perspective of this research. This required a constructivist ontology. The epistemology is interpretivist, and set out to provide a description of perceptions of the key actors as they engage in the formation of strategy. Defenders of interpretivism argued that the human sciences aim to understand human action (Schwandt, 2000:191). A qualitative methodology has been used to provide a plausible interpretation of the conversion process commonly referred to as strategy formation.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genSWOT analysis,      strategy formation,      Catholic health,      planning models,     PATOP, governance models.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of internal and external responses on human rights practices in China: the Chinese government and the spiral model</field><field name="creator">Fleay, Caroline</field><field name="description">This thesis assesses the usefulness of the five phase spiral model as an explanation of the changes in the Chinese government's human rights practices from the time of the "antirightist" campaign in 1957-58 to the end of 2003. Thomas Risse, Stephen Ropp and Kathryn Sikkink's spiral model focuses on the constitutive relationship between a target state and international human rights norms by exploring the influence of a transnational network promoting these norms on the human rights practices of the target state. The thesis concludes that the spiral model has provided a valid explanation for many of the changes in the Chinese government's human rights practices, and its responses to its internal and external critics, from 1957 to 2003. Many of the responses of the transnational human rights network and the Chinese government by the end of this period indicate that the latter had progressed to phase three of the model. Some aspects of the Chinese government's practices and relationships with its more powerful state critics can be better explained by the alternative explanations examined here, neorealism and modernisation theories. However, constructivist approaches, and in particular the spiral model, are more effective in explaining the developing pattern of communication about the validity of human rights norms. This thesis also concludes that the spiral model only conceptualises part of the constitutive relationship between the target state and international human rights norms - the influence of these norms on the identities, interests and behaviours of a target state.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human rights in China, international human rights, five phase spiral model.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecological study of plant species at Sandford Rocks Nature Reserve (SRNR)</field><field name="creator">Gaol, Mangadas Lumban</field><field name="description">The ecology of plant species at Sandford Rocks Nature Reserve (SRNR) was studied. The study site is an important nature reserve that contains relatively undisturbed natural vegetation. It has a mosaic of exposed granite rocks, scrublands and woodlands. The study involved: a description of the structure and composition of the vegetation; the population characteristics of selected Acacia species; aspects of reproduction in Acacia; germination and seedling characteristics of some Acacia and grass species that dominate the reserve; the effect of seed size on germination and seedling characteristics; and, the relationship of seed size to seed coat thickness in selected Acacia species. Five different areas were studied using the point centered quarter method to sample the woody perennial species. Thirteen Acacia species were examined for reproduction characteristics; and in 2 selected Acacia species, the effects of phyllode and/or inflorescence removal on reproduction was investigated. Germination tests were conducted to identify germination characteristics in 8 Acacia and 7 grass species dominant at SRNR. The possible effects of variation in seed size on germination; seedling characteristics; and, seed coat thickness were investigated in Acacia fauntleroyi and Acacia prainii. A total of 85 species from 20 families of woody perennials were collated. All areas were dominated by the Myrtaceae, Mimosaceae and Proteaceae families. There was considerable variability in the structure and composition of vegetation. Most species were present in particular sites and the composition of communities appears to be related to the heterogeneity of the habitat within the reserve. In areas of shallow or rocky soil, vegetation types present include Allocasuarina huegeliana woodland, Grevillea paradoxa low scrubland and Acacia neurophylla medium shrubland.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">seed coat thickness, Acacia species, Acacia reproduction, woody perennials.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Occupational injury, disease and stress in the veterinary profession</field><field name="creator">Fairnie, Helen Margaret</field><field name="description">Scant attention has been given to occupational health hazards of Australian veterinarians. This study aimed to identify the major risk factors for occupational injury and disease, emotional health and suicide rates of veterinarians. Qualitative in-depth interviews with 45 veterinarians were carried out which revealed that a significant proportion of veterinarians were both injured, stressed and had incurred zoonotic diseases. Data linkage of the names of registered veterinarians in Western Australia with four Health Department of Western Australia databases was undertaken to provide supportive statistics on the conditions identified as being important in the interviews. The results of this latter analysis were inconclusive. Therefore a self-administered questionnaire was developed, which collected quantitative data on injuries, disease, stress and risk factors from 419 veterinarians. Since the in-depth interviews had identified stress and suicide ideation as being very significant for many of those interviewed, the Kessler 10+ scale for measuring psychological distress was included in the self-administered questionnaire. The data linkage was unable to provide accurate data about numbers of deaths of veterinarians and the records of coroners in Victoria and Western Australia which provided data on 89 veterinarians, were analysed to determine suicide rates. Despite the interviews providing considerable information about rates and risk factors for injuries, disease and stress, no statistical analyses were undertaken because they provided insufficient data for quantitative analyses.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psychological distress in veterinarians, zoonotic diseases in veterinarians,   emotional health suicide rates  veterinarians, occupational health Australian veterinarians.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17084</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breastfeeding among working mothers in Nairobi</field><field name="creator">Lakati, Alice S.</field><field name="description">Breastfeeding is the best food source for the nutritional and health needs of young children. However when a mother returns to work, breastfeeding may be discontinued prematurely. The purpose of this study was to study infant feeding practices used by working mothers in Nairobi. Mothers attending clinics at two hospitals, one a private hospital serving higher socioeconomic groups and the other a public hospital represented the low socioeconomic groups, were interviewed. A structured interview was held with 444 mothers (200 from the low socioeconomic group and 244 from the high socioeconomic group) between January 5th and February 11th 2000. All mothers with infants aged 16-48 weeks who were willing to participate were interviewed. The prevalence of breastfeeding at the time of the study was found to be 94.1%. The low socioeconomic group exhibited a higher prevalence of breastfeeding (99%) with a 10% difference between the low and high socioeconomic groups. The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding was 13.3% at three months. Early introduction of other feeding methods was high, with 46.4% of the mothers introducing other feeding methods before one month. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine factors that were associated with exclusive breastfeeding using two separate models for exclusive breastfeeding at one month and two months. The mode of work (fixed working hours as opposed to shift work) was associated with exclusive breastfeeding for at least month (OR=0.45) and two months (OR=0.39).

The presence of lactose in whey constitutes a significant pollution problem for dairy factories. At the same time, there is an increasing market for high quality crystalline lactose. The main problem of lactose crystallisation, compared to sucrose, which is also a disaccharide, is that it is very slow, unpredictable and cannot easily be controlled. Compared to sucrose crystallisation, which has been extensively studied, lactose crystallisation lacks the fundamental research to identify the mechanisms of growth and effect of additives. An important difference from most other crystal growth systems is that ([alpha]-lactose hydrate crystals never grow from a pure environment; their growth environment always contains beta lactose. [alpha]-lactose monohydrate crystallises much more slowly because of the presence of [beta]- lactose in all solutions. Although there have been some studies on growth rates and the effect of additives, there has not been any reported work on the fundamentals of lactose crystallisation and the mechanisms that operate on the molecular level. The aim of this thesis is to gain a greater understanding at the fundamental processes, which occur at the molecular level during the crystallisation of lactose, in order to improve control at a macroscopic level.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">growth rate dispersion, milk, crystal growth.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imports and oligopoly behaviour in Australian manufacturing</field><field name="creator">Chong, Han Hwee</field><field name="description">Oligopoly behaviour by domestic firms faced with foreign competition in a small open economy is examined in the context of a market for differentiated products. This paper concentrates on the responsiveness of import flows to import price in the context of trade with imperfect competition. The empirical work analyses the behaviour over time of the interaction between domestic industry prices and domestic costs as well as foreign competitors' prices. A structural model is employed for estimation purposes with consumer demand derived from a CES (constant elasticity of substitution) utility function of domestic and foreign composites of goods. Domestic firms are assumed to face Leontief production functions and maximise profit independently subject to their conjectures about the reactions of rivals. Firm behaviour is modelled using conjectural variations to identify market power, distinguishing two models of oligopoly, namely, Cournot and Bertrand conjectural variations. This leads to the econometric specification of pricing, import and budget share equations consistent with oligopolistic equilibrium. The interrelationship between the budget share equations and the price-cost margin provides encompasses either Cournot or Bertrand conjectural variations. The econometric specification is applied to each of the two digit Australian manufacturing industries using quarterly data covering the period from 1984 to 2000. Results of the industrial behaviour indicate that industries that produce consumer products are generally react to price movements The classification of industry 21 to 24 is more proximate to consumer products as compared to higher industrial numbering. The regression results for industry 25 to 28 suggest quantity reactions. This is in line with the nature of the products produce by these industries, which are heavy industrial manufacturing products.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oligopoly, import flows, import price, foreign competition, Australian manufacturing industries.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14094</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of teaching and learning about the paradoxical concept of physical and chemical change</field><field name="creator">Palmer, William Pitt</field><field name="description">Science is sometimes seen as contained in a little box on its own, separate from the rest of the world.

The perspective is of someone involved in the teaching of the physical sciences for more than 40 years. The topic still remains contentious in teaching chemistry.The thesis sets out the evidence for and against the teaching of physical and chemical change and tracks the historical origins of the concept, its changing definitions and the research relating to the concept of physical and chemical change. A number of historically based textbook case studies are presented, some of which the author considers to be pioneering. The study ends with consideration of the public understanding of science, wondering whether the concept of physical and chemical change can be helpful in this respect.The conclusions reached are not in themselves remarkable, expressing a belief, that overall the concept of physical and chemical change is of benefit to the chemical community and perhaps to the wider public.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science textbooks, chemical processes, chemistry, science education.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14080</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Science education and the english second language learner</field><field name="creator">Morris, Judith</field><field name="description">The growing diversity of school populations around the world means that for many students the language of instruction in mainstream classrooms is not their first language. Content-based second language learning in a context such as a science classroom is considered advantageous as it enables the learner to manipulate a target language such as English in a way which is meaningful. However, science students who have yet to achieve communicative competence in English are disadvantaged when it comes to developing a deep understanding of scientific concepts. Many mainstream science teachers have concerns about this significant group of learners who can be left on the periphery of the class to cope as best as they can. Very often teachers aim to meet the needs of English Second Language (ESL) learners without any specific knowledge of the strategies which would enhance learning and ensure that learning environments encourage participation and interaction.

Although it is recognised that family centred care includes the child's rights to self determination the focus of this study is parental participation in the decision making and care of their hospitalised child at a partnership level. This is based on negotiation and requires frequent, effective communication between parents and nurses and for each to respect the other's knowledge and appreciate the other has something to offer in the relationship which will benefit the child. The purpose of this study was to identify whether family centred care was occurring in paediatric settings in rural Western Australia and explored parents' and nurses' perceptions of the concept. A questionnaire was designed based on the literature and common themes identified from focus groups. Convenience sampling was used and 15 rural hospitals facilitated participation of 243 parents who had a child under ten years of age hospitalised and 108 nurses who cared for children. Exploratory factor analysis identified four subscales from the parents' questionnaire and three subscales from the nurses' questionnaire which measured separate concepts of family centred care. Descriptive statistics were generated for each subscale, and independent t-tests, ANOVA and correlations were examined between independent variables and subscales of family centred care. There was a statistically significant difference in scores for parents' perceptions of `child friendly environment' between regional and district hospitals. Those parents who did not have social support scored a statistically significantly lower mean score for `respect as parent'. Nurses in district hospitals generated statistically significantly higher mean scores for `family focussed hospital' than those who worked in regional hospitals.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">paediatric nursing, rural Australia, regional, Western Australia, family centred care, descriptive study, rural.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The condition and effects of evolutionary education in the parochial school</field><field name="creator">Schulteis, Michael</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to determine the condition of evolution education in American parochial schools and the effect of evolution education on students' attitudes toward science.

In the first attitudinal study done specifically on parochial students, statistical analysis confirmed the reliability and validity of the TOSRA instrument for parochial school students. In a quasi-experimental design, analysis revealed that student science attitudes do change as a result of participating in a unit on evolution in the first year biology classes of secondary parochial schools. The emphasis placed by teachers on particular evolutionary topics was also analysed. It was found that all Lutheran high school biology teachers present evolution to some extent although not all topics are emphasized equally.

It occupies an area of about 360,000 sq. km, two thirds of which occurs in the Yilgarn Craton. The purpose of this research is to map the distribution of red-brown hardpan in the Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia; study the relationship between landscape, soil texture and vegetation; investigate the physical characteristics, petrology, mineralogy, geochemistry and cementing agents; and thereby determine the processes invaded in forming red-brown hardpan. The relation of red-brown hardpan to gold is investigated and determined its implications in mineral exploration. The main case study areas were the Goldfields Gas Pipe Line, the Federal Open Pit Gold mines and the Menzies district in the Kalgoorlie-Menzies region of the Eastern Goldfields; areas in and around the Woolgorong Station in the Murchison Province and at the Wiluna Gold Mines in the Northeastern Goldfields. The findings and conclusions of this research are summarised below. Red-brown hardpan occurs at or near the land surface and may vary from less than one metre to more than 10 m thick. It is exclusively developed in colluvium and alluvium, showing varying stages of cementation ranging from weakly cemented through moderate to strongly cemented. In addition, calcrete and red-brown hardpan occurs together in many places, south of the Menzies line, and this distribution suggests that red-brown hardpan was once more extensive and has been subsequently replaced by carbonate to form calcareous red-brown hardpan and calcrete. Red- brown hardpan predominantly occurs in regions with Q50 mm annual rainfall.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hardpan and duripan, regolith evolution, geochemistry, pedolith, saprolith, saprock, nano-cementation.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15888</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development, validation and application of an electronics laboratory environment inventory in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Liawatimena, Suryadiputra</field><field name="description">This study investigates and describes the development of an instrument named the Electronics Laboratory Environment Inventory (ELEI), which is used to measure students' perceptions of the electronics laboratory class as a learning environment.

In industry, facility layout design problems arise in manufacturing, in warehousing, and in various assignment type situations. The solution of these problems impacts on the viability of the industry. For example, material-handling costs which can comprise between 30 and 75% of the total manufacturing costs, can be reduced by using the optimization methods associated with the facility layout design. In the service industries, facility layout design problems arise in the location of emergency facilities (such as ambulance, fire stations) and in the allocation of space. The solution of these location problems impacts on the well being of the community. Mathematically, the facility layout problem has been modelled as: a quadratic assignment problem, a quadratic set covering problem, a linear integer programming problem, a mixed integer programming problem, and a graph theoretic problem. The problem has been shown to be NP-complete. This computational difficulty has led researchers to consider suboptimal solutions generated by heuristic approaches. There are a number of heuristic procedures that have been proposed for solving the facility layout design problem, including Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Expert Systems, and Graph Theoretic Algorithms. The most successful heuristic approaches are based on graph theoretic concepts. In this thesis we focus our study on constructive graph theoretic based heuristics for determining an optimal arrangement and configuration of facilities with the objective of maximizing the total benefit.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">arrangement and configuration of facilities, heuristic procedures.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategies for estimating atmospheric water vapour using ground-based GPS receivers in Australia</field><field name="creator">Agustan,</field><field name="description">The Global Positioning System (GPS) of navigation satellites was first developed for global navigation and position determination purposes. Signals from satellites are delayed by the Earths neutral atmosphere on propagating to ground-based receivers, termed the tropospheric delay. Although an unwanted term for precise positioning, the tropospheric delay may be converted to atmospheric water vapour, which is a vital parameter for weather forecasting.This research investigates the optimum GPS processing strategy to estimate atmospheric water vapour derived from ground-based GPS receivers particularly in the Australian region. For this purpose, GPS data observations from GPS permanent stations across Australia, mainly from the Australian Regional GPS Network, will be processed using scientific GPS software in post-processed mode and near real-time mode.This research shows that by applying high accuracy GPS data processing, the tropospheric delay could be estimated precisely. The quality of GPS data processing is indicated by the station coordinates repeatability since the coordinates can gauge at least a coarse assessment of the ability of the processing method to estimate the tropospheric delay.The precipitable water can be estimated from the wet component after separating the tropospheric delay into dry and wet components. High accuracy GPS data processing is dependent on the best choice of processing strategies, and the correct application of error-correction models and a priori constraints. This research finds that the GPS- PW estimation agrees with Radiosonde-PW estimation with an average of standard deviation at 2.5mm level for post-processed strategy and 2.8mm for near real-time strategy. The standard deviation of tropospheric parameter estimates is 1.1mm for post-processed strategy and 1.5mm for near real-time strategy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GPS-PW, meteorology, atmospheric water vapour, Global Positioning System (GPS).</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Barium zirconate ceramics for melt processing of barium cuprate superconductors</field><field name="creator">Kirby, Nigel Matthew</field><field name="description">The widespread use of high temperature superconductors through improved understanding of their underlying physics is in part dependent on the synthesis of large, high quality single crystals for physical research. Crucible corrosion is an important factor hindering the routine synthesis of large, high purity rare-earth barium cuprate superconductor single crystals. Molten BaCuO2-CuO fluxes required for the growth of such crystals are highly corrosive to substrate materials, and corrosion products may lead to chemical contamination of crystals and other practical difficulties. BaZrO3 is known to be inert to BaCuO2-CuO melts, but its use has remained restricted to a very small number of laboratories worldwide because it is very sensitive to the effects of off- stoichiometric or residual secondary phases which degrade its performance. BaZrO3 suitable for sustained melt containment is difficult to produce due to kinetic limitations of phase purity, difficulty in sintering to adequate density, and very narrow stoichiometry tolerances of finished ceramics. The existing literature provided a guide to the production of high quality BaZrO3, but was not sufficiently complete to readily allow production of crucibles suitable for this application. The two basic aims of this project were: To provide a comprehensive and quantitative description of the necessary attributes of crucibles for barium cuprate melt processing and to expand the knowledge of solid-state BaZrO3 processing to encourage its widespread application to crucible manufacture; To explore the application of solution chemical processes whose potential benefits could lead to routine application of BaZrO3 through improved ceramic quality and processing properties.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">zirconium chemistry, BaZrO3, crucible materials.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scenario planning as an organisational change agent</field><field name="creator">Nicol, Paul</field><field name="description">The thesis was based on a unique opportunity to compare the perceptions of participants before and after a scenario planning project conducted in a water utility. The researcher was able to explore the perceptions of the participants of scenario planning as a change agent directly, and so address a concern in some of the literature that much of the body of knowledge on scenario planning has been filtered through the viewpoints of scenario planning practitioners. Through the use of an adapted grounded theory approach, the perceptions of the participants emerged independently of a pre-conceived theoretical framework and explanations of the outcomes of the process were developed from this data. As well, the assumptions behind the practice of scenario planning were explored and from this a theory for scenario planning was developed. This was effected while constant comparison of concepts emerging from the data was in progress and provided a theoretical framework for the discussion of the empirical research. In this case scenario planning was perceived more as an instrument than as an agent of change, with a role of setting a framework for the strategic conversation in the subsequent phases of the change initiative. The outcomes of the research illustrated that uncertainties internal to the organisation had affected the implementation of change. In particular the conceptual ecologies of people in the organisation were not explored in depth, and this perpetuated a driving force for the future of the organisation that was not merely uncertain but remained unknowable. It was concluded that whether a scenario planning project achieved its objectives was matter of perception, with evaluation differing depending on the viewpoint taken.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">scenario planning, organisational purpose, barriers to change.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accounting for acquired goodwill in Australian business combinations: is there value to choose?</field><field name="creator">James, Kieran E.</field><field name="description">This research explores the empirical association between takeover bid premium and acquired goodwill, and tests whether the empirical association changes after the passage of approved accounting standard AASB1013: Accounting for Goodwill. AASB1013 mandates capitalization and amortization of acquired goodwill to the profit and loss account, over a maximum time period of 20 years. Using real options and contracting cost frameworks, this study argues that reducing the variety of accounting policy options available to bidder management after an acquisition results in a systematic loss in firm value. An empirical model developed by Robinson and Shane (1990) and Choi and Lee (1991) is used to measure the average effect on bid premiums of the mandatory change in accounting rule, after controlling for a range of confounding variables including mode of payment, managerial share ownership, and bidder prior share ownership. Based on a final sample consisting of 127 pre-AASB1013 bids and 134 post-AASB1013 bids, the results show that the goodwill accounting rule contained in AASB1013 significantly reduces both the mean and median level of bid premium and the strength of the association between acquired goodwill and bid premium.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">accounting policy choice, acquired goodwill, AASB1013, accounting standards.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building a knowledge society: the relationship between information and development in Bangladesh</field><field name="creator">Iqbal, MD Nasim</field><field name="description">The objective of the research is to identify how information can influence development in the developing countries, especially in Bangladesh.

The purpose of this study was to find the reasons behind this digital divide for people with disabilities and provide solutions. The investigation into this 'disability divide' initially examined the historical significance of the social construction of disability, the developments of computing and Internet-related technologies and the evolution of associated government and corporate policies. In order to gain an understanding of the specific elements in the current disability divide, interviews were conducted with a range of government representatives, multinational information technology developers and online information providers in Australia and the United States of America. In order to gain an understanding of what people with disabilities required from information technology, a national survey was conducted with people who are blind or vision impaired to determine their computing and Internet experiences. This study clearly identified that people with vision disabilities have a high level of computing and Internet expertise and it is specific barriers, rather than lack of will, that has prevented access to computing and Internet-related technologies. These barriers include issues relating to the perception of disability in society, Federal and state government policy, corporate policy, mainstream computing products, assistive technologies, real-time online communication, poverty and a lack of educational opportunities. Addressing the issues in these areas will significantly reduce the impact of the disability divide, allowing people who are blind or vision impaired to participate more effectively in the information age.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information technology, social construction of disability, digital divide, internet-related technologies, computing, vision impaired, perception of disability in society.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living with a label: an action oriented feminist inquiry into women's mental health</field><field name="creator">Gray, Jennie</field><field name="description">Dorothy Smith (1987) says investigations often begin with &#8216;a feeling of uneasiness&#8217;.

The unease that prompted this project emerged in conversations I had with women diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder whilst working as a practitioner at a women&#8217;s health centre. The frequency with which the discourses of biomedicine figured in these women&#8217;s narrated experiences engendered a collective commitment to make problematic &#8216;living with a label&#8217;. Loosely connected as mental health service recipients, the women I researched with are often positioned as &#8216;subject&#8217; to an objective medical gaze. Disrupting dichotomies that these women are accustomed to in clinical settings, and destabilising notions of neutral and detached research, our investigations were contingent, reflexive and relational. Recognising that all were intrinsic to the knowledge production processes, this project was cast in the feminist &#8216;with&#8217;, rather than the &#8216;on&#8217;.

This study combined quantitative and qualitative data and was conducted over one semester in four stages: 1) assessing the students' perceptions of their constructivist learning environment and determining students' pre-instruction conceptions about AIDS; 2) constructing an intervention based on constructivism theory in order to improving learning environments and students' learning outcomes; 3) implementing the intervention; and 4) evaluating the success of the intervention by re-assessing with the CLES. The Attitude Towards AIDS Questionnaire (ATAQ) was used to assess students' attitudes about AIDS. The students' cognitive achievement was assessed with the Students' Knowledge of AIDS Test (SKAT). Qualitative data were obtained from informal observation, focus group discussions, and student journals. The results indicated that the adapted Thai version of the CLES is appropriate for use in Health Science classes in Thailand's socio-cultural context because it was shown to be valid and reliable in both Actual and Preferred Forms. The results also revealed that the CLES and a constructivist learning approach can be used as effective tools in order to improve the learning environment of a Health Science class. This approach can improve students' knowledge and students' attitudes toward AIDS. The qualitative results supported the results from the questionnaires. This study suggests that teachers and health educators in Thailand can use the CLES to improve their learning environment and use a constructivist learning model to bring about improvement in students' achievement in their classes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health science classes, Thailand, constructivist learning, CLES, constructivist learning environment survey.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing land management units using Geospatial technologies: An agricultural application</field><field name="creator">Warren, Georgina</field><field name="description">This research develops a methodology for determining farm scale land managementunits (LMUs) using soil sampling data, high resolution digital multi-spectral imagery (DMSI) and a digital elevation model (DEM). The LMUs are zones within a paddock suitable for precision agriculture which are managed according to their productive capabilities. Soil sampling and analysis are crucial in depicting landscape characteristics, but costly. Data based on DMSI and DEM is available cheaply and at high resolution.The design and implementation of a two-stage methodology using a spatiallyweighted multivariate classification, for delineating LMUs is described. Utilising data on physical and chemical soil properties collected at 250 sampling locations within a 1780ha farm in Western Australia, the methodology initially classifies sampling points into LMUs based on a spatially weighted similarity matrix. The second stage delineates higher resolution LMU boundaries using DMSI and topographic variables derived from a DEM on a 10m grid across the study area. The method groups sample points and pixels with respect to their characteristics and their spatial relationships, thus forming contiguous, homogenous LMUs that can be adopted in precision agricultural applications. The methodology combines readily available and relatively cheap high resolution data sets with soil properties sampled at low resolution. This minimises cost while still forming LMUs at high resolution.The allocation of pixels to LMUs based on their DMSI and topographic variables has been verified. Yield differences between the LMUs have also been analysed.

During the last two decades many chemicals have been studied and applied under the name of relative permeability modifier (RPM) to combat this problem. These chemicals were mostly bullheaded individually into the affected zones, consequently their application resulted in low to medium success, particularly in treating reservoirs suffering from matrix flow. It has been found that the disproportionate permeability reduction depends on the amount of polymer dispersed or absorbed by the porous rock. If single polymers are employed to treat excessive water production in a matrix reservoir they cannot penetrate deep into the formation rock because the polymer will start to build as a layer on the surface of the rock grains. As a result the placement of polymer into the formation will no be piston like and the dispersion over the rock pores will be uneven. To improve water shutoff technology a method of injecting chemicals sequentially is recommended provided that the chemical&#8217;s viscosity is increasing successively with the chemicals injected.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oil and gas wells, excessive water production, (RPM), enhancing relative permeability modifier, injecting chemicals sequentially.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17578</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The classification of inland salt lakes in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Gregory, Stacey J</field><field name="description">Inland salt lakes in Western Australia have been used by the mining industry for the disposal of excess water generated during the mining process. However, the impact of these operations on the salt lakes is poorly understood. This is mainly due to the lack of information on the biota and chemistry for the lakes. The main aim of this project was to develop a classification system for inland salt lakes of Western Australia based on abiotic and biotic factors such as sediment and water quality, invertebrates and algae to determine lakes with unique or significant features. Water and sediments collected from the salt lakes were generally characterised by an alkaline pH, high salinity and the majority of lakes being dominated by sodium and chloride. Concentrations of some metals were also high, particularly in surface water. A high degree of variation in water and sediment quality was demonstrated both within and between the study lakes. In addition, these parameters were shown to be influenced by geography, geology, stage of the hydrocycle within which the lake was sampled and the occurrence of dewatering discharge. Biota in the salt lakes must be able to cope in a harsh environment, adjusting to temporary water regime, high temperature, and high salinity. As such, the species richness of these systems is generally low. Diatoms (a group of algae) and invertebrates were investigated among the biota. A total of 56 diatom species were recorded from 24 lakes. The most common species were Amphora coffeaeformis, Hantzschia aff. baltica and Navicula aff. incertata. These species were shown to have broad tolerances to environmental variations. Sediment chemistry explained variations in diatom community structure, with zinc, moisture content and cobalt having the greatest and negative influence.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">inland salt lakes, Western Australia, mining industry, disposal of excess water, biota and chemistry of salt lakes, classification system, sediment, water quality, invertebrates, algae</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18037</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stigma and discrimination of Indian women living with HIV/AIDS : perceptions and experiences of women in Mumbai, India</field><field name="creator">O'Connor, Pamela Margaret</field><field name="description">Stigma and discrimination are now recognised as major factors in the spread of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). To date, research has focused on how to change individual responses to stigma and discrimination without exploring the social and structural dimensions. Complex community and societal dimensions, such as culture, power and difference need to be explored if progress is to be made in coping with stigma and discrimination. India now has HIV/AIDS prevalence figures to rival sub Saharan Africa. The disease has spread from high-risk populations such as intravenous drug users and commercial sex workers into the general population. Married, monogamous, heterosexual women in slum communities are highly vulnerable. Factors such as caste, class, ethnic group, poverty and social expectations present formidable layers of stigma for these women. They have also faced discrimination since before their birth. HIV/AIDS imposes yet another layer of stigma and discrimination upon their shoulders. The aims of the study were firstly to investigate whether stigma and discrimination existed for these women by documenting and analysing literature on the individual, societal and cultural situation of Indian women living with HIV/AIDS (IWLWHAs).

The south-west and specifically the inland wheatbelt region has been severely influenced by secondary salinisation, due to clearing of native vegetation for agriculture. There has been little research on diatom communities from salt-affected systems, with this data providing the basis for the development of an inference model based on species optima and tolerance limits to salinity. Physico-chemical variables measured from the study sites were collated and assessed. Salinity ranged from freshwater (0.04) to hypersaline (156.80 ppt), and pH ranged from acidic (2.90) to alkaline (10.51). Dissolved oxygen levels were recorded from 1.11 to 18.67 mgL-1, water temperature from 6.30 to 28.10 &#176;C and peripheral vegetation scores from 1 (little or no cover) to 5 (dense cover). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that salinities were significantly higher in standing waters located further inland, compared to flowing waters in high rainfall areas. Hypersaline wetlands displayed significantly lower dissolved oxygen levels, higher water temperatures and reduced peripheral vegetation, compared to freshwaters. The pH of hypersaline sites was also significantly lower, associated with surrounding land use or underlying geology.

Past educational research literature suggests that the use of peer review may accelerate students' scientific reasoning skills without a concurrent demand on faculty time per student. Peer review contains many elements of effective pedagogy such as peer-peer collaboration, repeated practice at evaluation and critical thinking, formative feedback, multiple contrasting examples, and extensive writing. All of these pedagogies may contribute to improvement in students' scientific reasoning. The effect of peer review on scientific reasoning was assessed using three major data sources: student performance on written lab reports, student performance on an objective Scientific Reasoning Test (Lawson, 1978) and student perceptions of the process of peer review in scientific community as well as the classroom. In addition, the need to measure student performance across multiple science classes resulted in the development of a Universal Rubric for Laboratory Reports. The reliability of this instrument and its effect on the grading consistency of graduate teaching assistants were also tested. Further, application of the Universal Rubric to student laboratory reports across multiple biology classes revealed that the Rubric is further useful as a programmatic assessment tool.

It did so by seeking to understand and represent their views regarding what influences effective change processes. The significance of this research was the focus on employee perceptions and not those of management. It was research conducted at a grass-roots level seeking to provide a voice for those least often heard or asked. The research was conducted using participants from two case study organisations in the local government sector of Western Australia employing approximately 200 staff each. Both organisations were metropolitan and had been experiencing change within their organisations for some time. Within this research it is recognised that the phenomenon of organisational change is by no means new. Since the early 1970s literature has emerged proposing that our world and the world of work, both internally and externally, are about to change. Management books and the history of management and organisational life have been filled for years with issues relating to change. These include changing management practices, new techniques for achieving change and dealing with threats of what nonchange may bring. As the research was seeking to interpret respondents' meaning relating to the phenomenon of organisational change, it was not concerned with quantification, but with understanding the phenomenon from the viewpoint of those experiencing the change. This research was based on the belief that human behaviour, unlike that of physical objects, cannot be understood without reference to the meanings and purposes attached by the human actors to their activities. The ontological assumption of a socially constructed reality underpinned this study. The realities experienced were those as interpreted by employees. The epistemological assumption was that of interpretivism.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organisational change process, employee perceptions.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of agricultural extension workers in horticultural agribusiness in Nusa Tenggara Timur Province, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Leta, Rafael L.</field><field name="description">Despite the abundance of horticultural crops, farmers in the Nusa Tenggara Timur province of Indonesia (NTT) are still living under poverty level. The Indonesian government has identified agricultural extension workers as a 'point of spear' of agricultural development and given them 12 roles. Horticultural agribusiness would certainty be able to increase farmers' standard of living if agricultural extension workers can perform their roles effectively. However, in 1997, the average production of fruits was only 3.8 tonnes per hectare and 1.9 tonnes per hectare of vegetables. Ashraf (1993) has suggested that inefficiency of agricultural extension workers is one of the reasons why agricultural production does not improve to its full capacity. A study investigating the roles of Agricultural extension workers in horticultural agribusiness in Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) Indonesia was conducted. Interviews were conducted of 223 farmers, 46 agricultural extension workers and 32 government officers. A literature search suggests this is the first study ever done in Indonesia particularly in NTT which involved farmers, agricultural extension workers and government officers to investigate: 1) what roles were expected of agricultural extension workers by farmers, government officers and agricultural extension workers, 2) the perceptions of these groups about the effectiveness of agricultural extension workers in performing their roles, and 3) factors that impede agricultural extension workers' ability to perform their roles effectively.

A conceptual framework and hypotheses, informed through the literature and qualitative focus group process, were developed for testing. Data were collected from 81 organisations, drawn from both the private and public sectors. Analyses enabled detailed consideration of the impact of perceived levels of organisational knowledge on perceptions of post-downsizing/restructuring organisational effectiveness. The significance of relationships between downsizing/restructuring events, both decisions and processes, and knowledge sharing in organisations undergoing downsizing/restructuring were also examined. Findings indicate the need for open and honest relationships between managerial (Decision Makers and Implementers) and non-managerial employees (Affected Employees) in order to achieve successful organisational outcomes. The impact of knowledge sharing on organisational knowledge was assessed by studying the extent of both formal knowledge sharing and informal networks present in respondent organisations. The direct impact of knowledge sharing on organisational outcomes was also analysed and discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">downsizing, restructuring, knowledge retention, organisational effectiveness, employee support, knowledge sharing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18868</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microstructural design and characterisation of alumina/aluminium titanate composites</field><field name="creator">Manurung, Posman</field><field name="description">A new but relatively simple processing study was conducted to investigate the microstructure-property relationships of alumina/aluminium titanate (AAT) composites. The objectives of this study were: (a) to develop a process for fabricating AAT and &#946;-spodumene modified AAT composites using a solid-state reaction method and functionally-graded AAT using an infiltration technique, and (b) to evaluate the effects of dispersed aluminium titanate (AT) on the phase relations, microstructure and mechanical properties of alumina-based composites. The study has revealed that the processing procedures played an important rule in the microstructural development of AAT composites. The microstructure and properties of AAT composites have been found to be strongly influenced by the presence of dispersed AT. The phase relations in the AAT system have been characterised by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and neutron diffraction (ND). Rietveld analysis showed that the AT content increased in proportion with the amount of rutile added. The dynamic ND study showed that AT commenced to form at ~1310&#176;C The presence of AT caused a reduction of hardness but an improvement in fracture toughness. In addition, the presence of AT hindered the processes or kinetics of sintering and densification. The use of &#946;-spodumene has been investigated as a liquid-phase-sintering aid for the densification of AAT composites. XRD, ND, differential thermal analysis (DTA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Vickers indentation were used to characterise the effect of &#946;-spodumene on the phase relations, densification, microstructure and mechanical properties of AAT composites. The presence of &#946;-spodumene was found to have a profound influence on the phase relations, densification, microstructure and properties of AAT composites.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">structure-property relationships, microstructure, alumina/aluminium titanate composites.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development Of An Evaluation Tool For Use At The Design Stage Of Auditoria With Respect To Unassisted Speech Reinforcement</field><field name="creator">McMinn, Terrance</field><field name="description">This dissertation describes the development of an evaluation tool that can be used by an acoustican during the design stage of enclosures used for unassisted speech. Enclosures include lecture theatres, lecture halls and speech auditoriums. The tool is designed to enable Acousticians to be able to manipulate various acoustical parameters such as the geometry and the materials or construction selection to gauge the impact on speech performance. The tool can also be used to evaluate the performance of speech privacy within spaces using the Speech Transmission Index. Computer simulation tools have a number of advantages over existing methods such as physical scale models for this type of evaluation. Typical advantages are in the elimination of the difficult selection of materials with appropriate scale model acoustic performance, resolution of air absorption at scale model frequencies, reduced cost in development of the model, no storage space problems, ease of modifying and duplicating the model. Scale models also present difficulties in measuring some of the indices such as Speech Transmission Index. Whilst equipment can be purchased for the measurement of STI, scale model equivalents and the impact of the change in frequencies and modulations have not been researched or published.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acoustics, unassisted speech.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inquiry-based strategies: an investigation into the extent to which they are indicated and employed in the teaching of contemporary science syllabuses</field><field name="creator">Devitt, Denise</field><field name="description">The science education literature was examined in order to identify the methodologies that various authors considered to characterise inquiry teaching.

The final version of the ITIC contained forty items in five different scales, Freedom in Practical Work, Communication, Interpretation of Data, Science Stories and Uncertainty in Science.The Actual and Preferred Forms of the ITIC were administered to 2,207 Grade 7-12 students and 65 teachers from 15 different schools. The results of this investigation showed that both students and teachers would prefer there to be higher levels of inquiry behaviours in Tasmanian science classrooms, with teachers indicating a preference for significantly higher levels than students. The perceptions of different sub-groups within the student population were also analysed.An examination of the Tasmanian curriculum documents showed that they supported the use of inquiry teaching methodologies, as defined by the ITIC scales. From the above investigations it was concluded that it would be desirable for there to be higher levels of inquiry methodologies in Tasmanian science classes, and that the production of the ITIC provides a means of monitoring and measuring any change.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science education, inquiry teaching, is this an inquiring classroom, ITIC, Tasmanian science classes.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quasigeoid modelling in New Zealand to unify multiple local vertical datums</field><field name="creator">Amos, Matthew</field><field name="description">One goal of modern geodesy is the global unification of vertical datums so that height data from them can be properly integrated. This thesis studies the unification of the 13 disparate levelling- and tide-gauge-based vertical datums in New Zealand (NZ). It proposes a new NZ-wide single vertical datum based on a gravimetric quasigeoid model to unify the existing local vertical datums. This will also include methods to transform height data in terms of the existing datums to the new datum and vice versa. After defining and comparing the main types of height system and vertical datum used around to world, the system of heights used in NZ was shown to be normal-orthometric. Consequently, datum unification was achieved using a quasigeoid model, as opposed to a geoid model. The quasigeoid was computed by combining the GRACE-based GGM02 and EGM96 global geopotential models with land gravity data (40,737 observations) and a 56-m resolution digital elevation model (DEM). Marine gravity data came from a least-squares collocation combination of 1,300,266 crossover-adjusted ship track observations and gravity anomalies derived from multi-mission satellite altimetry.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vertical datums, New Zealand, quasigeoid model.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploratory study of the measurement of religion and spirituality using scale content analysis and epidemiological methods</field><field name="creator">Browne, Geoffrey Robert</field><field name="description">This study arose out of a search for a suitable scale to measure religion and spirituality. The literature suggests that religion and spirituality are potentially powerful explanatory variables in health and social research, but there do not appear to be any instruments that are generally accepted as measures of an individual's religious or spiritual characteristics. While a lack of consensus in such a complex area is probably to be expected, it is the lack of accepted measures or instruments that drives this study. The literature review describes the historical influence of religion on public health practices, and the most recently reported associations between religion and both physical and mental health. This establishes religion as a potentially useful construct to include in any health study. However, the reported association between religion and health is often unclear, and the measures used differ widely between studies. This study goes beyond the health context and explores the reasons why existing methods have not resulted in broadly accepted measures of religion and spirituality.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">measures of religion and spirituality, influence of religion on health.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computer classroom learning environments and students' attitudes toward computer courses in tertiary institutions in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Charik, Kanokporn</field><field name="description">This thesis is significant in that it is one of the first evaluations of a computer classroom psychosocial learning environment and investigation of associations between learning environment factors and students' attitudes at the tertiary level in Thailand. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in this study. Three questionnaires were employed to provide quantitative data: the College and University Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI), the Computer Laboratory Environment Inventory (CLEI), and the Attitude towards Computer and Computer Courses (ACCC). The three questionnaires were administered to 905 computer science students in order to investigate their perceptions of their learning environment and associations between this and their attitudinal outcomes. Overall, the results generated from scale internal reliability analysis, mean correlations and ANOVAs suggested that the modified Thai versions of the CUCEI, CLEl, and ACCC are valid and reliable instruments for measuring students' perceptions of computing laboratory learning environments in a Thailand university. The results of an application of the CUCEI and CLEI demonstrated that students had positiveperceptions about their computer classroom learning environment. The qualitative data obtained from student interviews supported the information from questionnaires and provided more detail about the computer classrooms. Measurements of students' attitudes indicated that students enjoyed their classes and thought they were useful. Regarding associations between students' attitudes and perceptions of the computer classroom, most scales of the Thai CUCEI and CLEI, were statistically significantly positively associated with the four scales of the Thai version of the ACCC. Importantly, there were significant negative correlations between scales of the CUCEI, and CLEI with the Anxiety scale.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tertiary level,  Thailand,  learning environment and student attitutes, computing laboratory learning.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and Validation of an Instrument for Assessing Distance Education Learning Environments in Higher Education: The Distance Education Learning Environments Survey (DELES)</field><field name="creator">Walker, Scott L.</field><field name="description">Globally, as distance education has become firmly embedded as a part of the higher education landscape, governments and institutions are calling for meaningful research on distance education. This study involved designing, developing and validating a learning environment survey instrument for use in distance education-delivered courses in post-secondary education. Specifically it involved merging two distinctive areas of study: psychosocial learning environments research and distance education research. The unique social structure of asynchronous distance education learning environments requires a unique and economical instrument for measuring the perceptions of distance education course participants. The research followed a three-stage instrument-development process of identifying salient scales, developing survey items, and field testing and analysing data using item analysis and validation procedures. This was followed by an investigation into the associations between the psychosocial learning environment and students enjoyment of distance education. The results yielded a new six-scale, 34-item Web-based learning environment instrument suitable for use in a number of asynchronous post-secondary distance education environments. The new instrument, the Distance Education Learning Environment Survey (DELES) assesses Instructor Support, Student Interaction and Collaboration, Personal Relevance, Authentic Learning, Active Learning, and Student Autonomy. Analyses of data obtained from 680 subjects supported the factorial validity and internal consistency reliability. The results also indicated statistically significant associations between the distance education learning environment and student enjoyment of distance education.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learning environment survey, distance education.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Landscape as metaphor: artist as metaphier</field><field name="creator">Briggs, Susan H.</field><field name="description">This research records a three year journey of exploration through the visual arts, specifically painting and drawing in relation to the landscape. The written work presented here provides a support document to my final exhibition of paintings that were exhibited in the John Curtin Gallery at Curtin University of Technology from November 24th - December 15th 2002.The writing of this exegesis is in itself a creative piece, but it is not the same as the visual research that culminates in the paintings. I am convinced that to talk about creating art actually leads one away from being in the experiencing of that art, hence this writing discusses the processes involved and not the finished work. My primary objective within this exegesis is to present a discussion centred around some of the philosophical issues that became visible whilst carrying out my practical work. This discussion is also about process itself in art making practices and research, hence this exegesis is intended to run as a parallel to the visual body of work as presented in the final exhibition of works held in the John Curtin Gallery.I have intentionally used my own practice as a device to question the choices and outcomes of art making generally in an effort to add a little colour to the larger discourse of creative practices. Some of the writing may seem personal (apart from the journal notes) and again, this is an intentional device in order to bring about a sense of embodiment within the writing itself and a way of mirroring the processes within the paintings.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">John Curtin Gallery, creative art, exhibition, paintings.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hearing their voices : building a career development model for women in engineering</field><field name="creator">Newhouse-Maiden, Lesley Patricia</field><field name="description">This study is an interpretive investigation of the life-career histories of 53 women in engineering; and a case study of one woman's account of present-lived career and her quest for identity in engineering over an eight year period (1992-1999). This study had two broad aims. First, it aimed to give voice to women's stories derived from their own reflective accounts, and to compare and contrast their perspectives with feminist writers' reviews of non-traditional girls' and women's career experiences, and with the organisational career story of itself. Second, it aimed to evaluate the adequacy of my convergence of a socialist feminist "unified systems" theory of social relations (Jaggar, 1983, 1989; Jaggar &amp; Rothenberg, 1984, 1993) with Super's segmental life-span, lifespace theory (Super, 1980, 1990, 1994) to explain women's career and personality development. Further to this theoretical convergence, I elaborated on Super's original models and evaluated their usefulness for my gender analysis of career from four perspectives. I conceptualised "career" as both "subjective" and "organisational" (Dale, 1972; Hughes, 1937) and, using Benhabib's (1986b) terminology, created four perspectives by further differentiating career into either "generalised other" or "concrete other" (see Figure 1.1). Drawing on the findings of my exploration of the women's careers, I extended the range of Jaggar's/Super's explanatory theories of career and personality development (Figure 2.2) in an elaboration of Supers archway model (Figure 8.1). I found that my combined Jaggar/Super career archway and spider web model (Figure 2.3) represented the life-space tensions in each individual woman's career decision-making in engineering.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women, career pathways, career development, engineering.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The causal predominance of psychotic experience</field><field name="creator">Preston, Neil Joseph</field><field name="description">The present study investigated the causal predominance of cognition on anxiety, depression, paranoia, phobia and somatic concern over three time waves of self reported data measured every six months over one year, of 145 cases experiencing their first episodes of psychosis. In turn the symptoms of anxiety, depression, paranoia, phobia and somatic concern were examined for their cross-influential effects on cognition. Cognition was examined under a causal predominance hypothesis as the lead symptom because of its influence recognised in the literature under the neurodevelopmental hypothesis. These longitudinal effects were examined using structural equation modelling. Prior to this investigation, the research was able to demonstrate a stable 6-factor measurement model with these symptoms between two independent samples of early psychosis cases that met guidelines of treatment under the Australian national early psychosis treatment guidelines. This measurement model demonstrated good internal reliability and construct validity. Most symptoms over each time wave had a "domino effect" where the symptom prior to the next wave of assessment had an influence. This is known as a mediation effect. Somatic concern and depression demonstrated a "snow ball" or direct effect where the extent of the condition at time one influenced directly the condition at time three. Structural models, which examined the cross-influential effect between cognition and the other symptoms, demonstrated an effect between paranoia and cognition. This effect demonstrated that paranoia at Time 2 (i.e., 6 months after stabilisation of symptoms), had a crossinfluential effect on cognition at Time 3 (ie, 12 months after stabilisation of symptoms).</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EPOES, symptoms, psychosis, pathology.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of conserved lymphokine element 0 in induction and inhibition of interleukin-5</field><field name="creator">Arthaningtyas, Estri</field><field name="description">The role of eosinophilia in allergic disorders indicates hIL-5 as a target of therapy. The conservation of hIL-5 proximal elements suggests they are important in controlling expression. Corticosteroids are important in the treatment of allergy, and are powerful inhibitors of IL-5 expression. Antisense oligonucleotides are new compounds that can specifically inhibit IL-5 production. This study aimed at understanding the role of conserved lymphokine element 0 (CLEO) in induction and inhibition of IL-5.The conserved proximal CLEO/TATA elements driving a luciferase reporter gene gave higher expression than a 500bp promoter in PER1 17 T-cell line. Two and three copies of IL-5 CLEO upstream of the silent IL-4 minimal promoter gave 150-200 fold increases in expression in forward orientation, but little activity in reverse orientation. Consequently, while CLEO is a powerful activator, it is not a classical enhancer. Antisense technology has also shown the dependence of IL-5 gene transcription on the de novo synthesis of the transcription factor Fra2.Inhibition of IL-5 reporter constructs by dexamethasone when induced by PMNcAMP, but not PMNCaI, provided a tool for understanding the mechanism. Deletion analysis identified CLEO as the key element of dexamethasone inhibition. Non-inhibition of IL-5 reporter constructs by dexamethasone in a Jurkat cell line, however, showed a possible intermediary factor involved in the inhibition mechanism.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interleukin-5, eosinophilia, regulatory elements, DNA manipulations.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceived effect of disability on adolescent siblings of children with an intellectual disability: development of a measure and pilot intervention</field><field name="creator">Nesa, Monique</field><field name="description">The effects of disability on individuals, their parents and their family as a whole have been extensively researched. However, the specific effects on siblings have not been given adequate attention by mainstream society until recently. Consequently, few services have been available for siblings in our community. Of the research that has explored sibling needs, most have relied on parental reports or used measures developed for alternate populations measuring more general variables such as psychopathology. This research project is concerned with the development of a self-report measure of Perceived Effect of Disability for teenage siblings (12 -17 years) of children with an intellectual disability and the development and pilot of an intervention that aimed to assist the positive adjustment of teenage siblings. The development of the measure involved three stages. First, an extensive item pool was constructed from past literature with 150 potential items identified. To ensure the validity of the item pool for siblings themselves, a sample of 24 teenage siblings rated the importance of the items and subscales. This reduced the number of items. Next, focus groups were run with an alternate sample of 41 teenage siblings for further evidence that all pertinent issues were included and to explore items identified as having low importance in Stage 1. The last stage involved testing the measure&#8217;s psychometric properties with a further 80 siblings. Exploratory factor analyses were conducted to determine the measure&#8217;s underlying factor structure. Results identified four factors underlying the measure, Positive Influence of Disability, Family Differences, Worry About What Others Think and Lack of Time With Others, all of which exhibited high internal consistency and test-retest reliability over a six-week period.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">positive adjustment of teenage siblings, services for siblings, percieved effect of disability measure, effects of disability on siblings.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16817</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Cyclogenisis in the North of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Hamilton, Gregory Stuart</field><field name="description">The region of interest in this study is the ocean area to the north of the Western Australian coast; that is, the Timor Sea. It is the tropical cyclones (TC) that generate in this area that most often affect the people and industries located in this region of Western Australia. Accordingly, it is the case that there is a continuing need to improve our understanding of these systems using both observations and numerical models. After an introduction to the problems caused by TCs in the north of Western Australia, a description is made of the study area. A review of the various meteorological systems that can be identified in the tropics is provided. This is followed by a history of research on cyclogenesis. A detailed discussion is undertaken on the current state of knowledge of tropical cyclogenesis. This theoretical understanding subsequently is applied to three case studies. Following a description of the data used and the analysis techniques, the three case studies are presented. In each case study, a system, which later becomes a tropical cyclone, is analysed during the genesis period. The three case studies examined in this thesis are, case 1 (TC Tim, 1994), case 2 (TC Elaine, 1999) and case 3 (TC Isobel, 1996). In each case, the system was studied for at least 10 days prior to it being named. This approach was adopted to ensure that any potential development was not overlooked. A system is named when it reaches sufficient intensity for gale force winds to exist in all quadrants around the centre of that system. For each case, the environment in the vicinity of the location where the system was initially identified was studied until an evolving system was identified.

As biography, it portrays the life of Mr. Mippy with particular emphasis on the factors which help to highlight his understandings and his vision for an Indigenous cultural renewal. As ethnography, the study is intended as a vehicle for wider concerns, evoking an interpretative glimpse of his community and contributing a new perspective of that community as a continuing social entity.These aims are broadly set forth in the brief introduction. The first chapter of the thesis then outlines the origin and development of the research project and the evolution of its methodology. Chapter two presents a picture of Mr. Mippys life experience, largely in terms of his own recorded memories and perceptions, while chapter three places his later life in a community context which includes historical, personal and demographic perspectives. The following two chapters, four and five, present various accounts of the work undertaken by Edward Mippy. They offer a glimpse of his cultural knowledge, seeking to explain the nature of his vision and the way in which his goals were implemented. The sixth chapter aims to situate his life and work in the wider social and academic discourses of Indigenous identity.

For little over a century corundum (&#945;-Al2O3) has been the most widely used and known of the aluminas. The emerging metastable aluminas, including the &#947;, &#948;, &#951;, &#952;, &#954;, &#946;, and &#967; polymorphs, have been growing in importance. In particular, &#947;-Al2O3 has received wide attention, with established use as a catalyst and catalyst support, and growing application in wear abrasives, structural composites, and as part of burner systems in miniature power supplies. It is also growing in importance as part of the feedstock for aluminium production in order to affect both the adsorption of hydrogen fluoride and the feedstock solubility in the electrolytic solution. However, much ambiguity surrounds the precise structure of &#947;-Al2O3. Without proper knowledge of the structure, understanding the properties, dynamics and applications will always be less than optimal. The aim of this research was to contribute towards settling this ambiguity. This work was achieved through extensive computer simulations of the structure, based on interatomic potentials with refinements of promising structures using density functional theory (DFT), and a wide range of supporting experiments. In addition to providing a more realistic representation of the structure, this research has also served to advance knowledge of the evolution of the structure with changing temperature and make new insights regarding the location of hydrogen in &#947;-Al2O3.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aluminas, gamma-prime alumina, gamma-Alumina, structure determination, kappa alumina, spinel based structures, c symmetry based structures, structural evolution, assessment of hydrogen content, interatomic potentials, density functional theory, neutron scattering, Rietveld analysis, electron microscopy, infrared analysis, small angle X-ray scattering.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14992</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cost functions, subaddivity and natural monopoly: review, extension and application to Australian telecommunications</field><field name="creator">Coble-Neal, Grant William</field><field name="description">This study applies a test for subadditivity (natural monopoly) to Australian telecommunications industry data for the period 1954 to 1990. If an industry exhibits subadditive cost, a monopoly can provide total industry output at a lower cost than multiple firms. The test for subadditivity is dependent on econometric estimation of a theoretically valid cost function. The cost function employed in this study is a multiple output variation of the symmetric generalised McFadden cost function. The main advantage of this specification is the ability to impose concavity on the cost function with respect to the input prices without imposing a priori restrictions on the input substitution elasticities.While there have been numerous previous subadditivity studies, this study is novel in two respects. First, this study contains the results of a direct test involving the provision of data carriage services provided by Australias monopoly carrier from 1970 to 1990. Thus, the test for subadditivity is applied to a relatively new service at a time when demand is in its infancy. Second, the approach to modelling makes explicit allowance for radical technological changes and lags in adjustment.The results indicate cost complementarity between data-aggregate output and large economies of scale. However, these effects are not strong enough to guarantee subadditivity. Analysis suggests that the most likely cause of subadditivity is the extent of network duplication between competitors. Evidence of subadditivity is found for firms that duplicate more than 30% of the networks fixed cost. This implies that at the national level, competition policy is the right choice. This suggests that regulated competition is likely to be no more costly than monopoly.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">McFadden cost function, subaddivity testing, Australian telecommunications.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Different scales and integration of data in reservoir simulation</field><field name="creator">Hartanto, Lina</field><field name="description">The term upscaling and determination of pseudo curves, or effective parameters, used on a coarse-scale simulation grid are related to the complex and extensive problems associated with reservoir studies.

Thus the building of the reservoir simulation models can be optimally determined.By concentrating on the modelling and upscaling gas injection for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) process, which includes Interfacial Tension (IFT) and the amicability effect, a new effective and efficient algorithm of upscaling will be investigated and determined by using several upscaled parameters.

When fluid passes over a flexible surface the simultaneous interaction between the flow and structure gives rise to vibrations and instabilities on the surface as well as in the fluid. The fluid-structure interaction (FSI) has potential to be used in the control of boundary layer dynamics to achieve drag reduction through transition delay. The modelling and control of FSI systems apply to many fields of engineering beyond drag reduction, for example: the modelling and analysis of biomechanical systems; natural environmental systems; aero-elastics; and other areas where flow interacts moving or compliant boundaries. The investigation is performed through numerical simulation. This returns more detail than could be resolved through experiments, while also permitting the study of finite compliant surfaces that are prohibitively difficult, or impossible, to study with analytical techniques. In the present work, novel numerical modelling methods are developed from linear system analysis through to nonlinear disturbances and viscous effects.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drag reduction, boundary layer dynamics, fluid structure interaction.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Culturally and linguistically diverse nursing student education: a grounded theory study</field><field name="creator">Brown, Vickey Michelle</field><field name="description">This study set out to examine and describe the experiences of undergraduate students from different cultural backgrounds studying nursing across three Australian states. The researcher chose to use the grounded theory method to analyse data collected from 40 undergraduate student nurses and 32 nurse teachers. Other data resources included field observations of student nurses in clinical practice and classroom settings. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and along with field notes and memos were analysed using the constant comparative method synonymous with grounded theory. This study was set in a sociopolitical climate of disharmony in which the basic social problem of sociocultural discord: being different and not fitting in (SD) was identified and developed as the core category. The basic social psychological problem existed for culturally and linguistically diverse nursing students because they were in some way different to the majority of their White western counterparts. Differences existed in, for example, religion, dress, skin colour, beliefs, behaviours, and ways of communicating. Because these students were different they experienced discord. Discord was characterised as sociocultural because differences causing discord were rooted in either a cultural or social domain or both. Those students who experienced SD lived with feelings of social and professional isolation, discrimination, and low self esteem to name a few. For the students, experiences of sociocultural discord were largely unpredictable and occurred episodically. The fear of embarrassment, discrimination, or some other form of inequitable treatment prevented students participating actively in classes or on clinical practice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Seeking Concord to get in the right track (SC), tertiary nursing education, Australians and stereotyping.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of health promotion on girls' and young womens' health behaviours</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Helen</field><field name="description">This formative research examines the effects of health promotion on girls' and young women's health behaviours. Health promotion campaigns targeting women have previously had variable success. Some have been criticised for containing unhelpful values and messages, for example, those that were seen to cause harm to women outside the target population or use of stereotypical symbolism to support the message. Within this study these are called 'unintended consequences'. The Young Women and Health Promotion (YW&amp;HP) study examines the potential for unintended consequences (both negative and positive) of health promotion in general. The focus is then narrowed to examine in more detail whether the use of specific methodologies (such as social marketing), contribute to unintended consequences when promoting physical activity, nutrition and non- smoking messages to girls' and young women. These health behaviours were specifically targeted as they are known to be the major modifiable risk factors for women in the prevention of many chronic illnesses.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health behaviour, girls, young women, unintended consequences, young women and health promotion study, health promotion.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=9410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal History and Deep Overpressure Modelling in the Northern Carnarvon Basin, North West Shelf, Australia</field><field name="creator">He, Sheng</field><field name="description">The Northern Carnarvon Basin is the richest petroleum province in Australia. About 50 gas/condensate and oil fields, associated mainly with Jurassic source rocks, have been discovered in the sub-basins and on the Rankin Platform since 1964. The basin is located at the southern end of the North West Shelf of Australia. It can be mainly subdivided into the Exmouth, Barrow, Dampier and Beagle Sub-basins, the Rankin Platform and Exmouth Plateau. The sub-basins are rift-related grabens and half-grabens developed during the Jurassic to the earliest Cretaceous and contain over 10 kilometres of Mesozoic and Cainozoic sedimentary rocks, among which are several thousand meters of Jurassic rocks. The formations of the Jurassic and the lower part of the Barrow Group of Early Cretaceous age in the sub-basins of the Northern Carnarvon Basin were found to be overpressured with excess pressures of 5-29 MPa at depths of 2900-3600 m indicated by repeat formation tests (RFTs) and drill stem tests (DSTs). The characteristics of organic matter, thermal history and thermal maturity, pressure seal and overpressure evolution in the sub-basins are crucial to a proper understanding of the nature and dynamic processes of hydrocarbon generation and migration in the basin. Based on organic geochemical data, the important source rocks in the basin are Jurassic organic-rich fine-grained rocks including the Murat Siltstone, the rift-related Athol Formation and Dingo Claystone. The Mungaroo Formation of the Middle-Upper Triassic contains gas-generating source rocks. These formations recognised to be organic rich based on 1256 values of the total organic carbon content (TOC, %) from 17 wells. Average TOC values (calculated from samples with TOC &lt; 15 %) are about 2.19 % in the Mungaroo Formation, about 2.09 % in the Murat Siltstone and about 1.74 % in the Athol Formation and Dingo Claystone.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thermal maturity, 2D deep overpressure modelling, Palaeoheatflow modelling, Rock-Eval Tmax, Type III kerogen, Pressure seal, Deep overpressure, Thermal history, Pressure behaviour modelling, Overpressure generation, Northern Carnarvon Basin.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=11998</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing The Visiting Public's Perceptions Of The Outcomes Of Their Visit To Interactive Science And Technology Centres</field><field name="creator">Johnston, David</field><field name="description">This study investigated the problem of how to assess the visiting public's perceptions of the outcomes of their visit to an Interactive Science and Technology Centre. The study was carried out in several phases. First the researcher immersed himself as a participant observer over 15 months in the day-to-day activities of a science centre. Second, data to describe perceptions of visit outcomes were collected from one-to-one interviews with randomly selected visitors and professional staff, and four focus groups of explainers and visitors. Third, these data were used to structure the collection of further descriptions, in visitors' own words, about the visit experience. In the fourth and fifth stages, data from the second and third stages were pooled to develop two new instruments, the Perceptions of Visit Impact Instrument, a semantic differential survey designed to be administered at the point of exit from a science centre, and the Profile of Visit Outcomes Instrument, a nine part survey designed to be administered several weeks after the visit. The two instruments were refined through local review and field testing, and replication using data from large samples of randomly selected visitors at five and three centres, respectively, in Australia and New Zealand.

The study also investigated the validity of a widely-applicable classroom environment questionnaire, as well as associations between attitudes and classroom environment. The study involved a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods and was carried out in two phases. In the first phase of the study, data were collected using the Constructivist Learning Environment Survey (CLES), to assess learners' perceptions of the constructivist learning environment, and an attitude scale to assess learners' attitudes towards their mathematics classroom. The instruments were administered to 1864 learners in 34 intermediate (Grades 4 - 6) phase and senior phase (Grades 7 - 9) classes. Data were analysed to determine whether (a) the CLES is valid and reliable for use in South Africa and (b) relationships exist between learners' perceptions of the learning environment and their attitude toward their mathematics classes. Descriptive analysis was used to generate feedback information for teachers based on graphical profiles of learners' perceptions of the actual and preferred learning environment for each class. Analyses of data collected from 1864 learners in 34 classes supported the factor structure, internal consistency reliability (Cronbach alpha coefficient), and discriminant validity of the CLES, as well as its ability to differentiate between classes. The results suggest that researchers and teachers can be confident about using the modified version of the CLES in mathematics classes in South Africa in the future.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Limpopo Province, learning environment, post-apartheid education.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Energy efficient design in housing of small floor area : appropriateness in housing for the aged</field><field name="creator">Karol, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address energy efficient design in a temperate climate in typical small, medium density housing, particularly in housing for the aged. The connections between energy efficient design and small, medium density housing were identified as contemporary issues related to Australian Government policies in two disparate areas. One policy area is reflected in the Government's commitment to assist older people, whether they are active, early retirees or the frail elderly, wealthy or poor, to live in their chosen place of residence. Increasingly this chosen place of residence may be a small, medium density dwelling. The other policy area is that related to reducing energy consumption in buildings. This policy is reflected in recently proclaimed building regulations aimed at reducing space heating/cooling requirements in housing. The building regulations include details of acceptable construction practice for energy efficiency that may not be appropriate in small, medium density housing. It was proposed in this thesis that extensive use of space heating and cooling in housing for the aged was required because well-established benchmarks for energy efficient design in a temperate climate were not generally appropriate in small, medium density dwellings and were particularly inappropriate in housing for the aged. `Appropriate' in this context referred to: indoor temperatures being acceptable without the need for space heating and cooling; retaining the site planning and general form of typical, medium density aged persons housing developments in suburban Australia; cost effectiveness over the life of a building; and fitting the needs of physically and financially vulnerable older people.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">appropriateness criteria, older people, medium density housing, architecture, energy efficiency.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of power influence on the relationship between department store and its subtenants in China</field><field name="creator">Yip, Leslie Sai-chung</field><field name="description">The perspective that asymmetrical power relationship on vertical channel would lead to dominating partner exploitation with the use of coercive power is examined within the context of horizontal channel exchange relationship between department stores and tenant retailers. A power structure-action-outcome framework is offered to study casual links between dependence (structural aspects of power), use of coercive and noncoercive power (action), and three aspects of outcome - economic and social satisfaction, commitment and strategic performance. Data was collected through personal interview with 302 small, medium size retail tenants of department stores in PR China. Analysis of findings provided support to the model and the hypotheses. Results confirmed that dependence and use of power were only weakly related. The findings demonstrate the contextual influence of Chinese collectivistic culture on coercive power which involves the use of punishment or penalty. To further explore the relationship between dependence and power, investigation was carried out to examine if dependence moderates the effect of coercive power on economic satisfaction, with a positive result. On the other hand, use of non-coercive power showed positive results for economic and social satisfaction, which are positively related to commitment and strategic performance. It can be concluded that use of non-coercive power is strongly recommended for store-tenant relationship in the retail sector of China.

It is closely related to the pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes. CAP has been proposed for various digital subscriber loop (DSL) systems over unshielded twisted pairs of copper wires. In this thesis, our main focus is on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) performance of the ideal (i.e., infinite length) linear and non-linear (decision feedback) CAP receivers/equalisers in the presence of additive, coloured Gaussian noise, and/or data-like cross-talks. An in-depth analysis is given on the performance of both receiver structures. In the case of the linear receiver, one possible view of the overall CAP transceiver system which includes both data and cross-talk transmission paths is that it is a linear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Accordingly, the existing MMSE results for a general MIMO system are applicable also to CAP systems. However, up to date, this approach was shown to be unsuccessful in the sense that the derived MMSE expressions are too complex and offer little insights. In our analysis, in order to find a more incisive MMSE expression, we reconsider the problem of minimisation of the MSEs at slicers. By exploiting the Hilbert transform pair relationship between the impulse responses of the inphase and quadrature transmit shaping filters, we are able to obtain an elegant and more meaningful MMSE expression, as well as the corresponding transfer functions of the optimum linear receive filters. In the case of the nonlinear, or decision feedback equaliser (DFE), receiver, we start our analysis with the receiver structure of a generic multidimensional (&gt;/= 3) CAP-type system.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adaptive equalisers, MMSE performance, bandwidth efficiency, 2-D CAP transceiver system.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14683</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building close and long-lasting relationships with focal customers: an empirical study of seed potato purchasing by Filipino potato farmers</field><field name="creator">Batt, Peter J.</field><field name="description">In the highlands of the Northern Philippines, a model of long-term relationships between potato farmers and their preferred seed suppliers is proposed. In the absence of any certified seed system that might provide some guarantee of seed quality, farmers prefer to transact with those seed suppliers with whom they have had some favourable prior experience. Such suppliers provide both the best quality seed and, since most farmers must borrow the capital to purchase the seed, the most favourable terms of repayment. As there is much uncertainty in the exchange, the farmer's relationship with their preferred seed supplier is based on trust. However, since the farmer's satisfaction with the exchange cannot be ascertained until after purchase, trust is antecedent to satisfaction. As satisfaction is derived from the economic benefits the farmer obtains, satisfaction will lead to the farmer's desire to maintain the relationship. Satisfaction is enhanced both by the seed supplier's willingness to extend credit and to provide information. As there is much variation between alternative seed supplier's offer quality, satisfaction will result in the farmer becoming more dependent upon that seed supplier who makes the best offer. Furthermore, having provided the farmer with financial assistance, seed suppliers will find that they have constrained their opportunities to use coercive influence strategies, for in the absence of any formal contract, farmer's may readily default on the loan. The use of coercive influence strategies will reduce both the farmer's trust in their preferred seed supplier and the farmer's desire to maintain the relationship.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">buyer-seller relationship,  Northern Philippines,  seed suppliers, potato production.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some aspects of signal processing in heavy tailed noise</field><field name="creator">Brcic, Ramon Francis</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses some problems that arise in signal processing when the noise is impulsive and follows a heavy tailed distribution. After reviewing several of the more well known heavy- tailed distributions the common problem of which of these hest models the observations is considered. To this end, a test is proposed for the symmetric alpha stable distribution. The test threshold is found using both asymptotic theory and parametric bootstrap resampling. In doing so, some modifications are proposed for Koutrouvelis' estimator of the symmetric alpha stable distributions parameters that improve performance. In electrical systems impulsive noise is generated externally to the receiver while thermal Gaussian noise is generated internally by the receiver electronics, the resultant noise is an additive combination of these two independent sources. A characteristic function domain estimator for the parameters of the resultant distribution is developed for the case when the impulsive noise is modeled by a symmetric alpha stable distribution. Having concentrated on validation and parameter estimation for the noise model, some problems in signal detection and estimation are considered. Detection of the number of sources impinging on an array is an important first. step in many array processing problems for which the development of optimal methods can be complicated even in the Gaussian case. Here, a multiple hypothesis test for the equality of the eigenvalues of the sample array covariance is proposed.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">signal detection, stable distributions, impulsive noise, heavy tailed distributions.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher-student interactions and laboratory learning environments in biology classes in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Kijkosol, Duangsmorn</field><field name="description">The first purpose of the study described in this thesis was to provide validation information of three questionnaires that were modified and translated into the Thai language, namely, the Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction (QTI), the Science Laboratory Environment Inventory (SLEI), and the Attitude to Biology Class (ABC).

A sample of 1,194 students from 37 biology classes in 37 schools completed the three questionnaires. The results of the study showed that most students in secondary schools of Thailand have moderately positive attitudes to their biology class. Students perceived their teachers as having good leadership, being helping/friendly, and understanding, but seldom uncertain, dissatisfied or admonishing. They also perceived that sometimes their teachers were strict, however allowing students responsibility and freedom. In biology laboratories, they perceived the environments as employing good student cohesiveness, less open-endedness and integration of the theory and practical, the rules were not clear and the materials were not good and insufficient. There were differences between students' actual and ideal perceptions of classroom interactions and laboratory learning environments.

These selforganising, distributed networks of sensors, processors and actuators that are capable of movement have a broad range of potential applications, including military reconnaissance, surveillance, planetary exploration and geophysical mapping. In many of the foreseen applications a certain geometric pattern will be required for the task. Hence, algorithms for maintaining the geometric pattern of an MWSN are investigated. In many tasks such as land mine detection, a group of nodes arranged in a line must provide continuous coverage between each end of the formation. Thus, we present algorithms for maintaining the geometric pattern of a group of nodes arranged in a line. An MWSN may also need to form a geometric pattern without assistance from the user. In military reconnaissance, for example, the nodes will be dropped onto the battlefield from a plane and land at random positions. The nodes will be expected to arrange themselves into a predetermined formation in order to perform a specific task. Thus, we present algorithms for forming a circle and regular polygon from a given set of random positions. The algorithms are distributed and use no communication between the nodes to minimise energy consumption. Unlike past studies of geometric problems where algorithms are either tested in simulations where each node has global knowledge of all the other nodes or implemented on a small number of robots, the robustness of our algorithms has been studied with simulations that model the sensor system in detail.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MWSN, vision, mobile wireless sensor networks.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14191</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Painting a Portrait of Mathematics: A Case Study of Secondary Students' Assessment Portfolios</field><field name="creator">Brown, Paul David</field><field name="description">This study analyses the effect of introducing student portfolios as a means of assessing the learning of mathematics. It examines the intended and the unforeseen outcomes in terms of the students, the caregivers, and the teachers involved, using quantitative data to match classroom environments with the response to the innovation. A major focus of the qualitative aspect of the study is the decisionmaking process that was associated with the implementation of change. For this study, all the junior students in a New Zealand secondary school were asked to compile portfolios of their mathematical work. The portfolios were graded by the teachers, the marks contributing to the students' assessments for the year's work. At the outset, the plan was to survey the 510 students involved to determine their attitude towards mathematics, survey them again once the innovation was in place to quantify the classroom environment, then repeat the first survey. Analysis was expected to reveal whether classroom environments that approximated a "portfolio culture" (Duschl &amp; Gitomer, 1991) contributed to an improved attitude towards mathematics. This quantitative approach was supplemented with taped interviews of students and teachers, ongoing records of less formal interactions, review of examination marks and school reports, and questionnaires mailed to the homes of a sample of the students. As the study progressed, it emerged that the major impact was on the teachers, and the focus shifted to them. For four years, follow-up surveys were conducted with teachers, including those who had transferred to other schools.

If design is considered a driver in the development of environments that people encounter as part of their everyday activities, they may learn about design from those encounters. With a visual database of environments that include positive design examples, the population will benefit. Firstly, they have the capacity to use their informed encounters to contribute with some authority to discourse that shapes the future of their individual and collective surroundings. Secondly, they hold a greater expectation for design which can increase economic activity through design-related industry. Aim: The Australian post office (PostShop) was chosen as an example of an everyday environment that has the capacity to capture a large audience, due to an ever-increasing and proven catchment of the population-currently one in eighteen Australians will visit each day. To understand the role of design in the PostShop environment it is essential to understand the process through which the environment is developed, and those criteria that drive the final outcome. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the extent to which the key development drivers of the PostShop influence the inclusion of design as a driver. Background: To enable this investigation to take place within an established context, a review of background literature was undertaken. This included themes supporting design literacy; the history of the PostShop built environment; brand; fitout and landlord guidelines for the built environment; global postal models; organisational behaviour; the development process; and the role of design in improving economic growth.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Post Shop, development drivers, design and economic growth, visual encounter.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design attributes of educational computer software for optimising girls' participation in educational game playing</field><field name="creator">Rich, Warren Charles</field><field name="description">Recent research on girls in science education in Australian primary schools indicates a participation rate lower than that of boys. This inequality could lead subsequently to reduced opportunities for girls entering the workforce in their adult years. Many studies have attempted to reveal why this situation has arisen and a variety of strategies for increasing girls' participation has been suggested. A relatively new strategy that does not appear frequently in the research literature is the use of educational computer game software. An important question arises: does the game software used in primary school science education reflect design attributes favoured by boys and, if so, do these attributes actively discourage girls' participation by making them feel uncomfortable or stressed? My case study was designed to identify design features of computer games that girls prefer so that these features can be included in educational computer game software designed for science education, as well as the other Key Learning Areas. Through interviews, surveys and observations my interpretive study obtained the opinions and views of over 200 children in two suburban Australian primary schools in which I work as a teacher-librarian. In this role I purchase educational computer games and organize special classes for students to play them. From my analysis of the data I make recommendations that reflect girls' preferred design attributes for educational computer games. I also generate a checklist of criteria from my interpretations that may result in the purchase of software that could not only enhance girls' participation and success in primary school science, the curriculum area of greatest personal interest to me, but also in other Key Learning Areas of primary education.\</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sex-bias in software, girls and science education, human-computer interaction, science education computer software.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethnic and cultural influences on body composition, lifestyle and body image among males</field><field name="creator">Kagawa, Masaharu</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to determine ethnic and cultural influences on body composition, lifestyle, and aspects of body image (perception, acceptability, and satisfaction) of younger (age 18-40 years) Australian and Japanese males, the latter including groups living in Australia and Japan. The sample sizes of the three groups were 68 Japanese living in Australia, 84 Japanese living in Japan, and 72 Australian Caucasian males respectively. The methodology included body composition assessments (by anthropometry and DXA), lifestyle and body image questionnaires, and dietary records. The study found significant p&lt;0.05) ethnic differences in the %BF at given BMI levels and for Japanese the BMI values of 23.6kg/m2 and 28.6kg/m2 were found to be equivalent to 25 and 30 for Caucasians when used to classify individuals as "overweight" and "obese". Equations in common use for the calculation of body composition in Japanese males were evaluated using modern methods of body composition assessment and found to need considerable modification. New regression equations that represent BMI-%BF relationships for Japanese and Australians were proposed: Japanese: Log %BF = -1.330 + 1.896(log BMI), (R2 = 0.547, SEE = 0.09); Australians: Log %BF = -1.522 + 2.001(log BMI), (R2 = 0.544, SEE = 0.10). Equations were also developed to predict %BF for Japanese and Australian males from body composition assessments using anthropometry and DXA: Japanese: %BF = 0.376 + 0.402(abdominal) + 0.772(medial calf) + 0.217(age), (R2 = 0.786, SEE = 2.69); Australians: %BF = 2.184 + 0.392(medial calf) + 0.678(supraspinale) + 0.467(triceps), (R2 = 0.864, SEE = 2.37). Lifestyle factors were found to influence perceptions of body image.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese men, Body Mass Index (BMI), anthropometry.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16083</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of Soil Failure Mechanisms during Spudcan Foundation Installation</field><field name="creator">Hossain, Muhammad Shazzad</field><field name="description">Mobile jack-up rigs are widely used in offshore oil and gas exploration and increasingly in temporary production and maintenance work. There is a steadily increasing demand for their use in deeper water and harsher environments. A typical modem jack-up has three independent legs, each equipped with a footing known as &#8216;spudcan&#8217;. This thesis is concerned with the performance of spudcan foundation subjected to vertical loading correspondent to preloading during its installation into uniform clay. The chief aim of this study is to investigate the bearing behaviour with the corresponding soil failure mechanisms during spudcan penetration. Centrifuge model test and Finite Element (FE) analysis are carried out extensively. In centrifuge modelling, a half-spudcan model and a full spudcan model are used. In the half- spudcan model test, a novel system for revealing soil failure mechanisms and measuring soil deformation has been adopted, in which the half-spudcan model is placed against a transparent window and a subsequent Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) analysis is performed. The full-spudcan model test is conducted to measure the load-penetration response. In numerical simulation, both small strain and large deformation analyses are carried out with smooth and rough soil-spudcan interfaces considered. At the initial stage of penetration, it is observed that a cavity is formed above the spudcan as it is penetrating into a uniform clay. Meanwhile, soil flows towards the surface and thus soil heave forms close to the spudcan shoulders. With further penetration, the soil underneath the spudcan starts to flow back into the cavity on the exposed top of the spudcan. This backflow causes the spudcan to be embedded while the initially formed cavity remains open.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bearing capacity, cavity stability, soil flow mechanisms, uniform clay, preloading, jack-up rig, spudcan foundation.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Teaching Models and Chemical Representations in Developing Students' Mental Models of Chemical Phenomena</field><field name="creator">Chittleborough, Gail Diane</field><field name="description">Chemical representations play a vital part in the teaching and learning of chemistry. The aim of this research was to investigate students&#8217; understanding of chemical representations and to ascertain the influence of chemical representations on students&#8217; developing mental models of chemical phenomena. Three primary threads flowing through the thesis are models, representations and learning. Each thread was found to play a vital part in students&#8217; learning of chemical content, in their learning of the scientific process and in their learning about the process of learning itself. This research with students from Year 8 to first year university level comprised four studies that provide comparisons between ages, abilities, learning settings and teaching and learning approaches. Students&#8217; modelling ability was observed to develop and improve through instruction and practice and usually coincided with an improvement in their understanding of chemical concepts. While students were observed to actively use models to make predictions and test ideas, some were not aware of the predictive nature of models when asked about it. From the research, five characteristics of scientific models have been identified: scientific models as multiple representations, scientific models as exact replicas, scientific models as explanatory tools, how scientific models are used, and the dynamic nature of scientific models. A theoretical framework relating the four types of models - teaching, scientific, mental and expressed - and a typology of models that highlights the significant attributes of models, support the research results. The data showed that students&#8217; ability to describe the role of the scientific model in the process of science improved with their increasing age and maturity.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mental models, chemical phenomena, chemistry, chemical representations, teaching models.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinants of firm success: a resource-based analysis</field><field name="creator">Galbreath, Jeremy Thomas</field><field name="description">The resource-based view of the firm (RBV) is one the most important areas of research content to emerge in the field of strategic management in the last 15 years. The RBV is prescriptive. That is, the RBV prescribes that competitive advantage stems from those resources that are valuable, rare, inimitable, and nonsubstitutable (VRIN). With rare exception, resources that meet the VRIN criteria are widely purported to be intangible in nature. From a research perspective, the RBV stream tends to be dominated by conceptual discussions and advancements. However, empirical tests of the core premises, or the main prescription, of the theory are argued to be very limited in quantity. To add to the body of empirical research that seeks to verify the main prescription of the RBV, this research undertakes a new and different level of analysis, one that has not been previously tested. Given that firms compete with both tangible and intangible resources, the present study is interested in determining if, as the RBV implicitly prescribes, resources that are intangible in nature are more important determinants of firm success than tangible resources. Although the research question is basic and fundamental, it has rarely been appropriately or adequately tested within the RBV stream, as is demonstrated by this thesis. To carry out the research, this study offers a conceptual model of the firm&#8217;s resource pool that includes tangible assets (financial and physical assets), intangible assets (intellectual property assets, organizational assets, reputational assets), and capabilities. A series of hypotheses are posited to explore the proposition that intangible resources contribute more greatly to firm success, on the dimensions of sales turnover, market share, and profitability, than tangible resources.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hierarchical regression analysis, firm success, resource-based view of the firm, tangible resources, intangible resources, industry structure, discriminant analysis.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of shelter in cherax abidus and bidyanus bidyanus polyculture systems</field><field name="creator">Wangpen, Prayadt</field><field name="description">Research into the polyculture of finfish and crayfish has been conducted in Western Australia for over a decade now. This research was instigated out of a need to increase revenues from freshwater crayfish farmers wishing to diversify their income base with a view to increasing profitability and reducing risk. It has become clear that several key variables dictate how the polyculture system (i.e. polysystem) will perform. These include biological factors like: size of participating species, relative densities, gender, planktonic turbidity, natural feeds; and abiotic factors like: light intensity, clay turbidity, floating cages for segregation, water quality, and habitat/shelter complexity. Many of these factors can be controlled / adjusted by the manager of the polysystem to maximise performance, production and profitability.While much of the research to date has focussed on the marron (Cherax tenuimanus) industry, it is also important to realise that an understanding of these factors can also assist other crayfish polysystems, like integrated agri-aquaculture systems containing yabbies (Cherax albidus). Some of the factors that influence how the system will perform may become more prevalent, like suspended clay turbidity and the associated role of light intensity in species interactions, or shelter complexity and the resulting choice of shelter material. But overall, they are the same basic variables and we must understand how they affect the particular multi-species system that we are dealing with. There is a lot to be learned from the literature on how these variables affect multi-species aquatic environments in the wild. Perhaps aquaculturists have not considered this enough in the past. Some farmers seem to believe that these variables are different JUST because it is a culture system. This is not true.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aquatic ecosystems,   role of  shelter,   variables affecting aquatic environment,   habitat complexity, polyculture of  finfish  and  crayfish.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15622</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Change management: a grounded-theory case study of a large organisation's efforts to introduce a new system of personnel performance management</field><field name="creator">Heaven, Michael</field><field name="description">This is the report of a study into educational change. The purpose of the investigation was to observe and analyse an example of a system-wide policy change through an intensive and disciplined case study, in order to develop a theory about the implementation of a particular change process and use that theory to account for the way the observed change process proceeded. Although change and how it was achieved in a large, complex bureaucratic organisation was the primary focus for theory development and understanding, the role of the management personnel in the change process was also of interest. The introduction of performance management (in particular, promotion-by-merit within the Western Australian Ministry of Education) was the change example under consideration. In contrast to the traditional way-of-studying-educational change, the present study adopted a participant observation case study using a grounded theory approach (Glaser and Strauss, 1967), because of its use in a previous study (Heaven, 1987) and in addition, the literature review indicated a lack of grounded theory studies in this area. Grounded theory is not the only methodology which can generate theory grounded in the data. However,it does ensure that a well-connected and comprehensive theory will emerge and that the theory which does emerge will be clearly and demonstrably grounded in the data from which it derives. Seven major factors or categories were identified from this grounded theory study. These factors included values, antagonists, ethos, infrastructure, equivocation, communication and culture.

The main philosophy behind this study is to allow the remote user to conduct an Internet-based Remote Operation (I-bRO) for the dynamic system. The dynamic system has been defined as the system which has its parts interrelated in such a way that a change in one part necessarily affects other parts of the system [I]. In order to achieve this goal, the study has been conducted in a form of an on-line and real-time Virtual Laboratory (VL). Through this form of laboratory, a user can carry out the experiment, perform real-time monitoring and controlling operations of the experiment and collect real and live data from the experiment through the network link as the user was physically in the laboratory. The dynamic system that has been selected for the test-rig of this study is a 3-phase Induction Motor (IM) which is mechanically coupled with a DC-Dynamometer that acts as a variable load to the IM. This system is a common laboratory experiment in the study of the Electrical Engineering for both undergraduate and postgraduate students. The study covers both sides of the I-bRO; the hardware and the software. The hardware side includes the design and the development of a load control box that has been used to interface the DC-Dynamometer and consequently control it from the local computer. The software side covers the design and the development of the Virtual Instrumentation System (VIS) that has replaced successfully the physical Measurement and Test (M&amp;T) instruments of the test-rig. Beside that, the software side includes the development of the internet remote front panel for the remote operation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">system monitoring, instrumentation systems, virtual instruments.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fiscal adjustment policies and fiscal deficit: the case of Tanzania</field><field name="creator">Kihaule, Arnold Mathias</field><field name="description">In Tanzania, fiscal adjustment policies emphasized an increase in tax revenue and cuts in public spending to correct the fiscal deficit. However, adjustment policies restricted the impact of fiscal policies in correcting fiscal deficit because they led to a low GDP growth and narrowed the tax base. The government overlooked the need to have an alternative tax base that could compensate for the fall in GDP growth. In that respect, the main purpose of this study is to examine the impact of fiscal adjustment policies in correcting the fiscal deficit in Tanzania in different adjustment periods in the 1973-2000 period. The thesis adopts a country study approach to analyse the effect of changes in the tax structure on the fiscal position using the primary balance as a proxy. The study also uses time series econometric methods to examine the impact of economic policy regime changes on public spending and GDP growth and the implications for fiscal policy in Tanzania. The study finds that changes in macroeconomic conditions either temporarily expanded or narrowed the tax bases and influenced the correction of the fiscal deficit in different years. Fiscal adjustment policies were pro-cyclical, thus leading to low GDP growth. This limited the effect of changes in the tax structure in reducing the fiscal deficit. Lastly, policy regime changes led to public spending instability and a structural break in the GDP data series. This signified that economic policy reforms caused fundamental changes in the economy, with implications for macroeconomic and fiscal policies in Tanzania. In sum, the results suggest that pro-cyclical policies are harmful for countries pursuing fiscal adjustment policies to correct a fiscal deficit.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fiscal revenue and public spending in Tanzania, Tanzanian economy, economic policy change.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16585</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Students' and teachers' perceptions of effective teaching and learning in the middle level science classroom: the effects on student achievement</field><field name="creator">NeSmith, Richard A.</field><field name="description">The major purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between teacherstudent interpersonal behaviour in the middle level of schooling with the students' academic achievement in science as determined by the term grade (typically issued after a six or nine week grading period). The study also provided validation data for the Questionnaire on Teacher Interactions (QTI) survey instrument with a large American sample of students and teachers drawn from randomly selected the State of Ohio schools. The QTI was designed to elicit students' and teachers' perspectives of effective teaching and learning in classrooms. Numerous studies, here and abroad, during the last five years and have caused awareness that students' perceptions of their school experience are a significant influence on how and what students learn in the classroom. Few studies have been conducted on the topic of student perceptions in comparison to their respective teachers' perceptions in science or how this variance might influence student achievement. The focus of the present study was to compare the perceptions of students and their teachers regarding effective teaching and learning, while concurrently noting students' achievement in science. This study presumed that there was a definite disparity between what teachers perceive to be effective teaching and learning in comparison to what students perceive. The intention of the study was to identify some of the factors associated with any disparity. The hypothesis for the study, simply stated, was that student achievement, according to student's accumulative grade, would reflect a variance in perception with that of their science teacher.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">perceptions on learning, perceptions on learning environment, Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction (QTI).</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the relationship between information systems investment and organisational performance: developing and testing a conceptual model in the Australian financial services sector</field><field name="creator">Maimbo, Hilangwa</field><field name="description">The research reported in this thesis was an exploratory study that investigated the relationship between Information Systems (IS) investment and organisational performance and which led to the successfd development and testing of a combined process and variance model that sought to explain this complex relationship. The focal industry was the Australian Financial Services Sector (FSS), with samples being drawn from both the credit union industry (largest industry by size in the FSS) and the commercial/retail bank industry (largest industry by volume). The research began with a detailed review of the literature and thus explored the concepts underlying the business value of IS in general and the relationship between IS investment and organisational performance in particular. To fuaher enhance understanding of this literature, a meta-analysis of the business value of IS in general, and IS investment and organisational performance in particular, was undertaken as it was noted that there did not appear to have been any such formal structured meta-analyses to date. The foregoing analyses led to the proposal and development of a conceptual model of the relationship between IS investment and organisational performance that was comprised of four main components, the level of IS investment as represented by the IT portfolio, Organisational performance (both internal and external), Considerations for Strategic Information Systems Planning and Managerial effectiveness. In addition, the conceptual model explicitly considered the effect and impact of Context on the conceptual model.

The study was designed to reveal and address the implications for teachers of primary mathematics, of moving from test-based assessment to a base built upon a balanced blend of norm-referenced and criteria-based assessments. In developing embedded authentic assessment through a process portfolio model, the teachers looked to change from the assessment of learning to assessment for learning. Consequently, through the efforts of the teachers involved, their students and those students&#8217; parents, the study traced a substantial pedagogical restructure. Based on an interpretative methodology, this study of significant assessment restructure used mainly qualitative approaches to data collection and analysis, supplemented by limited quantitative data. Interviews, participant observer interactions, surveys and joint teacher discussion and planning sessions were effective in mapping the change. Through frequent interaction, participating teachers shared their emerging understandings, along with difficulties and successes in the evolution and implementation of an effective, flexible process portfolio. From the beginning of the evolution, teachers working together to bring about improvements that would lead to students perceiving mathematics as meaningful, engendered a strong feeling of excitement, curiosity and &#8216;team&#8217;. As the change progressed the team identified and met a range of challenges, not the least of which was gaining an understanding of the nature and function of a process portfolio strategy as against the product portfolio which was in use at that time in the study school.

International education is a significant endeavour in Australia in terms of any measure (students, dollars, associated employment). Over the last two decades it has grown in scope, beyond international fee-paying students, so that it now crosses all sectors of education and training (schools, vocational education and training, and higher education). Australian institutions have expanded their enrolment offshore and engaged in a variety of joint venture activities to capitalise on this surge of interest. The study examined international fee-paying students and career pathways shortly after the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) conducted two major studies in 2004 into career education and transnational education amongst member countries. The links between course and career intentions were investigated by focusing on the subject fields of Science and Engineering. The term career pathway is used as a metaphor to describe the way students move through the Australian education and training system, with such movements possibly occurring through sequential levels or by sectors. A literature review was conducted initially, and a mixed research methodology (involving both quantitative and qualitative approaches) was adopted for the study. A survey instrument was used with a sample of 110 international fee-paying students drawn from students studying Science and/or Engineering at nine institutions across sectors of Australian education and training, then a further sample of 22 students was interviewed in order to gain an understanding of the underlying reasons for students making the decisions, in relation to courses and careers that they do.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science and engineering, Australian education and training system, career pathway, international fee-paying students.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An assessment of the nutrient stripping function of two constructed wetlands in the Swan-Canning Estuary</field><field name="creator">Majimbi, Abbey Aggrey</field><field name="description">The use of constructed wetlands and wet detention basins has proven to be highly effective in removing pollutants from industrial discharges and stormwater runoff throughout the world. This is attributed to design of the key treatment components in a constructed wetland, catchment source characteristics and climatic conditions. A disproportionate amount of research and monitoring effort has gone into constructed wetlands due to their cost effectiveness and ability to optimize multiple benefits. In Western Australia, several wetland monitoring studies on the role of constructed wetlands especially in Swan-Canning estuary have been done, but often do not address their design efficiencies in stormwater treatment. Two wetlands (Liege St and Tom Bateman wetland) constructed for nutrient stripping proximal to the Swan-Canning estuary have been monitored for two years. Liege St wetland was constructed to reduce the nutrients reaching the Canning River directly and improve the amenity value of the area. Similarly, Tom Bateman wetland was constructed to reduce nutrients of the Banister Creek catchment draining into the Canning River as well as for stormwater management and habitat use. Physicochemical and biological indicators were used to assess the nutrient stripping efficiency of the wetlands. In some cases, data from previous studies were used to determine the health and viability of the selected wetland sites. The limnological indicators used included; dissolved oxygen, pH, water temperature, electrical conductivity and nutrient levels. The biological included; bacteria, nutrients and chlorophyll in periphyton, macroinvertebrates and diatoms.

Feasibility of constructing a diversion channel at upstream of Murray River to attenuate the flood level from 1 in 100 year ARI to 1 in 50 year ARI, was investigated by Kiong (2003). The Murray River Water Surface Profile along three kilometres south of Greenlands Road was modelled. Flood damages on each flood occurrence were assessed and Average Annual Damage (AAD) was calculated. The AAD is used to estimate the monetary benefit against the construction cost of the diversion channel. Groundwater along Greenlands and Fauntleroy Drains was also modelled to determine the viable depth of the designed channel, as well as the analysis of backwater. The proposed channel is designed at different scenarios (invert level at breakout point, culvert or causeway design, and diversion channel variations). The benefit cost ratio of the proposed diversion channel is calculated.

In the evaluation process for selecting a potential target saline formation for the disposal of carbon dioxide, flow characterisation of the disposed plume should be undertaken by reservoir simulation of the target formation. The movement of injected carbon dioxide in the saline formation is influenced by many factors including the physics of carbon dioxide at deep formation depths and pressure, physical interactions with formation rock and pore water and variations in the rock flow pathways through changes in formation heterogeneity. This thesis investigates the roles of physical interactions on the disposal of carbon dioxide and the ability to contain the injected gas through evaluation of trapping mechanisms such as dissolution of CO2 in formation water and residual gas trapping through the process of gas-water relative permeability hysteresis. Variable formation heterogeneity is evaluated for its impact on the migration of injected CO2 plume movement and the role of formation heterogeneity in impeding or accelerating the immobilisation of injected carbon dioxide. Multiple reservoir simulation studies were conducted to evaluate, initially, the role of different trapping mechanisms in immobilising the movement of injected carbon dioxide and subsequently, the role of variations in formation rock in the migration and trapping of and injected plume of carbon dioxide. The major simulation study shows that the selection process for identifying appropriate saline formations should not only consider their size and permeability but should also consider their degree of heterogeneity endemic to the formation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">carbon dioxide (CO2), saline formation, greenhouse gas emissions, atmospheric venting, physical interactions, variable formation heterogeneity, reservoir simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On conditional random fields: applications, feature selection, parameter estimation and hierarchical modelling</field><field name="creator">Tran, The Truyen</field><field name="description">There has been a growing interest in stochastic modelling and learning with complex data, whose elements are structured and interdependent. One of the most successful methods to model data dependencies is graphical models, which is a combination of graph theory and probability theory. This thesis focuses on a special type of graphical models known as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001), in which the output state spaces, when conditioned on some observational input data, are represented by undirected graphical models. The contributions of thesis involve both (a) broadening the current applicability of CRFs in the real world and (b) deepening the understanding of theoretical aspects of CRFs. On the application side, we empirically investigate the applications of CRFs in two real world settings. The first application is on a novel domain of Vietnamese accent restoration, in which we need to restore accents of an accent-less Vietnamese sentence. Experiments on half a million sentences of news articles show that the CRF-based approach is highly accurate. In the second application, we develop a new CRF-based movie recommendation system called Preference Network (PN). The PN jointly integrates various sources of domain knowledge into a large and densely connected Markov network. We obtained competitive results against well-established methods in the recommendation field.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stochastic modelling, complex data, graphical models, graph and probability theory, Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Vietnamese accent restoration, Markov network</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Service distribution and service discovery through a public web services platform</field><field name="creator">Wu, Chen</field><field name="description">Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) represents an emerging architectural approach that is able to tackle challenges in the contemporary service-based economy, in which the global market revenues are shifting from the manufacture of traditional off-the-shelf products to the provision of diversified services that suffice for customers&#8217; needs. In such a service-based economy, one can envisage an entirely &#8220;service-oriented&#8221; world, where a massive number of distributed services with different natures and capabilities are provided by various professionals around the world. Problems arise when business applications demand desirable services through different sources and providers that are appropriate for their own benefits and preferences. Therefore, it can be very challenging to design an SOA infrastructure that enables users to exploit this great level of service heterogeneity and quantity. One of the key issues in service-oriented architecture is to achieve efficient service discovery and loosely-coupled service distribution while maintaining a satisfactory degree of scalability, usability, and Web consistency. This thesis deals with SOA  infrastructure-level design and implementation issues. It approaches this SOA infrastructure within the scope of Web services, which capture an important, and perhaps the best, &#8216;realisation&#8217; of SOA. It investigates and formulates how public Web services distributed across the World Wide Web can be augmented by a software platform that enables scalable, user-centred,semantic-enabled, and integration-oriented service retrieval, selection, and matching. The primary goal of this thesis is thus to propose a conceptual framework of an enhanced SOA infrastructure with regard to service distribution and discovery.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">service-oriented architecture (SOA), contemporary service-based economy, global market revenues, public Web services</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corrosion of rock reinforcement in underground excavations</field><field name="creator">Hassell, Rhett Colin</field><field name="description">The effect of corrosion on the performance of rock support and reinforcement in Australian underground mines has not been widely researched and is generally not well understood. This is despite the number of safety concerns and operational difficulties created by corrosion in reducing the capacity and life expectancy of ground support. This thesis aims to investigate corrosion and relate how the environmental conditions in Australian underground hard rock mines impact on the service life of rock support and primarily rock reinforcement. Environmental characterisation of underground environments was completed at a number of mine sites located across Australia. This provided an improved understanding of the environmental conditions in Australian underground hard rock mines. Long-term testing on the impact of corrosion on the load bearing capacity of reinforcement and support under controlled experimental conditions was conducted in simulated underground environments. Rock reinforcement elements were examined in-situ by means of overcoring of the installed reinforcement and surrounding rock mass. Laboratory testing of the core determined changes in load transfer properties due to corrosion damage. These investigations provided an excellent understanding of the corrosion processes and mechanisms at work. Corrosion rates for a range of underground environments were established through the direct exposure and evaluation of metallic coupons in underground in-situ and simulated environments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian underground mines, corrosion, rock support and reinforcement, environmental conditions, hard rock mines</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17986</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of elementary school science kits in terms of classroom environment and student attitudes</field><field name="creator">Scott, Linda F</field><field name="description">The purpose of this evaluation study was to compare students' perceptions of their science classroom environment when using science kits, textbooks or a combination of science kits, textbooks and teacher-created materials. This year-long study involved using a learning environment questionnaire, namely the My Class Inventory (MCI), interviews and observations to assess which of the three treatments leads to a more positive learning environment. Three questions investigated were whether (1) the learning environment can be reliably and validly assessed among Grade 3-5 students in Texas, (2) instruction using textbooks, science kits, or a combination of textbooks and science kits is more effective in terms of changes in student attitudes and learning environment perceptions, and (3) there are associations between student attitudes toward science classes and the classroom environment? Administrators and teachers in Texas are searching for ways to improve the scores received on standardized tests. For more than 40 years, research has shown that positive classroom environments can lead to improvement in achievement. Therefore 1 chose to investigate the above questions using a learning environments framework. This study was conducted in three urban elementary schools in North Texas. There were a total of 588 students in 28 classrooms with 16 different teachers involved in this research. The schools were similar in demographic features such as ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Analyses of data collected with the My Class Inventory (MCI) supported the instrument's factorial validity, internal consistency reliability, and ability to differentiate between the perceptions of students in different classrooms.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">students' perceptions, science classroom environment, science kits, textbooks and teacher-created materials, My Class Inventory (MCI)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17977</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking by Australian women: changes with pregnancy and lactation</field><field name="creator">Giglia, Roslyn Carmel</field><field name="description">The consumption of alcohol and smoking of cigarettes are both common practices in Australian society. With continued public health efforts exposure to both alcohol and nicotine during pregnancy has diminished, however little is known about exposure to these toxins in the postnatal period and the effect on the breastfed infant. To investigate the pattern of alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking in the postnatal period and the effect on breastfeeding outcomes, a longitudinal study was conducted in two public hospitals with maternity wards in Perth, Australia. Data for the Perth Infant Feeding Study (PIFSII) were collected from 587 mothers between mid-September 2002 and mid-July 2003. While in hospital participating mothers completed a self-administered baseline questionnaire. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted at 4, 10, 16, 22, 32, 40 and 52 weeks. Data collected included sociodemographic, biomedical, hospital related and psychosocial factors. Further analysis of alcohol data was undertaken on the 1995 and 2001 National Health Survey (NHS) data sets to provide a national perspective. Alcohol and smoking related data were analysed and described using frequency distributions, means and medians. Univariate logistic regression was used to screen for potentially significant variables for subsequent incorporation in the multivariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to determine the effect of alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking on breastfeeding outcomes prenatally, antenatally and postnatally, after adjusting for factors identified in the literature as being associated with breastfeeding initiation and duration. The relationship between smoking status and breastfeeding duration was determined using survival analysis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, pregnancy, postnatal period of pregnancy, breastfed infants, breastfeeding, Australian women</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of planar inverted-F antennas in a dielectric enclosure</field><field name="creator">He, Jianwei</field><field name="description">Demand for small and low-profile antennas has greatly increased due to the desire for miniaturisation of modern-day mobile radio electronic terminals. Such an antenna is often integrated into the dielectric casing of a terminal, or independently enclosed within a dielectric radome to provide a protection from operating environments and keep the system more compact. However, the dielectric casing or radome may interact strongly with the antenna and result in losses in performance. The primary focus of this dissertation is to investigate and enhance the performance of Planar Inverted-F Antennas (PIFAs) when enclosed in dielectric casings or radomes for applications in mobile radio communications. PIFAs have attracted much interest due to their small volume, low profile structures and electrical characteristics compatible with existing specifications, making it a promising candidate for mobile radio applications. Therefore, the design of a single band PIFA on a finite ground plane, operating in the 900 MHz band is first presented. It is found that the effect of the finite ground plane must be considered to achieve an optimum performance of the PIFA. Then the performance of this antenna in the presence of a dielectric cover layer is investigated and evaluated in terms of resonant frequency, bandwidth and efficiency. In this study, the dielectric layer represents the dielectric casing of a device where the antenna is much closer to the top part of the casing than to the other side parts whose effect can then be ignored. Computer simulations of performance are based on the Method of Moments (MOM) and have been validated by measurements. This study shows that a dielectric cover layer will strongly interact with the antenna with the result that the antenna performance may move outside the design specifications.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differences in student perceptions of teacher-student interpersonal behaviour in regional streamed secondary mathematics and science classes</field><field name="creator">Hedderwick, Helen</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to examine teacher and students' perceptions of teacher-student interpersonal behaviour in regional secondary classrooms.

This study utilised the Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction (QTI) to collect data about the classroom learning environment of Australian regional mathematics and science classrooms. Qualitative information in the form of classroom observations and informal interviews has also been collected from a small subset of the student sample. This qualitative information was collected by the researcher in the dual roles of teacher and researcher. Triangulation of the methods of data collection sought to better validate the data collected, and assess multiple perspectives in the classroom. The study has involved a large sample of students from one country high school in Western Australia.

T.</field><field name="description">Modeling patterns in temporal data has arisen as an important problem in engineering and science. This has led to the popularity of several dynamic models, in particular the renowned hidden Markov model (HMM) [Rabiner, 1989]. Despite its widespread success in many cases, the standard HMM often fails to model more complex data whose elements are correlated hierarchically or over a long period. Such problems are, however, frequently encountered in practice. Existing efforts to overcome this weakness often address either one of these two aspects separately, mainly due to computational intractability. Motivated by this modeling challenge in many real world problems, in particular, for video surveillance and segmentation, this thesis aims to develop tractable probabilistic models that can jointly model duration and hierarchical information in a unified framework. We believe that jointly exploiting statistical strength from both properties will lead to more accurate and robust models for the needed task. To tackle the modeling aspect, we base our work on an intersection between dynamic graphical models and statistics of lifetime modeling. Realizing that the key bottleneck found in the existing works lies in the choice of the distribution for a state, we have successfully integrated the discrete Coxian distribution [Cox, 1955], a special class of phase-type distributions, into the HMM to form a novel and powerful stochastic model termed as the Coxian Hidden Semi-Markov Model (CxHSMM). We show that this model can still be expressed as a dynamic Bayesian network, and inference and learning can be derived analytically.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">modeling patterns, temporal data, complex data, hidden Markov model (HMM), duration and hierarchical information, unified framework</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal as a protein source for growing-finishing pigs</field><field name="creator">Zakayo, Griffin A.</field><field name="description">A study was conducted to evaluate the use of Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal (LLM) as a protein supplement for pigs. In addition, an evaluation of detoxifying LLM, by sun-drying, water-soaking, or treating with ferrous sulphate (FeS04) solution was undertaken. The research involved two experiments; a growth study and a metabolic study. In the growth study sixteen, 12 weeks old Large White x Landrace pigs (average body weight 22.9 &#177; 2.12 kg) were fed four experimental rations; a commercial grain-based grower /finisher ration (control); or a ration containing 20% of either sun-dried LLM, water-soaked LLM, or FeS04-treated LLM, replacing the basal diet. There was a significant (P&lt;0.05) decrease in liveweight gain, feed intake and feed conversion efficiency in pigs fed the ration containing sun-dried LLM. Growth rate, feed intake and feed conversion efficiency were not affected by the addition of water-soaked and FeS04-treated LLM to the basal diet. Triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels in the blood plasma were not affected by the dietary treatments. However, addition of FeS04-treated LLM to the basal diet significantly (P&lt;0.05) decreased the back fat thickness of the pigs.

In the postsurgical environment, the nurse has a pivotal role in assessing the patient with pain, implementing both doctor and nurseinitiated pain interventions and evaluating the patient's response to pain control treatments. Apart from its humanitarian utility, effective relief of postoperative pain is a critical element of a patient's postoperative recovery. Failure to manage pain effectively in the immediate postoperative period can produce undesirable immediate and longterm physical and psychological consequences that can severely disrupt an individual's quality of life. Despite the availability of multidimensional assessment measures, sophisticated pharmacological therapies and a greater range of complementary pain therapies, postoperative pain remains treated ineffectively by those professionally responsible for its management. In particular, evidence indicates that nurses are poor managers of their patients' postoperative pain. This thesis reports research that was conducted in two stages to explore, describe and analyse how nurses managed their patients' postoperative pain and their perceptions of factors that influenced this practice. A predominantly descriptive design was utilised in Stage 1 of the study to collect data from patients' hospital records and with a demographic questionnaire administered to nurses. This was complemented with interview data from nurses in Stage 2.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Postoperative pain management.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phenology and Growth of the Grasstree Xanthorrhoea preissii in Relation to Fire and Season</field><field name="creator">Korczynskyj, Dylan</field><field name="description">Australian grasstrees are a long-lived group of arborescent, monocotyledonous plants that persist in fire-prone landscapes. Renowned for their capacity to survive fire, and flower soon after, these species have long attracted the attention of biologists. A southwestern Australian species, Xanthorrhoea preissii, has been the subject of several recent studies, including use and verification of the "leafbase banding technique" that prompted my study. This technique, which is used to determine the age and fire history of grasstrees, correlates alternating brown- and cream-coloured, transverse bands along the stem of grasstrees with seasonal growth, and intermittent black bands with the burning of the plant. Combined, this information provides a chronology for the fire events. Fundamental to this interpretation is the assumption that grasstrees grow continually, and this growth varies annually in accordance with changes between the two contrasting seasons of its mediterranean climate. I studied X. preissii in two habitats (jarrah forest and banksia woodland) adjacent to the Perth metropolitan area, in southwestern Australia, focussing on leaf growth and phenology in relation to four factors important to the species lifecycle; climate, fire, reproduction and herbivory. Leaf production monitored for grasstrees in both habitats revealed continuous growth, oscillating between maximum rates (2.5-3.2 leaves/d) from late-spring (November) to autumn (April/May), to a minimum rate of as low as 0.5 leaf/d during winter. In additional support of the "leafbase banding technique", annual leaf production was not different from the number of leafbases comprising one cream and one brown band.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Xanthorrhoea preissii, resprout, fire, grasstree.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13149</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Interpretive Inquiry Into Middle School Curriculum</field><field name="creator">Guiver, Gary Thomas</field><field name="description">This thesis is an interpretive inquiry which focuses on the curricular elements of a middle school program. The research project is based on the data collected from two specific classes and from five particular teachers, during the implementation phase of a middle school program. The research makes use of multiple methodologies including an empirical study, narrative accounts by teachers and students, interviews, autobiographical and biographical material, and notes from a personal journal. It was intended that the thesis create a detailed, multi-dimensional, image of the school curriculum. Common threads evident in the data obtained from the teachers indicated that there was an element of uncertainty regarding expectations for the middle school program, a perception that there was conflict over resources, a belief that disputes about curriculum `ownership' had impacted negatively on the program, and a degree of disappointment that the program's potential had not been fulfilled. Despite these constraints, all the teachers noted high levels of professional satisfaction and a sense of collegiality within the middle school team. The students did not express any particular preferences regarding curriculum content, but were principally concerned about the social environment within their own homegroup class and within the wider school community. A significant proportion of the students sampled commented positively on the relationships that they had developed with their peers and teachers. The findings appear to indicate that, provided that the class work is of some relevance and interest, young adolescent students are more concerned about who their teacher might be, rather than what they might actually teach.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Time Transfixed, surrealism, middle school, carricular elements.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced satellite radar interferometry for small-scale surface deformation detection</field><field name="creator">Baran, Ireneusz</field><field name="description">Synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) is a technique that enables generation of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and detection of surface motion at the centimetre level using radar signals transmitted from a satellite or an aeroplane. Deformation observations can be performed due to the fact that surface motion, caused by natural and human activities, generates a local phase shift in the resultant interferogram. The magnitude of surface deformation can be estimated directly as a fraction of the wavelength of the transmitted signal. Moreover, differential InSAR (DInSAR) eliminates the phase signal caused by relief to yield a differential interferogram in which the signature of surface deformation can be seen. Although InSAR applications are well established, the improvement of the interferometry technique and the quality of its products is highly desirable to further enhance its capabilities. The application of InSAR encounters problems due to noise in the interferometric phase measurement, caused by a number of decorrelation factors. In addition, the interferogram contains biases owing to satellite orbit errors and atmospheric heterogeneity These factors dramatically reduce the stlectiveness of radar interferometry in many applications, and, in particular, compromise detection and analysis of small-scale spatial deformations. The research presented in this thesis aim to apply radar interferometry processing to detect small-scale surface deformations, improve the quality of the interferometry products, determine the minimum and maximum detectable deformation gradient and enhance the analysis of the interferometric phase image. The quality of DEM and displacement maps can be improved by various methods at different processing levels. One of the methods is filtering of the interferometric phase.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">radar interferometry, remote sensing, InSAR.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Why and how does gender wage inequality persist?: perceptions of stakeholders in the Australian industrial relations system</field><field name="creator">Short, Christine</field><field name="description">This thesis explores how and why gender wage inequality persisted in Australia during the period 1990 to 2003. A review of the wage data indicated that Australian inequality persisted during this period and even increased in Western Australia. An analysis of the literature and published tribunal decisions showed that the focus of action relating to gender wage equality was on the formal industrial relations system, through legislation and tribunal decisions. As the literature also indicated that these measures had failed to assist many female-dominated occupations, it was felt useful to examine the views of key stakeholders in the formal industrial relations system. Given the mainly quantitative and aggregate data analysis of previous empirical literature and the theoretical literature&#8217;s growing focus on less quantifiable social factors, it was felt that qualitative research would add to the analysis of gender wage determination. This thesis uses in-depth interviews with stakeholders in the federal and Western Australian industrial relations systems to examine the period 1990 to 2003.

Three heating configurations: one uniform wall temperature (CS1) and two linearly varying wall temperature cases (CS2 and CS3) are analysed. The study considers the combined effects of natural convection, forced convection and radiation heat transfer on the overall heat transfer characteristics. Air, which is assumed to be a non-participating medium, is chosen as the working fluid. A computational fluid dynamics solver is used to solve a set of governing equations for a range of parameters.For chosen duct aspect ratios, the numerical model simulates the flow and heat transfer for two main effects: buoyancy and radiation heat transfer. Buoyancy effect is represented by Grashof number, which is varied from 2,000 to 1,000,000. The effect of radiation heat transfer is examined by choosing different wall surface emissivity values. The weak and strong radiation effect is represented by the emissivity values of 0.05 and 0.85 respectively. Three duct aspect ratios are considered - 0.5, 1 and 2. The heat transfer characteristics of all the above heating configurations - CS1, CS2, and CS3 are analysed and compared. The numerical results show that, for all heating configurations and duct aspect ratios, the overall heat transfer rate is enhanced when the buoyancy effect increases. Since buoyancy effect induces natural circulation, this circulation is therefore the main mechanism that enhances heat transfer. Radiation heat transfer is found to significantly influence convection heat transfer in high Grashof numbers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">heat transfer rate, buoyancy, radiation heat transfer, convection heat transfer.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cooperative teamwork for quality customer service in the Hong Kong shiprepair yards environment</field><field name="creator">Ng, Peter Yip-Chuen</field><field name="description">During the turbulent times facing contemporary organisations, managers and employees need a precise understanding of the nature of team dynamics that develops quality service to customers. Extensive literature searches reveal few research studies focused on the nature of teamwork, which develops value to customers. The purpose of this study is to examine the value of teamwork for providing quality service within the Hong Kong shiprepair industry, outline the insight gleaned and recommend future research. This study aims to link empirically the Western developed Deutsch's (1949a, 19496, 1973, 1980, 1985, 1990) Theory of Cooperation and Competition with the innovation of teamwork and to assist in understanding the variance in the performance of these teams. Literature suggests that the relationships and interaction within the work teams can very much impact the overall performance of these work teams. The extent that these work teams are able to develop cooperative goals can promote productive and constructive communication and problem solving (constructive controversy) in their interactions. A constructive interaction leads to team members' perception of high team confidence. With trust, strong work relationship, team morale and perceived confidence, team effectiveness is enhanced on quality customer service (Alper, Tjosvold and Law, 1998; Tjosvold, Hui and Law, 1998; Tjosvold, Moy and Sasaki, 1996, 1999; Wong et al., 1999). The research also tests the extent of impact of traditional Chinese values of power distance and collectivism as contributing to cooperative goals and encourages an openminded discussion of opposing views (constructive controversy). It proposes that by adopting cooperative goals, shiprepair yard management in Hong Kong may meet the twin challenges of involving employees fully into the organisation and providing quality service to customers.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ship repair and maintenance, boatyards, shipyards, dockyards.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Techniques for improved 2-D Kirchhoff prestack depth imaging</field><field name="creator">Manuel, Christopher D.</field><field name="description">The goal of oil and gas exploration using seismic methods is to accurately locate geological structures that could host such reserves. As the search for these resources tends towards more complex regions, it is necessary to develop methods to extract as much information as possible from the seismic data acquired. Prestack depth imaging is a seismic processing technique that has the capability to produce a realistic depth image of geological structures in complex situations. However, improvements to this technique are required to increase the accuracy of the final depth image and ensure that the targets are accurately located. Although prestack depth imaging possesses the ability to produce a depth image of the Earth, it does have its disadvantages. Three problematic areas in depth imaging are: the computer run times (and hence costs) are excessively high; the success of depth migration is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the interval velocity model; and seismic multiples often obscure the primary reflection events representative of the subsurface geology. Velocity model building accounts for most of the effort in prestack depth imaging and is also responsible for the likelihood of success. However, the more effort that is expended on this process, the greater the cost of producing the required depth section. In addition, multiples remain a problem in complex depth imaging since many attenuation techniques are based assumptions that may only be approximately correct and in addition require a priori information. The Kirchhoff method is considered to be the workhorse in industry for prestack depth imaging. It is a simple and flexible technique to implement, and usually produces acceptable images at a small fraction of the cost of the other depth migration methods.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">prestack depth imaging, seismic interpretation, oil and gas exploration.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protecting children in a multicultural society: an Australian story</field><field name="creator">Farate, Eduardo J.</field><field name="description">This thesis is based on a research study examining the extent to which cultural background and cultural factors are taken into account by Child Protection Workers investigating allegations of child maltreatment due to inappropriate or excessive punishment.

The research work reported herein was conducted to obtain complete information regarding moment redistribution of beams and one-way slabs using 500 MPa steel reinforcement.A computer based iterative numerical method was developed to analyse reinforced two-span continuous concrete beams and one-way slabs. The method takes into account the material and geometrical non-linearities in the calculations. The deflected shape of the beam and one-way slab was calculated by dividing the span length into a number of rigid segments. The program also calculates the failure load and extent of moment redistribution. The analytical method was verified against the test results reported in the literature. The analytical results for load-deflection graphs and moment redistribution showed a good agreement with the test results.A parametric study was conducted using analytical method. The results of this study showed that moment redistribution depends not only on the neutral axis parameter (Ku) but also on the ratio of neutral axis parameter (Ku-/Ku+), ultimate steel strain (&#170;su) and concrete compressive strength (fc).</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">steel reinforcement, ductility, reinforced concrete, moment redistribution.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dynamic investigation into the predictability of Australian industry stock returns</field><field name="creator">Yao, Juan</field><field name="description">This thesis involved an empirical investigation of the predictability of Australian industrial stock returns using a dynamic state-space framework. The systematic risks of industrial portfolios were examined in a stochastic market- model. The systematic risks of industry portfolios are found to be stochastic processes. Most of the industry groups have time-varying systematic risks that are mean-reverting to their stable or moving long-term mean. However, the investment and financial services, alcohol and tobacco, gold, insurance and media industry groups have rather random systematic risks. The time-varying market model provides a better explanation of the portfolio returns than the single-index model since it captures the stochastic properties of market risk. Further, a Bayesian dynamic-forecasting model was employed to examine the explanatory power of a set of economic and financial variables. The unanticipated components of the term-structure variable, the interest-rate variable and the aggregate-dividend-yield variable were shown to be significant in explaining the industry portfolio excess returns. The comparison between multivariate analysis and univariate analysis strongly indicates that the correlations within industries are critical in the investigation of the predictability of returns. In the out-of-sample analysis, a maximally predicted portfolio (MPP) was constructed based on the updated economic and financial information; however, the predictability of the MPP did not exceed that of a naive forecast.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stock market predictability, Australian stock market, industry returns.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A phenomenological study of the health-care related spiritual needs of multicultural Western Australians</field><field name="creator">Hawley, Georgina</field><field name="description">This study was designed to identify the spiritual needs of multicultural Australians with a health problem, in order to understand the educational implications for health care professionals. The rationale for the research was supported by the Australian Council for Health Service (1997) requirement that health care professionals meet the spiritual needs of their patients and clients'. At the commencement of this study, no research had been published on what these spiritual needs might be. To discover what health care professionals needed to be taught in order to meet the spiritual needs of their patients, I required a suitable group of patients. Then, after identify their spiritual needs, I wanted to explore ways in which these needs could be met. For this to occur, I also needed to identify factors that would fulfill patients' spiritual needs or prevent them from being met. This research proceeded in two stages. The first involved collecting data from all spiritual groups in Western Australia. The second involved the recruitment and interviewing a small number of ex-patients to gain their perspective of health care related spirituality and needs. To gain data about the various spiritual groups in Western Australia, I wrote to all organisations and associations, asking for information and reference material. This data was analysed using HyperResearch (1995), and themes common to all spiritual groups were developed. The inter-relationship between these themes provided the framework for an emergent model of spirituality.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multicultural health care, spiritual needs, Australia, health care professional education, patient care.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A trans-cultural study of the practice of occupational therapists in Thailand and Australia: reframing theories of practice</field><field name="creator">Pongsaksri, Arisa</field><field name="description">Culturally appropriate conceptual models for practice are of major interest to occupational therapists, an emerging health profession in Thailand. Currently in Thailand, occupational therapy education and practice derives its conceptual models from Western models. How these models are translated into practice in Thailand is unclear, as there are currently no research studies relating to the cultural and clinical practice demands of Thai occupational therapists and of service delivery in Thailand. In addition, how occupational therapists in Australia apply conceptual models in practice has also been given limited attention in the research literature. A comparison is made between Thai and Western Australian occupational therapists to examine the use of theoretical models in the Western cultural context and to investigate the influences of cultural differences on occupational therapy practice. The purpose of this study is to identify the conceptual models most frequently used by occupational therapists in Thailand and in Australia, to describe the application of these models to practice, and to explore the cultural influences impacting on the application to practice. The need for a derived but more culturally specific conceptual model for occupational therapy practice in Thailand was also investigated. Focus group interviews were conducted as the initial stage of the study, to obtain in-depth background information about occupational therapy practice. Content analysis using transcript-based analysis and systematic coding was used to analyse the focus group data. The results demonstrated three main conceptual approaches: among both Westem Australian and Thai occupational therapists. These three models were described as the Performance Model, the Whole Person Model, and the Medical Model.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Samphan framework, theoretical models of practice of occupational the, cultural implications in occupational therapy prac.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of aggregate on the microstructure of geopolymer</field><field name="creator">Subaer</field><field name="description">Inorganic geopolymers or simply geopolymers based on silico-aluminate are relatively novel materials with a wide range of potential applications. The mAln purpose of the present study was to experimentally investigate the compositionmicrostructure- property relationship of these new materials. These must be understood in order to optimise the performance of geopolymers. Geopolymers with different chemical compositions (Si:Al and Na:Al atomic ratios) were prepared by thermally assisted alkali-activation of metakaolinite at 70&#186;C. Metakaolinite was obtAlned by dehydroxylation of kaolinite at 750&#186;C for 6 hours. Measurements indicated that the compositions of geopolymers influence the microstructural character as well as the physical and mechanical properties of these materials. Geopolymers prepared with an atomic ratio of Si:Al = 1.04 and 1.25 are categorised as sodium-poly(sialate) (Na-PS) geopolymers. These materials were found to be composed of zeolite-A or zeolite-X in conjunction with amorphous geopolymer. These materials are relatively soft, with low density and high apparent porosity, and have low hardness and compressive strength. Geopolymers prepared with an atomic ratio of Si:Al = 1.50, 1.75 and 2.00 are categorised as sodium-poly(sialate-siloxo) (Na-PSS) geopolymers. The structure of these geopolymers is amorphous as observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with no evidence of zeolite formation. A broad amorphous hump in the X-ray diffraction patterns suggests that the Na-PSS geopolymers consist of disordered frameworks with short-range order. The thermal analysis of Na-PSS by means of thermogravitmetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) revealed that about 15% of the initial reaction water remAlns in the geopolymer framework. The DTA curves for Na-PSS show a single endothermic peak around 135&#186;C due to water evolution.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">properties and structure of geopolymers, geopolymers, organic and inorganis polymers.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15824</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Colonial, economic rationalist, or collegial?

Is G7 behaviour considered colonial, economic rationalist, or collegial? Additionally, Indonesian business leaders' perceptions of economic and social development in Indonesia are measured, exploring a possible connection with perception of G7 behaviour. Within the context of this project, the researcher assumes that attitudes in Indonesia are significantly shaped by the impact of' an increasingly competitive and sophisticated global free-trade environment today versus one of exploitation and domination under past European colonial rule. The research questions on which the project is based emerged after detailed consideration of a large and varied number of publications concerning related historical and contemporary socio-economic, political issues and examination of recent inter-country comparative performance indicators (1996 to 2000). The background for the research project is framed within the context of Modern World-Systems theory which rose to prominence in the early 1970s, earlier theories about Intentional Underdevelopment, Dependency and Geography, and the more recent hypothesis on Enlightenment and Institutions theory, all attempting to explain why some countries are so poor and others are not.

It is bounded to the northwest by largely undeformed Palaeoproterozoic basement lithologies of the Bangweulu block and is truncated to the northeast by Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic transcurrent shear zones within reactivated parts of the Palaeoproterozoic Ubendian belt. To the southeast and south, Irumide lithologies were reworked within the Neoproterozoic Lufilian and Zambezi belts, and to the east by the East African Orogen. Lithologies in the Irumide belt comprise a Palaeo- to Mesoproterozoic complex of gneisses and granitoids and a supracrustal succession of quartzites and pelites. A three-fold subdivision was accepted prior to this study; (1) Palaeoproterozoic granites and gneisses forming the Irumide basement, (2) a supracrustal succession of quartzites and metapelites called the Muva Supergroup, (3) various deformed and undeformed granitoids intruding both the Palaeoproterozoic basement and Muva Supergroup and considered to be pre-Irumide (1.4 Ga) and syn-, late- to post-Irumide (1.1-0.95 Ga). The age of Irumide tectonism itself was poorly constrained between 1.4 and 1.0 Ga. The basement units comprise the Mkushi Gneiss in the southwest and the Luwalizi Granite, Mwambwa River and Mulungwizi Gneisses in the northeast. These units have been correlated with the Palaeoproterozoic Bangweulu block and Ubendian belt in the past. These basement units are structurally and in places unconformably overlain by a metasedimentary succession of quartzites and metapelites, which in the southwest has been called the Kanona Group, and in the northeast the Manshya River Group.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">irumide tectonism, geochemistry, irumide granitoids.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15789</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A retrospective study to evaluate antibiotic prescribing for pediatric appendectomy procedures</field><field name="creator">Abid, Mohammed Ashraf</field><field name="description">Objective: To retrospectively evaluate antibiotic use in pediatric appendectomy procedures following an educational intervention in December 2001. Methodology: Demographic, clinical, and prescribing data was collected for all the patients &lt;18 years old who have had undergone non-perforated appendectomy procedures at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, WA. Data collection and analysis were divided into three groups. Group-I involved patients from May 2002 to April 2004 (which followed the post-intervention follow-up conducted from December 2001-April 2002 by Mallik et al.1). In May 2004, the Western Australian Therapeutic Advisory Group (WATAG) sent an advisory note which recommended a change from the use of cefotetan for surgical prophylaxis to cephazolin plus metronidazole. Group-II of the study involved patients between May 2004 (when the WATAG note was released) and June 2004; while Group-III involved patients from July 2004 to April 2005 (when the hospital issued the new guidelines and withdrawn cefotetan).Patient records were randomly selected for Group I &amp; III and all the records were evaluated for Group III. Results: Records for 408 patients were evaluated across the three groups of the study. There no significant difference (p&gt;0.05) between gender and age across the three groups.

Of this, 70% was typically used as a low-grade fertiliser in agriculture, representing an annual land use area of around 1,600 ha when spread between 5 and 7 t DS/ha. Loading rates of biosolids are typically based on the nitrogen (N) requirements of the crop to be grown, referred to as the N Limiting Biosolids Application Rate (NLBAR). A consequence of using the NLBAR to calculate loading rates is that phosphorus (P) is typically in excess of plant requirement. The resultant high loading rates of P are considered in the guidelines developed for the agricultural use of biosolids in Western Australia, but lack research data specific to local conditions and soil types. Regulatory changes throughout Australia and globally to protect the environment from wastewater pollution have created a need for more accountable and balanced nutrient data. Experiments presented in this thesis were undertaken to ascertain: the percentage relative effectiveness (RE) of biosolids as a source of plant available P compared with inorganic P fertiliser; loading rates to best supply P for optimum crop growth; P loading rates of risk to the environment; and the forms of P in local biosolids. Therefore, both the agronomic and environmental viewpoints were considered. Anaerobically digested and dewatered biosolids produced from Beenyup Wastewater Treatment Plant, Perth with a mean total P content of 2.97% dry weight basis (db) were used in a series of glasshouse, field and laboratory experiments. The biosolids were sequentially fractionated to identify the forms of P present and likewise in soil samples after applying biosolids or monocalcium phosphate (MCP).</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil properties, phosphorus in biosolids, plant nutrients.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16492</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring communication patterns within and across a school and associated agencies to increase the effectiveness of service to at-risk individuals</field><field name="creator">Scott, Donald</field><field name="description">The significant standpoint in this study was that schools&#8217; key role was to educate and yet this process would be severely impeded when a student receiving the education was at-risk. Agencies external to the school provide support in various forms to these individuals with the view of decreasing their at-risk status, thus providing an environment conducive to learning. Communication was posited to be a fundamental process essential to the provision of support and education to these at-risk individuals. The conceptual framework in this study acknowledged the complexity of school and organisational environments and was founded upon four key theoretical perspectives; organisational communication theory; a psychological orientation provided by Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy of needs; a social reconstructionist perspective; and constructs underpinning at-risk status causal factors. This research study sought to identify communication patterns existing within a selected school, and between the school (in this case) and associated agencies that were supporting the at-risk individuals. The results of this study, derived from in-depth interviews and questionnaires with agency personnel and school staff, demonstrated that although formal patterns of communication did exist they were inefficient and cumbersome. Formal patterns of communication were subsidiary to informal networks between colleagues. In this study, the school was frequently excluded from informal and formal agency communication patterns. Intra-agency and intra-school communication patterns were characterised by a top-down orientation with administrators tending to control the flow of information. A major finding was that there were considerable barriers to developing more effective communication patterns.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication pathways, communication processes, at-risk students.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16482</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effectiveness of Constructivist Teaching on Improving Learning Environments in Thai Secondary School Science Classrooms</field><field name="creator">Puacharearn, Panomporn</field><field name="description">This study describes the first study conducted in Thailand that resulted in changes in science teachers' classroom environments. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of constructivist teaching on improving learning environments in Thai secondary school science classrooms. The study involved three phases. First, the Constructivist Learning Environment Survey (CLES), an instrument for assessing students' perceptions of the actual and preferred classroom environment through the constructivist perspective, was validated for use in Thailand. Second, typical Thai secondary school science classrooms were described using quantitative and qualitative methods. Finally, the effectiveness of constructivist teaching on promoting improvement in classroom environments was evaluated through an action research process, involving the use of feedback on actual and preferred classroom environments. The sample consisted of seven secondary school science teachers and their 17 classes of 606 students in Nakornsawan Province, Thailand. Student Actual and Preferred Forms of the CLES, assessing Personal Relevance, Uncertainty, Critical Voice, Shared Control and Student Negotiation, were administered. Factor analysis and internal consistency reliability measures supported a five-factor structure for both actual and preferred forms. Students' attitudes to science were also measured.

The Science Learning Strategy (SLS) program aimed to improve student ability to apply learning strategies to science, increase student achievement in science and to augment students' feelings of control over their science learning, so that their perceived competence was maximised. Achievement of these aims was monitored by collecting perceptions from students, parents and the teacher/researcher via a range of devices including questionnaires, work samples and interviews. The program overall was regarded as successfully achieving all three aims by 22 of the 24 students. The other two students found that only some aspects of the course were helpful, and felt they had learned little from the program. Thirty three percent of parents attributed positive changes in their daughter's study and learning strategies to participation in the SLS program (the remainder were unsure, or did not know of any changes). In relation to perception of academic performance, 38% of the parents interviewed believed that the SLS had a positive effect on their daughter's achievement in science. Several of these parents reported very positive effects on performance. The remainder were not sure or did not know if there had been any positive effects. No parents mentioned that the SLS program had caused a drop in science performance. The proportion of parents believing their daughters blamed disappointing results on factors they couldn't control dropped from 45% at the start of the year, to 22% by the end of the SLS program. After the intervention, 33% of parents reported that their daughters had come to believe that their science performance was affected by many factors, most of which they could control.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science, year 8, science learning strategy, learning strategy, SLS.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14888</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of blended learning in improving the reaction, achievement and return on investment of industrial automation training</field><field name="creator">Mackay, Stephen George</field><field name="description">There has been a significant increase in the level of remote or distance learning using the Internet, often referred to as e-learning or online education.

The purpose of this research is to investigate the impact blended learning has in improving engineering training in the engineering field of industrial automation. This is especially in improving the reaction, achievement and return on investment of learners compared to that of only the traditional classroom or e-learning approaches. One of the gaps in current research is the examination of the impact of blended learning in improving engineering training. The research revealed significant growth in the use of e-learning for engineers and technicians. There would however appear to be a large number of engineers and technicians who were disappointed with their experiences of e-learning. Significant concerns were also identified in the efficacy of e-learning and the lack of hands-on experience in this form of training for engineers and technicians.

In order to accomplish this goal the researcher, a university professor, attempted to create this environment and document it in a case study.The study sought to ascertain which dimensions of a constructivist learning environment - autonomy, prior knowledge, negotiation, student-centeredness - university students preferred and how these preferences changed after being in such an environment. It also sought to find out how students' preferred environments matched the environment they perceived to be in place. In addition, the study sought to determine what changes the instructor had to make in his teaching practice to implement each of the dimensions.The results of the study suggest most students very strongly preferred the prior-knowledge and negotiation dimensions, strongly preferred the autonomy dimension, and weakly to moderately preferred the student-centeredness dimension. The data indicate that during the study student preferences for prior knowledge and negotiation increased slightly, preferences for student centeredness increased moderately, and preferences for autonomy increased significantly.In addition, the researcher found that the four dimensions were not implemented equally. While the first three dimensions were strongly implemented, the student-centeredness dimension was only moderately implemented.

Prolonged computer use by office workers has been reported to result in an increased risk of developing Work-related Neck and Upper Limb Disorders (WRNULD) (Bernard et al.. 1994: Faucett &amp; Rempel. 1994: Tittiranonda et al.. 1999). The occupational risk factors associated with prolonged computer use include static posture and the speed and force of keyboard operation. Past studies have examined different aspects of these risk factors through measuring muscle electrical activity (EMG), kinematics and keyboard forces. However, most of these studies have been conducted on healthy painfree subjects and even the few Case-Control studies have not clearly established any direct relationships between the risk factors and WRNULD. The present research project consisted of a series of three studies aimed at investigating whether there were intrinsic differences among different individuals in response to different physical stressors. These intrinsic differences may have important implications to help explain why some individuals would develop WRNULD while others do not. The individuals' responses to the demands of three physical stressors: static posture, speed and force of keyboard operation were assessed. The internal exposure measures of kinematics, EMG, keyboard dynamics and subjective discomforts were used to evaluate the inter-individual differences. Study I was a field investigation comparing the neck-shoulder kinematics between symptomatic ("Case", n=8) and asymptomatic ("Control", n=8) office workers. Results showed trends for consistently greater head tilt and neck flexion angles, and greater ranges of movements in the Case Group than the Control Group.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">static posture, musculoskeletal discomfort, work-related muscle pain, occupational risk factors, WRNULD.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of anthropometry activities for high school science: student outcomes and classroom environment</field><field name="creator">Lightburn, Millard E.</field><field name="description">The study involved the evaluation of anthropometric activities for high school science.

Quantitative (survey) and qualitative (interview) methods were used to provide answers to the research questions. The quantitative portion of the study involved students' achievement, students' attitudes to science and students' perceptions of the classroom learning environment. A pretest/posttest design was used with achievement outcomes, however, only a single assessment of student attitudes and classroom environment was made. The sample size used to gather data on students' attitudes to science and students' perceptions of the leaming environment was 726 students. Five hundred and ninety-eight (598) students tools the biology test. However, analyses were restricted to the subsample of 158 students who had experienced the anthropometric laboratory activity. Twenty-four students (24) were interviewed for the qualitative part of the study. Data generated from the interviews were used to complement information provided in the surveys. The main purpose of this research was to evaluate these student-centered activities in terms of students' achievement, students' attitudes and students' perceptions of the science classroom environment. Other aims included: to validate generally-applicable measures of classroom learning environments and students' attitudes to science; to investigate gender differences in students' achievement, attitudes and perceptions of classroom environment; and to investigate associations between the classroom learning environment and the student outcomes of performance and attitudes.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learning environment, science activities, human body measurements.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14071</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a water treatment system for Subsea Gas processing plant</field><field name="creator">Honer Badi M Nazhat, Dana</field><field name="description">The petroleum industry is currently moving to meet the ever-rising demand for oil and gas production. As onshore fields become depleted and decline in production, exploration and production companies have started venturing further offshore. To support this activity, there is need for new subsea production technologies to develop deepwater and ultra deepwater fields.Woodside Hydrocarbon Research Facility (WHRF) at Curtin University of Technology is working on natural gas dehydration processing using gas hydrate technology. Through the studies, a novel gas dehydration process has been developed and now proposed for subsea application. Natural gas dehydration processes generate both a treated dry gas stream and a waste stream of condensate consisting of both hydrocarbons and water. This condensate can be reinjected to the reservoir formation but this is not always economic or practical. Availability of an alternative means of treatment and disposal of the condensate would be advantageous. This study aims to investigate and to provide a basis for the design of such an alternative scheme by constructing a floating separator for the treatment and disposal of waste condensate from subsea dehydration stage.A model was developed to simulate the process of evaporation of condensate from the proposed floating separator. The calculations were performed taken into account zero wind speed and an ambient temperature around 34 C. The simulation results showed that condensate skimming time was found to be 15 days for flowrate (Qin) of 100 bbd associated with specific separator diameter and total height dimensions. By considering the ratio of diameter to total height of 2.5, the floating separator was designed to enhance the evaporation rate and to get overall structure stability due to the mechanical restrictions that might be encountered in the sea.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">natural gas dehydration processing, subsea production technologies, deepwater fields, demand for oil and gas, gas hydrate technology.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16991</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extraction and separation of cobalt from acidic nickel laterite leach solutions using electrostatic pseudo liquid membrane (ESPLIM)</field><field name="creator">Heckley, Philip Scott</field><field name="description">Approximately 70% of the western world's known nickel reserves are contained in laterite ores, but only 30% of the world's nickel production comes from these ores. This is due to the lack of economically viable technology to extract the nickel from these ores. However, recent advances in pressure acid leaching technology have resulted in new commercial attempts to extract nickel and its valuable by-product, cobalt, from laterite ores. The commissioning of three nickel laterite projects in Western Australia in the late 1990s represents the first of these new generation nickel operations, with several other projects; in Australia and overseas, in various stages of development. Unfortunately, several technical issues have hindered full production in these new refineries. Some of these problems are directly attributable to the mixer-settler contactors used in the solvent extraction process. This has highlighted a need to develop alternative contactors for industrial use. Electrostatic Pseudo Liquid Membrane (ESPLIM) is an alternative, novel technique to conduct the solvent extraction process. It combines the basic principles of solvent extraction, liquid membrane and electrostatic dispersion into a simple, compact reactor that utilises many advantages of each technique. The aim of this study w as to develop a method of extracting and separating cobalt from an acidic nickel laterite leach solution using ESPLIM. Bench scale tests using synthetic and actual leach solutions have shown that: the design and construction materials of the baffle plate and electrodes have a significant effect on the performance of the reactor; an AC power supply provided better droplet dispersion than a DC power supply; an increase in the applied electric field strength above a critical value resulted in a decrease in the aqueous droplet size and an increase in residence tune.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">laterite ores, acid leaching, solvent extraction, nickel, cobalt.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information literacy and news libraries: the challenge of developing information literacy instruction programs in a special library environment</field><field name="creator">Bradley, Fiona</field><field name="description">This study examines the current situation of training provided to journalists by news librarians in the United States and Australia. The study examines the factors affecting the provision of training and the potential for information literacy instruction to comprise most of the training provided. The definition of information literacy was explored in the context of journalists and news organisations. The study questions the adaptability of the concept to a workplace environment, where organisational and individual development is important. The results of a self-administered questionnaire are presented. Respondents indicated that news librarians are very willing to plan and conduct training, a clear majority agreeing that they should train journalists to search for their own information. Respondents also expressed a need for more training themselves with regard to the skills needed to deliver instruction. The results also found that training is at an early stage in news libraries, with few hours available for planning and conducting training, and mixed success with different training methodologies. A model is suggested as a method of selecting information literacy competencies for individual journalists. The model describes the relationships between individual, organisation, and occupation determined competencies. The study also discusses the implications of the lack of workplace training for journalists, which has impacted upon news libraries' ability to introduce training services. News librarians are providing training, and are pro-active in providing services and information to journalists, but managers do not yet recognise this as a major role for librarians in news organisations.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news librarians, information literacy, training of journalists.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14147</field></doc><doc><field name="title">C02 quantification using seismic attributes in laboratory experiments</field><field name="creator">Keshavarz Faraj Khah, Nasser</field><field name="description">Sequestration has been suggested as a solution for resolving the problem of increasing greenhouse gas emissions. CO2 is the major greenhouse gas which results from using fossil fuels for domestic and industrial purposes. Different geological targets have been suggested as reservoirs for CO2 sequestration with saline aquifers being the focus of this research. Monitoring and verification of injected CO2 into the ground is an essential part of CO2 sequestration because there is a strong requirement to understand and correctly manage the CO2 flow and movement within the reservoir over time. This includes a need to understand mobile CO2 in its all phases (gas, liquid, supercritical and dissolved in formation water). It is now well recognised that monitoring injected liquids in the sub-surface can be done remotely using surface seismic monitoring techniques. Seismic waves are sensitive to the contrast in the physical properties of formation water and CO2. As a gas, the migration path of CO2 has been shown to be easily imaged but such images provide only a qualitative rather than a quantitative solution, which is inadequate to remotely verify storage volumetrics. The complexity of saline aquifer reservoirs containing the different phases of CO2 (a function of reservoir pressure, temperature, and chemical composition and the state of phase of injected CO2) requires a good knowledge base of how the seismic response changes to such changes in CO2 phase and reservoir heterogeneities for verification purposes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">greenhouse gas sequestration operations, CO2 sequestration, time-lapse seismic monitoring.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structural nature of aluminosilicate inorganic polymers: a macro to nanoscale study</field><field name="creator">Rowles, Matthew Ryan</field><field name="description">Aluminosilicate inorganic polymers (AIPs) are network heteropolymers consisting of Si04 and AlO4 tetrahedra linked by a shared oxygen. The use of these materials as a cementing agent, toxic waste storage and fibre reinforced material, amongst a multitude of prospective applications, has grown in recent years. The utilisation of AIPs is hampered by a lack of knowledge about their formation and structure. In order to allow the materials to achieve their full potential, the way in which the material behaves and forms under different conditions must be elucidated. The basic questions that this study aimed to answer were: 1) How does the structure of these AIPs change with composition? and 2) Can this change in structure explain the material properties of the AIP? The AIPs investigated in the study covered the molar composition ranges Si:Al ratio = 1 - 3 and Na:Al ratio = 0.5 - 2. They were made by the sodium hydroxide activation of metakaolinite, derived from the dehydroxylation of kaolinite. The Si content of the AIP was altered by the addition of amorphous silica fume via the activation solution. The study considered the structural nature of the AIPs at the macro, micro and nanoscales, and found that the structure changed at all scales and with all compositions. The nature of the AIP structure was studied at the macroscale utilising compressive strength testing. The results from this work showed that the compressive strength of the AIPs varied systematically with the chemical composition. The strengths recorded ranged from 0.4 &#177; 0.2 MPa for a sample with Si:Al:Na molar ratios = 1.08:1:0.5, to 64 &#177; 3 MPa for a sample with Si:Al:Na molar ratios = 2.5:1:1.3. The higher strengths measured exceed those exhibited by Portland cement pastes. The microstructure of the AIPs was investigated by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">inorganic polymer science, AIP formation, bonding characteristic science.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16061</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Restlessness of meaning: an exploration of how visual artists are working with museum collections</field><field name="creator">Darbyshire, Jo</field><field name="description">This exegesis is an exploration of issues involved in making an exhibition -The Gay Museum (2003) -at the Western Australian Museum. Inspired by the work of artist Joseph Kosuth at the Brooklyn Museum (1990) and curator Peter Emmett at the Museum of Sydney (1994), this project attempts to explore and extend the role of artists as curators in contemporary museums. The project also shows that by re- interpreting objects in museum collections artists can actively challenge and support museums in a period of change and that collaboration between artists and museums as 'makers of meaning' can open up new possibilities for both. The curatorial vision for the exhibition therefore included strategies from contemporary museums - a multi-disciplinary approach and the use of non-linear narrative - and strategies from the contemporary art world -those that explore an aesthetic approach to objects and installation. Research for the project was determined by the expectations, unique histories and political choices that shaped and connected three 'communities' - Jo Darbyshire from the visual arts community, the Western Australian Museum community and the gay and lesbian community of Western Australia. As The Gay Museum project shows, the collaboration between artists and museums can contribute to museums being sites that vibrantly reflect contemporary cultural changes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">The Gay Museum, re-interpreting objects in museum collections.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15181</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Articulating and ameliorating elder abuse in Australia</field><field name="creator">Kingsley, Elizabeth J.S.</field><field name="description">The abuse of older people is a largely unrecognised and under acknowledged social problem in Australia.

Epidemiological evidence indicates that deaths world-wide from AIDS are yet to peak. Although HIV notifications and AIDS deaths in the total Australian population have decreased', there has been an increase in rates in the Australian Indigenous population. There is also some evidence of complacency in HIV prevention vigilance in Australia which indicates a need for continued focus on prevention programs. The knowledge levels, attitudes toward HIV risk, and risk-taking behaviours of young Australians place them at risk of exposure to HIV. Appropriate prevention programs can be delivered to these vulnerable young people through the school setting. Programs delivered in schools have been shown to have a positive effect and teachers are vital to the delivery of these education programs. Without appropriate training, however, teachers may not optimise the outcomes of these programs. While it would be desirable for teachers to be trained in HIV prevention education in pre-service training this has not been the case in Western Australia (WA). When there is not an opportunity for pre-service training, professional development programs can be implemented to provide additional training required by teachers. Traditionally this professional development has been provided through workshops. These face-to-face delivery methods, however, do not always adequately serve the needs of all teachers, and in particular the needs of teachers in rural and remote areas. In an attempt to address the needs of these teachers, alternate methods of professional development delivery may be appropriate. The aim of this study was to test an alternate method of delivery.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teacher professional development, Protect Yourself Program (PYP), teachers' role in HIV prevention education.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organizational commitment, group-leader relations and turnover intention: a study of local marketing officers in securities firms owned by foreign interests in Hong Kong</field><field name="creator">Sit, Kenneth Y.

From an individual&#8217;s perspective, turnover can have both potentially positive and negative consequences not just on himself or herself, but also on his or her family members and those who remain with the organization, irrespective of whether they are close associates with the person who has decided to leave the organization. From the organizational perspective, employee turnover can be costly - time and effort on loss recruitment, training, socialization investments, disruption, etc. From the societal perspective, turnover can bring in significant consequences which include mobility and migration to new industries and organizations for economic development. This study focuses on the relationship between one of the antecedents of organizational commitment &#8211; group/leader relations and the turnover intention of local marketing officers in securities firms owned by foreign interests in Hong Kong. Various studies have shown that the antecedents of organizational commitment such as personal traits, job characteristics, group and leader relations and company attributes are related to the turnover intention of staff but not much of it has been done in Hong Kong. The primary objective of this study is to propose a parsimonious model to address the issue of employee withdrawal among a sample of marketing executives working in foreign securities firms in Hong Kong SAR. The research design is quantitative in nature, testing various hypotheses on two levels of exchange within organizations - between subordinate and organization and between subordinate and supervisor.

The intended research in this field is to establish the viability of utilizing a synthesised natural gas hydrate as a means to allow a cheaper form of transportation of natural gas from the wellhead to the customer in direct competition with liquefied natural gas (LNG). Natural gas exists in ice-like formations called hydrates found on or under sea-beds and under permafrost. Hydrates trap methane molecules inside a cage of frozen water, where the amount of hydrates trapped is dependent on surrounding formation pressure. The amount of natural gas trapped in hydrates is largely unknown, but it is very large. A number of scientists believe that hydrates contain more than twice as much energy as all the world's coal, oil, and natural gas combined, hence making it a viable option of fuel in the 21st century, in a world constantly seeking cleaner sources of energy. The feasibility of production of natural gas hydrates on offshore installations and onshore facilities makes this development a viable option. As such this technology requires detailed research and development in a laboratory environment coupled with a pilot plant construction for commercial operation. Current estimates for onshore based facilities for the production of hydrates show a cost reduction of approximately 25% compared with LNG plants of the same energy capacity.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gas formation, hydrates, natural gas.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Educational practice and learning environments in rural and urban lower secondary science classrooms in Kalimantan Selatan, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Wahyudi,</field><field name="description">This study investigated the educational practices and learning outcomes in rural and urban lower secondary school science classrooms of Kalimantan Selatan, Indonesia. Guided by six research questions, this study focused on curriculum implementation and its association with the existing working and learning environment, learning process and learning outcomes. The investigations were conducted in two stages and used two research methods. The classroom learning environment and school level environment were investigated at the first stage using the questionnaire survey as a research method. The questionnaires were developed and validated with a sample of 1188 Year 9 students and their teachers in 16 schools. Validation of the questionnaire confirmed that the Indonesian version of the modified WMIC is a valid and reliable instrument to measure the classroom learning environment in the Indonesian educational context. The results regarding the status of the classroom learning environment are summarised in four assertions. First, students tended to prefer a more favourable classroom learning environment than the one they actually experienced. Second, female students generally held slightly more positive perceptions of both actual and preferred learning environments. Third, students in rural schools experienced a less positive learning environment than did their counterparts in urban areas. Fourth, teachers&#8217; perceptions were more favourable than their students on both the actual and preferred learning environment for all seven scales, except on Task Orientation in which their perceptions were matched.

The system is designed to use as little ancillary equipment as possible and only requires one small instrument rack and one PC based control computer. All of the control features of the system are based or installed in the control computer.The PSLR project at Curtin University was concerned with repairing and u p grading the PSLR to return the system to operational capacity. This involved the replacement of missing control components, repair of some hardware, modifications to the control program, and several calibration and operational tests. These tests showed that the PSLR system was capable of a ranging accuracy to fixed targets of 8.5 mm with an average accuracy of 23 mm. They showed that the PSLR was capable, in selective conditions, to track star ephemerides to less than 54.

Through the scenarios it illuminates an alternative method to develop strategies for the future. Ultimately the end result of scenario planning is not a more accurate picture of the future, but better decision making for the future. This is a significant piece of research because it demonstrates the advantages of the scenario planning process as a method to illuminate the potential future dangers and opportunities in the water industry's business environment. The scenarios can be used as a launching pad for strategic planning and to prepare the water industry for the uncertainties it faces. Water is precious and essential to life. Water supply is arguably the ultimate essential service. Australia uses about 22,000 gigalitres of water [l gigalitre (GL) = 1,000,000,000 litres, approximately 444 Olympic swimming pools (ABS 2004)] per annum across all sectors, irrigation, industry and domestic. The aim of this study was to determine the critical issues for the future of the Australian urban water supply industry. The study achieved this with the aid of scenarios that tell stories about urban water supply to the year 2025. A key to this study is the concept of organisations as living organisms, which are capable of learning and adapting to changes in their business environment. Today's business environment is constantly changing through globalisation, technological innovation and society's values.

Communication technology and the international role for English suggest the integrating global communication reality is simplifying. Experience indicates integration produces complex heterogeneous dialogue and asymmetrical relationships with no shared interpretative systems. The global/national/local nexus presents management with universal and particular paradoxes mediated through diverse contextual micro communication practices and behaviours. This thesis derives from a professional service (environmental engineering) TNC request for help to address the business communication and performance concerns implicated in the production of professional bi-lingual English and Indonesian reports for clients. At the heart of this corporate concern lie the multicultural nature of interactions between the individuals, organizations and wider stakeholders involved in the Jakarta, Indonesian branch office operations. A developing nation adds further complexity. This thesis contends that these micro organizational concerns link to critical macro economic, political, and cultural societal concerns for the development of more responsive ethical and sustainable management and governance. This thesis argues for an elevated notion of the role of communication management to enable business to pursue more sustainable goals, improve business performance, and address the issue of risk.

In order to address some of these gaps in our understanding, this study aimed to broaden the range of theoretical approaches applied to economic studies of womens retirement savings strategies.

New, practical and highly accurate methodologies for gravity field modelling that describe the Earth as an oblate ellipsoid of revolution are therefore required. The foundation for these methodologies is formed by solutions to ellipsoidal geodetic boundary-value problems. In this thesis, new solutions to the ellipsoidal Dirichlet, Neumann and second-order boundary-value problems, as well as the fixed- and free-geodetic boundary-value problems, are derived. These solutions do not rely on any spherical approximation, but are nevertheless completely based on a simple spherical harmonic expansion of the function that is to be determined. They rely on new relations among spherical harmonic base functions. In the new solutions, solid spherical harmonic coefficients of the desired function are expressed as a weighted summation over surface spherical harmonic coefficients of the data on the ellipsoidal boundary, or alternatively as a weighted summation over coefficients that are computed under the approximation that the boundary is a sphere.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gravity field, ellipsoidal geodetic boundary value problem, solid spherical harmonic coefficients, gravity field modelling.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16850</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the environmental knowledge, attittudes and behavioural intentions of elementary school students</field><field name="creator">Amarant, Arlene</field><field name="description">This study was designed to find out elementary students knowledge about the environment, their attitudes towards helping the environment and what they actually have done to help the environment.

Both quantitative and qualitative data has been collected from students while qualitative data only was collected from pre-service teachers, practising teachers and parents. The sample for the quantitative data collection was comprised of 581 Year 9 and 10 students in 36 different classes taught by 28 different teachers in 7 schools covering 4 states of Australia. All of the schools are private schools and part of the Seventh-day Adventist school system. The questionnaire used an actual and preferred form of the 56 item version of the What is Happening in the Classroom? (WIHIC) survey along with 10 questions from the Test of Science Related Attitudes (TOSRA) modified for mathematics classrooms. For the qualitative data collection 40 interviews and 8 focus groups were conducted. Apart from comparing upper and lower-streams, other variables examined were: actual and preferred perceptions of the classroom learning environment, Year 9 with Year 10, males with females, English speakers with second language students, and attitudes with perceptions of learning environments. The most significant finding of the study was not only that lower-stream students have a more negative perception of their classroom learning environment, but that they seek less change. This negative perception is seen to be worse in Year 10 than Year 9, particularly in the areas of teacher support and task orientation. This study found a positive correlation between attitude and perceptions of classroom learning environment. This study also found a tacit acceptance of streaming as a practice by most participants in the study.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">test of science related attitudes, what is happening in this class, students perceptions, classroom learning environment, mathematics education.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Limnology and biota of Lake Yindarlgooda - an inland salt lake in Western Australia under stress</field><field name="creator">Campagna, Veronica</field><field name="description">Inland salt lakes of the arid and semi-arid zones of Western Australia are unique systems. An unpredictable rainfall pattern and a transient water regime ensure these lakes remain dry for much of the year. Lake Yindarlgooda in the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia is a typical inland salt lake that has been subjected to additional stresses. This thesis is the outcome of investigations conducted on the lake from 2001 to 2003. Emphasis is on the limnology and biota of the lake, including an adjacent wetland, and impacts on the aquatic ecosystems caused predominantly by mining. Lake Yindarlgooda is a large, shallow hypersaline lake situated on the Yindarlgooda Palaeoriver. It is sodium chloride dominated and has naturally high background levels of nickel. Sites impacted by the leaching of hypersaline decant water from a leach residue storage facility (LRSF) were differentiated from control sites using multivariate statistics. Salinity was found to be a major determinant in the structure of the biological communities in the lake systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Paratemia, biota, limnology, impact of mining on aquatic water systems, salinity, inland salt lake, Lake Yindarlgooda, Western Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17473</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A substantive examination of rural community resilience and transition - A social justice perspective of a civil society</field><field name="creator">Costello, Diane Ingrid</field><field name="description">It is well established that rural regional Australians have borne the brunt of globalization in terms of the adverse impacts caused by social and economic restructuring resulting from global, national and local forces. In response governments and communities have embraced sustainability and civil society for promoting local community action and responsibility for social, economic and environmental issues. This research focuses on community narratives about the social change processes as they engage the forces of neo-liberal policies. Applying a qualitative, grounded theoretical approach to data collection and analysis this study also adopts a multi-perspective, multi-disciplinary framework to gain more holistic, contextual understandings of community functioning and change. In echoing the principles of community psychology, the foundational, multidisciplinary concepts of sense of community, social capital, civil society, empowerment and conscientization have informed understandings of this communitys process and outcome towards transformational change. This study offers a critical reflection of transformational change in an effort to promote more peaceful, collaborate relationships between dominant and oppressed groups in expanding our understandings and solutions for community change. Identified by Newbrough (1992, 1995) as the Third Force Position, the ideals of political community are visibly expressed as they attempt to pursue transformational change towards a just and sustainable future for the community. However, while civil society has made a positive contribution, also apparent are the processes and outcomes which affect those most vulnerable. Those most powerless continue to suffer from exclusion, marginalization and as a result are denied access to vital resources to meet their needs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social economic environmental issues,  community narratives,  social change process,  local community action,  civil society,  sustainability,  economic restructuring,  globalization, rural regional Australians,  political community,  community psychology,  community change,  conscientization,  empowerment, neo-liberal policies,  sense of community.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular characterization of Malaysian methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus</field><field name="creator">Lim, Tien Tze</field><field name="description">Seventy-four methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from two Malaysian hospitals were characterised by both phenotypic and genotypic techniques. These isolates were collected over an 18 year time period in the years, 1982, 1989, 1994 and 2000. All of the Malaysian MRSA isolates were found to be multiresistant and resistant to at least five different antimicrobial agents. Over 30% of them were non-typable by the International Basic Set of bacteriophages. The majority of the typable isolates were susceptible to the group III phages, especially phage 85. The majority of the isolates carried one to six plasmids. Only two isolates were plasmid free. The plasmid profiles of these isolates, other than the 1982 isolates, were very similar to each other. Contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) gel electrophoresis was used to examine the genetic relatedness of the isolates. Twenty-six CHEF patterns were found among the isolates. These CHEF patterns were closely related to each other. The predominant CHEF pattern A was found in the 1982, 1989 and 1994 isolates. The CHEF patterns of the year 2000 isolates were different to CHEF pattern A, but still closely related. All of the isolates were found to carry the Allotype III SCCmec and have coagulase-gene type 24. Multilocus sequence typing was preformed on the isolates with CHEF pattern A collected in different years. These isolates were found to have either sequence type 239 (ST239), or its single locus variant. The predominant Malaysian clone belongs to the pandemic clone ST239-MRSA-III that is pandemic in Asian countries.

These studies suggest, but do not provide, a causal link between increased calcium intake and reduced adiposity. In contrast, randomised controlled trails (RCT) are limited and their outcomes, to date, are conflicting in their findings (Zemel et al. 2004b; Harvey-Berino et al. 2005; Thompson et al. 2005; Zemel et al. 2005a; 2005b). The primary mechanism involves the control of intracellular calcium by calcitrophic hormones, vitamin D3 and PTH. It is proposed that a higher calcium intake lowers the calcitrophic hormones, thus reducing intracellular calcium and attenuating lipid storage (Zemel et al. 2000). Other flow through effects may include the greater utilisation of fat as a fuel source, increased thermogenesis, increased fat excretion, improved satiety and reduced food intake. (Melanson et al. 2003; Sun &amp; Zemel, 2004; Boon et al. 2005a; Gunther et al. 2005b; Jacobsen et al. 2005b; Melanson et al. 2006). In this thesis we demonstrate that the acute ingestion of calcium, increased postprandial fat oxidation in overweight and obese humans. The results were consistent between the two sources of calcium tested (dairy and calcium citrate). Circulating levels of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were less suppressed, while glycerol tended to be higher following both high calcium meals (Cummings et al. 2006).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cellular, animal and epidemiological studies, calcium, dairy foods, regulation of weight, adiposity, calcitrophic hormones</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17868</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hardware-based text-to-braille translation</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Xuan</field><field name="description">Braille, as a special written method of communication for the blind, has been globally accepted for years. It gives blind people another chance to learn and communicate more efficiently with the rest of the world. It also makes possible the translation of printed languages into a written language which is recognisable for blind people. Recently, Braille is experiencing a decreasing popularity due to the use of alternative technologies, like speech synthesis. However, as a form of literacy, Braille is still playing a significant role in the education of people with visual impairments. With the development of electronic technology, Braille turned out to be well suited to computer-aided production because of its coded forms. Software based text-to-Braille translation has been proved to be a successful solution in Assistive Technology (AT). However, the feasibility and advantages of the algorithm reconfiguration based on hardware implementation have rarely been substantially discussed. A hardware-based translation system with algorithm reconfiguration is able to supply greater throughput than a software-based system. Further, it is also expected as a single component integrated in a multi-functional Braille system on a chip.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">algorithm reconfiguration, FPGA, Markov theory, braille translation, assistive technology, VHOL.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Watching Indonesian sinetron: imagining communities around the television</field><field name="creator">Ida, Rachmah</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the everyday cultural practices of communal television viewing by urban kampung people. It challenges the institutional frameworks and constructs about the television audience. To achieve this, the thesis looks at the cultural context of the television set and its uses in urban kampung households and the neighbourhood system. Studies on urban kampung community in Indonesia so far have focused on the socio-economic and cultural practices of the people in relation to state ideological matters (e.g. Guinness, 1989; Sullivan, 1994; Brenner, 1998). This thesis is an attempt to extend the investigation about the cultural practices of the kampung community in relation to media use in the era of competitive private television in the early 2000s. As those kampung people have existentially engaged in fashioning their own lives neither as rural subjects nor urban/ity subjects, their narratives in responding to televised images and representations (of women in particular) shape the particularity of the cultural scene of these marginalized subjects. Taking up their social economic background and the particularities of socio-cultural circumstances of the kampung, this present study takes a close look into the day-to-day communal viewing practice of the kampung female viewers of the most-watched local program on Indonesian television, that is sinetron (television drama).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cultural practices of communal television viewing, urban kampung people, cultural context of the television set, urban kampung households, urban kampung community, Indonesia, media use, competitive private television, kampung female viewers, Indonesian television, sinetron</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning environments of technology supported secondary science classrooms: a study in an Indian school</field><field name="creator">Gupta, Adit</field><field name="description">Science teaching at the secondary level can be made more effective with the judicious utilization of a multi-media approach involving modem information and communication technologies that is entering the Indian educational system in general and the schools in Jammu region (J&amp;K State), in particular, surely but slowly.

The study described in this thesis utilized the Technology-Rich, Outcomes-Focused Learning Environment Inventory (TROFLEI), to study the perceptions of students' actual and preferred classroom learning environment in a technology-supported science classroom at the secondary level in an Indian school situation. An important aspect of this research was to determine the reliability and validity of this scale for use in Indian classroom settings. An attitude scale derived from the Test for Science Related Attitudes (TOSRA) for studying the attitude of students towards science was also employed and lastly the Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction (QTI) was used to analyze the teacher student interactions in a technology-supported science classroom environment.

While the use of radiometric data for regolith mapping has been generally well received, radiometric methods have not commonly been adopted to assist and improve soil mapping. This thesis contributes to the development of radiometric techniques as soil and regolith mapping tools by examining soil characteristics and radiometric response using non-standard radiometric methods. This is accomplished through the development of new data processing methodologies, which extracts additional information from standard radiometric data that is unattainable using standard processing methods, and development of a new interpretation approach to soil and regolith mapping employing the multispectral processed radiometric data. The new multispectral processing methodology resolves seven gamma ray peaks from standard 256-channel NaI radiometric data to produce new radiometric uranium ternary, thorium ternary and uranium ratio imagery. Changes in the gamma ray relationships, identified through the new imagery, identify changes in soil and/or environmental conditions that are absent or difficult to identify in the standard radiometric imagery. With the isolation of non-standard thorium channels 228 [superscript] Ac (900 keV) and 228 [superscript] Ac (1600 keV), case studies in this thesis demonstrate how the difference of 1.9 years (half-life) between thorium 228 [superscript] Ac and 232 [superscript] Th decay daughter products can be mapped through the interpretation of thorium energy using ternary imagery [red: 208 [superscript] Tl (1764 keV), green: 228 [superscript] Ac (900 keV), blue: 228 [superscript] Ac (1600 keV)]. Energy peak differences may be be linked to local variations in soil chemistry, soil movement, and water movement.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">radiometrics, regolith mapping, uranium ternary, thorium ternary, uranium ratio imagery, Western Australian soil types</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Industrial democracy and best practice in Thailand: a stakeholder study</field><field name="creator">Joungtrakul, Jamnean</field><field name="description">This research investigated the perceptions on industrial democracy of selected stakeholder groups in the Thai industrial relations system.

Six hundred and sixty-one (661) students from 22 classrooms in four inner city schools completed the modified actual forms of the Constructivist Learning Environment Survey (CLES), the What Is Happening In this Class? (WIHIC) questionnaire, and the Test Of Mathematics Related Attitudes (TOMRA). The data were analyzed for the CLES, WIHIC, and TOMRA to check their factor structure, reliability, discriminant validity, and the ability to distinguish between different classes and groups. In terms of the validity of the CLES, WIHIC, and TOMRA when used with middle-school students in California, the factor analysis results attest to the sound factor structure of each questionnaire. The results for each CLES, WIHIC, and TOMRA scale for the alpha reliability and discriminant validity for two units of analysis (individual and class mean) compare favorably with the results for other well-established classroom environment instruments. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also calculated for each scale of the CLES and WIHIC to investigate its ability to differentiate between the perceptions of students in different classrooms. The ANOVA results suggest that students perceived the learning environments of different mathematics classrooms differently on CLES and WIHIC scales. In general, the results provided evidence of the validity of these instruments in describing psychosocial factors in the learning environments of middle-school mathematics classrooms in California.

In recent years, attempts to increase the utilization of fly ash to partially replace the use of Portland cement in concrete are gathering momentum. Most of this by-product material is currently dumped in landfills, creating a threat to the environment. Geopolymer concrete is a &#8216;new&#8217; material that does not need the presence of Portland cement as a binder. Instead, the source of materials such as fly ash, that are rich in Silicon (Si) and Aluminium (Al), are activated by alkaline liquids to produce the binder. Hence concrete with no Portland cement. This thesis reports the details of development of the process of making fly ash-based geopolymer concrete. Due to the lack of knowledge and know-how of making of fly ashbased geopolymer concrete in the published literature, this study adopted a rigorous trial and error process to develop the technology of making, and to identify the salient parameters affecting the properties of fresh and hardened concrete. As far as possible, the technology that is currently in use to manufacture and testing of ordinary Portland cement concrete were used. Fly ash was chosen as the basic material to be activated by the geopolimerization process to be the concrete binder, to totally replace the use of Portland cement. The binder is the only difference to the ordinary Portland cement concrete. To activate the Silicon and Aluminium content in fly ash, a combination of sodium hydroxide solution and sodium silicate solution was used. Manufacturing process comprising material preparation, mixing, placing, compaction and curing is reported in the thesis.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">concrete construction, carbon dioxide gas, fly ash, Portland cement, geopolymer concrete</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18580</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal enhancement strategies for fluid jets impinging on a heated surface</field><field name="creator">King, Andrew James Campbell</field><field name="description">This research investigation examines the thermal behaviour of single and arrays of fluid jets impinging at heated surfaces, and formulates enhancement schemes for the jet impingement heat transfer processes for high-intensity cooling applications. The proposed techniques are numerically modelled and analysed over a wide parametric range to identify flow characteristics leading to thermal enhancement and optimum performance. The first scheme applies to a single fluid jet and incorporates a protruding object at the impingement surface to improve heat transfer. In this, a conical protrusion of high thermal conductivity is attached to the heated surface directly beneath the jet. Three different aspect ratios of 0.5, 1 and 2 are investigated for the protrusion while the inclusion of a fillet at the base of the cone is also studied. Jet Reynolds numbers between 100 and 30,000 are modelled. The observed thermal performance is compared with a reference case having no surface attachment. With this arrangement, the heat transfer rate typically varies between 10 and 40 percent above the reference case although depending on certain parametric combinations, the heat transfer may increase above or decrease below the reference performance. The highest indicated increase in heat transfer is about 90 percent while 15 percent below is the lowest. Careful selection of cone surface profile creates potential for further thermal enhancement.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thermal behaviour of fluid jets, jet Reynolds numbers, jet impingement heat transfer processes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and structuring of commercial mortgage-backed securities in Australia</field><field name="creator">Chikolwa, Bwembya C</field><field name="description">According to the Reserve Bank of Australia (2006) the increased supply of Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS), with a range of subordination, has broadened the investor base in real estate debt markets and reduced the commercial property sector&#8217;s dependence on bank financing The CMBS market has been one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing sectors in the capital markets, for a market which was virtually nonexistent prior to 1990. The global CMBS market issuance which stood at AU$5.1 billion (US$4 billion) in 1990 had grown to AU$380 billion (US$299 billion) by the end of 2006. In Australia, a total of over 60 CMBSs with nearly 180 tranches totalling over AU$17.4 billion had been issued to December 2006 from when they were first introduced in 1999. To date few studies have been done on Australian CMBSs outside the credit rating agency circles. These studies are predominantly practitioner focused (Jones Lang LaSalle 2001; Richardson 2003; Roche 2000, 2002). O&#8217;Sullivan (1998) and Simonovski (2003) are the only academic studies on CMBSs. As such, this thesis examines issues relating to the development of Australian CMBSs and quantitatively and qualitatively analyses the structuring of Australian CMBSs. In assessing the growth of the Australian CMBS market, an interpretive historical approach (Baumgarter &amp; Hensley 2005) is adopted to provide a cogent review and explanation of features of international and Australian CMBSs. This helps to understand the changing nature of the market and provides better understanding of the present and suggests possible future directions. The Australian CMBS market is matured in comparison with the larger US and EU CMBS markets as seen by the diversity of asset classes backing the issues and transaction types, tightening spreads, and record issuance volumes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), quantitative analysis, determinants of CMBS credit ratings, ANNs, OR, qualitative analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parks, people and planning: local perceptions of park management on the Ningaloo Coast, North West Cape, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Ingram, Colin Barry</field><field name="description">Attaining the &#8216;appropriate&#8217; balance between human use of national parks and their protection is a topic of considerable public, scientific and business interest and is thus an important focus for research. An increasingly affluent and mobile western society has made tourism the world&#8217;s largest industry; an industry with a significant reliance on the attractions of protected areas such as national parks and their wildlife. Regional communities have benefited from protected areas through local tourism expenditure and government recognition of the economic and social values realized from protected areas. High levels of visitation, and the management of this human use require effective management. But tensions arise when park managers invoke policies and management prescriptions to mitigate the adverse affects of human use. These actions and the way they are implemented can have an alienating impact on local communities, particularly those with a direct business dependency on park tourism. This thesis explores the notion that truly sustainable management of national parks can only be achieved if park managers and communities living adjacent to parks work together in a partnership to meet each other&#8217;s needs and through this process, foster the long-term environmental, social and economic benefits that can be derived from these parks. This thesis documents how a local community perceives its park managers and thereby the impact that park management has on local communities. It then seeks to identify the opportunities for park managers and communities to improve the way they view each other and the skills, attitudes and approaches necessary to create the environment for a sustainable relationship and can deliver sustainable outcomes for both parties.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainable management of national parks, Exmouth and Coral Bay communities, Ningaloo coast, park management, community stewardship of parks</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of mathematics teachers' beliefs and practices following a professional development intervention based on constructivist principles</field><field name="creator">Stoker, John</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the beliefs and related classroom practices of a selected group of in-service teachers within the context of a mathematics professional development intervention for primary school teachers in the Eastern Cape of South Africa.

The professional development intervention took place in a context of transition and transformation in education in South Africa. Curriculum transformation has been inspired by the production of a national policy document known as Curriculum 2005. This document rests on the theoretical assumptions of a learner-centred, outcomes-based approach within a constructivist framework. The professional development experiences of the RUMEP intervention were based on a strongly constructivist rationale recognising the need for key teachers to implement learner-centred, outcomes-based approaches in their classrooms. Although the study included both qualitative and quantitative data gathering techniques the research paradigm was mainly interpretive. From the group of 34 key teachers, a purposive sample of three cases was selected for classroom observation. Two observation periods of six months each made up the First Phase and Second Phase classroom visits, interspersed with intensive professional development contact sessions.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">key teachers, constructivist learning, school environments.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13819</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The changing role of teachers in embedding ICTs into the curriculum: a case study in a Tasmanian school</field><field name="creator">Purnell, Dianne</field><field name="description">Information Communication Technology (ICT) can provide innovative learning experiences, but in all cases a great deal depends upon the teacher to provide the context to make this possible.

In particular, it looks at what motivates teachers to change their practice, in what ways their practice changes and what support is essential for that change to be lasting and worthwhile.Three learning areas were selected for the study, LOTE, English, and Mathematics. There were a total of eleven teachers plus the researcher and eight classes of students. The majority of data collected was qualitative in the form of documents, interview and observations. Quantitative data was collected mainly through surveys.The study focused on the following key elements required for teachers to embed ICTs into the curriculum:1) The role of management;2) The role of teachers (pedagogical, technical);3) Requirements for technical assistance;4) Time allocation; and5) Professional development.Resulting from the study are a series of recommendations for education departments, Principals, ICT managers and teachers to assist them in implement the embedding of ICTs into the curriculum.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computers in education, Information Communication Technology, teachers' role.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A pilot investigation of the volunteer work participation of mental health consumers</field><field name="creator">Young, Janelle Margaret</field><field name="description">Mental illness is often associated with social isolation, unemployment and limited community participation. Mental health rehabilitation services aim to decrease these psychosocial effects of illness and encourage better community integration for mental health consumers. Volunteer work is one avenue in which consumers can become actively involved with their local communities. However whilst often supported clinically, limited empirical evidence exists which supports the use of volunteer work as a potential mode of rehabilitation for consumers. The overall aim of this study was to document consumer perceptions and experiences with volunteer work and to identify if participation in volunteer work has a positive impact on their mental health. Phase one of this study involved in-depth interviews with nine consumers currently volunteering. Themes identified from these interviews supported the notion that volunteer work is a meaningful occupation for consumers and one which promotes community integration and supports consumer recovery. Findings from the interviews also guided the development of a volunteer scale for later use within the study. Phase two involved the development and pilot testing of a volunteering questionnaire which measured consumer attitudes and experiences with volunteer work. This scale was combined with other standardised tests which measured the mental health variables of personal empowerment and quality of life. Phase three involved the administration of the questionnaire battery developed in phase two. The battery was distributed and completed by thirty consumers, including both those who were and were not volunteering. Analysis conducted identified that overall consumers held a positive view of volunteer work, believing it was a way of developing work skills, friendships and promoting positive mental health.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mental illness, social isolation, unemployment, limited community participation, rehabilitation services, psychosocial effects, volunteer work</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive cocci isolated from poultry in Western Australia : an assessment of poultry meat as a vehicle for the transmission of resistant strains via the food chain.</field><field name="creator">Bertolatti, Dean</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to examine whether Gram-positive cocci isolated from processed poultry in Western Australia provided a potential risk for the transfer of antimicrobial-resistant organisms to humans via commercially prepared ready-to-eat chicken. Research in this study was conducted in three phases: the characterisation of Gram-positive cocci isolated from poultry, an assessment of the isolates' thermal tolerance and the development of a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) based food-safety program. In the first phase of the study, three specific objectives were investigated. The first determined the presence of Gram-positive cocci on poultry and on processing equipment from poultry-processing plants. The findings confirm the presence of staphylococci and enterococci on incoming live and slaughtered birds and processed carcasses. The data also indicate that carcasses probably become cross-contaminated during processing, when these bacteria are present on the incoming live birds and equipment. The second objective was to characterise staphylococcal isolates by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and chromosomal and plasmid DNA analysis. The susceptibility of isolates to antimicrobial agents was tested by the disk diffusion method according to the NCCLS (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) guidelines. Isolates were typed by contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) gel electrophoresis of SmaI digested chromosomal DNA, and plasmids were isolated by the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method. Approximately 37% of Staphylococcus aureus and 16% of coagulase-negative staphylococcal (CNS) isolates were resistant to six or more of the antimicrobial agents tested. Many isolates exhibited resistance to antibiotics that are commonly used in human medicine and registered for veterinary use in Australia.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">food safety program, poultry meat, Gram-positive cocci, antimicrobial resistance.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12997</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effectiveness of an outreach programme in science and mathematics for disadvantaged grade 12 students in South Africa</field><field name="creator">Hartley, Mogamat S.</field><field name="description">This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a computer-based outreach programme that addresses one aspect of a national strategic recommendation in South Africa. This outreach programme, which started in 1982, was in its twentieth year of existence in 2001 and provided support in mathematics and physical science to Grade 12 students and teachers from historically disadvantaged schools. This study examined the role that the outreach programmes played at two schools during 2001 and endeavoured to provide an analysis of the intended, implemented, perceived and achieved programmes for this year. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of this outreach programme in providing support to both teachers and students in the teaching and learning of mathematics and physical science. The goals and objectives of the outreach programme (the intended programme) were identified from documentation of the Outreach Project and interviews with Outreach Project managers. In addressing the implementation of the outreach programme (the implemented programme), lessons at each of the two, Mini-Computer Supported Education Centres (MICSECs) were observed over a period of four months. At one centre (Centre A), the lessons consisted of a formal (talk-and-chalk) presentation followed by an informal part when students worked on the computer in the same period. At the second centre (Centre B), the MICSEC was used as an adjunct to the normal classroom lesson, that is, students were taught in their normal classrooms and then, at least once a week, taken by their teacher to the MICSEC to do problem-solving on the computers. The perceptions of students (the perceived programme) were examined by an actual and preferred version of the Computer-Assisted Learning Environment Questionnaire and by interviews conducted with both individual students and groups.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer-assisted learning, mathematics education, science education, University of Western Cape outreach programme.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development and validation of a learning environment instrument for CSIRO Science Education Centres</field><field name="creator">Harington, Darrel G.</field><field name="description">Past research into defining and measuring the characteristics of learning environments in Science Education Centres and Science Museums (SECSMs) has been based upon low-inference measures, such as observations and interviews.

A review of learning environment research identified a possible procedure for the development of, and a format for, a suitable instrument. Research in SECSMs was reviewed to identify learning environment factors that defined the CSIROSEC learning environment.

Each epoch is characterised by a particular focus or paradigm of clinical management, which prevails over a period of time but is then followed by a comparatively short period of rapid change to a new paradigm. Such changes are shaped by a number of forces, but three categories can be readily identified. These are: concepts of mental illness; reactions of administrative systems and the attitudes of medical practitioners. As the concept of the nature of mental illness has changed, succeeding epochs have evolved to a more humane and enlightened approach to the mentally ill. Nevertheless, each management paradigm has failed to deliver the expected 'cures' and the consequent reduction in the burden of illness. Each has been replaced by a new and radically different paradigm, often at enormous cost, but there has been no progressive evolution towards a system that incorporates measures that have proven value. In recent years 'Community Care', has failed in such a manner that there have been strong arguments that it should be abandoned. At the same time there is evidence that a new paradigm 'Primary Care Psychiatry' is emerging as government policy. The challenge is to preserve the best elements of community care and integrate Primary Care Psychiatry into the broader framework. The best chance of achieving this is to develop a gradual, evolutionary process, built on consensus between psychiatrists, general practitioners and administrators.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community-based mental health service, mental illness, primary care psychiatry.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple perspectives on the teaching and learning of mathematics in rural South African schools in the context of national curriculum reform</field><field name="creator">Morar, Tulsidas</field><field name="description">This study investigates the teaching and learning of mathematics in four rural schools in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The study is set against the backdrop of Curriculum 2005 (C2005) - an outcome based curriculum reform initiative that has been introduced to all South African schools. The objective of the study is to investigate the teaching and learning practices of four rural teachers of mathematics in this complex reform milieu. The following broad research question guides this study: "How do teachers interpret and implement the new mathematics curriculum in terms of a political perspective (how teachers and learners are connected to the curriculum); a socio cultural perspective (what adjustments the teacher makes to accommodate the learners' circumstances); and a practical perspective (how the teacher implements the goals of C2001?" The South African situation provides a unique and particularly challenging context for teaching and learning and curriculum reform. It is understood that schools differ - and therefore curriculum issues cannot be solved through general pronouncements but rather viewed from a multiplicity of perspectives. In this thesis, I examine the teaching and learning of mathematics in four rural classrooms in the Eastern Cape. By way of honouring the contextual complexity of the situation, 1 have adopted a multiple perspectives approach to analysing what goes on in these four classrooms.

There is necessary the more cost-efficient primary prevention strategies are equally, if not more important. Youth have been identified as an important primary prevention target group in public health initiatives designed to reduce drug-related harm. Strengthening parents' capacity to reduce children's risk of alcohol, tobacco and other drug-related harm is also recognised as an important strategy. The first chapter of this thesis introduces this public health issue, provides a summary of the present state of play regarding parent-training intervention research, and presents the research hypotheses. A comprehensive review of the epidemiological, empirical, and theoretical literature pertaining to this research is presented in Chapter 2. Recreational alcohol, tobacco and other drug (ATOD) use results in some 23 000 deaths (representing around 18% of all deaths) and the premature loss of some 160 000 person-years of life each year in Australia. The social consequences have been estimated to cost the Australian community almost $19 billion annually. The prevalence of young people in these data is also cause for concern. In Western Australia (WA), nearly one third of the alcohol-related deaths in the period 1993-1995 occurred in people aged less than 25 years. In 1995 in WA, alcohol use was responsible for almost two thirds of all drug-related deaths in those aged 15-34 years. Furthermore, road crashes accounted for almost half (45%) of the deaths among those aged under 25 years in WA and alcohol was a leading factor in these crashes. There is agreement that the use of ATODs is a learned behaviour and therefore broadbased psychosocial theories offer the most promising explanation for its onset.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alcohol tobacco and other drugs (ATOD), home-based ATOD education, parent-directed drug education.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negotiating sustainability in the media: critical perspectives on the popularisation of environmental concerns</field><field name="creator">Brodscholl, Per Christian</field><field name="description">Despite intensified and concerted efforts to realise sustainable development.

By using a critical discourse analysis perspective to analyse texts produced by actors with competing political commitments (neo-liberal and left-liberal), it discusses how primarily profit-driven generic conventions can govern what can and cannot be said in debates on sustainability. The thesis suggests that the effectiveness of (cultural) politics aimed at legitimating and de-legitimating neo-liberal approaches can be understood in teens of the relationship between an instrumental rationality geared at maximising the effectiveness of existing institutional systems and a communicative rationality geared at achieving understanding.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">media discourses on sustainability, critical discourse analysis, discoursal hybridity.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role Of Students: Perceptions In Modifying Science And Mathematics Classroom Activities</field><field name="creator">Nannestad, Charles Leif</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to provide teachers with a practical means to obtain timely indications of their students reactions to individual activities. Teachers could then modify their presentations of activities cognisant of those students perceptions. The study set out to establish a suitable instrument, and then to evaluate its use by classroom teachers.Five experienced science and mathematics teachers identified five characteristics of interest when considering students perceptions of classroom activities: Understand Content, Communication, Relevancy, Work Output, and Enjoyment. A fifteen-item instrument based upon these characteristics was developed for this study. The viability of the survey for use by busy classroom teachers was increased by the short and succinct format, as well as the provision of a computer graphing template to process and display responses. The combination of the survey and computer template is called the Students' Perceptions of an Activity Instrument and Display (SPAID).Teachers appreciated the provision of a structure to assist their reviewing the use of activities, and the rapidity with which the information was available. Students' responses provided timely support for teachers' decisions to engage classes in the activities and increased teachers' confidence in the worth of the activities. Alterations to activities were small in scale and idiosyncratic to the student cohorts.

In the Swan River Estuary, Western Australia, the chemical pollutants of concern released into the river are petroleum hydrocarbons and sodium pentachlorophenate (NaPCP). Decreased water quality causes a loss of biotic diversity especially amongst fish populations. The health of aquatic ecosystems can be monitored by fish health, especially fish located at higher levels in the food chain. Pink snapper (Pagrus auratus), an endemic Western Australian fish species, was tested for its potential as a bioindicator of aquatic environmental health. This thesis presents data on the responsiveness of pink snapper to the contaminants of concern, using biomarkers such as serum sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), mixed function oxygenase (MFO), metabolic enzymes such as citrate synthase (CS), cytochrome C oxidase (CCO) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the histological alteration such as hepatic cell lesions (hyperplasia and hypertrophy), and glycogen and lipid droplets. The metabolic enzymes CCO and LDH as well as the hepatic MFO induction and histopathology were proven to be the most suitable biomarkers for use for routine monitoring of the Swan River Estuary using pink snapper as a bioindicator. However, CS activity and hepatic cell lesions (hyperplasia and hypertrophy) did not respond to exposure to contamination and are therefore not suited as biomarkers of effects in pink snapper. The first phase of the study aimed at investigating the responsiveness of juvenile pink snapper to an MFO inducer. Polychlorinated biphenyl isomer # 126 was selected as a model MFO inducer for this study. In the initial experiment, MFO activity was measured as a biomarker of exposure, and serum SDH activity was assessed as a biomarker of liver damage.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chemical pollutants, biomarkers, aquatic environment monitoring, aquatic ecosystems.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Futures imaging: student views, mediation and learning through science</field><field name="creator">Lloyd, David G.</field><field name="description">The thesis presents a critique of the nature of 13 to 15 year-old students' images of futures. Arguments are made for their importance to the individual community and culture and their value and use in a science learning setting.This study of the nature of futures images is based upon data collected from small samples in two school settings between 1990 and 1999 using a guided fantasy approach. The diversity of student hopes and fears for futures is categorised using several research tools developed from the futures literature. The results identify a range of futures scenarios ranging from highly utopic to highly dystopic and themes including human interactions, the natural and built environment and the nature and use of futuristic technologies.The importance of student images of futures is discussed from the personal perspective of the students and then considered in the broader context of society and Western culture. The data are examined through a number of theoretical frames including psychology, history and the futures field of enquiry. The consensus seems to be that expectations of the future are inseparable from human nature and influential in determining the viability of cultures.The value of student images of futures in science learning is explored through a case study of one of my own Year 9 classes. In teaching this class I used the technique of futures imaging integrated into a critical futures teaching approach utilising a constructivist planning model. I found that students' futures images revealed a broader aspect of student worldviews than is usual in science learning environments, and were valuable in exposing student prior knowledge, interests and concerns.

Polyculture also increases ecological stability and assists recycling processes, which can result in synergistic benefits to participating species. In aquaculture, this synergism can result in increased profitability through advanced growth rates and/or reduced feed input. However, many of the inherent advantages of aquatic polyculture rely on cohabitants occupying distinct ecological niches within the system. In Western Australia, opportunities to multi-crop aquatic species are limited by species choice due to low natural diversity and strict translocation policies. This creates a situation where available aquaculture species exhibit overlaps in occupied niches. Effects of this overlap can include direct predation, increased intraspecific conflict, and competition for resources such as shelter and food. Prior to this study, silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) were identified as a prime candidate for duoculture with marron, based on favourable schooling and feeding characteristics, and preliminary trials demonstrated commercial benefits, including synergistic growth advantages to marron. However, investigations also showed that silver perch will predate on both small and moulting crayfish under certain conditions, and that growth of silver perch was inhibited when held in cages to prevent predation. The work reported in this thesis was undertaken to address the niche overlap existing between marron and silver perch, and therefore assist the marron industry in Western Australia in implementing appropriate management strategies for diversification.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marron industry in Western Australia, Australian aquaculture, multi-species systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of students' perceptions of teacher support and equity in the classroom and their impact on students' attitude towards science</field><field name="creator">Lalor, Jennifer</field><field name="description">This study investigated the relationship between students&#8217; perceptions of learning environments and their attitude to science in Australian secondary schools. It focussed on teacher support and equity in the lower secondary school years of 8, 9, and 10. Teacher Support and Equity are two of the five scales of the What Is Happening In this Class (WIHIC) questionnaire. The scale to measure Attitude to Science was drawn from the Test of Science Related Attitudes (TOSRA). Using the statistical package SPSS, gender differences and year level differences were examined for each of the scales. Results showed that the females rated the scales of Teacher Support and Equity more highly than did the males but the males had a more positive attitude to science than did the females. The Year 9 students were considerably less positive than those from years 8 and 10 on all three scales. Of the three scales, Equity received the highest rating across all the groups, while Attitude scored the lowest. Regression analysis showed statistically significant and positive associations between Attitude to Science and the Teacher Support and Equity scales. These results were consistent when tested separately for the male and female students, and for each of the year levels. To gain insights into science teaching and learning from a teacher&#8217;s perspective, one primary teacher, two high school teachers, and one pre-service teacher were interviewed.

The practice of mapping making extensive use of satellite remote sensing and airborne platforms is well established for terrestrial management. Marine biological resource mapping however is not readily available except in part from that derived for surface waters from satellite based ocean colour mapping. Perhaps the most fundamental reason is that of sampling difficulty, which involves broad areas of seabed coverage, irregularities of seabed surface and depth. Conventional grab sample techniques are widely accepted as a standard seabed mapping methodology that has been in use long before the advent of acoustic techniques and continue to be employed. However. they are both slow and labour intensive, factors which severely limit the spatial coverage available from practical grab sampling programs. While acoustic techniques have been used for some time in pelagic biomass assessment, only recently have acoustic techniques been applied to marine biological resource mapping of benthic communities. Two commercial bottom classifiers available in the market that use normal incidence echosounders are the RoxAnn and QTC View systems. Users and practitioners should be cautious however when using black box implementations of the two commercial systems without a proper quality control over raw acoustic data since some researchers in their studies have indicated problems with these two bottom classifiers such as, among others, a depth dependence.

For expatriate managers, successful adjustment is imperative and fundamental in establishing overall effectiveness during overseas assignments. It is intriguing that organizations often blame the individual when expatriate assignments fail (Deresky 2002; Hodgetts and Luthans 2000; Swaak 1995a; Tung 1987) rather than recognizing that others may lack understanding of what it is like to be immersed in another culture. A study of Canadian expatriate managers who have worked in non-government organizations (NGOs) in Indonesia is presented. The research focuses on interpreting the lived experience of expatriate managers using their own words and meanings. Written descriptions from research participants were obtained via email and analysed/synthesized using Giorgi's descriptive phenomenological method (Giorgi 1975; 1985; Giorgi &amp; Giorgi 2003). The central finding of the study is that expatriates experience paradoxical ways of being including feelings of: understanding/not understanding, discomfort/comfort, powerfulness/powerlessness, belonging/not belonging, being open to the new culture/yet holding on to own culture, freedom/restriction, being supported/not supported, and being unchanged/changed when immersed, living and working in another culture. The new knowledge and understanding obtained from this research may result in alterations to present human resource management practices and strategies utilized in facilitating and supporting expatriate assignments.

Relatively few have examined the complex interactions between zooplankton grazers and the type and quality of food available, or the role of zooplankton grazers in structuring phytoplankton communities, or their contribution to the nutrient pool. The ecological role of zooplankton grazers in the Swan River estuary, Perth, Western Australia, was examined as part of a collaborative research project directed by the Western Australian Estuarine Research Foundation, which was established in response to concern about increasing intensity and persistence of algal blooms. The present study focussed on one component of the zooplankton, the Copepoda, as model zooplankton grazers. A regular zooplankton monitoring programme, undertaken over a two year period, provided data on seasonal patterns of abundance and distribution of zooplankton over a broad spectrum of physical conditions. Relationships were identified between habitat variables, such as algal biomass, dissolved oxygen, salinity and suspended solids and zooplankton distribution, relative abundance and species composition. Prior to the inception of this study, it was assumed that copepod species composition, abundance and richness in the Swan River estuary may have changed over time, in response to long-term declines in water quality. Comparison of historical copepod monitoring data with current data did not detect any such change and it was concluded that there was greater variation in copepod species composition, abundance and richness within years than between years and that no significant change had occurred between 1966 and 1997.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">zooplankton, phytoplankton, grazing dynamics, nutrient interactions, estuarine health.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The measurement of stability in aphasia recovery: implications for language modelling</field><field name="creator">Ciccone, Natalie A.</field><field name="description">Background: Performance stability is an implicit assumption within theoretical explanations of aphasia. The assumption being that when completing language processing tasks, performance will be stable from moment to moment and day to day. Theoretically, aphasia is most commonly viewed within a modular framework. that is, language processing is carried out by specific, specialised language processing modules. Aphasia is thought to result when one of these modules is dammed leading to a unique pattern of performance results. Implicit to this view of aphasia is stability, once damaged, the module will no longer be accessed and any process using the module will be impaired. This theory of aphasia is widely held within both research and clinical communities and underlies many of our approaches to the assessment and treatment of aphasia. However more recently researchers have been expressing doubts about the validity of assuming stability in aphasia performance. Instead variability in performance is being reported and alternative explanations of aphasia are being provided. One of these considers aphasia to result from a reduction in or the inefficient allocation of cognitive resources. Aims: This research explored variability in aphasic performance, with the aim to examine variability over a range of tasks and time periods. Methods and Procedures: Eight aphasic and ten non-brain damaged individuals participated in eight sessions. Within these sessions they completed a spontaneous language task; which contained four different narrative genres. a lexical decision task and a simple reaction task.\</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">language processing, aphasic performance, aphasia.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effectiveness of predict-observe-explain technique in diagnosing students' understanding of science and identifying their level of achievement</field><field name="creator">Liew, Chong-Wah</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research program was to explore the effectiveness of the Predict- Observe-Explain (POE) teachingllearning technique to diagnose students' understanding of science and identify students' level of achievement with reference to the Science Student Outcome Statements for Australian schools. This research employed an interpretive action research approach with a sample of students from three Australian metropolitan high schools in grades 9, 10, 11, and 12, whose ages ranged between 14 and 17 years. Three data collection methods were used to generate data for interpretation, namely, written POE responses of students, in-class journals and student interviews. Data collected were interpreted using three theoretical perspectives, namely, Chi et al.'s theory of ontological categories, Hewson and Hennessey's conceptual change theory to determine the epistemological status of students' understanding of science, and Chinn and Brewer's model to classify types of students' responses to contradictory observations. This purpose of using this methodology was to obtain an in-depth, plausible and credible account of students' understanding and their level of achievement. POE tasks were concerned with heat and the expansion of water, solubility of salt, and power and resistance of light globes. The data revealed common ideas amongst students that are contrary to scientists' science; furthermore, students showed that they were able to articulate their own ideas based on the POE tasks. The findings in this research reveal that these POEs were effective in capturing a range of possible student observations and prediction outcomes when worded in an open-ended format.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interpreting students' understanding, POE tasks, science educaiton.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15777</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Benchmarking to trigger and sustain the introduction of cleaner production in small to medium sized enterprises</field><field name="creator">Altham, William Ashley</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates benchmarking (and associated capacity building activities) as a trigger for the diffusion and implementation of Cleaner Production. The critical success factors for the environmental benchmarking process are: The identification of gaps in environmental performance in areas important to the long-term future of the businesses; Providing and/or promoting the drivers to close the performance gaps; Ensuring business managers possess the ability and tools to close the performance gap. A program was developed implementing these factors and delivered to the drycleaning industry in Western Australia. This program identified large performance gaps for the different Eco-Efficiency indicators. The participants accepted the benchmarks (which are amended for 'economies of scale' if required) as suitable targets and committed their businesses to achieving these in their action plans. Economic benefits, managing environmental risk and maintaining their licence to operate were found to be important drivers. Participants on average reduced hazardous waste generation by 48%, improved their chemical efficiency by 30% and their energy efficiency by 9%, while individual business manager's levels of Eco-Efficiency improvements varied widely. The businesses with the higher levels of productivity and the greatest experience in the industry obtained the greatest improvements in Eco-Efficiency from the program. Furthermore, the business managers involved in the program had a significantly higher uptake of Cleaner Production in comparison with control groups, both inside the drycleaning sector as well as in 3 other sectors dominated by small to medium-sized enterprises.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">benchmarking, drycleaners, small business, cleaner production.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14708</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Professional learning in a school-based community of science teachers</field><field name="creator">Melville, Wayne Stuart</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates professional learning in a school-based community of science teachers. Transcripts of science staff meetings were analysed using two frameworks. These frameworks relate to the notions of community and professional learning. The school-based community is interpreted in terms of three metaphors of understanding: meanings, practice and identity. Professional learning is interpreted in terms of how the teachers learn the episteme, techne and phronesis of their science teaching. I propose that professional learning occurs when teachers engage in virtues-based personal reflection and/or public discourse around episteme, techne and phronesis in the spaces 'in-between' the metaphors of community. This proposition raises implications for the accessibility of professional learning and the relationship between community and organisational boundaries.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community and professional learning, science education, teacher professionalism.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16182</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practicals in science education: a study of the theoretical bases, rationale and implementation of practicals in junior secondary science education</field><field name="creator">Bradley, Duncan</field><field name="description">This study explores the issues involved in the theoretical bases, rationale and implementation of practical work in junior secondary science programs. The part that practical work has played in science education, both internationally and in Australia, is reviewed. Links are made between statements made by science educators more than 200 years ago to those made by modern day researchers into science teaching and learning. The study draws together the research traditions of the philosophy of science, science curriculum development, learning environments, and educational psychology. The researcher has carried out a multi-stage field study using both qualitative and quantitative methods to achieve the objectives of the study. Developments in the philosophy of science as they impinge on science education are reviewed. Science practicals are defined for the purposes of this study and a new Theoretical Model for Science Practicals is proposed. The model enables the description and statement of purpose of eight types of science practicals. The target population of the study is Australian science teachers and students. The model provides a theoretical basis for the development of the survey instrument, Science Practicals Inventory (SPI), to investigate students&#8217; perceptions of the use of practicals in science learning. The eight types of practicals described in the model were used as the scales for the SPI. Qualitative data collected during separate group interviews of science teachers and students supported the development of the SPI together with quantitative data from three pilot studies. The SPI was validated using samples of high school students from Tasmania and Western Australia.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Science Practicals Inventory (SPI), laboratory skills, science education in Australia, practical work in science education.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The culture of computer classrooms in single-sex and mixed-sex secondary schools in Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Logan, Kerina Ann</field><field name="description">The participation by females in computing education has become an issue in the Western world. Fewer females than males are observed at all levels of computer education. As the level becomes more advanced the loss of females is both cumulative and progressive. Reports from the United Kingdom, the United States, and New Zealand indicate that at secondary level boys significantly outnumber girls in higher-skill computing courses and at tertiary level the numbers of females enrolling has declined over the past decade. The motivation for this research was a desire to understand why females were not enrolling in computing classes, and when they did, why their retention was poor. A review of the literature regarding females and computing indicated that there were certain features evident in the computing classroom believed to contribute to a unique culture existing in the computing learning environment. These included the context in which computing is historically embedded, the lack of female teachers as role models and the nature of the classroom itself, where male attitudes towards computers and games play a critical role. Throughout the literature the culture of computing was shown to be strongly embedded in male values, and unattractive to many females. For this reason, some researchers suggest that single-sex classrooms or schools may provide a more supportive learning environment for both female and male students. Therefore this study explored the computer classroom learning environment of senior secondary school students at three different types of school, single-sex girls' and boys' schools and mixed-sex schools. A mixed-method research design was adopted to investigate the nature of the classroom learning environment in which computing is situated and to determine ways by which it might be made more equitable.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CUCEI, computer studies classroom, culture of computing.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15049</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of impurities and additives in the crystallisation of gypsum</field><field name="creator">Muryanto, Stefanus</field><field name="description">Scale formation is one of the persistent problems in mineral processing and related industries. One of the main components of the scale is frequently gypsum or calcium sulphate dihydrate (= CaS04.2H20). Gypsum is formed through the process of crystallisation, and it is well known that crystallisation process is significantly affected by the presence of admixtures. Industrially, scale formation occurs in an environment which is very rarely free from the presence of admixtures. In a typical mineral processing industry, certain types of admixtures are present, which may include metallic ions (e.g. originated from corrosion products) and certain types of the flotation agents used. The effect of admixtures on crystallisation kinetics and cyclical morphology can be very significant, even if they are present in trace amounts. It is important to emphasise that the effects are generally specific, that there is no unified theory that applies to all and every situation. The present study has investigated the effect of certain admixtures on gypsum crystallisation, and was accomplished in three phases of experiments: (1) seeded batch crystallisation; (2) seeded continuous crystallisation, and (3) once through flow system under isothermal condition. The three phases of the work used equimolar solutions of CaC12 and Na2SO4 to produce CaS04 which is the precipitating species. The seeded batch crystallisation experiment explored the effect of two flotation agents commonly used in mineral processing plants: (1) sodium isopropyl xanthate (= SIPX) and, (2) isopropyl thionocarbamate. The experiments were performed at 25, 35, and 45&#176;C, respectively. The initial concentration of the crystallising solution was 2,000 ppm of Ca 21 and it reached the equilibrium concentration values of between 1,000 and 8,00 ppm of Ca 2+ in 90 minutes.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mineral processing, scale formation, gypsum scale, crystallisation kinetics.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemoprophylaxis for the prevention of endophthalmitis after cataract surgery: patterns of use and economic costs</field><field name="creator">Rosha, Deepinder Singh</field><field name="description">Objectives: The objectives of study were to (i) examine the regional differences in methods of performing cataract surgery across different jurisdictions in Australia and New Zealand (ii) identify risk factors for post-operative endophthalmitis and (iii) explore the implication of changes in surgical practice on the number of cases of post-operative endophthalmitis and resultant net cost to health system. Methods: Cataract surgeons across Australia and New Zealand were surveyed about their demographics, surgical techniques, use of pre- and post-operative antibiotics and antiseptics and cases of post-operative endophthalmitis. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine the regional variations in the use of methods of chemoprophylaxis and surgical practices. Multivariate Poisson regression was performed to identify factors associated with the incidence of post-operative endophthalmitis. A cost analysis was conducted to determine the impact of an increased use of chemoprophylatic treatment on the number of cases of post-operative endophthalmitis and net cost savings to the health system from its use. In addition, the results of the current survey of surgical practices of cataract surgeons was compared with those from an earlier survey conducted approximately 10 years ago. Result: The response to the survey of ophthalmologists was 82%, but after excluding ophthalmologists who did little or no cataract surgery, the study sample comprised 540 participants of the 896 who were initially sent the survey. Participating cataract surgeons reported 162,120 cataract surgeries and 92 cases of post-operative endophthalmitis, an incidence rate of 0.056%.

The construct of perfectionism was examined in this research by exploring differences between positive and negative perfectionism. The literature to date has focused almost exclusively on perfectionism as a maladaptive construct, with little research examining if perfectionism can be a positive factor. The implication of the study was to determine if some factors identified may be potentially important in future treatments targeted towards perfectionism, as there is some evidence to suggest that perfectionism may predict poorer response to standard cognitive behavioural treatment. This research compared three different groups; (i) a clinical group with diagnoses of anxiety and depression (n = 40); (ii) a group of athletes (n = 111) and (iii) a student control group (n = 101). The research consisted of 5 studies. In Study 1, evidence was found for the validity, consistency of factor structure and internal consistency of the Positive and Negative Perfectionism Subscale (PANPS; Terry-Short, Owens, Slade, &amp; Dewey, 1995). In Study 2, clinical participants with a range of diagnoses were found to have significantly higher overall perfectionism and negative perfectionism compared to athletes and controls. Rigidity predicted higher positive perfectionism. Dichotomous thinking accounted for a large proportion of variance in negative perfectionism, and was argued to be an important factor distinguishing between positive and negative perfectionism. In Study 3, positive perfectionism was found to relate to faster performance time in athletes competing in triathlons, and negative perfectionism was not found to impede sporting performance.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">perfectionists, personality disorders, Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS-F), Positive and Negative Perfectionism Scale (PANPS).</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between the persistent illusion of movement and traumatic anxiety in a non-clinical sample</field><field name="creator">Dellar, Brendon</field><field name="description">This thesis was concerned with investigating a visual-illusionary phenomenon that co-occurs with post-traumatic anxiety symptoms. More specifically, individuals who report recurring specific memories of a fearful event (RSM) also tend to report a persistent illusion of movement (PIM) upon prolonged visual fixation (Tym, Dyck &amp; McGrath, 2000). The development of a visual test (i-Test) designed to reliably elicit PIM has enabled research to be conducted on the nature and correlates of this type of visual disturbance. The present research aimed: 1) To develop a standard protocol for assessment of PIM and RSM; 2) to test the reliability of the i-Test in eliciting PIM in a student sample 3) to test the predictive relationship between dissociation and anxiety symptoms with PIM and RSM 4) to formulate and test a hypothesis regarding a mechanism underlying PIM. The first study screened 142 participants for RSM and PIM using self-administered questionnaires designed by Tym (personal communication, 2001). There was an unexpectedly high rate (54.2%) of PIM and RSM (37.3%) in the sample, which appeared to be the product of questionnaire design limitations. Two semi-structured interviews were developed and subsequently tested on a new sample of 50 participants in Study 2. Study 2 documented intra-rater and inter-rater reliability co-efficient of sufficient strength to indicate good reliability for the semi-structured interviews. The results of Study 2 indicate that PIM is a relatively stable symptom over a 30-minute and one-week test-retest time frame.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">recurring specific memories (RSM), visual disturbances, persistent illusion of movement (PIM).</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The cultural and social dimensions of successful teaching and learning in an urban science classroom</field><field name="creator">Martin, Sonya Nichole</field><field name="description">This critical ethnography focused on improving the teaching and learning of chemistry in a diverse, urban, tenth-grade classroom in high-achieving magnet high school serving students of differing cultural, social, and historical backgrounds.

Conducted within the methodological and theoretical frameworks of critical ethnography, this research employed collaborative research, autobiographical reflection, the sociology of emotions, and cogenerative dialogues as tools by which to examine the influence of structure and the social and historical contexts of lived experiences on teacher and student practices in the context of the science learning that took place in our classroom. The methods employed in this ethnography were designed to catalyze social transformation by identifying contradictions within structures and then finding ways to alter these structures to expand the agency of all those involved. Specifically I asked the following questions: 1) How do practices and schemas gained by being within school structures afford the structures of the classroom field? 2) How can the structures of the classroom be transformed to allow students and teachers greater exchange of capital (social, cultural, and symbolic)? 3) How does the exchange of capital afford agency for the participants? 4) How can participants' actions transform the structures associated with school and the classroom to break cycles of reproduction? Using multiple data resources such as field notes, videotape, interviews and artifacts, our research team was able to elicit and support findings at micro-, meso-, and macroscopic levels to answer these questions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teaching and learning of chemistry, ethnography.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17096</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching and Learning Genetics with Multiple Representations</field><field name="creator">Tsui, Chi-Yan</field><field name="description">This study investigated the secondary school students' learning of genetics when their teachers included an interactive computer program BioLogica in classroom teaching and learning. Genetics is difficult to teach and learn at school because it is conceptually and linguistically complex for students who have little or no prior knowledge about it. Yet genetics is now central to learning and research in biomedical sciences and is essential for understanding contemporary issues such as genetic engineering and cloning. Interactive multimedia programs such as BioLogica have provided new opportunities for learning as these programs feature multiple external representations (MERs) of knowledge in different formats, including visualgraphical and verbal-textual and at different levels of organisation. Users can manipulate and observe the behaviour of these MERs. Ainsworth (1999) summarised three functions of MERs claimed by researchers in supporting learners - to provide complementary information or processes, to constrain interpretations of phenomena and to promote construction of deeper understanding of the domain. Using an interpretive, case-based research approach with multiple methods and multiple sources of data, this study was guided by two foci of inquiry - teachers' integration and implementation of BioLogica in their classroom teaching, and students' learning with BioLogica alongside other resources. The theoretical framework drew on perspectives from educational psychology, the conceptual learning model in science education, and cognitive/computational sciences.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">secondary school, interactive multimedia, genetics.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficiency improvements for small-scale reverse-osmosis systems</field><field name="creator">Susanto-Lee, Robertus</field><field name="description">The water supplies of some small inland communities may come in the form of river systems that offer brackish water.

While such reform has been attributed to fiscal necessity due to increased health costs, the underlying causes are far more complex. Demographic changes, new technologies, expanded health care procedures and medications, increased demand and the globalization of health services have all contributed to the change and complexity of the industry. Health reform varies from country to country. In Canada, with a publicly funded health industry, the main reform method has been regionalization. This decentralized reform method arranges health services under a regional corporate management structure. The primary objective of this study was to assess the effects of health reform on the educational development of health-care managers in British Columbia, a western province of Canada. The study had a two-fold approach; to ascertain how health reform had changed the skill needs of health-care managers, and whether e-learning could benefit health management education. The key research questions that guided the study were: How might recent changes in the health industry have affected the learning needs and priorities of health-care managers?

The medical records of all patients aged &gt;/= 18 years admitted with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital (SGGH) over a 15-week period were reviewed prospectively. The severity of patients' penicillin allergies was assessed using a structured questionnaire. The antibiotic cost was calculated using acquisition, delivery (labour and equipment) and laboratory monitoring costs. The appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing was assessed using the Therapeutic Guidelines: Antibiotic (TG:A). The antimicrobial selections and costs were then compared for those patients with (Group A) and without (Group B) penicillin allergy. 155 patients were reviewed (males 71, females 84) with an average age of 68 &#177; 18 years. Of these, 27 (17.4%) had documented penicillin allergies; of which 12 were classified as Severity I (e.g. anaphylaxis, urticaria), 12 as Severity II (e.g. rash, itch) and three as intolerance (e.g. GI upset). The current TG:A recommends cephalothin or cephazolin as the drugs of choice for mild to moderate CAP patients with a history of penicillin allergy. However, combinations of cephalothin intravenously and azithromycin orally were the most commonly prescribed antimicrobials for such patients. The TG:A recommends erythromycin plus cefotaxime or ceftriaxone as the first-line therapy for severe CAP patients with a documented penicillin allergy.

To be competitive, manufacturers must respond to such uncertainties rapidly and with the greatest flexibility in order to procure and maintain the supply of raw materials resources to sustain their manufacturing operations. Thus, the understanding and measuring of the procurement flexibility are key steps in maintaining a competitive advantage. So, the present study examined the theoretical concepts of procurement flexibility and proposed a generalisable measurement scale for manufacturing procurement flexibility. The scale was based on five supplier-manufacturer procurement dimensions of information exchange, supplier integration, product and component delivery, logistics and organisational structure. Further, each of these dimensions was divided into three flexibility elements of range, uniformity and mobility. A measurement scale was developed fiom a review of extant literature on flexibility relationships, purchasing, procurement and supply chain management using Q-Sort methodology. A mail survey of the major industry groups in the Australian manufacturing industry was undertaken. Principal component analysis and multiple regressions were used to examine the relationships between the flexibility dimensions and their elements. The results indicate that there is still much theory formulation and research to be conducted on procurement flexibility measurement scales. The results also revealed that Australian manufacturers have a limited experience with the flexibility issue and in some cases do not have even a procurement strategy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">manufacturing strategy, supply chain integration, supply chain management.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The distribution pattern of algal flora in saline lakes in Kambalda and Esperance, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Handley, Michelle Anne</field><field name="description">The study has attempted to characterise the physicochemical limnology and distribution of algal flora of two salt lake systems in Western Australia, one from the coastal Esperance region and the other from the inland Kambalda region. Climatic conditions, water regimes and physicochemistry were found to differ markedly between the two lake systems and a total of 171 algal taxa, representing five divisions, were recorded. Of these, 82 were members of Bacillariophyta, 48 of Cyanophyta, 33 of Chlorophyta, two of Euglenophyta and six of Dinophyta. The physical limnology of salt lakes in the Esperance region was seasonally variable, defined by climatic conditions. As such, the lakes investigated in the region exhibited a stable cycle of filling during winter and spring, and drying out in summer. Four of the lakes in the region could be classified as near-permanent, and one as seasonal on the basis of predictability and duration of filling. Seasonal fluctuations in water depth resulted in fluctuations in salinity levels. Salinity levels ranged from subsaline to hypersaline, and all the lakes in the region were alkaline. In addition, the lakes were well mixed in terms of oxygen and temperature, and were impacted by eutrophication from their catchments. They were either mesotrophic or eutrophic with respect to both nitrogen and phosphorus. In geological terms, lakes in the Esperance region were separated only recently from the ocean, and two lakes retain a connection with marine waters, one through a creek during years of high rainfall and one through hydrological interactions with groundwater of marine origin. In general, the algal communities of lakes in the Esperance region were similar to those of other Australian coastal salt lakes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian salt lakes, biota of lakes, algal communities of lakes.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and character of a functionally-graded aluminium titanate/zirconia-alumina composite</field><field name="creator">Pratapa, Suminar</field><field name="description">A functionally-graded Al(subscript)2TiO(subscript)5/ZrO(subscript)2-Al(subscript)2O(subscript)3 (AT/zirconia-alumina) composite has been successfully synthesized by an infiltration process involving an alpha-Al(subscript)2O(subscript)3-ZrO(subscript)2 (90:10 by weight) green body and a solution containing titanium chloride. The mass gain after infiltration has been used to estimate the amount of new phase introduced into the system. The phase composition character of the functionally-graded material (FGM) has been determined by x-ray diffraction. The Rietveld "whole pattern" refinement method was applied to diffraction patterns of the sample which were collected from the surface and at several depths which were made by polishing away the material. Absolute weight fraction determination using the Rietveld external standard method showed that the concentration of AT reduces linearly from the surface to the core. In contrast, the alpha-alumina content increases with depth in a complementary manner. Low level amorphous phase was also observed. Other functionally-graded microstructural profiles examined were x-ray characteristic line intensity of Ti, Ti dot-mapping, and alpha-alumina grain size. The FGM also exhibits graded character in both thermal and mechanical properties, i.e. thermal expansion, microhardness, and Young's modulus. The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of the FGM increased with polishing-depth and approached that of the zirconia-alumina reference sample at a depth of 0.5 mm.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microstructure, composite synthesis, functionally-graded materials (FGMs).</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14696</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Induction of apoptosis in murine malignant mesothelioma cell lines: gene expression and susceptibility</field><field name="creator">Kusmiaty</field><field name="description">Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive and highly chemo-resistant tumour of the mesothelium. Asbestos is indicated as the environmental factor most commonly associated with mesothelioma. The chemo-resistance is possibly due to impaired apoptotic mechanisms since it is known most chemotherapeutic drugs act via apoptosis. Murine MM cell lines that have been derived from tumours induced by inoculation of crocidolite asbestos into mice provide a suitable model, since both phenotypic and biological properties are closely similar to the human disease. Four murine MM cell lines were used in this study, namely ABl, AB12, AC29 and AC34. The aim of this study was to determine susceptibility of those MM cell lines to induction of apoptosis and the expression of key molecules in those cells. Many apoptosis-related genes are known, expression of some of these genes in four murine MM cell lines were investigated in this study. Gene expression was determined using conventional reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitated using real-time RT-PCR with SYBR-Green I detection on a Rotor-Gene 2000 (Corbett Research, N.S.W., Australia). Gene expression data was normalised against the most stable housekeeping genes as determined by the geNonn software. Susceptibility of the four murine MM cell lines to apoptosis induction was determined using cisplatin or TNF-a or IFN-y at different concentrations and at different times in the case of cisplatin. Apoptosis was assessed by a DNA laddering assay. Conventional RT-PCR results showed that all four murine MM cell lines expressed DR5, Bax, Bcl-xL, FLIP-L, c-Myc and caspase-3. Fas mRNA was detected in all cell lines except AC29. Neither FasL nor Bcl-2 was expressed in the four murine MM cell lines.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">malignant mesothelioma (MM), apoptosis-related genes.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Japanese colonial language education in Taiwan and assimilation, 1895-1945</field><field name="creator">Fewings, Catherine Shu-fen (Yu)</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the subject of Japanese colonial language education in Taiwan and assimilation between 1895 and 1945. It examines the overall nature of Japanese colonial rule in Taiwan through its colonial policies, followed by a review of the history of Japanese colonial language education in Taiwan, the investigation of the Japanese colonial position on language education and assimilation, the establishment of the implementation of Japanese language education in Taiwan in areas of teaching methodologies and textbook compilation, and the determination of the effects of Japanese language education on assimilation in Taiwan. The thesis further seeks to determine the link between a Taiwanese identity and the Taiwanese who were ruled and educated under Japanese colonial rule. The views of both the elite and common Taiwanese who lived through the colonial era are examined.The aim of this thesis is to test the hypothesis whether Japanese colonial education in Taiwan achieved assimilation among the Taiwanese as claimed by Japanese colonial authorities. Through the official facts and figures provided by Japanese colonial authorities, they seemed to prove a successful case of assimilation among the Taiwanese. However, through close scrutiny of these official facts and figures and reality backed up by the oral accounts of the Taiwanese and conscientious observations by the Japanese, it is found that the claims made by Japanese colonial authorities in the case of assimilation through Japanese language education are highly contestable. By interviewing those who experienced Japanese language education during the colonial period, further insights into the formation of post-colonial Taiwanese identities are gained. This study contributes to studies on Taiwans subsequent socio-linguistic developments in the post-colonial period.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">search for identity, assimilation, colonial language education, colonial rule.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brunei children's understanding of science: the influence of change in language of instruction on conceptual development</field><field name="creator">Salleh, Romaizah</field><field name="description">In 1987, as a matter of utmost urgency and importance, Negara Brunei Darussalam called for a new system of education that emphasized nationalistic commitment: &#8220;Languages for Bruneians&#8221;. With the era of globalization, the Brunei Ministry of education argued that new patterns of communication were necessary and implemented a bilingual policy where children are taught in Malay until the fourth year of primary school when the medium of instruction changes to English. While the new policy supports Bruneians&#8217; proficiency in two languages, rumour has been magnified through recent established research findings that a large percentage of pupils are underachieving in science. The main focus of this study is the effect of language transfer, from Malay to English as the medium of instruction, on the development of children&#8217;s conceptual understanding in science. Two clusters of science concepts, evaporation and condensation and living and non-living, provide the science context through which children&#8217;s understanding is explored. The theoretical framework that includes viewing and examining children&#8217;s conceptual understanding from conceptual development and epistemological and ontological perspectives of conceptual change informs the analysis of this study. The research design employed a cross sectional case study method involving the administration of interviews to a total of 255 children aged between 6 and 12 years of age. The interviews about the concepts of evaporation and condensation involved two phases. For the first phase, 60 children from each primary level of 1, 3 and 4 (total n = 180) were interviewed. Fourteen months later, 18 children from the same sample were selected based on their fluency in the first interviews and revisited for more detailed interviews.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Malay, English, bilingual education, science learning.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Cooperative Group Work and Assessment on the Attitudes of Students towards Science in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lowe, John Paul</field><field name="description">The improvement of secondary-level students&#8217; attitude to science is encouraged in the New Zealand curriculum document. It is also noteworthy that employers in scientific institutions and commercial organisations place great value on group or teamwork. However, it is apparent that some teachers have reservations about cooperative group work, particularly problems with classroom management. There has been significant research done on cooperative learning and student attitudes, but investigations about the use of cooperative group work to improve the science-related attitudes of our younger secondary school students are rare. This thesis focuses on the effect of cooperative group work and assessment on the attitudes of 312 science students in four rural secondary schools in New Zealand. The cooperative groups were established using a simplified protocol which was non intrusive on curriculum delivery to help ensure wide acceptance by secondary science teachers. The students&#8217; attitudes were assessed quantitatively using the Test of Science Related Attitudes (TOSRA) while qualitative results were obtained through teacher and student interviews along with researcher observations.. The data were collected before and after three terms of cooperative learning in a variety of activities including practical classes, fieldwork, and written assignments and class tests. This part of the study revealed that group work and group assessment enhanced students&#8217; attitudes to science, with both the teachers and students seeing real value in such activities, especially the formative group testing opportunities. The study also confirmed the reliability and validity of the TOSRA in New Zealand schools for the first time.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TOSRA, New Zealand, science, student attitude, group work.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Realtime computer interaction via eye tracking</field><field name="creator">Dubey, Premnath</field><field name="description">Through eye tracking technology, scientists have explored the eyes diverse aspects and capabilities. There are many potential applications that benefit from eye tracking. Each benefit from advances in computer technology as this results in improved quality and decreased costs for eye-tracking systems.This thesis presents a computer vision-based eye tracking system for human computer interaction. The eye tracking system allows the user to indicate a region of interest in a large data space and to magnify that area, without using traditional pointer devices. Presented is an iris tracking algorithm adapted from Camshift; an algorithm originally designed for face or hand tracking. Although the iris is much smaller and highly dynamic. the modified Camshift algorithm efficiently tracks the iris in real-time. Also presented is a method to map the iris centroid, in video coordinates to screen coordinates; and two novel calibration techniques, four point and one-point calibration. Results presented show that the accuracy for the proposed one-point calibration technique exceeds the accuracy obtained from calibrating with four points. The innovation behind the one-point calibration comes from using observed eye scanning behaviour to constrain the calibration process. Lastly, the thesis proposes a non-linear visualisation as an eye-tracking application, along with an implementation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-linear visualisation, iris tracking, eye tracking, human-computer interaction (HCI).</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing the mathematical achievement of technical education students in Brunei Darussalam using a teaching and learning package</field><field name="creator">Khalid, Madihah</field><field name="description">Mathematics plays a key role in many of today&#8217;s most secure and financially rewarding careers. In almost every sector of the economy, a substantial core of mathematics is needed to prepare students both for work and for higher education. The impact of computers and information technology in areas as diverse as manufacturing and advertising means that understanding mathematics becomes more important because it provides students with basic prerequisites in other useful areas such as problem-solving. Technical students in Brunei are trained with the skills needed in the world of industry and commerce to become competent workers and many of them continue to pursue higher education. They need the right balance of mathematics that can prepare them for both purposes. Considered to be academically weak, and coming from the system (high schools) whose teaching approaches benefit abstract learners, these students need to be motivated and have their interest in mathematics nurtured. This study is an attempt to improve the mathematical skills of technical students in Brunei by developing a teaching and learning package that can be used by mathematics instructors with their students. The package was designed to provide student-centred instruction and focuses on the learning environment aspects of &#8220;Teacher Support&#8221;, &#8220;Innovation&#8221;, &#8220;Cooperation&#8221;, &#8220;Task Orientation&#8221; and &#8220;Relevance&#8221;. These learning environment aspects were incorporated into each category of the ARCS motivational model (Keller, 1983b) for the purpose of enhancing motivation. It was anticipated that students&#8217; mathematical understanding and attitude would be improved when their learning environment and thus their motivation was enhanced.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">technical students, mathematics education, education in Brunei.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15984</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arid zone ant communities of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Gunawardene, Nihara</field><field name="description">This thesis is prepared in three parts; the first part is a study of the ant species of the southern Carnarvon Basin, which was undertaken in order to determine the patterns of ant species distribution in this arid zone area.

Recommendations to alter the border between the South-west Province and the Eremaean Province were supported. The next chapter of this thesis analysed ant species from long unburnt and burnt areas of three main vegetation types (two Triodia species grasslands and Acacia aneura woodlands) in the Gibson Desert Nature Reserve. This study was carried out to observe the recovery of ant populations after fire. The results provided further evidence that invertebrates are measurably impacted by fire in the arid zone. The final chapter is a comparison of these two arid zone studies with six other ant community studies from throughout Western Australia.

Based on these parsimonious channel models, low complexity receivers such as RAKE receivers are considered to exploit these propagation effects and enhance the system performance. We consider the scenario where multipath is frequency selective slowly fading and where the channel components including delays and attenuation coefficients are assumed to be constant over one or few signalling intervals. We model the channel as a long FIR-like filter (or a tapped delay line filter) with the number of taps related to the ratio between the channel delay-spread and the chip duration. Due to the high data rate of new CDMA systems, the channel length in terms of the chip duration will be very large. With classical channel estimation techniques this will result in poor estimates of many of the channel parameters where most of them are zero leading to a reduction in the system performance. Unlike classical techniques which estimate directly the channel response given the number of taps or given an estimate of the channel length, the proposed techniques in this work will firstly identify the significant multipath parameters using model selection techniques, then estimate these identified parameters. Statistical tests are proposed to determine whether or not each individual parameter is significant. A low complexity RAKE receiver is then considered based on estimates of these identified parameters only. The level of significance with which we will make this assertion will be controlled based on statistical tests such as multiple hypothesis tests. Frequency and time domain based approaches and model selection techniques are proposed to achieve the above proposed objectives.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multiple access techniques, multipath fading channels, channel estimation, Code Division Mutliple Access.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16299</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The measurement of underwater acoustic noise radiated by a vessel using the vessel's own towed array</field><field name="creator">Duncan, Alexander John</field><field name="description">The work described in this thesis tested the feasibility of using a towed array of hydrophones to: 1. localise sources of underwater acoustic noise radiated by the towvessel, 2. determine the absolute amplitudes of these sources, and 3. determine the resulting far-field acoustic signature of the tow-vessel. The concept was for the towvessel to carry out a U-turn manoeuvre so as to bring the acoustic section of the array into a location suitable for beamforming along the length of the tow-vessel. All three of the above were shown to be feasible using both simulated and field data, although no independent field measurements were available to fully evaluate the accuracy of the far-field acoustic signature determinations. A computer program was written to simulate the acoustic signals received by moving hydrophones. This program had the ability to model a variety of acoustic sources and to deal with realistic acoustic propagation conditions, including shallow water propagation with significant bottom interactions. The latter was accomplished using both ray and wave methods and it was found that, for simple fluid half-space seabeds, a modified ray method gave results that were virtually identical to those obtained with a full wave method, even at very low frequencies, and with a substantial saving in execution time. A field experiment was carried out during which a tug towing a 60-hydrophone array carried out a series of U-turn manoeuvres. The signals received by the array included noise radiated by the tow-vessel, signals from acoustic tracking beacons mounted on the tow-vessel, and transient signals generated by imploding sources deployed from a second vessel.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acoustics, array-processing, tow-vessel machinery.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catalytic partial oxidation of propylene to acrolein: the catalyst structure, reaction mechanisms and kinetics</field><field name="creator">Fansuri, Hamzah</field><field name="description">Bismuth molybdates have long been known as active catalysts for selective oxidation of olefins. There are several phases of bismuth molybdates but only three of them are known to be active for partial oxidation of propylene to acrolein, namely, &#945;, &#946;, and &#947; bismuth molybdates. A significant amount of work has been carried out and reported in the literature, aiming to understand the reaction mechanisms so as to control the reaction process. It has been revealed that the oxidation reaction follows the redox mechanisms and lattice oxygen plays a key role as the main oxygen source for the reaction and controls the catalyst performance. The properties of the lattice oxygen are influenced by the bulk crystalline structure of the catalyst. Therefore, it is possible that the crystal structure influences the performance of the catalyst in promoting the partial oxidation reaction. However, there appears to be a lack of detailed reports in the literature on the relationship between the bulk crystal structure and the activity and selectivity of the catalyst for the partial oxidation reaction.

Once present, ventilator-associated pneumonia is known to increase the duration of mechanical ventilation, time in the intensive care unit, and length of hospital stay. Patients with acquired brain injury are commonly admitted to the intensive care unit and considered to be at a high risk for the development of respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, which could potentially impact on the intensive care unit costs and outcomes. Respiratory physiotherapy is often provided to prevent and/or treat ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients with acquired brain injury. The theoretical rationale of the respiratory physiotherapy is to improve airway clearance and enhance ventilation which may reduce the incidence of pulmonary infections and thus ventilator-associated pneumonia, and may in turn decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation, prevent the need for tracheostomy and hence result in reduced costs and shorter hospital stay. Although respiratory physiotherapy may be beneficial in reversing or preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia, to date there are no data concerning the effectiveness of respiratory physiotherapy in patients with acquired brain injury. Hence from an evidence-based perspective, at present there is no justification for the role of respiratory physiotherapy in the management of patients with acquired brain injury in the intensive care unit.

The Island of Mauritius relies to a great extent on its human resource power to meet the challenges of recent technological developments, and a substantial core of mathematics is needed to prepare students for their involvements in these challenges. After an analysis of the School Certificate examination results for the past ten years in Mauritius, it was found that boys were out-performing girls in mathematics at that level. This study aimed to examine this gender difference in mathematics performance at the secondary level by exploring factors affecting mathematics teaching and learning, and by identifying and implementing strategies to enhance positive factors. The study was conducted using a mixed quantitative and qualitative methodology in three phases. A survey approach was used in the Phase One of the study to analyse the performance of selected students from seventeen schools across Mauritius in a specially designed mathematics test. The attitudes of these students were also analysed through administration of the Modified Fennema-Sherman Mathematics Attitude Scale questionnaire. In Phase Two a case study method was employed, involving selected students from four Mauritian secondary schools. After the administration of the two instruments used in Phase One to these selected students, qualitative techniques were introduced. These included classroom observations and interviews of students, teachers, parents and key informants.

His method of identifying fires within a pixel significantly larger than the fire by utilizing the different responses of the 3 &#956;m and 11 &#956;m channels has been applied to a number of sensors. Over the last decade a lot of work has been invested to refine and validate fire detections based on this approach. So far, the application of the method proposed by Dozier (1981) reached its peak with the launch of the MODIS instrument on board the Terra satellite. In contrast to earlier sensors, MODIS was equipped with spectral channels specifically designed for the detection of fires with algorithms based on the work by Dozier (1981). These channels were designed to overcome problems experienced with other platforms, the biggest of which is the saturation of the 3 &#956;m channel caused by big, hot fires.

It should be noted that this thesis will not examine in detail all documentation in which a right to health care in its various forms is mentioned.

The minerals processing operation at Zinifex Limited's Century Mine, which uses differential flotation, began in November 1999 and the flotation behavior of the ore remains a major research interest. The present study was aimed to determine the possible mechanisms of sphalerite recovery during carbon pre-flotation and lead flotation in this operation including identification of the variables that affect these two flotation stages and also identify depressants for sphalerite that offer better selectivity during these stages. To achieve this aim, the study was undertaken in two stages: a review of literature related to selectivity during lead-zinc flotation, and an experimental program consisting of bench-scale flotation tests wherein the various experimental variables were systematically varied. A comparison between the data generated to those of the plant was also undertaken. The review of literature revealed four basic mechanisms of sphalerite recovery: activation of the sphalerite surface, composite particle flotation with galena and gangue, graphitic inclusions in the mineral surface and entrainment in the froth. The depression or rejection of sphalerite on the other hand could be affected by grinding, froth washing and the use of chemical depressants including cyanides, zinc sulfate, abraded iron and iron sulfate, sodium sulfide, sodium sulfite and metabisulfite, and organic depressants derived from selective collectors.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">activation of sphalerite, lead-zinc flotation, sphalerite depression.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of a management process: An exploratory study to identify underlying patterns in planning</field><field name="creator">Dickie, Carolyn</field><field name="description">This study linked the management activity of planning with Alexander et al.&#8217;s (1977) concept of pattern languages developed within architecture. Since the 1990s the concept has been expanded in the information systems discipline to document software development practices. Moreover, uses of the patterning concept have focussed on software from a technical aspect; however, authors such as Coplien and Harrison (2004) have moved beyond the purely technical aspects and have used the concept of patterns to discuss issues of organisational structure. Similarly, within the discipline of management, process management tools are used to manage, track or simplify core processes by recognising patterns that can be replicated to produce more effective and efficient structural systems. Whether practitioners seek continuous improvement through control of business structures, inputs or processes, planning of desired outcomes is critical. Practical implementation difficulties continue despite a plethora of independent planning tools/applications available to managers. Consequently, a focus of this study was to explore human processes of planning in organisations, using Manns et al.&#8217;s (2001) definition of patterns to determine whether identifiable underlying patterns existed. There is a dearth of literature and practical resources related to the concept of management patterns. However, identifying flexible patterns in planning would provide a direct link between the theory of management planning, its practical implementation or both.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">planning in organisations, patterns.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis and structure of C4 symmetric resorcinarenes</field><field name="creator">McIldowie, Matthew</field><field name="description">This study investigates methods for the synthesis and resolution of chiral resorcinarenes.The first direct synthesis of C4 dissymmetric resorcinarenes by the Lewis acid catalysed condensation of 3-alkoxyphenols and alkyl aldehydes was developed. The chirality of these novel resorcinarenes was demonstrated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (n.m.r.) and enantioselective HPLC. The structure and physical properties of the new materials were characterised by several methods including X-ray crystallography.Resolution of the chiral resorcinarenes was achieved on a multi-gram scale by either formation of their diastereomeric camphorsulfonate esters or diastereomeric "amide" derivatives followed by flash chromatographic separation. The absolute configuration of one resorcinarene camphorsulfonate diastereomer was determined by X-ray crystallography and the stereochemistry of the related diastereomers assigned based on spectroscopic and chromatographic properties. Hydrolysis of the resolved resorcinarene camphorsulfonate diastereomers afforded the C4 symmetric resorcinarenes of known absolute stereochemistry. The absolute configuration of one resorcinarene "amide" diastereomer was also determined by X-ray crystallography.Functionalisation of the resorcinarene racemates with 2- and 3-picolyl ethers afforded a number of resorcinarene based pyridine ligands. The complexation behaviour of the ligands was examined and X-ray crystallographic data obtained for complexes with silver(I) and copper(II) salts.A significant proportion of the work described in this thesis has been published in four separate peer reviewed papers which have been attached as appendices 12-15.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">synthesis and resolution of chiral resorcinarenes.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frontier methods for comparing public hospital efficiency</field><field name="creator">Mangano, Maria</field><field name="description">This research examines the impact, if any, of the introduction of casemix funding on public hospitals in Victoria. The results reported here show that in Victoria, during the period under observation, rural hospitals showed a significantly greater preponderance, relative to metropolitan hospitals, to either amalgamate or close down. Since 1 July 1993 public hospitals in Victoria have been compared for efficiency in the delivery of their services. The casemix funding arrangements were installed, among other reasons, to improve efficiency in the delivery of hospital services. Duckett, 1999, p 107 states that under casemix funding 'The hospital therefore becomes more clearly accountable for variation in the efficiency of the services it provides'. Also, 'Generally, case-mix funding is seen as being able to yield efficiency improvements more rapidly than negotiated funding'. Hospital comparisons provide State bodies with information on how to allocate funding between hospitals by means of annual capped budgets. Budgets are capped because funding is restricted to a given number of patients that can be treated in any given year. Thus, casemix funding relies heavily on cost comparisons between hospitals, and the way that hospital output is measured relies on the use of diagnosis related groups (DRGs).</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">introduction of casemix funding, public hospitals in Victoria.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17497</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular analysis of J-virus and Beilong virus using reverse genetics</field><field name="creator">Danielle E. Magoffin</field><field name="description">The emergence of viruses in the family Paramyxoviridae, especially those such as Hendra virus and Nipah virus (NiV) that are zoonotic, highlighted the severity of disease that could be caused by infection with viruses belonging to this family. In addition to causing disease outbreaks, several newly discovered paramyxoviruses were found to have unique genetic features, which provoked renewed interest in the study of previously unclassified or uncharacterised viruses in this family. J-virus (JPV) was isolated from wild mice, in Queensland, Australia, in 1972, and has been suggested to be a natural respiratory pathogen of mice. Beilong virus (BeiPV), another paramyxovirus, was first isolated from human mesangial cells in Beijing, China, in 2003, and was subsequently detected in rat mesangial cells. Following initial characterisation, the genomes of JPV and BeiPV were found to contain two genes, SH and TM, not common to other paramyxoviruses, as well as an extended attachment protein gene. BeiPV has the largest genome in the family Paramyxoviridae, which is, in fact, larger than that of any other virus within the order Mononegavirales. The genetic material of paramyxoviruses is not amenable to manipulation via classical genetics; a reverse genetics approach was therefore employed to study the evolution and classification of JPV and BeiPV. Minireplicon systems utilising green fluorescent protein as a reporter were established for JPV, BeiPV and NiV, and were used to better assess the taxonomic status of JPV and BeiPV, and to determine the relationship between these viruses and henipaviruses, which also have exceptionally large genomes. These studies indicate that JPV and BeiPV are closely related and should be classified in the same genus and their replication and transcription machinery is different from that of the henipaviruses.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Paramyxoviridae, Hendra virus, Nipah virus (NiV), paramyxoviruses, Beilong virus (BeiPV), virus detection</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">French exploration and intentions with regard to the west coast of Australia 1772&#8211;1829</field><field name="creator">Reid, Dorothy V</field><field name="description">In 1772 French navigator Alesno de Saint-Alo&#252;arn, visited the western coast of the Australian continent, and claimed it for France. Some French authorities and later French navigators believed that Saint-Alo&#252;arn&#8217;s claim was valid under prescriptive law, yet this law is only valid if the land claimed is settled within a time frame of thirty years. However, France did not intend to either lay claim to, or establish a colony in western Australia during later voyages of exploration conducted in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, especially as in 1778 Captain Cook had taken possession of the east coast of Australia which was fortified by the British Navy. While this thesis does not dispute Saint-Alo&#252;arn&#8217;s claim, a long succession of writing developed from a British perspective has located rivalry and fear of French colonial ambitions as the cause for British occupation of western Australia. French, Dutch and British voyages to the west coast of Australia have been canvassed, drawing upon both contemporary accounts and twentieth century interpretations of the aims and motives of the respective governments. This thesis investigates three factors considered to have significantly influenced the motivation for and preparation of relevant French and British voyages of exploration covering the period 1772 to 1829.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">French exploration, west coast of Australia, 1772-1829, British exploration, spatiality and territoriality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Benthic habitat mapping using multibeam sonar systems</field><field name="creator">Parnum, Iain Michael</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to develop and examine the use of backscatter data collected with multibeam sonar (MBS) systems for benthic habitat mapping. Backscatter data were collected from six sites around the Australian coastal zone using the Reson SeaBat 8125 MBS system operating at 455 kHz. Benthic habitats surveyed in this study included: seagrass meadows, rhodolith beds, coral reef, rock, gravel, sand, muddy sand, and mixtures of those habitats. Methods for processing MBS backscatter data were developed for the Coastal Water Habitat Mapping (CWHM) project by a team from the Centre for Marine Science and Technology (CMST). The CMST algorithm calculates the seafloor backscatter strength derived from the peak and integral (or average) intensity of backscattered signals for each beam. The seafloor backscatter strength estimated from the mean value of the integral backscatter intensity was shown in this study to provide an accurate measurement of the actual backscatter strength of the seafloor and its angular dependence. However, the seafloor backscatter strength derived from the peak intensity was found to be overestimated when the sonar insonification area is significantly smaller than the footprint of receive beams, which occurs primarily at oblique angles. The angular dependence of the mean backscatter strength showed distinct differences between hard rough substrates (such as rock and coral reef), seagrass, coarse sediments and fine sediments. The highest backscatter strength was observed not only for the hard and rough substrate, but also for marine vegetation, such as rhodolith and seagrass. The main difference in acoustic backscatter from the different habitats was the mean level, or angle-average backscatter strength. However, additional information can also be obtained from the slope of the angular dependence of backscatter strength.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">backscatter data, multibeam sonar (MBS) systems, benthic habitat mapping, Australian coastal zone, seagrass meadows, rhodolith beds, coral reef, rock, gravel, sand, muddy sand, Reson SeaBat 8125 MBS system</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18584</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Climate change and water management impacts on land and water resources</field><field name="creator">Ali, Syed Mahtab</field><field name="description">This study evaluated the impacts of shallow and deep open drains on groundwater levels and drain performance under varying climate scenarios and irrigation application rates. The MIKE SHE model used for this study is an advanced and fully spatially distributed hydrological model. Three drain depths, climates and irrigation application rates were considered. The drains depths included 0, 1 and 2 m deep drains. The annual rainfall and meteorological data were collected from study area from 1976 to 2004 and analysed to identify the typical wet, average and dry years within the record. Similarly three irrigation application rates included 0, 10 and 16 ML/ha-annum. All together twenty seven scenarios (3 drains depths, 3 climates and 3 irrigation application rates) were simulated. The observed soil physical and hydrological data were used to calibrate and validate the model. Mean square error (R[superscript]2) of the simulated and observed water table data varied from 0.7 to 0.87. Once validated the MIKE SHE model was used to evaluate the effectiveness of 1 and 2 metre deep drains. The simulated water table depth, unsaturated zone deficit, exchange between unsaturated and saturated zones, drain outflow and overland flow were used to analyse their performance. The modeling results showed that the waterlogging was extensive and prolonged during winter months under the no drainage and no irrigation scenario. In the wet climate scenario, the duration of water logging was longer than in the average climate scenario during the winter months. In the dry climate scenario no waterlogging occurred during the high rainfall period. The water table reached soil surface during the winter season in the case of wet and average climate. For the dry climate, the water table was about 0.9 metres below soil surface during winter.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">shallow and deep ocean drains, groundwater levels, drain performance, MIKE SHE model, climate scenarios, irrigation application rates</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18688</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semi-automated geomorphological mapping  applied to landslide hazard analysis</field><field name="creator">Hansen, Andrew</field><field name="description">Computer-assisted three-dimensional (3D) mapping using stereo and multi-image (&#8220;softcopy&#8221;) photogrammetry is shown to enhance the visual interpretation of geomorphology in steep terrain with the direct benefit of greater locational accuracy than traditional manual mapping. This would benefit multi-parameter correlations between terrain attributes and landslide distribution in both direct and indirect forms of landslide hazard assessment. Case studies involve synthetic models of a landslide, and field studies of a rock slope and steep undeveloped hillsides with both recently formed and partly degraded, old landslide scars. Diagnostic 3D morphology was generated semi-automatically both using a terrain-following cursor under stereo-viewing and from high resolution digital elevation models created using area-based image correlation, further processed with curvature algorithms. Laboratory-based studies quantify limitations of area-based image correlation for measurement of 3D points on planar surfaces with varying camera orientations. The accuracy of point measurement is shown to be non-linear with limiting conditions created by both narrow and wide camera angles and moderate obliquity of the target plane. Analysis of the results with the planar surface highlighted problems with the controlling parameters of the area-based image correlation process when used for generating DEMs from images obtained with a low-cost digital camera. Although the specific cause of the phase-wrapped image artefacts identified was not found, the procedure would form a suitable method for testing image correlation software, as these artefacts may not be obvious in DEMs of non-planar surfaces.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">photogrammetry, geomorphology, steep terrain, computer-assisted three-dimensional mapping, diagnostic 3D morphology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17998</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The value of trading relationships between buyers and sellers of wine grapes in Australia</field><field name="creator">Hobley, Lynlee Ellen</field><field name="description">The following dissertation uses an exploratory and confirmatory approach to explain relationship value within the grape and wine industry in Australia.

A three phase model was developed from a comprehensive literature review and further enriched through a qualitative field study involving sixteen in-depth interviews with wineries and their grape suppliers in Western Australia. The hypothesised structural equation models were tested using data gathered from a comprehensive survey of 175 wineries and 400 wine grape suppliers located in South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia. Research findings highlight the similarities and differences in relationship value antecedents and outcomes for wineries and grape suppliers. In Phase One, it was evident from the working relationships studied that partner attributes included in the model &#8211; conflict resolution, communication, performance satisfaction, trust and cooperation - all made an important contribution towards the realisation of relationship value for both parties. A restrained use of power was found to be critical to avoid a reduction in the ability to resolve conflict, the level of performance satisfaction and trust in the relationship.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relationship value, grape and wine industry in Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simultaneous removal process for humic acids and metal ions by adsorption</field><field name="creator">Terdkiatburana, Thanet</field><field name="description">Humic substances are macromolecules that naturally occur in all environments in which vegetation matter are present. In general, humic acid is part of humic substances which form the major fraction of the dissolved organic matters in surface water and represents 90% of dissolved organic carbon. Humic acid plays a fundamental role in many ecosystems since it interacts with toxic metal ions present in the system, resulting in a decrease in the bio-availability of such ions. Moreover, the availability of humic acid in water can react with other chemical compounds, such as chlorine to form trihalomethanes (including chloroform) and causes an increasing risk of cancer and may be linked to heart, lung, kidney, liver, and central nervous system damage. Therefore, humic acid removal in water treatment processes is very important in order to achieve the drinking water standards. Heavy metals are significant contaminants in aqueous system. All heavy metals can produce toxicity when ingested in sufficient quantities, but there are several important ones such as lead, mercury, copper, cadmium, arsenic, nickel and silver. These heavy metals are so pervasive and produce toxicity at low concentrations. Moreover, they may build up in biological systems and become a significant health hazard.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">humic substances, adsorption, humic acid removal, dissolved organic matters, surface water, ecosystems, water treatment processes, heavy metals, ions</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18564</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inversion for the Elastic Parameters of Layered Transversely Isotropic Media</field><field name="creator">Li, Ruiping</field><field name="description">In most cases of seismic processing and interpretation, elastic isotropy is assumed. However, velocity anisotropy is found to exist in most subsurface media. Hence, there exists a fundamental inconsistency between theory on the one hand, and practice on the other. If not recognised, this can invalidate interpretation of seismic data. In this thesis, inversion methods for elastic parameters are developed to quantify the degree of velocity anisotropy of multi-layered transversely isotropic media. This primarily involves examining the velocity fields of layered media using anisotropic elastic wave propagation theory, and developing inversion programs to recover elastic parameters from those velocity fields. The resolved elastic parameter information is used in carrying out further studies on the effects of seismic anisotropy on normal moveout (NMO). Mathematical analyses, numerical simulations, and physical modelling experiments are used in this research for verification purposes before application to field survey data. Numerical studies show the transmission velocity field through layered media appears to be equivalent to that through a single-layered medium, within the practical offset limits in field surveys. The elastic parameters, which describe the property of such equivalent single-layered media, can be used as apparent elastic parameters to describe the collective mechanical property of the layered media. During this research, Snell's law was used in ray tracing to determine ray paths through the interface between any two component layers. By analyzing the signals recorded by any receiver in a walkaway VSP survey, the apparent transmission velocity field for the layered media above this receiver depth was inverted.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wave propogation, inversion, transverse isotropy.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12924</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The solvent extraction behaviour of chromium with Bis (2,4,4-trimethylpentyl) phosphinic acid (Cyanex [R] 272)</field><field name="creator">Lanagan, Matthew D.</field><field name="description">The bulk of the world's known nickel reserves are contained in laterite ores but sulphidic ores remain the main source of the Western world's nickel production. With the continuing increase in nickel consumption and the depletion of sulphidic ores, the traditional source of nickel, the extraction of nickel from lateritic ores has been the subject of research interest worldwide. Advances in pressure acid leaching (PAL) technology have resulted in significant commercial attempts to extract nickel from these ores. Leaching the ore with sulphuric acid at elevated temperatures and pressures allows almost complete dissolution of the nickel and cobalt, a valuable byproduct of these ores, but yields highly contaminated pregnant leach solutions. Separating and purifying the nickel and cobalt from these solutions remains a hindrance to full commercial production. Several purifying techniques have been commercialised but all suffer from continuing technical problems. Among them, however, the direct solvent extraction (DSX) technique offers several advantages. Direct solvent extraction involves the separation of the nickel and cobalt directly from the partially neutralised pregnant liquor stream (PLS) by solvent extraction with Cyanex(R) 272 as the extractant. However certain contaminants adversely affect the solvent extraction process. Among them is chromium and little is known about the solvent extraction behaviour of this metal. The present work investigated the solvent extraction of chromium with Cyanex(R) 272.

Based on universal typology, this study proposes that the linguistic category of the descriptive verb lies between the attributive adjective and the verb. With this identification, the study claims that the modifying ending -(u)n has the prototypical semantic function of the perfective aspect. The perfective aspect is, however, interpreted differently according to the verb types and this provides a solution to the form-function distinction: when the descriptive verb is suffixed by -(u)n, the attributive adjective expresses a permanent state; with the processive verb the relative clause denotes the completion of action or process. The analysis of the linear ordering of elements in the verb phrase reveals that grammatical morphemes are related in the strict grammatical rules, which progressively build up conceptualisation. Contrary to the views presented in previous studies, this study argues that incremental and left-to-right processing, the relative clause has semantic constraints on the head noun.

Western Australia was one of the first States in Australia to commence a professional preparation of nurses at an institution of higher education in 1975. Graduates of the program were presented with their Bachelor of Applied Science from the Western Australian Institute of Technology (now Curtin University of Technology), in March 1979. This thesis seeks to answer the question concerning the genesis of such an event. The focus of the study is primarily to follow the progress of general nurse education in Western Australia and to highlight the accompanying influences that shaped its development. The purpose of this study was to explore, analyse, interpret and describe the history of nurse education in Western Australia from 1962-1975. The study used a pluralistic approach employing a variety of historical methods. The research commenced with broad questions and ideas developed from documents and people. The process of data collection, historical criticism and analysis took place simultaneously. The synthesis was written as a chronological narrative. The material of the study thus 'spoke' for itself by providing answers to questions raised during the investigation. The history of nurse education from 1962 to 1975 revealed visible milestones that represented nurse education reform. Beginning from the antecedents of the study these were the sanctioning of a review of nurse training in 1960 together with the commencement of the Western Australian Nursing Survey and the appointment of the Nurses Registration Board Education Officer.

During operations, formation cuttings with adhering oil-based drilling muds were discharged into the ocean via a chute into approximately 125n1 of water, forming a substantial mound at the base of the platform. A suite of seabed sediments was collected from 16 sampling sites at various distances from the platform immediately following the cessation of drilling operations. The distribution of hydrocarbons in the sediment directly under tile cuttings chute was consistent with that found in drilling fluids formulated from a kerosene-like fluid. The samples from more remote sites exhibited the successive enhancement of an unresolved complex mixture relative to the n-alkanes, associated with tile presence of residues from petroleum biodegradation processes. In a subsequent sampling some three years later, a 10 cm core was retrieved from the cuttings pile and divided into 1 cm depth intervals. Samples within 6 cm of the surface of the cuttings pile contained biodegraded residues of the drilling mud, where the extent of biodegradation increased with decreasing proximity to the surface, most likely indicative of aerobic biodegradation.

Drawing from a contingency theory, the research posits that the credibility of marketing strategy depends on the external business environments and its formulation process. The credibility of marketing strategy and the strategy formulation process, in turn, determine the effectiveness of the implementation of the strategy in achieving the desired performance. The causal relationships amongst these variables were then analyzed by structural equation model using LISREL 8.30 program. The primary data for this study were collected through structured interviews with the Marketing Managers of 219 Indonesian companies. The results of the study not only strengthen the notion of the influence of external business environments on the actions of organizations, such as the credibility of marketing strategy, but also confirm the belief of the importance of an innovative culture in implementing strategic marketing planning. The study also identifies that marketing managers play a pivotal role in the formulation and implementation of the strategy. Within the scope of the strategy formulation, marketing managers as boundary spanners of their companies provide the decision makers with current and up to date strategic issues, which in turn enhance the credibility of the formulated strategy. On the other hand, within the strategy implementation, the managers with their autonomy conduct evaluation and control of the marketing strategy, and adjust the strategy to any significant environmental changes to achieve the desired performance.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesia, marketing managers, external business environments, marketing strategies.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13882</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of a K-5 mathematics program which integrates children's literature: classroom environment and attitudes</field><field name="creator">Mink, Deborah V.</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a one-year study of 120 fifth grade students whose teachers participated in a program entitled Project SMILE (Science and Mathematics Integrated with Literary Experiences). The purpose of the study was to investigate the extent to which the classroom implementation of Project SMILE positively influenced the classroom environment and student attitudes toward reading, writing and mathematics. This was accomplished by, first, facilitating a series of five professional development workshops with the teachers and, subsequently, asking these teachers to use the strategies with their students. Because Project CRISS (CReating Independence through Student-owned Strategies), the foundation of SMILE, had already proven to be successful nationwide for secondary students, this study focused on elementary (K-5) school students and their teachers. My evaluation of this unique program, that integrates children's literature and mathematics, focused on student attitudes and the nature of the classroom learning environment. My research represents one of the relatively few studies that have employed learning environment dimensions with students in the elementary school mathematics classroom as criteria of effectiveness in the evaluation of educational innovations. The My Class Inventory (MCI) and an adaptation of the 1988 NAEP (National Assessment of Educational Progress) Attitude Survey were administered to a sample of 120 Grade 5 students as measures of students' perceptions of the classroom learning environment and their attitudes. Qualitative data were composed of student and teacher interviews, classroom observations and work samples.

In contrast to this seller-incentive perspective, this study examines how the buyer interprets the signal via brand name, the effectiveness of signalling via brand name in terms of buyer value perspective, and how the buyer's reaction toward the signal impacts on the seller's decision to adopt the signalling strategy. Signalling theory and concepts from consumer-based branding research are used to suggest how to evaluate the effectiveness of signalling via brand name in the context of the consumer market, wherein information is asymmetric. Findings from online trading experiments, using the methodology of experimental economics, demonstrate that the function of brand fluctuates according to which market conditions prevail for brand and price, the extent of brand differentiation, and the magnitude of brand-building cost. This suggests an alternative way to measure the value of a brand to the buyer.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brand-building, brand signalling, consumer-based branding.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New tricks for old hands: How experienced primary teachers incorporate new science curricula into their practice.</field><field name="creator">Pearson, Jennifer Olwyn</field><field name="description">Primary teachers are constantly required to make changes in their teaching practice. This thesis reports on a year in the professional life of two experienced primary school teachers as they engage in implementing a new science program called Primary Investigations (Australian Academy of Science, 1994). The study examined the issues that arose as the two adapted the strategies and philosophies of the new program into their pre-existing pedagogical frameworks. The study used qualitative methods of data collection and analysis. Over ten months of participant observation several stories or narrative vignettes were created to highlight the major issues faced by the two teachers. These stories were then analysed to identify several propositions about curriculum implementation and primary science. The narrative vignettes provide descriptive accounts around several implementation issues. The two teachers experienced some problems with the supply of equipment to support their teaching and lacked the subject knowledge to identify when the equipment was inadequate. The teachers had high expectations of the teachers' resource book but a lack of science content knowledge hindered their ability to use the document with confidence. While the teachers believed that science is important for children they lacked the confidence and questioning skill to engage the students in 'science talk'. 10 teachers were able to transfer pedagogical knowledge from other disciplines 0 overcome some of the dilemmas they faced in science lessons. Both teachers displayed a strong 'ethic of care&#8217; for the children in their class that covered gaining knowledge, behaviour towards others and safety during science lessons.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">change,  science curricula,  primary teachers,  primary investigations.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On-farm quality assurance in the redmeat industry of Australia</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Anna</field><field name="description">A series of on-farm quality assurance schemes for red meat producers across Australia were developed in the late 1990s in response to increasing global demands for greater accountability within the whole food. The Cattlecare and Flockcare schemes were introduced in 1996 and 1998, respectively, to provide mechanisms for producers to demonstrate that their livestock were free of potential chemical residues, and that they had taken measures to prevent injury or stress to livestock. These schemes were independently audited codes of practice. After several years there was some dissatisfaction with the levels of adoption of these schemes, especially Flockcare. By 2001 just over 5% of all cattle producers and just over 1% of all sheep producers had implemented on-farm quality assurance. This covered nearly 16% of all cattle and 2% of all sheep in Australia, indicating that the larger than average producers were implementing quality assurance. Based on previous studies and anecdotal evidence that there were few current benefits for producers, the aims of this study were to identify the reasons for slow uptake and to quantify factors affecting implementation of on-farm quality assurance in the red meat industry. Surveys of "adopters" and "nou-adopters" of these schemes were developed and implemented in 2000 and 2001. Producers were approached initially by phone and given the options of completing the survey over the phone, by mail or by fax.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">red meat producers, on-farm quality assurance, Australia, livestock, Flockcare, Cattlecare.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pharmaceutical care in diabetes mellitus</field><field name="creator">Clifford, Rhonda Marise</field><field name="description">People with diabetes mellitus are more likely to die from cardiovascular causes than those without diabetes, and modifiable risk factors, such as hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and hypertension can be targeted in intervention programs to decrease this risk. In addition to tertiary care for patients with diabetes, there is a need for simple programs to be implemented in the community that allow the benefits of improved metabolic and blood pressure control to be realised more widely. Pharmaceutical care comprises the detection, prevention and solution of drug-related problems in a quantifiable form, so that outcomes of care can be easily reviewed and monitored. Previous studies of pharmaceutical care programs in patients with diabetes do not provide conclusive evidence of the benefit of pharmaceutical care. The aim of this research was to evaluate the impact of the provision of pharmaceutical care to patients with diabetes mellitus in an Australian context. In order to develop a pharmaceutical care program, the characteristics of an Australian cohort of patients with diabetes were reviewed. The Fremantle Diabetes Study (FDS), was a community-based prospective observational study of diabetes care, control and complications in a postcode-defined region of 120 097 people surrounding the port city of Fremantle in Western Australia. It was intended that the FDS annual reviews would provide important local information in order to design and implement a prospective pharmaceutical care program. A pilot pharmaceutical care program was subsequently developed for use in a diabetes outpatient clinic. This program was then modified for use in a community-based sample of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, drawn from the FDS cohort.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community-based patients, drug therapy, diabetes, complementary medicine.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Student, text, world : literacy and the expansion of pedagogical space</field><field name="creator">Beretovac, Zlatko David</field><field name="description">Using Foucault&#8217;s notion of a dispositif or social apparatus, this thesis charts the pedagogical relations established in contemporary literacy discourse in terms of a space of visibility and a form of sayability, and analyses them as operating within power-knowledge. It furthers this analysis by conceptualising the space of literacy as a normative heterotopia and as a recent mutation of bio-power, the government of the developing body. Such analysis problematises the discourse of literacy, from the term&#8217;s systematic indefiniteness to its real effectivity in producing subjects, spaces and disciplinary techniques. Literacy combines and interrelates a nineteenth-century establishment and a twentieth-century rearrangement of pedagogical space. The national language, the developing child, as well as the world of demands and national progress: all emerge as part of the nineteenth-century educational state, forming a set of disciplinary procedures, a structure of perception and a desire to recognise and utilise language development. Literacy discourse appropriates these knowledges and multiplies the sites in which they operate. It articulates the recognition and enablement of non-standard literacies with the governmental project of intensifying and directing the powers of a population. The pedagogical relations operationalised in literacy discourse project a continuous disciplinary power over a general social space. Thus, literacy has become both a common and much theorised social concern, and a term which structures lives, spaces, discourse and power.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foucault, dispositif, social apparatus, pedagogical relations, contemporary literacy discourse, space of visibility, form of sayability, power-knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17295</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the process of IS/IT investment evaluation and benefits realisation in large Australian organisations</field><field name="creator">Lin, Chad Ying</field><field name="description">In modern organisations a large portion of senior management's time is now being consumed in finding ways to measure the contribution of their organisations' IS/IT investments on business performance. It has been shown that IS/IT investments in many organisations are huge and increasing rapidly every year and yet there is still a lack of understanding of the impact of the proper IS/IT investment evaluation processes and practices in these organisations. At the same time, the issue of expected and actual benefits realised from IS/IT investments has generated a significant amount of debate in the IS/IT literature amongst the researchers and practitioners. This is as true in Australia as it is in the rest of the developed world. Thus, one can argue that a detailed study of current practice in IS/IT investment evaluation in Australia is warranted. In this research study, an attempt was made to: (1) establish current Australian industry and government practices and norms in managing IS/IT benefits and evaluation; and (2) develop a framework based on the fit between theory and practice of IS/IT investment evaluation by large Australian organisations, particularly in an environment where much of the IS/IT is outsourced. Research objective one utilised an existing questionnaire based on Ward et al. (1996). This questionnaire was sent to the IS/IT managers of the largest 500 Australian organisations. The aim of this objective was to investigate IS/IT investment evaluation and benefits management and realisation in these Australian organisations, so as to shed light on the current practices and norms in this area.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information systems investment evaluation, information technology investment management.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Evaluation of Australian Labour Market Assistance Policy</field><field name="creator">Dockery, Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis is comprised of a series of published papers relating to the evaluation of active assistance measures for the unemployed in Australia. It offers both applied evaluations of active assistance measures as well as critical assessment of the evaluation approaches that have dominated the literature and policy formation in Australia. "Active" assistance for the unemployed is distinguished from "passive" assistance, such as income support.The motivation behind the work lies in the fact that a very large amount of public expenditure is directed to active assistance for the unemployed. Over $2 billion dollars was spent on labour market programs at the height of the Working Nation package in each of 1995-96 and 1996-97, and $1.5 billion was allocated to "labour market assistance to jobseekers and industry" in the most recent (2001-02) Commonwealth budget. Despite this considerable past and ongoing expenditure, the evaluation effort in Australia has been far short of international best practice. As a consequence, there is no convincing empirical evidence as to how effectively these public resources are being used, or of the relative merits of various options in the design of active interventions for the unemployed.Ultimately, the goal of the research is to improve supply-side policies designed to address unemployment. As stated, it aims to do this through original empirical evaluations of programs and through critical assessment of existing evaluations and institutional arrangements.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">unemployment, labour market programmes, public employment services, job search, program evaluation.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematics errors in fractions work: a longitudinal study of primary level pupils in Brunei</field><field name="creator">Yusof, Jamilah</field><field name="description">This study examined the different types of mathematical errors exhibited by primary level pupils in Brunei when working with fractions.

The study was longitudinal in nature and its two phases involved a single cohort of Primary 5 pupils followed through a full year period in four government-funded primary schools in Brunei Darussalam. Pupils' mathematical errors were assessed by means of researcher-developed paper-and-pencil tests, while pupils' attitudes towards the learning of fractions were measured by means of an adapted version of attitude questionnaire that has been used previously with Bruneian pupils. Guided by six research questions, a number of statistical analyses were carried out to ensure the validity and reliability of the instruments used. These included piloting and revising the instruments, the use of Cronbach's alpha with the items in the attitude questionnaire, and the calculation of the Pearson Product Correlation Coefficient between scales of the questionnaire. The data was analysed by calculating the percentages and means of occurrences of each type of error. Paired and independent sample t-tests were carried out in order to investigate gender differences in pupils' errors and the impact of further instruction on fraction at the P6 level, while the GLM test was administered in order to investigate if there were significant change in pupils' attitudes towards fractions from the pre- to the posttests.

Four calix[4]arene molecules were successfully synthesized. Two were isolated in the cone conformation with iso-propyl groups attached to the lower rim. The other two were in the 1,3-alternate conformation with allyl groups attached to the phenolic oxygen. The final calixarene synthesized was a calix[6]arene that was partially substituted with iso-propyl groups on the lower rim. The parallel orientation of the aromatic rings was confirmed using single crystal X-ray structure determination. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) complexation studies were conducted on the four calix[4]arene derivatives and showed that thallium binds within the aromatic cavity, and that the complexation/decomplexation kinetics and molecule flexibility are affected by the incorporated ion and the attached groups on the calixarene. Once the binding characteristics of the synthesized calixarenes had been examined they were then incorporated into plasticized PVC together with an ion-exchanger to make ISEs capable of determining thallium activities in solutions. Three calixarenes were successfully incorporated into the membranes and produced Nernstian responses over the concentration range 10-2-10-6 M TlNO3. The lower detection limit of the above electrodes lies in the micro-molar range, which is a common characteristic of the experimental setup used. Since the electrodes behaved ideally with respect to thallium(I), it was then decided to test the complex formation constants and selectivities of the three ionophores.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">calixarene molecules, thallium, inophores, ISEs.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimisation of chlorine dosing for water disribution system using model-based predictive control</field><field name="creator">Muslim, Abrar</field><field name="description">An ideal drinking water distribution system (DWDS) must supply safe drinking water with free chlorine residual (FCR) in the form of HOCI and OCI&#1471; at a required concentration level. Meanwhile the FCR is consumed in the bulk liquid phase and at the DWDS pipes wall as the result of chemical reactions. Because of these, an optimized chlorine dosing for the DWDS using model-based predictive control (MBPC) is developed through the steps of modelling the FCR transport along the main pipes of the DWDS, designing chlorine dosing and implementing a multiple-input multiple-output system control scheme in Matlab 7.0.1 software. Discrete time-space models (DTSM) that can be used to predict free chlorine residual (FCR) concentration along the pipes of the DWDS over time is developed using explicit finite difference method (EFDM). Simulations of the DTSM using step and rectangular pulse input show that the effect of water flow rate velocity is much stronger than the effect of chlorine effective diffusivity coefficient on the FCR distribution and decay process in the DWDS main pipes. Therefore, the FCR axial diffusion in single pipes of the DWDS can be neglected. Investigating the effect of injection time, initial chlorine distribution, and overall chlorine decay rate constant involved in the process have provided a thorough understanding of chlorination and the effectiveness of all the parameters. This study proposed a model-based chlorine dosing design (MBCDD) based on a conventional-optimum design process (CODP) (Aurora, 2004), which is created for uncertain water demand based on the DTSM simulation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drinking water distribution system, free chlorine residual (FCR), model-based predictive control (MBPC), optimized chlorine dosing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=21508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selection criteria for loading and hauling equipment - open pit mining applications</field><field name="creator">Hardy, Raymond J</field><field name="description">Methods for estimating productivity and costs, and dependent equipment selection process, have needed to be increasingly reliable. Estimated productivity and costs must be as accurate as possible in reflecting actual productivity and costs experienced by mining operations to accommodate the long-term trend for diminishing commodity prices, For loading and hauling equipment operating in open pit mines, some of the interrelated estimating criteria have been investigated for better understanding; and, consequently, more reliable estimates of production and costs, also more effective equipment selection process. Analysis recognizes many of the interrelated criteria as random variables that can most effectively be reviewed, analyzed and compared in terms of statistical mathematical parameters. Emphasized throughout is the need for management of the cyclical loading and hauling system using conventional shovels/excavators/loaders and mining trucks to sustain an acceptable &#8220;rhythm&#8221; for best practice productivity and most-competitive unit-production costs. Outcomes of the research include an understanding that variability of attributes needs to be contained within acceptable limits. Attributes investigated include truck payloads, bucket loads, loader cycle time, truck loading time and truck cycle time. Selection of &#8220;ultra-class&#8221; mining trucks (&#8805; 290 -tonne payload) and suitable loading equipment is for specialist mining applications only. Where local operating environment and cost factors favourably supplement diminishing cost-benefits of truck scale, ultra-class trucks may be justified. Bigger is not always better &#8211; only where bigger can be shown to be better by reasons in addition to the modest cost benefits of ultra-class equipment.

Despite numerous attempts to establish a certified seed system, the most practical solution is to import clean foundation seed of the desired variety and physiological age. With imports from Europe and North America proving to be immature and too expensive, Western Australia (WA) has emerged as a potential source of high quality seed. While seed imports from WA are unique in that the varieties imported have been selected by researchers in Vietnam as being suited to the agro-ecological environment in the Red River Delta (RRD), no assessment of the economic benefits to smallholder potato farmers from the use of WA potato seed has been undertaken. In 2006/08, the yield and profitability of three potato varieties Eben, KT3 and Atlantic in two locations were compared where the crops had been derived from new seed imported from WA (VN0), seed derived from crops cultivated in the RRD after one generation (VN1) and two generations (VN2). There was a significant difference in the yield produced between the three different seed sources but not between the locations. For all varieties, and in both years, the yield decreased with the number of multiplications in Vietnam. Furthermore, the marketable yield declined significantly from the first crop (VN0) to the third crop (VN2). The decline in yield and tuber quality with each successive generation was associated with an increase in PVY and PVX infection. Not unexpectedly, differences in yield and marketable yield between the seed generations had a significant impact on the gross income for each variety.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">potato industry, Vietnam, eben, KT3, atlantic, productivity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=118348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of p53&#8217;s differential activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Yuan</field><field name="description">The p53 tumour suppressor protein lies at the hub of a very complex network of cellular pathways including apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and cellular senescence.

To enable us to investigate this ability of p53 to switch between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, we developed a model which demonstrates similar p53 expression patterns but different functional outcomes.

Cisplatin-treated cells undergo apoptosis while Nutlin-treated cells enter cell cycle arrest.

Early low-angle faults (D', D1), documented in the surrounding Coolgardie, Kambalda and Boorara Domains are not developed in the Ora Banda Domain, and the fabrics reflect only the latest ENE-WSW shortening event. The western limb of the regional-scale ESE- plunging Kurrawang syncline (D2), is truncated by the Zuleika Shear Zone (D3), a within- greenstone ductile shear zone located 10km southeast of Ora Banda. The shear zone has a much greater strike length (250km) than depth extent, as seismic imagery reveals a sharp truncation against a mid-crustal decollement at a depth of 6km-depth below surface. The Zuleika Shear Zone is a NW-SE trending band of anastomosing S-C mylonite zones formed in conjugate sets of NW- SE trending sinistral and N-S trending dextral shear zones. Widely distributed flattening strains and more restricted zones of non-coaxial shear in the Zuleika Shear Zone, suggest deformation-path partitioning typical of a transpressional tectonic environment. Latetectonic brittle-ductile faults (D4) cross-cut the Zuleika Shear Zone and surrounding greenstones, and hence are not Riedel structures or other lower order faults genetically related to the ductile shearing. Gold mineralisation of the Zuleika Shear Zone began during the ductile deformation (D3), continued through peak metamorphism that postdates the shearing, and finally ceased after the brittle-ductile faulting event (D4).

Paediatric nursing has progressed since the 1960's and in the 1990's, the major breakthrough was the emergence of the partnership model. Hence, it would be ideal to investigate the elements facilitating the foundation of trust in the formation of a nurse-parent relationship. The purpose of this study is to identify the concept of formation of trust in the relationship between parents whose children suffer from chronic asthma and the paediatric nurses responsible for their care in a paediatric medical setting. The study also determined and explored the characteristics of a trustworthy nurse, and identified those factors which facilitated or impeded the development of trust between the paediatric nurse and the parent within the culture of the paediatric medical setting. Parents of hospitalised children were sought for data collection. Data was collected using field observations and semi-structured interviews. Participant observation and all ethnographic field notes were used to describe culture in relation to the concept of trust in the nurse-parent relationship. The findings indicated that elements vital to the development of trust between parents and paediatric nurses were pre-existing trust, knowledge of asthma, communication, building a relationship and confidentiality. Based on these findings, a model of trust and partnership was developed. The implications of the findings have been significantly related to keeping parents informed of their child's condition, the continuity in nursing care and paediatric nurses to introduce themselves at the beginning of each change of shift.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">paediatric nursing, nursing care, childhood asthma.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impeded nursing care: nurses' lived experiences</field><field name="creator">Drury, John</field><field name="description">This phenomenological study describes the lived experience of ten registered nurses who provided a standard of nursing care that they perceived to be impeded because of their negative reactions to their patient's condition.

These negative reactions included frustration, annoyance, nurses fearing for their own safety, revulsion, sadness and feelings of guilt that impeded care had been provided. These reactions translated into behaviours that were associated with providing nursing care to the patient that the nurses themselves perceived to be of impeded quality. Behaviours included not being there or spending less time with the patient, not communicating well and having less rapport with the patient, not meeting the patient's psychological and social needs and not meeting the patient's spiritual needs. The nurses found their awareness that this had occurred disturbing and they devised strategies to cope personally and also to ensure that a better quality of care was provided in subsequent situations. Strategies included discussions with colleagues, arranging for colleagues to provide care for the patient, mental preparation, and using individual coping strategies.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">patient care, factors impeding care, nurses' reactions and behaviours.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender differences in teacher-student interactions, attitudes and achievement in middle school science</field><field name="creator">Eccles, Lynette</field><field name="description">Research has shown that interest in science often decreases in the middle-school grades for both boys and girls, but that more boys continue on the science track in high school and college, leading to males dominating the fields of science and engineering in the work place. The interpersonal interaction between teachers and students, as both individuals and as a group, comprises a large part of the classroom learning environment. Though these interactions last only a school year, they can influence student attitudes and achievement in the long term. Past research has suggested that a key factor in improving student achievement and attitudes is to create learning environments which emphasize characteristics that have been found to be linked empirically with achievement and attitudes. The purpose of this study was to use quantitative methods to validate a learning environment questionnaire (Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction, QTI), to investigate outcome-environment associations, and to compare male and female students in terms of their attitudes, classroom environment perceptions and achievement. An attitude scale, based on items from the Test of Science Related Attitudes (TOSRA), and a 48-item eight-scale version of the QTI were administered to 1228 science students in Grades 6, 7 and 8 at one middle school in South Florida. Student achievement was measured using the students&#8217; quarterly (nine-week) science grade.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Test of Science Related Attitudes, QTI, Interest in science, science achievement, attitudes towards science, middle-school grades, teacher and student interpersonal interaction, student achievement, student attitudes, classroom learning environment, Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction, TOSRA, classroom environment perceptions, MANOVA, gender differences in students, teacher interpersonal behavior.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The molecular genetics of human complement C4: implications for mapping MHC disease susceptibility genes</field><field name="creator">Puschendorf, Mareike</field><field name="description">The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is a gene-dense region located on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21.31). This region contains the highly polymorphic HLA genes as well as many other genes with immunological and non-immunological function. The susceptibility genes of many human disorders have been mapped to genes within the MHC. However, the genes themselves and indeed the locations of the genes, for many of the disorders, remain a mystery. This is a result of the high degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) that exists between loci within the MHC. The high LD is explained by the genomic structure of the MHC. The MHC contains several blocks of DNA within which recombination is extremely rare, whereas the boundaries of the blocks are defined as "hotspots" of recombination. Most disease association studies have used the highly polymorphic HLA class I and class II genes which are separated by an, as yet, undefined number of blocks and several hundred kilobases of DNA. The MHC gamma block resides in the central region of the MHC between the blocks that contain the HLA class I and class It genes. As such, typing for polymorphisms in the gamma block is critical for MHC disease gene mapping studies. The gamma block contains approximately 20 known genes including the complement C4 genes. The gamma block can contain between I and 3 tandemly arranged C4 genes. The C4 protein exists as either the C4A or C413 isotype and is polymorphic with up to 40 allotypes being reported. However, the majority of Caucasian haplotypes can be explained by the common C4A3 / C4B1 or C4AQ0 / C4B1 complotypes with the remaining haplotypes explained by just a few other complotypes. For this reason, and because C4 allotyping is a technically difficult procedure, C4 allotyping is rarely used in MHC disease association studies.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">complement system, C4 genes, C4 and MHC associated diseases.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurement of Lead Isotopes in Snow and Ice from Law Dome and other sites in Antarctica to characterize the Lead and seek evidence of its origin</field><field name="creator">Vallelonga, Paul Travis</field><field name="description">Human activities such as mining and smelting of lead (Pb) ores and combustion of alkyllead additives in gasoline have resulted in extensive global Pb pollution. Since the late 1960's studies of polar ice and snow have been undertaken to evaluate the extent of anthropogenic Pb emissions in recent times as well as to investigate changes in anthropogenic Pb emissions in the more distant past. The polar ice sheets have been used to investigate Pb pollution as they offer a long-term record of human activity located far from pollution sources and sample aerosol emissions on a hemispheric scale. Lead isotopes have been previously used to identify sources of Pb in polar snow and ice, while new evaluations of Pb isotopic compositions in aerosols and Pb ore bodies allow more thorough evaluations of anthropogenic Pb emissions. Lead isotopic compositions and Pb and Barium (Ba) concentrations have been measured in snow and ice core samples from Law Dome, East Antarctica, to produce a detailed pollution history between 1530 AD and 1989 AD. Such a record has been produced to evaluate changes in anthropogenic Pb emission levels and sources over the past 500 years, to determine when industrial (anthropogenic) activities first began to influence Antarctica and also to investigate natural Pb fluxes to Antarctica. Additional samples were also collected from Law Dome snow and ice cores to respectively investigate seasonal variations in Pb and Ba deposition, and the influence of the 1815 AD volcanic eruption of Tambora, Indonesia. All samples were measured by thermal ionisation mass spectrometry, for which techniques were developed to reliably analyse Pb isotopic compositions in Antarctic samples containing sub-picogram per gram concentrations of Pb.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bismuth, volcanism, barium, Law Dome, sulfer emissions, lead contamination, filter sampling, aerosols, analytical blank, ice cores, Pb, lead isotopes, pollution, pele's hair, lead, ice, Antarctica, polar, thermal ionisation mass spectrometry, Mount Erebus.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identity, opportunity and hope :an Aboriginal model for alcohol (and other drug) harm prevention and intervention</field><field name="creator">Nichols, Fiona Troup</field><field name="description">The fieldwork for this study was conducted in the West Kimberley region of Western Australia between 1997 and 1999. Qualitative and quantitative information provided by 170 Aboriginal participants enabled an exploration of the context and patterns of Aboriginal alcohol use; Aboriginal perceptions of the alcohol issue, existing interventions, research findings, 'culture' and its role in prevention and intervention; and participants' incorporation of these perceptions into an Aboriginal model for alcohol misuse prevention, intervention and evaluation. Findings were based on the results of individual and focus group interviews, serial model-planning focus groups, documentary data and observation.Study findings generally suggest that in addition to self-determination and support components, 'cultural context' retains an important role for many remote area Aboriginal people. The findings from a small sub-sample tentatively suggest that 'cultural' disruption, in addition to the socio-economic consequences of colonisation and dispossession, may play an important role in alcohol misuse. Consequently, it appears that in combination with self-determination and support components, the strengthening of a locally-defined 'cultural' context may have an important role in alcohol misuse prevention and intervention - an approach frequently unrepresented in existing symptom-focused models and one inviting further investigation. The model developed by study participants expands significantly on existing symptom-focused approaches through a comprehensive life-enhancement focus on aspects of identity, opportunity and hope. This approach adds depth and meaning to understandings of cultural appropriateness and of culturally relevant models for substance misuse prevention and intervention.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">indigenous model, indigenous health, belonging, substance misuse, resilience, education, evaluation, participatory action research, culture, employment, capacity building, cause focus, abstinence, self-determination.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14160</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The culture of engineering education and its interaction with gender : a case study of a New Zealand University</field><field name="creator">Godfrey, Janett Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This study focused on the culture of engineering education, a culture which has been characterised internationally as reflecting masculine attitudes, values and norms of behaviour, thereby reinforcing the current under-representation of women. The goal of the study was to define the dimensions of the culture and the associated processes of enculturation, highlighting the interaction of these with gender. Following a review of relevant literature, research questions were formulated. These were addressed through an interpretive case study undertaken at a multidisciplinary School of Engineering in a New Zealand university. The study used predominantly ethnographic methods of data collection. To guide the analysis, a model was developed based on Schein's (1985) theoretical framework. The first level of the model involved the identification of observable manifestations of the culture (grouped as Artefacts, Practices and Behaviours). At the second level, shared values and cultural norms were induced from the observable manifestations. At the third level, the essence of the engineering education culture was distilled from these values and norms, in the form of seven cultural dimensions. At each level of the analysis the explicit and tacit processes of enculturation, especially in relation to gender, were considered. This research exposed the masculinity of the basic beliefs and assumptions at the core of the disciplinary culture, revealing the source of enduring cultural norms and their manifestations in behaviours and practices. Diverse forms of masculinity were evident, especially within sub-disciplinary subcultures, but all were constructed in opposition to perceptions of femininity. Participants in the study (whether male, female, students or staff) perceived women in engineering as different, not only to men, but to other women.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">engineer education, New Zealand, gender, engineering.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adverse drug reaction reporting in Australian hospitals</field><field name="creator">Nita, Yunita</field><field name="description">Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are known to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. However, only a small proportion are reported. An increase in the number and quality of reports by improving ADR reporting systems in hospitals, could improve patient outcomes and save healthcare costs. The first part of this project was to review the ADR reporting systems in Australian hospitals and to determine factors contributing to the ADR reporting rate. Data were collected by a postal, self-administered questionnaire. Questionnaires were sent to 299 chief pharmacists of Australian hospitals listed in the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia (SHPA) directory. The response rate was 49.5%. Seventy seven (60%) hospitals had a formal hospital policy for ADR reporting and 110 (85.3%) hospitals targeted all drugs to be reported. ADR reporting rates to ADRAC in 2000 (ADR reports per patient admission) were between zero and 1.09% (median=0.02%) with 7.1% of hospitals having a reporting rate of zero. A centralised ADR system and the existence of an ADR policy was not associated with higher reporting rates. The next part of the project was a survey of 803 Western Australian (WA) doctors and 1323 Australian hospital pharmacists to evaluate involvement in, understanding of and reasons for reporting ADRs. A postal, self-administered, anonymous questionnaire was sent to doctors at two tertiary hospitals in Perth and three regional hospitals in WA. A similar questionnaire was sent to all hospital pharmacists listed in the membership list of SHPA, as well as non-SHPA members in WA. Response rates obtained for the WA doctors survey was 35% (n=277) and 43% (n=574) for hospital pharmacists. Sixty four percent of doctors and 96% of hospital pharmacists knew how to report ADRs within the hospital while 57% and 98% (respectively) knew how to report ADRs to ADRAC.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">penicillin allergy, ADRAC, ADRs, drug allergy.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14052</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing employment contracts, changing psychological contracts and the effects on organisational commitment</field><field name="creator">Loring, Jane A.</field><field name="description">Changing workplace conditions have resulted in psychological contracts becoming more transactionally oriented.

In particular, it seeks to analyse the relationship between the form of the psychological contract (relational/transactional) and type of organisational commitment (affective, continuance, normative).Data were collected from 210 randomly selected participants using the Psychological Contract Scale (PCS), and the Measure of Affective, Continuance and Normative Commitment Scale (MACNCS). The Career Commitment Scale (CCS) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) were administered and information gathered regarding overall job satisfaction, age, gender, contract type, position held, industry sector and length of employment.The major findings from this study is that there are positive relationships between relational psychological contracts and affective commitment (&#226; = .653, p &lt; .05), continuance commitment (&#226; = .222, p &lt; .05) and normative commitment (&#226; = .476, p &lt;.001), and a negative relationship between transactional psychological contracts and affective commitment (&#226; =148, p &lt; .05), after controlling for various background and employment characteristics.

The techniques developed significantly improved the ability to produce accurate, reliable and stable leak detection predictions for the gas transmission pipeline studied and can be applied generally to other pipelines as well. Recommendations for minimum pipeline requirements to implement successful leak detection are also detailed. There are several commercial software packages available that perform some form of leak detection via system modelling. However, due to the commercial aspects of these products, vendors do not publish the detailed methods of leak detection. This thesis identifies the fundamental techniques required to have accurate and reliable leak detection on a gas transmission pipeline, whilst taking into account the lack of measurement data typically encountered on most gas pipelines. The investigation confirmed that a mass balance technique could be successfully used to produce stable leak detection results for compressible flow in gas transmission pipelines. This leak detection [using mass balance] can be achieved without flow measurement along the pipeline, instead, using only pressure and temperature measurements. Although it is recognized that flow measurement data will greatly improve the ability to detect leaks, the focus of this work is on pipelines where this flow measurement data at intermediate points along the pipeline is not available. It was also demonstrated the reliability of the leak detection was improved by the application of on-line signal processing techniques at various stages of the data processing.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">optimum filter, compressor performance, pipeline network, leak location.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15189</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Student perceptions of health science teacher interpersonal behaviour</field><field name="creator">Flinn, Susan Jane</field><field name="description">The major aim of this study was to investigate the use of the Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction (QTI) in health science classrooms in Tasmania, Australia. In the past, the QTI has been used in a number of learning areas. However, it has not been used in the learning area of health science.This study involved 1,471 grade 9 and grade 10 health science students and their teachers in 75 classes. The QTI was used to study student and teacher perceptions of health science teacher interpersonal behaviour.Statistical analyses revealed that the QTI is a valid and reliable instrument for use in health science classrooms. Quantitative results from the QTI were supported by qualitative data including comments from the students and a reflective narrative of the experiences of the researcher as a health science teacher.An investigation into the associations between QTI scales and student attitudinal and cognitive outcomes revealed that all scales of the QTI related to student attitudinal and cognitive outcomes in health science classrooms. It is, however, the scales of Leadership and Helping/Friendly which make the greatest positive influence to student attitudinal and cognitive outcomes.Health science students perceived their teachers as displaying high levels of leadership, helping/friendly and understanding behaviour, and low levels of uncertain, dissatisfied and admonishing behaviour. Teachers generally perceived themselves in a more favourable manner than their students did.The students also perceived the less experienced teachers as less dominant and more oppositional compared to teachers with more experience.

There is an inherent weakness in the public housing construction procurement in which price has been the overriding factor in the award of contracts and this has led to poor quality. A quantitative research method was adopted. The data for analysis included share price of listed construction contractors and other listed companies in Hong Kong. In addition, annual turnover of listed construction contractors from its company reports and available public housing projects to be tendered versus the number of prospective contractors were analysed. A main survey and a supplementary survey were also conducted after a qualitative initial study was launched to find out themes for the questions in the main survey. It is suggested that business risks of construction industry in Hong Kong are high when compared with non-construction business. As a consequence, risk premium from stocks of listed construction contractors should be higher than stocks of non- construction business. It is further suggested that risk premium of stocks of listed public housing construction contractors should be lower than other listed non- residential public buildings construction contractors due to adoption of subcontracting as risk management in the public housing construction industry. All these were being verified using share price, number of available public housing construction projects and company reports.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hong Kong Housing Authority, construction industry, Hong Kong Housing Department.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The historical geography of six major river basins in the north west of Western Australia since pastoral occupation</field><field name="creator">O'Grady, Colleen Margaid</field><field name="description">The thesis is based upon research into the historical geography of the pastoral industry in the six major drainage basins in the North West of Western Australia, in an attempt to outline its early development, and to explain how the rangeland degeneration associated with the Big Drought of 1936-1946 was exacerbated by unrealistic official expectations and poor management, particularly of stations in the hands of absentee corporate owners. it discusses the failure of government agencies to appreciate the effects of overstocking in an environment characterised by climatic variability and fragile rangeland resources. It draws attention to the official reluctance to take action against the destructive activities of profit-seeking corporate owners in the period leading up to and including the Big Drought, and of speculative leaseholders in more recent times The thesis attempts to differentiate between the grassmen as leaseholders bent upon generating a sustainable income from the rangeland through conservative management, and the exploitative owners and their (often) incompetent managers.

The study investigated the intensity of grief in a sample of parents of individuals with psychotic disorders in Western Australia to determine if the results replicate international studies. It further examined if the characteristics of the psychotic disorders of children, had an impact on the grief reactions of parents and if the disorder had a measurable impact on the nature of the relationship between parents and children. The study also identified specific coping strategies that parents consider as being most helpful to them in dealing with their grief, the relationship between intensity of grief and coping patterns of respondents and gender differences in grieving and coping strategies. The research findings suggest that there is measurable grief in a cross section of parents of individuals with psychotic disorders in Western Australia with many similarities to studies done internationally. The findings also suggest that this grief increases in intensity from the time of first diagnosis and peaks at 1-2 years after diagnosis and again 20 years after diagnosis. There was a strong association between past behaviours related to grief reactions and present feelings related to grief. To the best of my knowledge, these findings have not been reported before.

Enrolments in subjects like science have progressively declined and the persistent use of traditional teaching methods has often been held responsible for this. In less than a decade, the Internet has emerged as a potential tool to vary classroom routines, however, its use in high school science classrooms is still in its infancy. In this study, Getsmart, a website was developed and implemented in junior science and senior physics classrooms in a blended learning environment in a Queensland State High School. The study had three main objectives amongst others. The first aim was to study the impact of such an environment on students' perceptions. Secondly, the impact of such an environment on students' attitudes towards physics and junior science was studied. Finally, the research sought to investigate the effect of such an environment on their learning outcomes. Getsmart was developed on the principles of cognitive apprenticeship teaching model (Collins, Brown, &amp; Newman, 1989). During the research phase, the website was accessed by students once a week during class time. They also had the option to login in their own time at school (e.g., morning tea, lunchtime, before and after school) and at home. The research was conducted as a case study over two years and during this time, 406 students in junior science and physics participated.

It aims to break new ground by investigating Malay-English language alternation in the context of computer-mediated communication (CMC), in contrast to previous research which has mostly studied alternation or code-switching in informal conversations. The corpus of texts consists of 21 1 messages posted on the 'Bruclass' and 'Brudirect' forums. These were analysed in terms of their grammatical and discoursal features to determine what role is played by each of the contributing languages. Chapter 1 outlines the major research questions: how much alternation is there between Malay and English, how is this alternation achieved, and why do the bilingual text producers make these language choices when posting their messages in the on-line forums? This chapter also includes outline description of the sociolinguistic context of Brunei Darussalam in terms of its population, history, system of education, and discussion of the varieties of Malay and of English used by Bruneians. In Chapter 2 relevant literature on language alternation is reviewed, with a gradual narrowing of the focus: from theories of code-switching and language alternation to studies dealing specifically with Malay-English code-switching in Malaysia and in Brunei Darussalam. Studies on language use and alternation in the CMC domain are also reviewed. Chapter 3 discusses the combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, and the rationale for these. Findings from the grammatical and discoursal analyses are reported and discussed in Chapter 4.

This research investigates the essence of methodologies in order to understand and to address these consequences. In this thesis, methodologies are treated in a broad sense in order to arrive at a generalisable solution. An integrated research framework was constructed to pursue the solution. The framework is based on my adopted ontological, epistemological and methodological assumptions. The research is considered as an interpretivist single case study using qualitative research methods. A holistic Information Security Methodology was selected for in-depth study. Data were collected from various sources, but primarily from focus groups using 18 participants representing 11 organisations. Data were also collected from the developer of the methodology and two other organisations who were implementing it. Data analysis was based on a grounded approach to arrive at a substantive theory representing a conception of an ideal methodology as perceived by these practitioners. The use of the Hermeneutic circle and the purposely constructed Interrogative Framework were the essential tools for analysis. This conception is believed to hold some of the key factors for reducing the common problems of deviation and rejection of methodologies. The proposed theory is the main contribution of this research, which can be used as a foundation theory to construct and evaluate methodologies. The theory also has been used to propose extensions to existing theories. The core theory consists of basic elements and attributes. Other constructs were also developed to be used as contexts to the theory.

Due to the higher prevalence of FSCI in women, they may experience even greater disruption to roles and activity engagement. The literature consistently points to three main aspects when defining fatigue regardless of diagnoses; a physical aspect, a psychological aspect, and the impact on activity and participation. Research into the first two aspects has demonstrated relationships between fatigue, pain, depression, and social support. However, examination of the third aspect has been largely overlooked with respect its relationship to, and impact on, fatigue. Leisure theorists have hypothesized that engagement in leisure activities makes a positive contribution to physical and mental health. Previous research has measured leisure activities based on frequency of, or satisfaction with, participation. While some research has shown that physical and social activities have positive health benefits, gaps still exist in understanding the relative contribution of different types of leisure participation to fatigue and HRQoL.For example, little research has examined the contributions of leisure participation and leisure satisfaction to HRQoL and fatigue in women with chronic conditions. One explanation for the lack of research may be the absence of measurement tools developed to classify and quantify participation in different types of leisure activities for women with FSCI. Without a measurement tool, the relative contribution of participation in different activities (by frequency and/or satisfaction) to fatigue and HRQoL cannot be examined.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fatigue, chronic conditions, health related quality of life, physical health, mental health, leisure activities.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation, identification and characterisation of antibacterial compounds from Carissa lancelota R.Br.Root</field><field name="creator">Hettiarachchi, Dhanushka Sugeeshwara</field><field name="description">Carissa lanceolata (conkerberry) is a perennial woody shrub used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland for various medical conditions such as toothache, respiratory infections and the cleaning of sores, which all strongly indicate an antibacterial activity. A literature review revealed that the wood of this plant possesses significant antibacterial activity, which was found to be related to the presence of eudesmane type sesquiterpenes. C. edulis and C. carandus are frequently used in other traditional systems of medicine in different parts of the world, and thus have also been investigated for bioactive compounds and pharmacological properties. Some of these were found to be in line with the main findings of this work. Carissa lanceolata root was shown to exhibit significant antibacterial activity against both Gram negative and Gram positive organisms. A micro-broth dilution assay was performed on 96-well plates using resazurin as an indicator for microbial growth of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Bioassays carried out in this work showed that crude extracts of root bark and wood, particularly their polar constituents were more active against the four strains of bacteria tested.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">indigenous communities, antibacterial activity, Australia, Carissa Lanceolata, traditional medicine.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16899</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and validation of an instrument for assessing online learning environments in tertiary education: The Online Learning Environment Survey (OLLES)</field><field name="creator">Clayton, John Francis</field><field name="description">Increasingly the perceived benefits of using networked computers, software applications and computer simulations in learning activities are being exploited at all educational levels and within all curricula areas. As web-based and online software applications such as browsers, search engines, communication tools and data-bases mature, so does educator's use of this medium for teaching and learning. How we can investigate the impact of these technologies upon the educational experiences of learners was the fundamental concept addressed by this thesis. The study reports on the design, development and validation of a web-based survey instrument for use in online learning environments in tertiary education. The thesis investigated both previous psychosocial learning environment instrument development studies and the nature of environments created by the use of information and communication technologies. The research followed a two-phased instrument development process. Phase one focused on content validity, identifying salient scales and items and piloting the instrument with a limited audience. Phase two focused on construct validity, conducting an extensive field test with a web-based form and performing statistical analysis on the online data collected. Principal components analysis, with oblique and orthogonal rotations, confirmed the structure of a 35-item 7-scale instrument. The thesis concludes by confirming the new instrument, the Online Learning Environment Survey (OLLES), will allow conclusions to be drawn about student perceptions on the interactions occurring in their online environments in an economical and efficient manner.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">online learning environments in tertiary education, information and communication technologies, online learning environment survey (OLLES).</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spherical wave AVO response of isotropic and anisotropic media: Laboratory experiment versus numerical simulations</field><field name="creator">Alhussain, Mohammed</field><field name="description">A spherical wave AVO response is investigated by measuring ultrasonic reflection amplitudes from a water/Plexiglas interface. The experimental results show substantial deviation from the plane-wave reflection coefficients at large angles. However there is an excellent agreement between experimental data and full-wave numerical simulations performed with the reflectivity algorithm. By comparing the spherical-wave AVO response, modeled with different frequencies, to the plane-wave response, I show that the differences between the two are of such magnitude that three-term AVO inversion based on AVA curvature can be erroneous. I then propose an alternative approach to use critical angle information extracted from AVA curves, and show that this leads to a significant improvement of the estimation of elastic parameters. Azimuthal variation of the AVO response of a vertically fractured model also shows good agreement with anisotropic reflectivity simulations, especially in terms of extracted critical angles which indicated that (1) reflection measurements are consistent with the transmission measurements; (2) the anisotropic numerical simulation algorithm is capable of simulating subtle azimuthal variations with excellent accuracy; (3) the methodology of picking critical angles on seismograms using the inflection point is robust, even in the presence of random and/or systematic noise.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">estimation of elastic parameters, AVA curves, plane-wave response, spherical wave AVO response.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alcohol consumption, smoking and lifestyle characteristics for Japanese patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</field><field name="creator">Hirayama, Fumi</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated lifestyle characteristics including cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, dietary supplements intake, physical activity, and urinary incontinence status for Japanese patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

A small male peer group in a selected school setting was studied over a three - year period, with an emphasis on extensive observation and interview. The study suggests that students actively engage in resistance as a way to claim power and prove masculinities, and thus identities, in the school setting, often resulting in poor educational outcomes for individual boys. The thesis proposes that discourses of masculinities are central to the creation of identities for young adolescent males, and shape the way they present as learners in the school environment. These discourses are informed and governed by peers and the need for individuals to find belonging within the peer milieu. Central to such discourses is the theme of power. Focused on gender as being socially constructed, and humans perceived to be self determining and moulded through interactions with others, this study is strongly influenced by the ideas of John Dewey (1910, 1966), Charles Taylor (1989, 1994) and Michael Foucault (1971,1977,1978,1981). It uses a framework based on three central themes - identity, power, and peer relationships, to shape and provide focus to the inquiry. In so doing, it seeks to find a "third space", a place where meanings become "fused" and "new horizons" emerge. The presentation is divided into four sections. The first section outlines the nature, research design and setting of the study. The second uses dialogue of the varying voices I brought to the research to explore the central themes of the framework. The third section draws the three themes together to examine the subjects' understanding of masculinities and how this influences their identities as learners, as well as how they perceive possible futures.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">secondary school boys development of masculinities, peer influences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18463</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of an intervention program for the treatment of malaria in children in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Joshua, Isaac B.</field><field name="description">Malaria is more prevalent today and the death toll is on the increase annually. It is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide and most of these deaths are in the poorest regions of the world. About 500 million cases are reported annually with more than 2 million deaths, and most are children. It is the major killer in the tropics and a major public health problem in developing countries and Papua New Guinea (PNG) is no exception. Resistant strains have been reported. This may be enhanced by inappropriate human behaviour in the use of anti-malarial drugs. Human factors include inappropriate prescribing and patient behaviour in using anti-malarial drugs. Despite the establishment of the standard treatment guidelines for malaria in PNG, three out of every four patients have chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria and malaria remains a major health problem. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of an education program on patients carers' understanding and effective use of anti-malarial drugs for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in children in general health clinics in PNG. The trial design involved a pre-post intervention study with a control group. The study was undertaken in the National Capital District. Papua New Guinea using one Clinic as the intervention site and another as the control site. The two clinics were similar in characteristics as confirmed in the study by demographic data where there were no significant differences observed. The data collection took placed over the period February to April 2002. It included observation of drug provision at study sites and interviews of patient carers on the first day at the clinic and a follow up seven days later. Three questionnaires were developed to evaluate the process and outcomes of malaria drug treatment in the above health facilities.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug Utilization Review (DUR), anti-malarial drugs, Rational Use of Drugs (RUD).</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analogies constructed by students in a selective high school</field><field name="creator">Crowley, Julianne Kathleen</field><field name="description">Research in science education over the past 20 years has emphasized the importance of active cognition in conceptual development. Students formulate knowledge within language constructions constrained by culture and social construction and relate to their own purposes using speech and writing. Many students in high school do not recognize the use of analogy in the development of science theory and concepts. By focusing on the constructed nature of science and analogy this thesis aimed to determine the capacity of high ability students to engage their own thinking and so have a powerful tool with which to deconstruct and reconstruct their scientific understandings. This thesis focused on the use of analogy in a Year 7 electricity unit and a Year 9 geology unit and used examination questions, quizzes, diary entries and interviews to determine the role of analogies in learning. The specific research questions asked were: Can high ability students create their own analogies?, What role do analogies play in learning?, and How do analogies help students in concept development? The thesis found that analogies are powerful tools in supporting student conceptual development. They allow students to link from their existing framework to new understandings and visual analogs were the most effective in supporting learning. The students move to new understandings may not happen within the teaching time but could occur several months after the introduction of the analogy.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science education,  analogy, concept development.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13465</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of learners' spatial capacity and world views on their spatial conceptualisation : a case study</field><field name="creator">Schafer, Marc</field><field name="description">This multi-sited case study aims to explore spatial capacity through pen-and-paper and hands-on activity tests, and explore world view perceptions of space in an attempt to show that spatial conceptualisation is a rich and complex blend of spatial capacity and world view. This study is oriented in a interpretive-naturalistic paradigm and characterised by multi-dimensional quantitative and qualitative methods. The research, set in five secondary schools in the Eastern Cape, was carried out with 32 Grade 11 learners and was designed around seven stages. This study attempts to understand spatial conceptualisation by recognising that all learners have epistemological macrostructures (world views) that shape their perceptions of the world in general and of space in particular. The main contention of this study is that spatial conceptualisation cannot be understood in isolation, through studying achievements on traditional pen-and-paper tests only. A comprehensive understanding of an individual's spatial conceptualisation involves the recognition of hands-on skills and world views as well. Spatial capacity, defined here in terms of spatial visualisation and orientation constructs, was explored through a pen-and-paper and a hands-on activity test. The results show only a weak to moderate correlation between the two tests, suggesting that performance in a traditional pen-and-paper test was not necessarily a good predictor for performance in a hands-on activity-based test. The investigation of world views was underpinned by a logico-structuralist process centred in conversations around nine bi-polar themes. Through a process of content- and meta- analyses involving the participation of a validation team, world-view profiles were established.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spatial orientation, spatial conceptualisation, spatial capacity, world view theory, spatial visualisation, South African secondary schools, multi-sited case study, case study.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13863</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of multiple representations on the learning of calculus by ESL students</field><field name="creator">Bridson, David J.</field><field name="description">The goals of this study were to research the learning difficulties among a group of four pre-university introductory calculus students who were mainly international students studying English as a Second Language (M). The intention was to create a constructivist-style classroom environment in order to determine if it could improve students` knowledge about the use and management of multiple representations (that is, graphical, rum~ symbolic, pictorial, linguistic or diagrammatic approaches for problem representation), increase their classroom communication as a means to improving ability in the modelling of calculus word problems, and to develop, implement and evaluate a teaching package that encouraged the use of multiple representations as a means of improving conceptual understanding. The achievement of these goals was sought by means of the development, implementation and evaluation of a number of calculus extended tasks that encouraged the use of multiple representations. These activities facilitated the compilation of a menu of approaches to the solution of mathematical problems, while the longitudinal nature of the study allowed for the monitoring of student changes in their preferred approach. A traditional calculus curriculum was used for the study, but the instructional emphasis was based more on students' understanding of concepts in a classroom environment utilising a constructivist approach rather than on their memorising computational techniques.

The study proceeded through two stages: Quantitative surveying of students and parents prior to the implementation of school improvement initiatives; and quantitative and qualitative surveying of students and parents after 12 and 18 months, respectively, of reform implementation and application of the treatment.Evidence of change in the college and classroom culture and learning environment was evident after twelve months. The case study identified that students and parents identified changes in a number of elements of the classroom culture and learning environment. These included improvements in home-school communications, involvement in classroom planning and organization, relationships between teachers and students, school culture and evidence of pedagogical change. The research also identified that change had not occurred in the attainment of student learning outcomes, educational values and parent confidence to assist students in their learning.It became apparent that change in the organisational culture had occurred within the first 12 to 18 months.

In addition four refereed journal articles are included to complement the final report completed in 200l.This work shows the progressive development of a framework to describe the Western Australian compensation system. The first report, completed in 1991, explores the links between the resolution of disputed compensation claims and other elements of the compensation system. The second report, completed in 1999, is concerned with the issue of cost containment within the compensation system and the final report, completed in 2001, combines the insights of the previous two reports with the work of other commentators to develop a broad holistic framework for a compensation system in Western Australia. Underpinning the compilation of the three government reports is the legal analysis contained in the Workers Compensation Western Australia Loose-leaf service.

The aim of the research was to increase intellectual engagement through the implementation of a simple instructional cycle to replace a dominant lecture approach. The cycle consisted of three phases: (a) a plenary which is a short presentation of the subject matter, (b) seatwork activity where students work on problems, questions or activities with the instructor moving around the classroom, and (c) closure or summary which includes reactions to learning difficulties encountered by the instructor during phase b. The approach was designed to improve basic teaching skills and to enhance instructors' knowledge of student learning problems. The research employed qualitative and quantitative methods utilising multiple sources of data collection. Validation and reliability criteria were addressed through pluralistic epistemologies; triangulation, use of external observers, member checks, peer commentaries, and case studies. Likewise, the instructors' adaptation to the three phases in the approach were analysed together with students' perceptions of the teaching approaches in the new course. Two instructors, who were involved in the case study, taught the first version of the course having been coached by the researcher who attended almost all lessons within the semester. Analysis of the data indicated that the instructors developed teaching skills applicable in this instructional cycle approach.

Parental expectation of children's private and public behaviour, as well as their relevance to gender and age are explored.The findings from the survey suggested that the qualities held to be the most important for the Stayer group were those qualities that would be useful for their children to be successful in Australia. Qualities such as independence, assertiveness and using initiative were rated as being more desirable to develop for the children in the Stayer group than those children in the Sojourner group.

However, flocculation of Bayer process residue solids takes place in highly caustic liquors, typically using high molecular weight polyacrylates. This represents an almost unique situation, and implies a totally different adsorption mechanism. Direct examination of polyacrylate adsorption within the complex matrix of real liquors and a mixture of residue phases is difficult, making it necessary to focus on a model substrate (hematite) and synthetic liquors (pH 13 at high ionic strength). Previous spectral studies have used ex situ techniques, with sample drying potentially altering the adsorbed species, leading to inconclusive results. This study presents for the first time direct in situ evidence of polyacrylate adsorption onto hematite obtained by Fourier Transform Infrared-Attenuated Total Reflection (FTIR-ATR) Spectroscopy. Adsorption and hence concentration of dilute polyacrylate solutions onto hematite-coated zinc selenide optics has provided spectra of adsorbed polymer under a range of conditions, unbiased by any contribution from the bulk polymer solution. Analysis of the polyacrylate carbon-oxygen stretching frequencies established differing modes of adsorption at low and high pH conditions. At pH 2 adsorption proceeded through bidentate chelation of the carboxylate to a surface ferric ion, facilitated through deprotonation of a carboxylic acid group and removal of a hematite surface hydroxyl group, i.e. chemisorption. Unshifted carboxyl peaks in the spectrum enabled the unadsorbed 'loops' and 'tails' to be distinguished from the adsorbed polymer, and represented at least 70% of the total polymer chain length.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bayer reside flocculation, chemisorption, physisorption, flocculant adsorption.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13689</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing understandings of 'inclusion' and 'inclusive schooling'</field><field name="creator">Bridge, Douglas James</field><field name="description">This thesis suggests that students with (dis)abilities are immersed in, and emerge from powerful discourses within classrooms named `inclusive'. It suggests that resilient and normative psycho-medical discourses and discourses of special education work to maintain the deep structures of schooling, and work against a valuing of difference, and of the Other, within schools and classrooms named `inclusive'. The inquiry that is the basis of this thesis works with textual representations of `inclusion' and `inclusive schooling' and works to address issues of identity and subjectivity within the various discourses from which `inclusion' and `inclusive schooling' might be understood to emerge. It is sited within Western philosophical streams concerned with language and meaning, discourse and narrative, texts and textuality. It emerges from a qualitative research paradigm and is deeply influenced by the earlier works of Michel Foucault (1969, 1970, 1972, 1991). Through these works Foucault develops `genealogy' as a form of historical analysis. This thesis engages genealogy as a form for critical interpretative inquiry into schooling practices named `inclusive' of students with (dis)abilities. The genealogy admits the historical, social, theoretical and political contexts which frame research, inquiry and interpretation within the social sciences. The inquiry emerges from an epistemology of tentativeness and uncertainty. It accepts that knowledge is contextual, contingent and indeterminate. It addresses the associated `crisis of representation' (Denzin &amp; Lincoln 1994, 1998) related to what might constitute an adequate description of the sets of social relations and spaces named `inclusive schooling' through interpretative processes of opening questions and sets of questions.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">special education, interpreting discourse, inclusive classrooms.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The convergence of industrial and workers compensation laws in the 1990s in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Guthrie, Robert</field><field name="description">This dissertation describes and interprets the effects of the significant changes to the workers compensation, industrial and related laws that occurred in the early 1990s in Western Australia. These could be characterised as motivated by a desire by the then Coalition Government to reduce access to legal representation in compensation claims, limit the potential of workers to claim damages for negligence and reduce the use of collective bargaining mechanisms to resolve industrial disputes. Arguably, the common philosophical themes were to individualise the relationship between employer and employee and to reduce the bargaining strength of workers. In general terms, these themes were presented under the guise of flexible workplace relations. Whether these outcomes were achieved is not the subject of this analysis, rather, the aim is to show that one (perhaps unintended) consequence of the legislative changes of the early 1990s was to create significant areas of overlap in various employment related laws. These areas of overlap have led to some difficulties within the various tribunals involved in the resolution of employment related disputes. Over the last decade, the issues arising from the 1990s amendments have crystallized into important principles, which are discussed in this work. The thesis of this dissertation is that an examination of the development of the industrial and workers compensation laws in Western Australia in the 1990s establishes sufficient commonality between the industrial relations and compensation systems to warrant the rationalisation of these two jurisdictions.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">compensation claims, industrial relations, employment related laws.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An econometric approach to measuring productivity: Australia as a case study</field><field name="creator">Agbenyegah, Benjamin Komla</field><field name="description">Seminal papers of Solow (1957) and Swan (1956) stimulated debate among economists on the role of technical change in productivity improvements and for that matter economic growth. The consensus is that technological change accounts for a significant proportion of gross national product (GNP) growth in industrialised economies. In the case of Australia, the aggregate productivity performance was poor in the 1970s and 1980s, but picked up very strongly by the 1990s, and was above the OECD average growth level for the first time in its productivity growth history. However, this high productivity growth rate could not be sustained and Australia started to experience a slowdown in productivity growth since 2000. This study empirically measures the performance of productivity in Australia&#8217;s economy for the period 1950-2005, using an econometric approach. Time-series data are used to develop econometric models that capture the dynamic interactions between GDP, fixed capital, labour units, human capital, foreign direct investment (FDI) and information and communication technology (ICT). The Johansen (1988) cointegration techniques are used to establish a long-run steady-state relation between or among economic time series.

Time-out requires individuals to pause briefly after stuttering and to resume talking after a pause in this case, of five seconds. A randomised control group design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of time-out treatment. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to either a time-out treatment or control group. The results demonstrated that individuals who stutter are highly responsive to time-out treatment. The impact of the severity of the stutter, a person's age, previous treatment, and the nature of the stutter on treatment outcome, were also investigated. Baseline severity was a strong predictor of treatment outcome, and to a lesser degree, previous treatment and speech rate were found to share some influence over treatment success. In addition, there was an unexpected change in the stuttering topography over the experiment conditions.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">speech, stuttering, time-out treatment.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors that influence the utilization of maternity services and breastfeeding practices in rural Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Duong, Dat Van</field><field name="description">The overall objective of this thesis is to investigate factors that influence the utilization of maternal services, infant feeding and postpartum contraception practices in rural Vietnam. Field studies were carried out in a rural district of Thanh Hoa, a province located in North Central Vietnam. Willingness-to-pay for maternal preferences was measured in a sample of 200 postpartum and 196 pregnant women, as well as 196 men using the payment card technique. An association was found between satisfaction with the quality of maternal services and willingness-to-pay. There were no significant differences in willingness-to-pay values between prenatal and postpartum groups, and between male and female subjects. The feasibility, reliability and validity of a 20-item scale for measuring perceived quality of maternal services provided at commune health centres, were examined based on a sample of 200 postpartum and 196 pregnant women. The instrument was found to have good inter-rater reliability and internal consistency. Maternal status of clients (prenatal vs. postnatal) was found to influence the perceived quality of maternal services. Determinants of the utilization of maternal services at the primary health care level were investigated in a sample of 200 postpartum women together with sixteen focus group discussions and 16 in-depth interviews. The results showed that client-perceived quality of services and socio-cultural, and economic factors, rather than geographical access, could affect the utilization of maternal services. Factors affecting infant feeding practices were measured in a longitudinal study of 463 women at weeks one, 16 and 24 postpartum. Within the first week after delivery, the initiation and exclusive breastfeeding rates were relatively high at 98.3% and 83.6% respectively, but the premature introduction of complementary food was a great concern.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vietnam, postpartum contraception, exclusive breastfeeding.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impacts of mining and mine closure on water quality and the nature of the shallow aquifier, Yandi Iron Ore Mine</field><field name="creator">Gardiner, Sean Jonathan</field><field name="description">The Hamersley Yandi Iron Ore Mine of Hamersley Iron Pty. Ltd. is located in the Pilbara region, Western Australia, approximately 90km north west of the town of Newman. The iron ore has accumulated in a palaeochannel as an enriched Channel Iron Deposit (CID). Mining in other parts of this palaeochannel has been practised since 1991. Named deposits in the province are, from west to east, Munjina, Pool, Meander, Western, Central, Eastern, Junction and the Billiard deposits.Presently the CID acts as an aquifer and transmits water through its fracture system. It is the main conduit for the regional groundwater. The Water and Rivers Commission of Western Australia considers the groundwater in the alluvial beds of the Weeli Wolli Creek overlying the CID to be a useful resource. The groundwater is currently used for stock watering so the quality should be preserved.Part of the four possible closure plans of the Yandi Mine is to backfill the excavated channel with waste rock from the mining operation. The waste material will consist of the uneconomic grade lateritic pisolite iron ore, together with colluvium and alluvium overburden. The closure plans will also leave behind two pit lakes.The impact of these closure plans vary but each plan will leave pit lakes containing water with high salinity and this may adversely affect the quality of the groundwater downstream of the lakes.The hydraulic conductivity of the shallow aquifer may be impaired by swelling clays found in parts of the waste material. This impact would be reduced if the chosen closure plan was one with hydrogeological flow management.The water quality downstream of the pit lakes will change and the environmental impact on the groundwater will depend on which closure plan is chosen. This thesis suggests a number of options for consideration.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mine closure, mining, water analysis, Yandi Iron Ore Mine.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diffraction-based modelling of microstructural size and strain effects in sintered ceramics</field><field name="creator">Pratapa, Suminar</field><field name="description">Crystallite (or grain) size and strain within a polycrystalline material may have a profound influence on its physical properties, eg. the fracture toughness, wear and thermal shock resistance. A diffraction pattern for a material conveys information about the strain through the strain-induced changes in the shapes of the Bragg peaks and also through peak shifts. Crystallite size effects also influence the peak shape. Therefore, it is possible, in principle, to extract descriptions of crystallite size and strain from the peak broadening of a diffraction pattern. Various methods for size and strain evaluations have been proposed for extraction of the size and strain information in metals and ceramic powders. However, there appear to be no detailed amounts in the literature to be on the development of models appropriate for sintered ceramic materials. The objectives for this study were to critically examine the existing models for crystallite size and strain assessments and then to develop a new physically-based model which might be appropriate for sintered ceramics. The principal steps for the research, designed to fulfill the study objectives, were (1) acquiring high-quality diffraction data with synchrotron radiation, laboratory x-ray and neutron diffraction techniques for model evaluation; (2) performing preliminary evaluation using the existing models; (3) developing a new model and the non-linear least-squares calculation software; and (4) performing peak profile analyses using the existing and new models to evaluate the effectiveness of the new model. A convolution model for crystallite size and strain determination from diffraction line broadening has been developed with particular reference to the characterisation of sintered ceramics.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ceramics, crystallite size, grain size, strain assessment.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Subband acoustic echo cancellation</field><field name="creator">Huo, Jiaquan</field><field name="description">The main theme of this thesis is the control of acoustic echoes for modem voice communication systems by means of echo cancellation. Two important issues in acoustic echo cancellation, namely the efficient adaptation of the echo cancellation filter and the reliable adaptation of the echo cancellation filter in double talk environment, are investigated. The delayless subband adaptive filter architecture is studied. Efficient implementation of the analysis filter bank and the time domain filtering are derived. The transforming of the subband filter weights to a fullhand counterpart is examined. It is shown that the weight transform is a synthesis filtering procedure. Two new weight transform schemes that deliver substantial performance improvements are proposed. The open-loop optimal subband filter impulse responses are shown to be non-causal and several anti-causal laps in the subband filters are required to model this non-causality. Because of the inevitable double talk detection errors, adaptive filtering algorithms with built-in double talk robustness measures are needed for the reliable operation of the echo canceller. The basic idea of robust adaptive filtering is examined. A comparison of different existing time domain robust adaptive filtering algorithms demonstrates that excellent trade-off between the convergence and the tracking properties and the double talk robustness of the adaptive filtering algorithm can he achieved by using Huher&#8217;s method for both the update of the echo cancellation filter and the estimation of scale. A delayless closed-loop robust sub- hand adaptive filter is proposed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adaptive filtering, adaptation in subbands, telecommunications.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of a University Physics Studio Learning Environment: The Interrelationships of Students' Perceptions, Epistemological Beliefs and Cognitive Outcomes.</field><field name="creator">Yeo, Shelley R.</field><field name="description">Physics learning has been the focus of much research over the last few decades. One line of such research has had knowledge about physics conceptual understanding as its object. Conceptual physics learning is found to be enhanced by the use of a variety of interactive engagement teaching and learning strategies. Another line of research in physics education has been through the development of computer-based learning environments as alternatives to traditional lecturing approaches. One such development has been that of a 'physics Studio' in which computer software delivers content and facilitates activities and communication, and instructors adopt a tutoring or learning facilitator role rather than lecturing role. Curtin University of Technology has drawn on both lines of research, resulting in the creation of a Physics Studio. In addition, a constructivist philosophy has provided guiding principles underpinning the conduct of first year physics classes. The aim of this study has been to evaluate students' physics learning in first year Studio classes. In particular, the aim has been to examine the role of students' epistemological beliefs (beliefs about knowledge and knowing) and their perceptions of the learning environment, in that learning. The study is situated across the fields of psychology and physics education research. It uses an ex-post facto comparative research design together with a qualitative methodology to compare students in Studio classes with those in physics classes in a traditional lecture stream. The use of multidimensional scaling as a technique for reducing complex data to a visual form for the purpose of describing and investigating the Studio learning environment is also explored.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Epistemological Beliefs, Learning Environment,  Physics Studio, Physics Education,  Cognition.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14983</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of the health of the Swan-Canning river system using biochemical markers of exposure of fish</field><field name="creator">Webb, Diane</field><field name="description">Most environmental studies concerning the environmental health of the Swan- Canning River system have focussed on nutrient inputs from both rural and urban catchments that are the cause of algal blooms. On occasions these algal blooms have resulted in fish deaths attributed to oxygen starvation. Relatively few studies have examined whether non-nutrient contamination is affecting the health of the riverine environment. Those studies that have, have concentrated on measuring the levels of heavy metals, organochlorines, organophosphates, and hydrocarbons in the sediments and water of the river system, and in the flesh of the biota. However, chemical analysis often fails to detect chemicals of concern due to high laboratory detection limits. In addition, analysis of the body burden of contaminants within biota does not necessarily convey if exposure is inducing adverse effects at the individual or ecosystem levels. The use of biochemical markers as a tool for the assessment of the health of the Swan-Canning River system was examined under a collaborative research project with the Waters and Rivers Commission, established in response to the recognition of the paucity of information from chemical analyses. The present study focussed on the estuarine portion of the Swan-Canning River system, using the black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri), an estuarine dependent fish species, as a biomonitoring tool. Prior to the commencement of this study it had been determined that the black bream was a suitable fish species for use as a biomonitoring tool when using mixed function oxygenase (MFO) activity induction under laboratory conditions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aquatic toxicology, bioindicators, water pollution, biomarkers.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The accidental thesis: playing Go with Deleuze and Guattari</field><field name="creator">Gordan, Christina Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis uses a reading of Deleuze and Guattarian philosophies, drawn in the main from their companion texts Anti-Oediuus and A Thousand Plateaus, to explore ways in which popular cultural events and texts construct the way we think. The thesis explores how popular narrative produces the conditions of thinking in terms of a state model of subject-identity, and the manner in which this thinking constructs desire in terms of a desire for its own repression. Of particular concern is the danger this thinking has in constructing a populace conductive to the formation of social conditions marked by fascistic political practices. In considering this kind of thinking and its modes of construction, Deleuze and Guattari make a significant shift away from dominant theoretical analysis of power to argue that desire and the capture of desire are the primary agents of state control.The thesis draws on a number of popular cultural mediums and events, working towards a particular exemplary focus on the social conditions in contemporary Australian society. Integrating dialogues with several other key theorists across a broad spectrum of cultural studies concerns, it concludes that the state model reproduces itself throughout history and within different historical and cultural formations as a repetition of minority desires controlling the majority populous through refrains that appropriate plurality and difference. Further, while collective social revolutionary movements have ultimately failed in the past to overcome this repetition, the thesis suggests that Deleuze and Guattaris concepts of becoming through a molecular revolution, aimed at re-constructing the way we think, remains as a positive hope for liberation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">society, politics, philosophers, power.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical Success Factors of International Franchising: Case Studies of Foreign Franchisors in Asia</field><field name="creator">Choo, Stephen</field><field name="description">A multiple case study of four foreign franchisors was conducted in 2000 to study the critical success factors of international franchising in East Asia. The four franchisors were chosen because they possess different international franchising capabilities and are at varying levels of internationalisation. This study provides a useful insight into how a foreign franchisor should approach and compete successfully in East Asia. Firstly, the research provides a conceptual model, which displays the six key categories and success factors for international franchising in East Asia. The study has made a significant contribution in identifying two new categories that have mostly been neglected by researchers in international franchising. Secondly, the study reveals a unique form of master franchising that is being practiced in East Asia. Thirdly, the effective management of Asian partners is found to begin with recruiting the right partners with the desired characteristics and subsequently developing a long-term mutually beneficial working relationship with the partners.

This study investigates the experiences of one Aboriginal family with an extensive history of involvement with Australian Rules Football using methodologies which seek, and value, Aboriginal perspectives on their involvement. It privileges Indigenous knowledge. The study focuses particularly on the involvement of the Hayward family in Australian Rules Football - the game they love - and in which they have been intensely involved for many generations. The study describes how the Haywards of southwest Western Australia, like most Aboriginal families, experienced an extensive period of colonisation in which their social and cultural autonomy and power were eroded. The historical experience of Aboriginal Australians is vastly different to that of mainstream Australians, and grossly inequitable, not only in terms of economic and educational opportunity, but also in terms of access to sporting opportunities. In many ways, the story of the Hayward family is representative of the experiences of many Black sportsmen and women over the past hundred years. It is suggested that, in order to understand Aboriginal participation and foster the development of Aboriginal sportspeople of all ages, an understanding of the context of their lives is crucial. This study then, explores my extended family's experiences as participants in mainstream sport. It describes how the Haywards, like their community contemporaries, have confronted the limited opportunities afforded to them in their ambitions to gain access, equity of participation, and appropriate reward for effort in their sporting endeavours.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">racial issues in sport, AFL, Aussie Rules football, Aboriginals in sport.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of a nation-wide pilot program in school mathematics</field><field name="creator">Swincicky, Kevin Bohdan</field><field name="description">There has been much debate over many years in the Australian Federal Parliament on the implementation of a national curriculum in mathematics. In 2004, the Government, under the direction of the then Minister for Education Brendon Nelson, initiated a national mathematics program for students in lower secondary high schools and primary schools. The Australian International Centre for Excellence was commissioned to implement a pilot program and called for expressions of interest to participate from high schools across the nation. At that time I was working as the Acting Head of the Mathematics Department at a senior high school in a large Western Australian country centre. I was concerned with the content and level of difficulty in many of the textbooks that were available for our students and also the processes used in these textbooks (or by teachers) to assist students to gain mastery of the basic mathematical concepts in the Outcome Number. I decided to apply to participate in the pilot program on behalf of my school, and my application was accepted. In the first stage of the program two classes of both Year 8 and Year 9 students were selected. One of my cooperative colleagues and I found out very early that the Year 8 ICE-EM textbook was too difficult for many of these students as they lacked the skills to do much of the work in the Outcome Number. These students had very different learning experiences in their primary school mathematics, with schools and teachers placing different emphases on each of the Outcomes in mathematics. The opportunity to modify our school's Year 8 program and to implement change in the high schools' feeder primary schools occurred with the second stage of the pilot program's Transition Phases 1 and 2, due for implementation in 2007.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematics national curriculum, pilot program, lower secondary high schools, primary schools, Australian International Centre for Excellence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=118240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young adults' experience of living with a mental illness in rural Western Australia: a grounded theory approach</field><field name="creator">Mostafanejad, Karola</field><field name="description">It is estimated that one in five Australians are affected by a mental disorder, and the associated burden of living with a mental illness will become one of the greatest health care issues during the next 20 years. Since the 1960s, the care of people with mental disorders has been transferred to community settings including to rural areas of Australia through the process of deinstitutionalisation. However, research on young adults living with a mental illness in rural communities is limited, and the multidimensional experience of this group of young adults has not been previously explored. This study, guided by grounded theory methodology, explored young adults' experience of living with a mental illness in rural Western Australia. This thesis presents the findings of interviews with nine participants aged between 18 and 30 and places the findings within the context of relevant scientific literature. The constant comparative method used in grounded theory analysis identified that the basic social psychological problem experienced by all participants was "being shut out". The problem of being shut out consisted of two aspects: "being excluded" and "withdrawing from society". In order to manage the problem of being shut out, participants engaged in the basic social psychological process of "seeking normality". In seeking normality participants moved from a state of being shut out to one whereby they sought to take part in ordinary social activities taken for granted by other members of society. The process of seeking normality consisted of three phases: "floundering", "taking charge", and "moving forward. Phase one of the process occurred primarily in the period prior to experiencing a turning point, which changed the participants' willingness to take control of their life and to take effective steps in reducing their isolation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health professionals, basic social psychological problem and process, mental disorders.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16160</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical and Experimental Analysis of Spur Gears in Mesh</field><field name="creator">Wang, Jiande</field><field name="description">The investigation of numerical methods for modelling the mechanism properties ofinvolute spur gears in mesh, over the mesh cycle, forms the major part of this thesis.Gearing is perhaps one of the most critical components in power transmission systemsand the transmission error of gears in mesh is considered to be one of the main causes ofgear noise and vibration. Numerous papers have been published on gear transmissionerror measurement and many investigations have been devoted to gear vibration analysis.There still, however, remains to be developed a general Finite Element Model capable ofpredicting the effect of variations in rigid body gear tooth position, in which the criticalstage is the prediction of gear behaviour with profile modifications (including tip-relief).In this thesis, FEA results have been obtained by using various techniques including: (a)adaptive re-mesh with contacts using quad (2D) and brick (3D) elements and (b) theelement birth and death option. Tooth profile modifications can affect the behaviour ofthe gear meshing including the T.E., ratio of local deformation and load-sharing ratioresults, etc, providing an alternative method for gear design.

Encapsulation of these molecules with biodegradable polymers represents one way of overcoming various problems associated with the conventional delivery of macromolecules, for example instability and short biological half-life. The use of carriers made of hydrophilic polysaccharides such as chitosan, has been pursued as a promising alternative for improving the transport of biologically active macromolecules across biological surfaces. The development of nanoparticles as a delivery system also has major advantages of achieving possible drug protection, controlled release and drug targeting by either a passive or an active means. The aim of this study was to develop a simple and effective method to formulate biodegradable nanoparticles for the delivery of a model protein-bovine serum albumin (BSA) and an angiogenesis inhibitor, arginine-rich hexapeptide (ARE peptide). Major factors which determine nanoparticle formation and loading of the protein and the peptide as well as the underlying mechanisms controlling their incorporation and release characteristics were investigated. The preparation technique, based on the complex coacervation process, is extremely mild and involves the mixture of two aqueous solutions (chitosan and dextran sulfate) at room temperature. The formation of nanoparticles is dependent on the concentrations of chitosan (CS) and dextran sulfate (DS); particles with size, of 257 to 494nm can be obtained with 0.1%w/v solutions of CS and DS. Zeta potential of nanoparicles can be modulated conveniently from -34.3mV to +52.7mV by varying the composition of the two ionic polymers.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drug carriers, CS/DS nanoparticles, drug delivery.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of teachers school-level environment perceptions on changing elementary mathematics classroom environments</field><field name="creator">Blose, Ralph J.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to establish an action research plan for teachers to improve student outcomes by assessing, describing, and changing their classroom environments.

Marine clay is present at the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. Land reclamation on this highly compressible soil foundation often requires the use of soil improvement works to eliminate significant future settlements from occurring. The combination of prefabricated vertical drains with preloading is one of the most widely used ground improvement methods in land reclamation projects. The best means available for field measurement and back-analysis of the marine clay geotechnical characteristics under reclamation fills is by carrying out extensive field instrumentation and in-situ tests. In-situ testing of marine clay was carried out at a test site. In-situ penetration testing was used to analyse the degree of consolidation, the improved shear strengths, overconsolidation ratio and the effective stress of marine clay prior to reclamation as well as after surcharge loading. In-situ dissipation testing was used to determine the coefficient of consolidation due to horizontal flow and horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the marine clay prior to reclamation as well as after surcharge loading. The in-situ penetration and dissipation tests were carried out by means of the field vane shear, piezocone, dilatometer, self-boring pressuremeter and BAT permeameter.

Functional models are needed to support farmers tactical decisions. In order to develop an appropriate model, a comparison is carried out of potential modelling approaches to address the question of what to grow where. A probabilistic GlS model is identified in this research as a suitable model for this purpose. This model is implemented as the stand-alone Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) CaNaSTA, based on trial data and expert knowledge available for Central America and forage crops. The processes and methods used address many of the problems encountered with other agricultural DSS and SDSS. CaNaSTA shows significant overlap with recommendations from other sources. In addition, CaNaSTA provides details on the likely adaptation distribution of each species at each location, as well as measures of sensitivity and certainty. The combination of data and expert knowledge in a spatial environment allows spatial and aspatial uncertainty to be explicitly modelled. This is an original approach to the problem of helping farmers decide what to plant where.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">forages in tropical agriculture, developing countries, forage selection.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15872</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The perceptions of lecturers and on-campus students on online teaching and learning in higher education</field><field name="creator">Chin, Kum Leng</field><field name="description">In recent times, there has been a strong push for higher education institutions to offer more online courses to cater for students who otherwise would be denied university education. While this may benefit the many distance education students, the take-up rate of totally online education by current on-campus students remains uncertain. At the same time, many lecturers have started to design and develop online teaching material for their courses; many do so without the support of their employer - the university that they work in. The purpose of this study is two-fold. Firstly, to gain an insight into how on-campus students perceive online learning and to examine their readiness and willingness to make the shift from conventional classroom learning to online learning with no face-to-face contact. Secondly, to gain an insight into how lecturers approach online teaching; so as to better understand the problems they face when switching to a teaching mode that is quite different from the classroom teaching they are familiar with. The outcomes of this study will provide us with a better understanding of how lecturers and on-campus students perceive online teaching and learning. Understanding students' level of readiness to take part in online learning and their willingness to switch from the conventional classroom to cyberspace will assist universities in making decisions on the future direction of online courses. This is particularly important to those universities that intend to replace conventional classroom teaching with online courses. A better understanding of the problems faced by students and lecturers in online teaching and learning will also enable university administrators to ensure adequate resources are being allocated and the right level of support is provided.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">World Wide Web (WWW) and learning, on-line course material, Internet and higher education.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16074</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of lifestyle factors on the clinical outcomes of in vitro fertilisation-embryo transfer (IVF) treatment</field><field name="creator">Joesbury, Karen Ann</field><field name="description">Objectives: To determine the effect of female and male cigarette smoking, caffeine and alcohol consumption, stress and indicators of dietary status on the clinical outcomes of NF treatment. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: PIVET Medical Centre, Perth, Western Australia. Patients: Of 351 couples who commenced IVF treatment at PIVET Medical Centre between January 1997 and August 1998, 281 females and 247 males participated in this study, generating participation rates of 80.1% and 70.4%, respectively. Main Outcome Measures: Multivariate methods of data analyses were used to control for patient and treatment variables in the examination of the effect of lifestyle factors on the following clinical outcomes: 1) number of oocytes retrieved by transvaginal oocyte aspiration (oocyte production), 2) fertilisation, measured as the number of oocytes fertilised weighted by the number of oocytes inseminated, 3) B-hCG pregnancy, 16 days post-embryo transfer, and 4) &lt;12 week pregnancy loss following confirmation of B-hCG pregnancy. As a measure of ovarian reserve, serum basal FSH levels were also investigated as a dependent variable. Lifestyle factors included years of cigarette smoking (smoke years), tobacco, alcohol, caffeine and fruit and vegetable consumption, and stress from daily living and NF treatment. Results: Daily stress, tobacco consumption and smoke years were the female lifestyle factors shown to have a significant effect on NF treatment. Oocyte production decreased with increasing levels of daily stress (P=0.039). However, female patients with high daily stress levels experienced higher than average rates of fertilisation in vitro (P=0.0059) and pregnancy (P--0.0207). Smoke years had an adverse effect on ovarian reserve (P=0.035), which in turn, compromised oocyte production.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, PIVET Medical Centre, human reproduction.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation criteria for transport: an analysis of local policy implementation towards sustainable residential development</field><field name="creator">Yanuaria, Cathrina</field><field name="description">One of the most important issues influencing urban areas is that of sustainable residential development. In this regard, formulation and implementation of policies relating to transport play a major role in decreasing the amount of energy consumed and greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. This awareness of the major role of transport posed the main research question &#8220;Have transport elements in policies for residential development in Western Australia been implemented on the ground in the Perth Metropolitan Region?&#8221; Since this study focuses on and evaluates the implementation of residential planning policy on the ground at local level, it uses case study areas (Joondalup and Woodlake) deemed benchmark of sustainable development within the Perth Metropolitan Region in Western Australia. Policies for residential development and sections on transport (towards sustainable development) were collected and from this, evaluation criteria were drawn to be measured against their implementation. Then, field observation, and household questionnaire surveys were conducted to check and identify the extent of implementation. Subsequently, semi-structured interviews with policy players were undertaken to clarify findings and factors influencing (impeding or supporting) policy implementation. The findings of this research indicate that Joondalup (planned and developed more than two decades ago) was more sustainable in transport terms than Woodlake (developed nearly a decade ago) when measured against policies at the time of the planning and development phases. But when the case study areas were measured against current policy objectives and new evaluation criteria for transport towards sustainable development, Woodlake performs better.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transport objectives and policies, sustainable development and policy, evaluating transport.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of fractures on seismic waves in poroelastic formations</field><field name="creator">Brajanovski, Miroslav</field><field name="description">Naturally fractured reservoirs have attracted an increased interest of exploration and production geophysics in recent years. In many instances, natural fractures control the permeability of the reservoir, and hence the ability to find and characterize fractured areas of the reservoir represents a major challenge for seismic investigations. In fractured and porous reservoirs the fluid affects elastic anisotropy of the rock and also causes significant frequency dependent attenuation and dispersion. In this study we develop a mathematical model for seismic wave attenuation and dispersion in a porous medium in a porous medium with aligned fractured, caused by wave induced fluid flow between pores and fractures. In this work fractures in the porous rock are modelled as very thin and highly porous layers in a porous background. Dry highly porous materials have low elastic moduli; thus dry skeleton of our system contains thin and soft layers, and is described by linear slip theory. The fluid saturated rock with high-porasity layers is described by equations of poroelasticity with periodically varying coefficients. These equations are analyzed using propagator matrix approach commonly used to study effective properties of layered system. This yields a dispersion equation for a periodically layered saturated porous medium taking into account fluid communication between pore spaces of the layers. Taking in this dispersion equation a limit of small thickness for high-porosity layers gives the velocity and attenuation as a function of frequency and fracture parameters. The results of this analysis show that porous saturated rock with aligned fractures exhibits significant attenuation and velocity dispersion due to wave induced fluid flow between pores and fractures.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">attenuation and dispersion of seismic waves, permeability, rock physics, fractures in oil reservoirs, Biots slow wave, Biots theory of poroelasticity.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15309</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phytoplankton ecology in the upper Swan River estuary, Western Australia: with special reference to nitrogen uptake and microheterotroph grazing</field><field name="creator">Rosser, S.M. Jane Horner</field><field name="description">Phytoplankton succession and abundance in estuaries is known to be influenced by the relative strengths of various seasonally changing physical and chemical factors. Previous studies of Swan River Estuary phytoplankton biomass and composition have identified salinity, temperature, rainfall and nutrients as the most important controlling factors. These conclusions are generally based on analysis of data from river length transects and depth integrated day-time sampling. They describe influences ,affecting whole system phytoplankton abundance and succession. Many of the typical seasonal bloom that develop are ephemeral and only extend over relatively small areas. The focus of this study is a single site, Ron Courtney Island, considered typical of the upper estuary region. This region of the estuary was chosen as representative of the section of river most influenced by allochthonous nutrient input. It has been the region of most frequent and intense algal blooms over the past decade. The factors, physical, biological or physiological, that have the greatest influence on controlling phytoplankton biomass under various ambient conditions for this system are determined. While previous studies have recognised the importance of nitrogen to phytoplankton growth in the Swan River Estuary, they have focused on NO;, with only anecdotal reference to the importance of the alternative nitrogen source, NH4+. This is the first study to explore the influence of different nitrogen source fluxes on phytoplankton biomass in the upper Swan River Estuary. The roles of physiological adaptation to, and preferences for, 'new' (NO,), recycled (NH4+) and organic (urea) nitrogen sources in relation to ambient nutrient levels are explored.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microheterotroph grazers, Swan River, phytoplankton and algal blooms, phytoplankton growth.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the reasons for copper and gold loss in the cleaner tail, at Ok Tedi, Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Erepan, Peter</field><field name="description">Ok Tedi Mining Limited generates a copper and gold concentrate from its porphyry and skarn ore deposits located at Mt. Fublian, Western Province, PNG. The predominant porphyry ore-type is blended with high grade skarn ores to optimize copper and gold feed grades to the concentrator. Current operation (2003) is to blend 80% porphyry with 20% skarn ores, resulting in an acceptable concentrate grade and recovery. However, when the proportion of skarn ore in the plant feed exceeds 20%, low flotation recovery is often observed. Approximately 20% of the copper and 30% gold losses occur through the rougher flotation circuit. However, losses via the cleaner tailing stream are 8% and 9% for copper and gold, respectively, and augment value mineral losses to the final tailing. It may be noted that the cleaner tailing stream contains value minerals which have already been successfully floated in the rougher section of the concentrator, and are therefore recoverable. This study has the objective of determining the reasons for copper and gold loss in the cleaner tailing. The focus is therefore on the cleaner flotation bank and related streams. The project strategy commenced with characterization of the cleaner circuit performance under various operating conditions. This would provide evidence for any proposed mechanisms to explain the losses of valuable minerals to the cleaner tailing. The second part of the project strategy was to evaluate potential methods for improvement of cleaner flotation performance via laboratory flotation tests. To complete the work, plant trials of methods showing benefit in the laboratory were conducted.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cleaner performance, copper and gold loss, Ok Tedi ore deposits.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The classification and framing of the curriculum: a case of integrated studies</field><field name="creator">Chien, Robyn Kay</field><field name="description">This study focuses on curriculum integration for several reasons. Firstly, because there appeared to be no clear definition of integration nor a consensus on what constituted good integration. Secondly, there were few studies on integration and the type of learning involved. I believe that a study looking at an integrated unit in depth should help to shed light on what integration is and how it can be accommodated within the school system. Thirdly, an opportunity existed to observe such a unit within an established middle school. As integration is purported as being "the way" young adolescents should be taught, a middle school setting seemed ideal to me. I thought that this setting should be far enough removed from the content driven senior school to allow for its complete and uninhibited development, especially given the philosophy of this well developed middle school. Fourthly, I am interested in the potential of integration as a way of focusing on learning outcomes rather than curriculum inputs. My own theoretical perspective, with a heavy leaning toward constructivist ideas, caused me to lean towards qualitative rather than quantitative research methodologies and methods. I wanted to do justice to the study by clearly describing the social context of the school and the curriculum. Basil Bemstein's pedagogic code was seen as a way of providing the framework for the development of such a method of description. As this pedagogic code had seldom been used in a study such as this, a complete investigation of its descriptive and analytic power was seen as being of benefit to future curriculum research. The study involved two major tasks. The first task was to develop the framework to a point that it would provide a descriptive language for the recording and analysis of a school culture.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bernstein's framework, curriculum integration, science education.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vibration frequencies of whirling rods and rotating annuli</field><field name="creator">Shum, Wai Sun</field><field name="description">Static Whirling Rods: Past researchers suggested that &#8220;static instabilities&#8221; exist at certain rotational speeds of whirling rods. This thesis shows these instabilities are an artefact of the material constitutive laws that are being used well outside their range of applicability. An alternative approach is developed where strains due to rotation are separated from the superimposed vibration. This enables the generally predicted lowering of longitudinal natural frequencies with rotational speed shown to be simply a result of the bulk changes in the geometry of whirling rods. Steady state equations of whirling rods are formulated in Lagrangian coordinates. Due to the non-linear nature of the governing equations, an original numerical method is applied to solve the problem. Numerical results are compared with analytical results obtained from the linearized uniaxial model. There is a close agreement between these two models at low angular velocities. However, at high angular velocities, discrepancies between them arise, confirming that the nonlinear strain-displacement relationship has significant effect on the results and the inferred &#8220;static instabilities&#8221;. This approach first solves the &#8220;static&#8221; problem of the deformed geometry of a highly strained whirling rod before longitudinal natural modes are determined by classical methods. Furthermore, conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions are derived. Dynamic Rotating Annuli: In-plane modes of vibration of annular plates are investigated. Two different models of equations one from Bhuta and Jones and the other from Biezeno and Grammel that govern the rotational motions of annuli will be studied.

The sample consisted of 525 female students enrolled in 27 classes of A Process Approach to Science (SCED 401) at a large urban university in Southern California. Also comparisons were made between SCED 401 and the students' previous laboratory course with regard to the learning environment and attitudes. Perceptions of the learning environment were measured using scales from the Science Laboratory Environment Inventory (Open-Endedness and Material Environment) and the What Is Happening In this Class? (Student Cohesiveness, Instructor Support, Cooperation, Investigation). Attitudes towards science were assessed using the Enjoyment of Science Lessons scale from the Test of Science-Related Attitudes (TOSRA). Students completed the Nature of Scientific Knowledge Survey (NSKS) based on their entire science education experience-not just the one laboratory class which they had taken previously. Comparisons were then made with their understandings after having completed SCED 401. Finally, associations between the learning environment and the student outcomes of attitudes and understandings of the nature of science were explored. This study embraced the current trend in classroom learning environments research of combining quantitative and qualitative methods. Qualitative components included items from the open-ended questionnaire, Views of Nature of Science, interviews with students, and an analysis of concept maps.

These documents assisted in topic choices and assessment outcomes.Important influences transformed my planning. The first occurred in 1996 and the second in 2002. In 1996 I was involved in the production of a resource kit for teachers titled, Its Working Career and Work Education, Kindergarten to Year 8. During the compilation of this resource kit my planning incorporated the 1995, Teaching and Learning in Science Planning Guide, which resembled constructivism by building knowledge and understanding. In 2002 the curriculum in Tasmanian State Schools was transformed with the introduction of the Essential Learnings Framework 1 and 2. This curriculum innovation had implications on teachers planning methodology with a strong emphasis on collaborative planning.Studies and critiques of environmental units were undertaken in 2000, 2003 and 2004 to ascertain the effectiveness of my planning methodology. The underlying principles of constructivism provided a lens to improve perceived deficiencies in my classroom practice.

The use of gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-irMS) overcomes these problems by allowing the analysis of individual compounds containing only the most isotopically conservative aliphatic carbon-bound (C-bound) hydrogen. This project investigates the geochemical utility and reliability of compound-specific &#948;D values, with the aim to better understand and exploit this analytical capability. To demonstrate the source diagnostic potential of compound-specific &#948;D values, normal and branched alkanes extracted from series of immature bog-head coals (torbanites) were analysed. The torbanites contain immature organic matter predominantly from a single, freshwater algal source, i.e. Botryococcus braunii (B. braunii). The &#948;D values of n-alkanes reflect the climate regime at the time of deposition of the torbanites, and vary mainly in response to the &#948;D values of the source meteoric waters in their depositional environments. n-Alkanes from torbanites deposited at high latitude in a glacial climate are depleted in D by up to 70% relative to those from a torbanite deposited at low latitude under a tropical climate regime.

This study attempts to examine if this finding is also manifested in male and female teachers discourse in adult ESL classrooms in the three main aspects of classroom interaction; giving explicit instructions, asking questions and providing verbal feedback, using Sinclair &amp; Coulthards (1975) IRF framework. A sample of six teachers, three males and three females were observed through a process of non-participant observation and their lessons video-recorded in the naturalistic situation of the classroom in order to make a comparative analysis of their discourse.Teacher discourse in the three aspects of classroom interaction, namely, instructions, questioning and feedback, was examined with the purpose of exploring gender differences and similarities so that the reasons and implications for the manifestation of such similarities and differences can be further investigated. Conclusions were then made about the influence of traditional masculine and feminine speech styles on the discourse choices of the teachers.The discourse analysis found that more similarities than differences existed in the teachers classroom discourse supporting the notion that the choice of discourse features is dependent firstly on the context and secondly on the role of the interactants vis-&#224;-vis each other in the community of practice.

If pain remains untreated in critically ill young children, it can have dramatic short- and long-term consequences on their health and development. Apart from humanitarian reasons, the assessment of pain has been recognised in some parts of the world as the fifth vital sign and thus should be part of standard practice of pain management. The evaluation of pain in preverbal children is, nevertheless, challenging for health professionals, as they cannot rely on self-report when making their assessment. Observational pain instruments have been developed to facilitate this task, but none of these existing instruments are appropriate for the postoperative critically ill young child. The aim of this research was to provide a clinically valid pain instrument for health professionals to use in practice for the evaluation of the pain and the effectiveness of pain treatment in critically ill young children. This thesis presents research that was conducted in three phases to (a) describe pain, (b) develop, and (c) test the pain instrument. Conceptualisation of pain and psychometric theory informed the conceptual framework for this study. An observational design was used in Phase One of the study to define pain behaviour in critically ill infants. Correlational design was used in Phase Two and Three to determine the association between the newly developed pain scale and other pain assessment instruments. Phase One of the study was conducted in the paediatric intensive care units of two tertiary referral hospitals.

The presence of fractures in a reservoir can be useful for obtaining this information. The main objectives of this thesis are to investigate how fracturing can be detected remotely using exploration seismology. Fracturing will effect seismic data in a number of ways. Firstly, if the fractures are aligned preferentially in some direction, the medium will exhibit long wavelength anisotropy. In turn, if wave propagation is not aligned with one of the symmetry axes of the effective medium then shear wave splitting will depend upon the properties of the fracture filling fluid. Secondly, elastic waves will experience attenuation and dispersion due to scattering and wave-induced fluid flow between the fractures and matrix porosity. This occurs because the fractures are more compliant than the background medium and therefore there will be a pressure gradient formed during passage of the wave, causing fluid to flow between fractures and background. If the direction of shear-wave propagation is not perpendicular or parallel to the plane of fracturing, the wave polarized in the plane perpendicular to the fractures is a quasi-shear mode, and therefore the shear-wave splitting will be sensitive to the fluid bulk modulus.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fractures, exploration seismology, how fracturing can be detected remotely.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An approach to activity recognition using multiple sensors</field><field name="creator">Tran, Tien Dung</field><field name="description">Building smart home environments which automatically or semi-automatically assist and comfort occupants is an important topic in the pervasive computing field, especially with the coming of cheap, easy-to-install sensors. This has given rise to the indispensable need for human activity recognition from ubiquitous sensors whose purpose is to observe and understand what occupants are trying to do from sensory data. The main approach to the problem of human activity recognition is a probabilistic one so as to handle the complication of uncertainty, the overlapping of human behaviours and environmental noise. This thesis develops a probabilistic model as a framework for human activity recognition using multiple multi-modal sensors in complex pervasive environments. The probabilistic model to be developed is adapted and based on the abstract hidden Markov model (AHMM) with one layer to fuse multiple sensors. The concept of factored state representation is employed in the model to parsimoniously represent the state transitions for reducing the number of required parameters.

Despite the pervasive belief of the significance of guanxi for facilitating Chinese business transaction, few empirical efforts have been dedicated to comprehensively investigate the dynamics of guanxi in the mainland Chinese business context. Specifically, there is a dearth of empirical evidence to support the anecdotal claims that the guanxi construct and the business strategy orientations are strategically collaborated with the vertical and the horizontal guanxi network, and these operations are influenced by the attributes of organizations and individuals. Consequently, the purpose of this research was to investigate the interactions between the guanxi construct and the business strategy orientation with the vertical and the horizontal guanxi network, as well as the moderating effects that the organizational properties and individual attributes have on the posited interactions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">guanxi, China's economic transition, Chinese business</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diatoms and invertebrates as indicators of pH in wetlands of the south-west of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Erin J</field><field name="description">Increased groundwater usage, rainfall decline and activities such as mining have resulted in the acidification of certain wetlands in the south-west of Western Australia. This study investigated the influence of pH, the factor most commonly associated with acidification, on the invertebrate and diatom community structure of 20 wetlands in the south-west region of Western Australia. Few studies in Western Australia have investigated both biotic groups, particularly in relation to pH. Consequently, this study examined the comparative sensitivity of the two biotic groups to pH in order to identify the most effective biotic tool for assessing the ecological impacts of pH decrease. The wetlands included in this study displayed a wide range of pH from acidic (pH &lt; 6.5) to alkaline (pH &gt; 7.5). Other environmental parameters were also variable. Separation of the wetlands into three pH groups; Group 1 &#8211; acidic, Group 2 &#8211; circumneutral and Group 3 &#8211; alkaline, demonstrated that the acidic Group 1 wetlands generally had higher electrical conductivity than the remaining groups. This was probably due to the association of many Group 1 sites with mining and acid sulphate soils. Seasonal trends in environmental variables across the three pH groups were mostly unclear although some trends were evident within the individual pH groups. The study showed that invertebrate community structure differed in response to pH. However, the results also demonstrated that invertebrate distribution patterns were influenced by other factors.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wetlands in the south-west of Western Australia, influence of pH, acidification, invertebrate and diatom community structure of wetlands, biotic groups, acidic, circumneutral and alkaline groups</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17846</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intrastate conflicts and international humanitarian intervention: case studies in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Situmorang, Mangadar</field><field name="description">The differences in the international responses to the violent conflicts in East Timor (1998&#8211;1999), Maluku (1999&#8211;2003) and Aceh (1998&#8211;2005) are examined in this research. Given the growing acceptance of the significance of the use of military force for humanitarian purposes, the humanitarian crises in Maluku and Aceh might prima facie have justified humanitarian intervention similar to that in East Timor. By analysing the differences from the Indonesia&#8217;s domestic political point of view it is clear that the conscience-shocking situation caused by the violent conflicts was not the compelling factor for the international community to militarily intervene. The deployment of a multinational force in East Timor (INTERFET) was decided only after the UN and foreign major countries believed that such military intervention would not jeopardize the ongoing process of democratization in Indonesia. This suggested that Indonesia&#8217;s domestic circumstance was central to whether a similar measure in Maluku and Aceh would take place or not. Due to the reformasi (political reform) in Indonesia within which the independence of East Timor took place, two main changes within Indonesian politics, namely the growing sentiment of anti-international intervention and the continuing democratization process, helped to ensure that humanitarian intervention in the two other regions did not happen.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">East Timor, violent conflicts, international responses, Maluku, Aceh, military force, humanitarian crises, humanitarian intervention</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18582</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The determinants of growth in small and medium enterprises: an empirical study in the logistics industry in Hong Kong</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Raymond Wai Man</field><field name="description">Small and Medium Enterprise (SMEs) have contributed significantly to the economic growth of Hong Kong and it is worth investigating how they prosper. This study was based on an examination of a sample of SMEs in the logistics industry operating during the economic crisis in Hong Kong. The factors influencing the growth of small firms are many, complex and erratic. The primary objective of this study was to test the determinants of SME growth. The research question addressed was how and to what extent the characteristics of the owner-manger, the nature of the firm, and company strategy, together with the economic and government factors, impact upon the growth of small business. This study was conducted in 2004, based on a survey of 102 SMEs within the logistics industry in Hong Kong SAR. By studying the factors contributing to the growth of SMEs, this research investigated and analyzed the characteristics of SMEs which were at least three years old during of the period 1998 - 2003. The appropriateness and the support of the determinants that affect SME growth were empirically analysed. The research design was quantitative in nature, testing various hypotheses and theories about the associations between perceived constructs. Outcomes were then compared with factual indicator data, subjected to multiple regression analysis and co-efficiency analysis. The results of the regression analysis showed no tremendous incongruity compared to research conducted in previous studies, although there were some factors associated significantly and some factors associated positively but insignificantly with firm growth. Even though some findings appeared to be inconsistent with previous studies, the preoccupation of researchers and policy-makers worldwide with matters relating to SME growth was recognized.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">small and medium enterprise (SMEs), logistics industry, Hong Kong, economic growth</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seabed biotope characterisation based on acoustic sensing</field><field name="creator">Kloser, Rudolf J</field><field name="description">The background to this thesis is Australia&#8217;s Oceans Policy, which aims to develop an integrated and ecosystem-based approach to planning and management. An important part of this approach is the identification of natural regions in regional marine planning, for example by establishing marine protected areas for biodiversity conservation. These natural regions will need to be identified on a range of scales for different planning and management actions. The scale of the investigation reported in this thesis is applicable to spatial management at 1 km to 10 km scale and monitoring impacts at the 10s of m to 1 km biotope scale. Seabed biotopes represent a combination of seabed physical attributes and related organisms. To map seabed biotopes in deep water, remote sensing using a combination of acoustic, optical and physical sensors is investigated. The hypothesis tested in this thesis is that acoustic bathymetry and backscatter data from a Simrad EM1002 multi-beam sonar (MBS) can be used to infer (act as a surrogate of) seabed biotopes. To establish a link between the acoustic data and seabed biotopes the acoustic metrics are compared to the physical attributes of the seabed in terms of its substrate and geomorphology at the 10s m to 1 km scale using optical and physical sensors. At this scale the relationship between the dominant faunal functional groups and both the physical attributes of the seabed and the acoustic data is also tested. These tests use data collected from 14 regions and 2 biomes to the south of Australia during a voyage in 2000. Based on 62 reference sites of acoustic, video and physical samples, a significant relationship between ecological seabed terrain types and acoustic backscatter and bathymetry was observed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia's Oceans Policy, regional marine planning, biodiversity conservation, planning and management, seabed biotopes, acoustic, optical and physical sensors, acoustic data</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Indigenous history and colonial politics of Torres Strait: contesting culture and resources from 1867 to 1990</field><field name="creator">Pitt, George Henry</field><field name="description">The aim of my study is to comprehend why there is a significant gap in the economic development of Torres Strait. It questions why it is that Torres Strait Islanders as a whole remain largely economically unproductive in their present situation in contrast to the political beliefs of Islanders and their struggles for self-determination. It questions why Island leaders continue to accept policies of external control even though the guidelines for self development maintain the situation, rather than transforming it. Thus this thesis examines contemporary and traditional history of the Torres Strait in order to analyse and evaluate the development of the political structures of the Islands and how colonialism has influenced the politics of Torres Strait Islanders. I shift through the recorded layers of myths and legends for my interpretation and analyse the ethnographic accounts about Torres Strait from past archival reports, academic literature and the oral accounts from interviews. From the local media, I have examined the recent views of both the contented and discontented Islanders and other people reported in the local Torres News.

Consequences of excessive environmental heat stress range from reduction in safety due to impairment of concentration, to heat illness, which in extreme cases can be fatal. A critical factor in tolerance of workers to environmental heat stress is their level of hydration. Maximising productivity without compromising the health and safety of the work force requires quantification of the degree of stress posed by the thermal environment. For this purpose a number of heat stress indices have been developed. A recently introduced index is the Thermal Work Limit (TWL), which has been widely adopted and implemented in the underground mining industry in Australia. The field use of TWL and protocols in the mining industry with resultant reduction in heat illness and lost production is a practical endorsement of the index, and its validity under controlled conditions has been confirmed by a preliminary study. The further work needed to complete this validation forms part of this thesis. TWL was found to reliably predict the limiting workload in the controlled environment, reinforcing the validity of the algorithm and its application in the workplace. To date TWL has largely been used in the underground environment, however as the algorithm is equally applicable to the above ground environment where radiant heat forms a significant component of the thermal load, field studies were carried out at mining installations in the Pilbara region of Western Australia to evaluate this application of the index. The current industry standard index of heat stress is the Wet bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">excessive environmental heat stress, heat illness, impairment of concentration, reduction in safety, hydration level, work force health and safety, Thermal Work Limit (TWL), Australian underground mining industry</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development and Implementation of a Multimedia Program that Uses Analogies in Senior High School Chemistry to Enhance Student Learning of Chemical Equilibrium</field><field name="creator">O'Brien, Geoffrey William</field><field name="description">In this thesis, you will find a review the development process of a multimedia presentation designed to assist the teaching of chemical equilibrium using analogies.

This thesis describes a case study in the effective use of technology in the classroom based on established research in the field of analogical thinking. The work begins with a review of relevant literature from the fields of constructivism, collaborative learning and multimedia in education. The design phase of the research sought to discover if analogies for chemical equilibrium could be successfully transferred to a multimedia presentation on a computer. The subsequent testing of the software endeavoured to discover the most appropriate teaching strategies and if the use of such a program could enhance the learning process for students. The work resulted in a completed CDROM with full teaching program included which you will find attached to this thesis.

The ISLE model involves a multi-faceted design to address the three basic forms of learning: acquisition of knowledge, change in emotions or feelings, and gain in physical or motor actions or performance. A holistic approach to teaching at the university level encompassed a step-wise, cumulative strategy that reinforced all scales of the Constructivist Learning Environment Survey (Personal Relevance, Uncertainty of Science, Shared Control, Critical Voice, and Student Negotiation) and minimised the potentially detrimental effects of information overload and non-linear processing. By addressing individuals and recognising limitations, the same conceptual and logistical frameworks were applied to teachers and to students uniformly in the classroom and in the field. This key factor of the ISLE program broadened all participants&#8217; horizons and enabled them to see their role within the &#8216;big picture&#8217;. Thus, the common elements (knowledge) and basic components (understanding) in each realm became evident and the power of transfer for both content and concept was realised. A process approach to information technology provided a logical and meaningful mechanism for continuously scaling the program perspective from the classroom setting to the unique global environment of the World Wide Web. The final product of the ISLE program (virtual field trip) was constructed by linking the elements common to the supporting learning environments (university classroom, field trip, and information technology) at their basic levels: newness, massiveness, and appropriateness.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Virtual field trips, Information technology, Integrated science learning environment, ISLE.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12780</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and kinetics estimation in gibbsite precipitation from caustic aluminate solutions</field><field name="creator">Li, Tian Siong</field><field name="description">Precipitation of gibbsite from supersaturated caustic aluminate solutions has been investigated extensively due to its central role in the commercial Bayer plant, for extracting the alumina compound from bauxite. The primary focus of Bayer process simulation and optimisation is to help maximise the product recovery and the production of a product crystal size distribution (CSD) that meets the product specification and improves downstream process performance. The product CSD is essentially determined by the nucleation, growth and agglomeration kinetics, which occur simultaneously during the precipitation process. These processes are still poorly understood, owing to the high complexity of their mechanisms and of the structure of the caustic aluminate solutions. This research focuses on the modelling and kinetics estimation aspects of simulating gibbsite precipitation. Population balance theory was used to derive different laboratory gibbsite precipitator models, and the discretised population balance models of Hounslow, Ryall &amp; Marshall (1988) and Litster, Smit &amp; Hounslow (1995) were employed to solve the resulting partial integro-differential equations. Gibbsite kinetics rates were determined from literature correlation models and also estimated from the CSD data using the, so-called, differential method. Modelling of nonstationary gibbsite precipitation systems showed that error propagated with the precipitation time scale. The main contribution to the observed error was found to be from the uncertainties in the kinetic parameter estimates, which are estimated from experimental data and used in the simulation. This result showed that care is required when simulating the CSD of non-stationary precipitators over longer time scales, and methods that produce precise estimates of the kinetics rates from the experimental data need to be used.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gibbsite kinetics rates, modelling batch precipitation, Bayer precipitation.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13672</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Land use change in an area surrounding an industrial estate : a case study of Surabaya Industrial Estate Rungkut (SIER), Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Damayanti, Rully</field><field name="description">This research aimed to investigate land use change in the area surrounding the Surabaya Industrial Estate Rungkut (SIER) in Surabaya, Indonesia. It was found that the industrial location has encouraged unplanned land use occupation, particularly the growth of informal sector activities. Analysis of government action sees the existence of the informal sector as a problem due to its non-taxpayer status, its illegal occupation of land and the poor environment and image it creates for the wider city. The government&#8217;s response to such a situation is to bulldoze the activities and associated development. The land use change that has occurred in the study area identified a precinct designated for residential uses that is currently occupied by commercial activity. This research identified the networks between the formal industrial activity in the industrial estate, and this commercial activity, both formal and informal. It also assessed the impact of the surrounding residential community on land use change. The study then analysed the planning approaches adopted that attempt to segregate land use between industrial and non-industrial uses and the attempts to limit the development of an informal, unplanned, unregulated land use. The study found that the current zoning regulations adopted from developed countries face many implementation problems particularly in providing for the accommodation of a large number of rural migrants. The appropriateness of land use segregation via zoning regulations to minimize the negative impact of industrial activity and to optimise the benefit of industrial land use networks was evaluated. The study recommends the creation of a more flexible and updated planning approach to land use change in Indonesia.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Land economics,  Urban management,   Informal sector,  Surabaya, Industrial estate,   Land use.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of alternative forecasting models for natural rubber prices</field><field name="creator">Lim, Jit Yang</field><field name="description">One of the prominent features of the Natural Rubber (NR) market is its price variability, and the aim of this study is to project accurate short-term NR prices. This is accomplished by exploiting the use of forecasting techniques and information sets to seek the combination with the best forecasts, and exploring best ways of combining forecasts. We evaluate the relative performance of 19 models based upon three different forecasting techniques, and four information sets. In addition, we compare their forecasts with 13 other forecasts combined in various different ways, and taking the Naive forecast as benchmark. The generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity regression (or ARCH-type) models, though more complex, are generally better than the simpler regression models. In general, the performance of the various techniques seems to perform consistently well (or poorly) over the forecasting horizons, with alternations in performance due mainly to the type of information set used. We also adopted a simple trading rule to find out the economic values of our forecasts, and the results are most promising.

This study of Vietnam's educational structure and system is both unique and necessary. It provides detailed information and considerable analysis not previously available to readers outside Vietnam. As a historical study, it covers aspects of more than 2,000 years of the country's educational developments, from the invasion of China in 111 B.C. to the present. The study is divided into six chapters, each of which deals with a major period of time. Each chapter is self-contained. Historical background and essential materials are presented and analysed. The writing of historical events is based on chronological order. Vietnam was a country without written language before the coming of the Chinese who, in their invasion of Vietnam in 111 B.C., brought with them their civilization, culture, educational system and language. The introduction of Chinese language to Vietnam can be taken as the overture of Vietnamese education. The first two chapters provide detailed information and historical factors as to how an early educational system of Vietnam was established under the influence of China and through its impact of education on the formation of a Confucian political system and Confucian society, which continued to exist for over 2,000 years. The political decline of China in the late 19th century provided the opportunity for the French to enter Vietnam and finally replace the Chinese sovereignty over the country in 1885. The invasion and ruling of the French (1886-1954) brought forward significant changes in Vietnam politically, socially and educationally.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational system of Vietnam, education reform.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Operational and Teaching Software for a Complex Analytical Instrument Using Virtual Instrument Technology</field><field name="creator">Holmes, James R.</field><field name="description">It is not always possible to provide students and new users of complex instrumentation with sufficient hands-on use to fully develop the required knowledge of the instrument. Access may also be limited when there is a need to develop data collection and processing procedures. One solution to this problem is to develop a simulation of the instrument in readily accessible computer software. Modern computer-based technology allows traditional instrumentation to be replaced with Virtual Instruments consisting of digital control/acquisition hardware and software that graphically represents the functions of the physical instrument.In this thesis, operating and analysis software to simulate the operation of complex analytical instrumentation was successfully developed using a numerical model of the instrument. The approach will reduce the need for machine time for operator training and the development of data collection processing procedures. In particular the thesis developed software to emulate the behaviour of a VG-354 Thermal Ionisation Mass Spectrometer. Graphical programming tools were employed to create a modular set of Virtual Instruments that formed the basis of the model. The Simulated Mass Spectrometer produced results that compared well with real data obtained from the physical instrument.Virtual Instrument peak centring and measurement modules were then developed to operate the Simulated Mass Spectrometer in peak jumping mode. Uncertainties were reduced with improved analysis techniques employing polynomial least-squares fits for peak centring and single-collector isotope ratio measurements. The techniques also have the potential to accommodate hysteresis effects in the magnetic sector analyser, further reducing uncertainty.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">virtual training, simulation, instrumentation.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13792</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between non-fatal overdose of pharmaceutical medications, suicidality and depression</field><field name="creator">Buykx, Penelope</field><field name="description">This thesis examines three main themes; depression, suicidality, and non-fatal overdose involving pharmaceutical and over-the-counter (OTC) medications. At any given time depression affects approximately one in every twenty adults in Australia. People with depression are at elevated risk of attempted and completed suicide compared to those without. Medication overdose is a frequently chosen method of suicidal behaviour, and accounts for one in ten suicide deaths and close to nine out of ten non-fatal episodes of suicidal behaviour for which hospital treatment is sought. The study reported here had six primary aims; (i) to quantify medication overdose presentations over a 12-month period to the Emergency Department (ED) of a major metropolitan public hospital in Melbourne, Australia, (ii) to describe the medication overdose patient group, including comparison with two other relevant types of presentation, illicit drug overdose, and actual or potential self-harm by means other than overdose, (iii) to explore the relationship between depression, suicidal ideation and medication overdose, (iv) to identify the medications typically used in overdose and their means of acquisition, (v) to explore patient experiences of emergency care following a medication overdose, and (vi) to comment on the feasibility of introducing a brief intervention within the ED with the intention of addressing the issue of medication overdose.

Pastoral grazing of managed livestock, mainly sheep and cattle, occurs over much of this area, with an increasing proportion being allocated to the state conservation estate. Rangeland monitoring began at the local scale in the 1950s and since then has been closely tied to the needs of the pastoral industry. By 1992 a regional-scale, ground-based system was in place after two decades of trialling precursor techniques. The state-wide pastoral monitoring programme, known as the Western Australian Rangeland Monitoring System (WARMS), helps to monitor the state&#8217;s natural vegetation and soil resources. Change in soil and vegetation attributes through time, in response to climatic conditions, herbivore grazing, fire and other natural and anthropogenic drivers in the rangelands is known as change in range condition or range trend. When range condition is used in an ecological context, as it is in this research, an improving trend implies an improvement in ecological integrity or ecosystem health. In contrast, a declining trend implies a reduction in integrity, otherwise known as natural resource degradation. The principal objective of this study is to produce a regional-scale, long-term quantitative assessment of range condition change in the southern rangelands of Western Australia, using WARMS transect data. Previous analyses of the WARMS database have examined selected vegetation parameters, but this study is the first to calculate a single integrated range condition index. The assessment covers an area of approximately 760,000 km2, stretching southeast from the southern Pilbara region through the Gascoyne-Murchison and Goldfields regions to the Nullarbor region on the Great Australia Bight.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rangeland ecological health, Western Australian Rangeland Monitoring System (WARMS)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17757</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women and biographical speech: subjectivity and authority</field><field name="creator">Esten, Antonia</field><field name="description">The thesis is concerned with the construction of women's authority as it is manifested in biographical speech; that is, in written or oral narratives, or sub-narratives, about others. The emphasis is on women's biography but certain other genres (notably gossip and the biographical research interview) are also examined.The central premise is that women as patriarchal subordinates are significantly disadvantaged in the cultural processes that construct (public) authority; also, that speaking about (defining) both ourselves and others is a significant means by which we construct knowledges - an important basis for authority. Women's collusion with patriarchal structures and processes, whether this be conscious or unconscious, creates problems with the construction of their authority on numerous levels in public and private domains. Moreover, even when women intend to operate subversively from sites of resistance, and when they succeed in doing so to some extent, the workings of power through discourse often render the overall effect of subversion to be consistent with, and ultimately supportive of, dominant ideology.The thesis examines a variety of aspects of these complex dynamics as they apply to women in the context of contemporary western societies. To this end, the first and last chapters consider women's relations to formal biography with the aim of identifying their (historic) engagement with lifestorying. Two chapters discuss the psychological/ideological aspects of biographical authority with relation to western women's subjectivities. And two chapters analyse the political and ethical implications of postmodernist/postcolonial theory on women's biographical speech. The study concludes that women's authority manifested in biographical speech is undoubtedly problematic but that feminist-inspired initiates continue to be productive.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public authority, women's authority, feminist biography.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Madm, a novel adaptor protein that associates with Myeloid Leukemia Factor 1</field><field name="creator">Lim, Raelene</field><field name="description">Myeloid Leukemia Factor 1 (Mlf1) is the murine homolog of MLF1, which was identified as a fusion gene with Nucleophosmin (NPM) resulting from the (3;5)(q25.1;q34) translocation associated with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (Yoneda-Kato et al., 1996). Mlf1 was independently isolated using cDNA representational difference to identify genes up-regulated when an erythroleukemic cell line underwent a lineage switch to display a monoblastoid phenotype (Williams et al., 1999). Mlf1 has been shown to enhance myeloid differentiation and suppress erythroid differentiation; however, its mechanism of action is unknown. A yeast two hybrid screen was employed to identify Mlf1-interacting proteins. This screen isolated a number of known protein, as well as several novel molecules, that bound Mlf1. One of these was 14-3-3&#958;, a member of a family of molecules that bind phosphoserine motifs and regulate the subcellular localization of partner proteins. Mlf1 contains a classic RSXSXP sequence for 14-3-3 binding and associated with 14-3-3&#958;; via this phosphorylated motif (Lim et al., 2002). The aim of this thesis was to characterise a novel Mlf1-interacting protein that had some homology to protein kinases and was named Mlf1 Adaptor Molecule (Madm). Adaptor proteins are molecules that possess no enzymatic or transcriptional activity, but instead mediate protein-protein interactions. Madm is encoded by a gene consisting of 18 exons and promoter analysis suggested Madm expression might be widespread; indeed Northern blotting of adult tissues and in situ hybridization of embryos demonstrated ubiquitous Madm expression. Significantly, the Madm protein sequence is highly conserved across diverse species.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Madm protein sequence, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Urolithiasis: occurrence and function of intracrystalline proteins in calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals</field><field name="creator">Fleming, David Elliot</field><field name="description">The broad aim of the work presented in this thesis was to examine the relationship between the mineral and organic phases of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals, which are the principal components of human kidney stones. The results presented, clearly demonstrate the presence of some amino acids and urinary proteins in the crystals and suggest a role for intracrystalline proteins in urolithiasis. The adsorptive affinities of twenty amino acids to COM, calcium hydrogen phosphate, tricalcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite were assessed over the physiological urinary pH range (pH 5-8) in aqueous solutions. In all cases adsorption was strongest at pH 5 and decreased as the pH increased as a result of the increasing negative charge of both substrate and adsorbate. Binding was higher to COM than to the phosphate minerals, owing to differences in the surface charge or coordination-site availability. Aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu) and y- carboxyglutamic acid (Gla), which each have at least two carboxyl groups, exhibited the highest binding affinities, suggesting that binding occurs by chelation. Further, binding affinity was reasoned to result from the ability of the zwitterions of Asp, Glu and Gla to adopt favourable conformations in which two carboxyl groups, and possibly the amino group, can interact with the mineral surface without further rotation. Although free amino acids are unlikely to fulfil a prominent inhibitory role in stone pathophysiology, they could, nonetheless, fulfil an important function as terminal residues or as exposed components of calcium-binding domains of proteins involved in stone formation. The existence of intracrystalline proteins and amino acids in COM crystals was demonstrated by Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction (SXRD) analysis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urinary stone formation, kidney stone formation, urinary calcium oxalate crystals.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15693</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oceanographic processes in the Perth Canyon and their impact on productivity</field><field name="creator">Rennie, Susan Jane</field><field name="description">Submarine canyons are important to continental shelf ecosystems. They have a strong influence on shelf circulation and the distribution of biota. The Perth Canyon is a long, deep canyon on the Western Australian coastline that has attracted attention as a feeding area for pygmy blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda). Despite existing on a highly oligotrophic coast, the Perth Canyon has the ability to support sufficient krill to feed these massive mammals. The aim of this study was to examine the physical processes within the Perth Canyon, and consider how these could affect productivity. Research areas included the interaction of the Leeuwin Current and Leeuwin Undercurrent with the canyon, the circulation within the canyon, the effect of wind forcing and the occurrence of upwelling. The oceanography of the Western Australian coast including seasonal productivity changes was also examined. This study utilised numerical modelling and collection of field data to develop a thorough understanding of the Perth Canyon. The numerical model ROMS (Regional Ocean Modelling System) was used to simulate a long stretch of coastline in which the Perth Canyon was centrally located. The model forced the Leeuwin Current and Undercurrent using density gradients, and the seasonal Capes Current was then generated by applying a surface wind stress. The simulations showed that primarily the Leeuwin Undercurrent interacted with the canyon. Eddies continually formed within the canyon, which enhanced vertical transport and could contribute to entrapment of passive drifters. The addition of wind had no discernible effect on canyon circulation although vertical velocities increased everywhere and shallow upwelling occurred along the shelf. The field data comprised moored temperature loggers, field cruises, and sundry data from satellite imagery, weather stations and whale observations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oceanography, submarine canyons, Leeuwin Current.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Farm productivity and farmers' welfare in West Timor, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Benu, Fredrik Lukas</field><field name="description">This study examines agricultural productivity and farmers' welfare in West Timor, Indonesia. The driving force behind this study is to understand why the welfare of farmers has lagged behind others despite significant growth in the agricultural sector. The main research problem in this study is that while agricultural production has increased significantly in West Timor, the welfare of farmers has not increased as fast as that of non-farmers. To reduce the gap in income between farmers and nonfarmers, the growth of income of West Timor's farmers, as the indicator of their welfare, has to accelerate at least as fast as the growth of non-farmers' income. This target might be achieved if there is an appropriate policy of agricultural development implemented by the government. For this reason, evaluation of the structure of agricultural production, as well as the welfare of the farmers of West Timor, is an important issue that needs to be addressed. This study analyses the structure of agricultural production and the welfare of farmers in West Timor. An econometric method (Three Stage Least Squares) was used in modelling the agricultural system to evaluate the structure of the agricultural production as well as farmers' welfare in West Timor. A simultaneous equations model which consists of eight structural and four identity equations was constructed for the analysis of the structure, the estimation of elasticities from the regression coefficients and the subsequent policy analysis. The data used for the analysis are secondary data published by the Indonesian government.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agricultural development, government policies, agriculture.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14865</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of breastfeeding knowledge and attitudes of selected adolescent males and females from rural and metropolitan secondary schools</field><field name="creator">Juliff, Dianne Therese</field><field name="description">Research has indicated that adolescents hold both negative and positive attitudes and have common misconceptions about breastfeeding that appear to result from their limited knowledge and reduced exposure to breastfeeding. The purpose of this study was to determine the knowledge and attitudes toward breastfeeding of adolescent male and female secondary school students. The study also sought to elicit information on factors that may influence the decision regarding future infant feeding methods. Self-efficacy theory was the theoretical framework to guide the study. This quantitative descriptive study, using a cross-sectional design, involved consenting secondary school students' completing a self-report questionnaire. The study employed purposive sampling and included 1845 males and females in both year-nine and year-12 at designated metropolitan and rural secondary schools in 2001. Analyses of the data were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (version 10.7). Statistical procedures involved chi-square analysis, Student's independent t-test and univariate analysis of variance. Spearman's rank order correlation coefficient was used to describe the relationship between the secondary school student respondents' knowledge of and their attitudes toward breastfeeding. The study results indicate that overall Western Australian adolescent secondary school students have less than ideal knowledge of breastfeeding which is consistent with findings from other studies. Higher breastfeeding knowledge scores were reported in year-12 for both male and female students. For both year groups, female students had higher breastfeeding knowledge scores than male students.

Subjects were 113 people with diabetes (58 type 1, 55 type 2), 43 with and 70 without thiamin supplementation. Dietary thiamin was estimated by 24-hour recall, diabetes control by HbA1c. Age, BMI, albumin excretion, activity level and smoking status did not correlate with red cell thiamin (RCT) in either group. RCT correlated with serum thiamin (ST) (p &lt; 0.01). In those unsupplemented, adequate dietary thiamin did not ensure normal RCT, with 15.7 % of subjects below the reference range. Supplementation to intake &gt; 4 mg/d, was significantly associated with normal RCT (p = 0.028), with 97.7% of supplemented subjects having normal RCT. Supplementation was also significantly associated with elevated serum thiamin 24 hours post supplementation, contrary to other reports. HbA1c was not significantly associated with RCT. Conclusions: In diabetes, adequate dietary thiamin does not ensure normal red cell thiamin, but supplementation to &gt; 4 mg/day does, raising questions about actual thiamin requirements in diabetes and supporting evidence that thiamin deficiency in diabetes is not primarily due to dietary deficiency.

These are specifically selected for their salt and drought tolerance and also because they are representative of the surrounding natural vegetation. Where these have been sown, competition between several species has been observed. The resulting plant community structure is typically lower in species diversity than the initial seed mixture. This study aimed to determine whether competition was occurring between five of the species commonly used and some of the mechanisms that determine community structure on the rehabilitated areas of waste material. Atriplex bunburyana, Atriplex codonocarpa, Maireana brevifolia, Maireana georgei and Enchylaena tomentosa were selected for the study, which was conducted in three parts. Firstly, different plant densities and species combinations were studied in the field and in a pot trial to determine whether or not competition was occurring and to determine the resources that the plants were competing for. The results of the field trial revealed that competition was occurring, but that it formed only one component of the complex interactions between plant species, density and soil characteristics (i.e. pH and salinity). The pot trial complemented the outcome of the field trial. In addition, it showed that competition was occurring, but was even more pronounced. This was most likely due to the lack of nutrients and the limited availability of space in the pots.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">colonizer plant species, allelopathy, chenopod growth, plant density.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Residential revitalisation of inner city areas: a case study of Northbridge</field><field name="creator">Davidson, Dean A.</field><field name="description">The catalyst for this research has been the growing national interest in inner city living. Specifically this has come from local and state government, the housing and land development industry, and the general public over the last two decades. During this time there has generally been an increase in dwellings and residents within most Australian inner city areas. The last two decades has witnessed a continual barrage by public and private organisations as to the benefits of inner city living. However there has been negligible research from the inner city residents perspective. Most research to date has centered on inner city lifestyle benefits, what dwellings private developers are providing,and what local and state governments are doing to promote inner city living. This research has focused on Northbridge as a case study as an indicator of inner city Australian areas. The research identifies historical influences and changes in landuses in Northbridge since 1829 through to the 1990s with particular reference to the move from residential to commercial land uses, and the resurgence in residential land uses. This has included an analysis of the role and impact of local and state government, and commercial forces. A synoptic view reveals that landuse changes have been driven by the needs of commercial forces, with local and state government serving commercial before resident needs. A demographic profile of who the inner city residents are has been established. It has been revealed that the diversity of the inner areas is reflected in the demographics of the people that live there.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">inner city trends, inner city dwellings, residential and commercial land use.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15080</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing completion criteria for rehabilitation areas on arid and semi-arid mine sites in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Brearley, Darren</field><field name="description">Continued expansion of the gold and nickel mining industry in Western Australia during recent years has led to disturbance of larger areas and the generation of increasing volumes of waste rock. Mine operators are obligated to rehabilitate all disturbed surfaces and reconstructed landforms, and considerable effort and expense is now applied to the achievement of this objective. Associated with increasing rehabilitation effort is the requirement to accurately judge rehabilitation success through the development of completion criteria. Completion criteria are rehabilitation performance objectives set as conditions of approval for each stage of rehabilitation and for the project as a whole. They provide standards against which the success of rehabilitation can be measured, or more broadly the point at which responsibility for rehabilitation is complete. The current research project tackles the development of completion criteria by investigating ecosystem function within a variety of rehabilitation trials at four mine sites located in arid and semi-arid Western Australia, and also within surrounding 'natural' vegetation complexes undisturbed by mining, termed analogue sites. Six specific objectives were identified as part of the study: 1. To establish an appropriate end point land use for each mine site where field trials were established; 2. To examine long-term ecosystem development through the assessment of revegetation at a variety of rehabilitation sites; 3. To examine functional components within analogue communities and make appropriate comparisons with rehabilitation trials; 4.

The sample consisted of 927 Grade 8 and 10 science students from 12 secondary schools. Altogether, 443 students in 21 classes comprised the NBC teacher group and 484 students in 17 classes comprised the non-NBC teacher group.

From this basis, the Callovian to base Cretaceous sediments may be subdivided into five depositional sequences. The development of the sequence boundaries, in most part, is closely related to periods of major changes in basin configuration associated with the sequential breakup of eastern Gondwanaland. Initiation of the Upper Jurassic rift complex occurred during late Callovian early Oxfordian associated with the development of a northeast-southwest trending spreading centre on the Argo Abyssal Plain. The spreading centre propagated southwards during the Late Jurassic. This resulted in active rifting in the Barrow Sub-basin and ultimately led to the separation of the Indian and Australian plates during Valanginian time.Upper Jurassic synrift sediments in the eastern Barrow Sub-basin consist of detached basin floor fan complexes, channelised and canyon fed fan systems, slump deposits, prograding outer shelfal to slope deposits and deep marine claystones. Post-depositional uplift of the eastern shelfal areas during the Late Jurassic resulted in erosion of the transgressive and highstand fluvial-deltaic to shelfal deposits. These periods of uplift and erosion provided much of the sediment redeposited in the basinal areas during the lowstand periods.

The notion that there is a dearth of understanding by health care professionals when caring for persons with hearing loss has been acknowledged.

The process of inquiry was guided by Parses human becoming theory for nursing (1981, 1987, 1992, 1998). The Giorgi (1970, 1971, 1975, 1985, 1989, 1992) modification of the phenomenological method was used for analysis-synthesis. Five women and two men employed and ranging between 25 and 70 years shared their lived experiences with the researcher via email correspondence. Confidentiality and anonymity were assured. Participants were asked to write about what it is like for them to live with a different sense of hearing. The central finding of this study was: Living with a different sense of hearing is experiencing the joy-sorrow of hearing-not hearing unfolding through discovering gained-lost communication surfacing all-at-once with diminished-enhanced feelings of self while choosing the rhythm of revealing-concealing amid potential regard-disregard of others. The findings of this research build on Parses (1981, 1998) theory of human becoming and may enhance nurses understanding of what it is like to live with hearing loss, which may in turn alter the way nurses structure practice with persons who live with a different sense of hearing, making a difference in their quality of life.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phenomenology, Parse's human becoming theory, Giorgi's modification, qualitative research, hearing loss, lived experience.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancement of student learning and attitude towards mathematics through authentic learning experiences</field><field name="creator">Blum, Kathleen Mary</field><field name="description">Research suggests that many high school students are not learning mathematics of value from a personal or an employment perspective. School mathematics often consists of applying memorised algorithms to exercises that do not meaningfully connect with the student's experience, and hence do not lead to the construction of meaningful mathematics concepts by the student. Moreover, most high school mathematics curricula give students a false idea of the essence of mathematics: Instead of understanding mathematics as another powerful lens through which to view the world, and a creative, enjoyable endeavour, it is seen as mere calculation or esoteric gobbledegook. Authentic learning experiences involve a different perspective on both what passes as mathematics and how students learn to mathematise. The study examined high school mathematics knowledge from several perspectives, and sought, through an empirical study, to enhance student learning and attitude towards mathematics through authentic learning. A class of Year 8 students learnt several units of mathematics primarily by authentic methods, using problems or interesting phenomena in the students' own experience, or otherwise meaningful to the student. Qualitative data was collected by multiple methods, including video recordings. Surveys were administered to five classes of Year 8 students and their parents at the beginning and at the end of the semester in which most of the empirical research took place. This allowed a comparison of attitudes towards mathematics between the experimental class and the other classes.

In this thesis, I challenge this view on the basis that science teachers in particular are in a unique position to raise students' awareness of problematic issues in relation to the world around them by providing students with necessary knowledge. However, sound knowledge does not equate with a positive attitude, this is why I contend that providing students with factual knowledge might not be enough to enable them to participate in the public discourse on making the world a 'better place' in which to live. Given the pervading influence of science on our daily lives, this discourse necessarily includes a focus on science, scientific research and its uses. However, many science educators traditionally have taught science without addressing ethical questions. I argue that the inclusion of a discourse on ethical science-related issues into science teaching might open an avenue for science educators to offer students opportunity for practising their future engagement in the public discourse about science by learning to reflect critically and collaboratively on their attitudes, beliefs and values. This thesis presents an interpretive case study, situated in the 7th Moment of Qualitative Research, which investigated the planning and implementation of a specially designed 'Ethics in Science' curriculum, in the context of national curriculum reform in Austria.

The lack of favourable upwelling conditions results in the majority of the southeastern Indian Ocean surface waters being nutrient poor. Which is reflected in their low productivity. Several areas either on or in close proximity to the coastline are notably more productive. The associated forcing terms generating phytoplankton favourable conditions differ between areas. as do the seasons in which they occur. Measurements of chlorophyll a concentration. the major photosynthetic pigment contained in phytoplankton, may be directly related to oceanic bioproductivity. Using data collected by the Coastal Zone Color Seamier between 1979-86, this work aims to improve the understanding of the spatial and temporal changes that occurred in chlorophyll a abundance in the southeastern Indian Ocean. The highest seasonal mean concentrations occur in Summer (January-March) and Autumn (April-June); the former occurring in waters of the North West Shelf and the latter in close coastal areas of Western Australia south of North West.

Exceptions to this occur in proximity to the adjacent Indonesian islands and directly south of Albany (possibly due to northwards flow of subantarctic nutrient-rich waters). A considerable interannual variation was also noted, with the highest mean chlorophyll concentrations occurring in 1981. 1982 and 1983.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Western Australia, remote sensing, Phytoplankton.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14199</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To inform and engage: museum websites and dynamic delivery of information</field><field name="creator">Zeljkovic, Nada</field><field name="description">The World Wide Web has emerged as a powerful communications medium. With the development of new technologies, organizational websites are getting bigger and more complex, using design elements such as sound and motion to engage users' attention. This project will look at how users respond to the ways designers and developers present information on the web in a dynamic form which incorporates sound and motion. The research will focus on evaluating the communicative effectiveness of websites (particularly websites with different degrees of dynamic content in them), and will see if certain ways of presenting dynamic content are more effective than others. The method used will consist of observing users while they try to accomplish specific tasks on selected websites, through interviews, questionnaires and through verbal protocol ('think aloud') analysis. Effectiveness will be measured by such things as how long it takes them to complete each task, how successful they were in finding the necessary information, and the ease of use. Other factors which provide possible explanations for differences in effectiveness will also be measured; these will be drawn from two theoretical bases: communication theory (Fiske, 1982) and social psychology (Ajzen, 1991; Klobas &amp; Morrison, 1999). The outcome of the research will be identification of problem areas associated with the effectiveness of information delivery by dynamic sites. Guidelines for communication designers, information architects and developers of websites, as they evaluate the success of dynamic sites, will be an appendix to the research.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">website effectiveness, dynamic and static websites, website development, dynamicness, dynamic elements.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A search for biologically active compounds in Acacia (Mimosaceae) species</field><field name="creator">Wickens, Kristen M.</field><field name="description">Indigenous Australians were also known to use plants for medicinal purposes. For thousands of years, Indigenous Australians have used native plants as a source of medicinal agents. Some tribes living in Central Australia still, to this day, prefer to use traditional medicines in favour of the more common and readily available western medicines. A number of plant species endemic to Australia are listed in various Aboriginal pharmacopoeias, with approximately one-third of those species belonging to two genera, Acacia and Eremophila. Of the 1100 recognised species of Acacia, approximately 900 occur in Australia. At least thirty of these species were utilised by the Indigenous Australians as a source of medicine. Extracts of 8 Acacia species were screened using four frontline bioassays. These were the brine shrimp lethality test, the crown gall tumour assays, the disc diffusion antibiotic assay and the seed germination test to determine if any of the species were biologically active. Of all the species screened, Acacia pruinocarpa showed the most promise. The species demonstrated significant activity at concentrations at low as 3.7ppm, which is well below the standard 400ppm exhibited by potassium dichromate (Sam, 1993). Acacia adsurgens and A. dictophleba were the next two promising species exhibiting activity at concentrations of 16.12ppm and 37ppm respectively. This was a trend that was also observed in the Lettuce seed germination test for allelopathy with these three species showing the most promise. Interestingly the potency of A. pruinocarpa extract decreased significantly when it was re- screened after being put through a polyamide column. It can therefore be suggested that as tannins are removed by the polyamide column, the biological activity exhibited by A. pruinocarpa is a result of the tannin content in the species (2%), although more testing is required.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous Australians and native plants, traditional medicine.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact and influence of change on a residential aged care community: an action research study</field><field name="creator">Horner, Barbara Joan</field><field name="description">This study was an investigation of the complexities and challenges of change in a community-based aged care facility in Western Australia, to reveal the impact and influence of change on the community. It explored the impact of change on both the residents and the senior management team, as leaders of the organisation, and explored how change influenced the redevelopment process and future of the organisation. There is considerable literature on organisational change including the impact of change on the structure, function, process, workforce and leaders of the organisation. There is, however, little literature on organisational change within aged care communities, particularly with an emphasis on the complexities and challenges associated with change within an organisation that is both a business and a home for its residents. The study took the form of a participative action research study, occurring predominantly over two years (2002-2003) with some continuation into a third year (2004). The study had three phases and included two action research cycles and a critical reference group (CRG), comprising the senior management team (SMT) and researcher. It adopted a broadly qualitative methodology, using data from participatory observation and semi-structured interview; however, it did include quantitative and qualitative data from two 'quality of service' surveys for independent living residents and a staff satisfaction survey. The finding of this study are presented as a narrative account of the experiences of the participants.

An integral part of this exploration was the identification of particular aspects of lecturers' practice that had a significant impact in enhancing the adoption of constructivist ideas on learning and constructivist-aligned teaching practices by student teachers. This goal had a practical focus on more effective course teaching within the chosen philosophical framework of constructivism. At a more theoretical level, there was a focus on the development of a constructivist approach to teacher education for teacher educators through the medium of mathematics education. A potential outcome of the development and widespread adoption of such a constructivist-aligned pedagogy within teacher education could be the significant furthering of a "reform" (or transformative) agenda in school education with its potential for enhanced learning by children. The methodology comprised both quantitative (survey) and qualitative (interview) techniques to collect information which allowed the capture of different but complementary data, so building a "rich" data set. The surveys were conducted using two leaming environment instruments underpinned by particular constructivist perspectives: one focusing on the overall nature of the learning environment at an individual level from a critical constructivist perspective, and the other focusing on the nature of interactions between teacher and student teachers at a classroom level from a socio-cultural constructivist perspective.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Constructivist Learning Environment Survey (CLES), Questionnaire on Teacher Interactions (QTI), mathematics education, teacher education.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the perception of the impact of modeling on the development of commitment to action in Decision Conferencing.</field><field name="creator">Wood, Margaret Ann</field><field name="description">Managers are increasingly faced with making complex decisions in turbulent organisational environments. This has led to greater information processing demands. Increasingly organisations try to deal with this in such a way that many of these decisions are now made in a group environment. The increase in group decision making has generated a corresponding intensification in the interest in options available to support such decision making. One such approach is a Group Decision Support System (GDSS) referred to as Decision Conferencing. However, Decision Conferencing rests on the unsupported key premise that the computer modeling, which forms an intrinsic part of the process, leads to shared understanding and commitment - the stated goals of the process. The application of Decision Conferencing to important organizational issues continues, yet prior to this study its fundamental premise was both empirically unsupported and potentially under-theorised. This theory-building research demonstrates that the interface between these concepts is more complex than the literature suggests and that the concepts themselves are problematic. Shared understanding is essentially a dependent variable, with factors such as comprehension of the modeling process impacting on the degree to which this is developed. In addition, many aspects of commitment fall outside of the domain of the Decision Conference workshop e.g. the individual&#8217;s sense of responsibility and degree of commitment to their profession. The idea of commitment appears to fall more into the arena of managerial responsibility and change management and it is partly how the outcomes are managed after the Decision Conference which will be crucial to their implementation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">decision making, modeling, decision conferencing.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the impact of an e-classroom environment on the social, cognitive and affective elements of student work practices</field><field name="creator">Falloon, Garry Wayne</field><field name="description">This thesis documents the findings of an intrinsic case study examining the impacts of a digital or e-classroom environment on the social, affective, and cognitive development of a group of 33 year 5 and 6 students, in an urban primary school in Northland, New Zealand.It examines the manner in which the e-classroom concept was developed and implemented, the rationale behind its development, and the role of key players in this process. It further examines the impact of this environment on student work processes and practices, and identifies the unique blend of teacher philosophy, curriculum design and organisation, and computer application that comprised the learning environment for these students.Results of this study indicate particular issues associated with the successful operation of this e-classroom. These issues relate to such aspects as difficulties in managing and monitoring student progress when engaged in the multiplicity of learning tasks enabled by such an environment, the importance of student group composition and selection, the limitations of computers in supporting important knowledge development, and the manner in which students interact with and manipulate the features of software.The thesis concludes by presenting an analysis of the impact that these, and other vital areas of student engagement with computers, have on the effectiveness of utilising technological resources in this manner. It presents a series of recommendations for changes to improve the effectiveness of the learning environment in this e-classroom, and identifies a series of considerations for other schools considering undertaking similar initiatives.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learning with Information and Communications Techn, computers and classroom environments, e-classrooms.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Common property rights and indigenous fishing practices in the inland openwater fisheries of Bangladesh: the case of the Koibortta fishing community of Kishoregonj</field><field name="creator">Rashid, Saifur</field><field name="description">Bangladesh contains one of the richest and largest inland fisheries in South Asia and the third highest inland capture fisheries in the world and has a long history, which continues to the present, of conflict and cooperation between fishers and other diverse fishing interests over access to a range of fishing environments managed under a variety of leasing and tenurial arrangements. Several fishing communities are of ancient origin and over a long period of time have developed and adapted their indigenous fishing knowledge, including technologies, fishing practices and knowledge of diverse fishing environments to manage fisheries in a variety of environmental and ecological conditions. This thesis provides a detailed ethnographic account of one such community, the Koibortta fishers of Krishnapur village in the northeast flood plain region of Bangladesh, focusing on their management practices and indigenous fishing knowledge in selected inland common property fisheries. It examines, using documentary and oral historical sources, the ways in which they have adapted aspects of their indigenous fishing knowledge to changing economic and environmental circumstances over the past 50 years. It also examines, using case studies of three water bodies, how they were able to gain short-term and insecure access to selected water bodies, partly by drawing on traditional social networks at village and multivillage levels to mobilise fishers in negotiations with leaseholders.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">inland fisheries, common property rights, indigenous fishing practices, fishing communities, Bangladesh.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The primary carer's experience of caring for a person with a mental disorder in the Western Australian community: a grounded theory study</field><field name="creator">Wynaden, Dianne Gaye</field><field name="description">One in five Australians has a mental disorder and it is estimated that one in four families have a member who has a mental disorder. Since the 1960s there has been an 80 percent decrease in Australian institution-based mental health care. The majority of people who have a mental disorder are now treated in their local community and many of them live with their families. The change in the delivery of mental health care has seen the family emerge as one of the most important supports to their ill family member. While the changes in the delivery of mental health care have been based on human rights concerns, changes in mental health legislature, and economic factors, the multi-dimensional experience of being a primary carer of a person with a mental disorder remains relatively unexplored. The need for empirical evidence on the primary carer's experience is noted in both the scientific literature and from carers themselves and the principal aim of conducting this research was to address the identified need. This qualitative study, using grounded theory methodology, presents the findings of interviews with 27 primary carers and memos documented throughout the study. In addition, existing literature of relevance to the findings of this study is presented. A substantive theory of seeking balance to overcome being consumed is presented in this thesis. Using the grounded theory method the constant comparative analysis of data revealed that the basic social psychological problem shared by all participants was the experience of "being consumed". The problem of being consumed consisted of two stages: "disruption of established lifestyle" and a "sustained threat to self-equilibrium". Six conditions were identified as influencing participants' experience of being consumed.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">basic social psychological problems, Australian mental health care system, mental disorders.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A change management perspective of the adoption and implementation of an across the curriculum literacy innovation</field><field name="creator">Havel, Peter Donald</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a longitudinal case study conducted in a secondary high school in the North West of Western Australia that was implementing an across the curriculum literacy strategy called Effective Reading in the Content Areas (ERICA). The study was conducted from an educational change management perspective where the adoption and implementation of ERICA was viewed against an educational change management framework. The impact of the adoption and implementation of ERICA on the teaching staff and student writing competence was investigated. The study has demonstrated that an educational change management framework is a useful tool for making the decision to adopt an innovation and for guiding the subsequent implementation. In addition, the study has highlighted the need to plan appropriately using tried and effective planning cycles and to recognize that the outcomes of any implementation of an innovation are unpredictable because of the complex interaction of change principles. Furthermore, the study has highlighted the complexity of the task of trying to improve student writing competence. Much effort was expended with little resultant improvement in student writing competence. This outcome can be rationalized, but considerable change is required in the way in which a traditional school operates before significant improvements in student writing competence will be seen.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">literacy, educational change, Effective Reading in the Content Areas (ERICA).</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Boundaries for use in wheat variety classification use in Australia</field><field name="creator">Williams, Richard Malcolm</field><field name="description">Suppliers of wheat must ensure that their products have the required quality profile demanded by customers and consistently deliver that quality in order to be competitive. Australia&#8217;s wheat industry is highly exposed to such competitive threats because it relies heavily on exports. An integral component in maintaining Australia&#8217;s competitiveness has been its classification system. The first step involves the complex process of determining a genotypic quality profile of each variety &#8211; a variety classification. At harvest, subsequent steps are the use of a statutory declaration and testing of physical quality traits. Together these steps determine how deliveries of wheat are segregated. A single variety can have different classifications across the 7 classification regions of Australia.

Within this ideological framework, the archetypal male citizen - indeed, the &#8216;ideal&#8217; male citizen - over the post-World War Two decades came to be represented by the &#8216;salaryman&#8217; (sarariirnan, in Japanese). The term referred to permanent, predominantly white-collar, male private-sector employees, who were seen as being the foot-soldiers, the kigy&#244; senshi (&#8216;corporate warriors&#8217;) of Japan&#8217;s high-speed economic growth over the 1960s, 1970s. and even into the 1980s. Even after the slowing down of economic growth from the 1990s. the salaryman, and all that the discourse of masculinity built up around him represented, has continued to exert a powerful presence on the social landscape. This is despite the fact that, even at the high-point of economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s, only a minority of men would have fallen within the strictest definitional parameters of the term. However, it was the discourse associated with the salaryman - one infused with the gender ideology of the male breadwinner - that was far more extensive in its reach. In this respect the form of masculinity associated with the salaryman may be regarded as what R.W.

The use of computer vision and video analysis range from industrial inspection to surveillance. Object detection and segmentation are the first and fundamental task in the analysis of dynamic scenes. Traditionally, this detection and segmentation are typically done through temporal differencing or statistical modelling methods. One of the most widely used background modeling and segmentation algorithms is the Mixture of Gaussians method developed by Stauffer and Grimson (1999). During the past decade many such algorithms have been developed ranging from parametric to non-parametric algorithms. Many of them utilise pixel intensities to model the background, but some use texture properties such as Local Binary Patterns. These algorithms function quite well under normal environmental conditions and each has its own set of advantages and short comings. However, there are two drawbacks in common. The first is that of the stationary object problem; when moving objects become stationary, they get merged into the background. The second problem is that of light changes; when rapid illumination changes occur in the environment, these background modelling algorithms produce large areas of false positives.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">monitoring systems, computer vision, video analysis, object detection and segmentation.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17557</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher interpersonal behaviour: Its influence on student motivation, self-efficacy and attitude towards science</field><field name="creator">Reid, Catherine</field><field name="description">The effect that teacher interpersonal behaviour has on motivating students to want tolearn and on nurturing student self-efficacy in the science classroom cannot beunderestimated.

This has led to users being frustrated and lacking loyalty to the website. There is great potential for combining aspects of methodologies from different disciplines; however, these need to be integrated in a coherent way. To address these problems, a new integrated methodology was developed in this research. The new methodology was created from basic concepts derived from: lifecycle models; Information Systems development methodologies; methodologies with explicit human factors aspects; websites methodologies; marketing methodologies; and additional techniques such as task analysis and detailed website design and implementation. After studying the lifecycle model, the researcher identified four key principles, which were the foundation of the research: user participation; iteration; usability and &#8220;real interaction&#8221;. The way in which these four principles were incorporated in each methodology was evaluated in order to choose the strongest stages to utilize in the new combined methodology.

Studying species distributions can provide better frameworks for conservation of these ecologically important patches of floral and faunal diversity. The island of Sri Lanka is a well known harbour of unique and highly threatened biodiversity. Tropical lowland forest is remnant in the south-west of the island now mainly existing in small patches. While most are small disturbed fragments, Sinharaja Forest Reserve represents one of the largest remaining patches of this important ecosystem. As a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a Man and Biosphere Reserve, it has a dual role as a conservation area and a historically important resource forest. While the distribution of vegetation diversity has been well documented, analyses of invertebrate species distributions are lacking. This thesis investigated a key arthropod group, ground dwelling ants, in relation to environmental gradients within the forest. Cumulative results demonstrate the high diversity of the forest patch. In an area representing less than half the reserve, over 173 ground dwelling ant species were found in distinct assemblages throughout the forest. Since the forest is located upon a series of parallel ridges, ant species distribution was first analysed in terms of this small elevation change.

R.</field><field name="description">Haemostasis is a complex physiological process involving cellular and plasma protein components that interact to keep the blood fluid under normal conditions and prevent blood loss after vessel injury by promoting clot formation. Primary haemostasis encompasses the activation and aggregation of platelets and is supported by secondary haemostasis, in which the coagulation factors of the plasma interact in a complex series of reactions. Secondary haemostasis is initiated by the exposure of tissue factor (TF) to the blood after vessel injury. TF forms a complex with activated factor VII (FVIIa), which in turn activates factor X (FXa) and ultimately results in fibrin formation. The TF-FVIIa complex and FXa are tightly regulated by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), a trivalent Kunitz-type protease inhibitor. The endothelium, consisting of endothelial cells (ECs), constitutes the inner lining of all blood vessels. As such, it is in constant contact with the blood and plays a major role in haemostasis by synthesising and storing both pro- and anti- coagulant substances, including TF and TFPI. Release of TFPI from ECs is increased after exposure to both unfractionated and low molecular weight heparins, though the mechanisms are not clearly defined. TFPI circulates in plasma, predominantly bound to lipoproteins, though the effect of the three major lipoproteins [low density (LDL), very low density (VLDL) and high density (HDL)] on the release of TFPI from ECs is not well established. Furthermore, previous studies have not systematically investigated the effect of these lipoproteins on both TF and TFPI. The initial aim of this project was to establish assays for the measurement of TF activity and TFPI antigen to supplement the TFPI activity assay that is well established in our laboratory.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">haemostasis, cellular and plasma protein components, blood fluid, vessel injury, clot formation, platelets, coagulation factors, tissue factor, fibrin information</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian twin and molecular genetic study on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and its co-morbidity with reading disability</field><field name="creator">Sheikhi, Abdullah</field><field name="description">Aim: This study aims to investigate the genetic components of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Reading Disability (RD), and their comorbidity. Methods: Three approaches were applied to data from 2610 Australian twin families. This data was obtained by parental completion of the &#8216;Twin and Sibling Questionnaire'. 1) Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was applied to generate genetically independent classes that defined ADHD subtypes and RD based on related cluster symptoms. 2) Genetic modelling was used to study the particular genetic and environmental effects of each ADHD subtype and of RD, and to examine whether children identified with comorbid ADHD-RD are a genetically distinct group from those who have only ADHD without RD. 3) A family-based genetic association, including haplotype block analysis, was applied to compare the efficacy of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria and LCA in the genotyping analysis, to test the genetic overlap of ADHD candidate genes on RD phenotypes.and vice versa, and to detect some of the risk alleles of ADHD alone, RD alone, and comorbid ADHD-RD. This analysis was performed on a data set that included 190 individuals from the original sample; it tested twenty-one Single Nucleotide Polyrnorphisms (SNPs) from five ADHD candidate genes (DRD4, DATI, SNAP25, COMT, and HTR1B), and four RD candidate genes (MRS2L, KIAA0319, TTRAP, and THEM2) from the 6p22.2 region.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Reading Disability (RD), comorbidity, Australian twin families, genetic modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bioassay assessment of mine pit lake water for aquaculture and biodiversity conservation</field><field name="creator">Neil, Luke L</field><field name="description">For decades, researchers have been working to better understand the effects of acid and metal toxicity to aquatic organisms and to develop ways to effectively mitigate these detrimental effects. Acid mine drainage (AMD) causes environmental pollution that affects many countries having historic or current mining industries. Both surface and underground mining have the potential to create AMD and therefore adversely affect the local and adjacent environments. Through malignant mining and farming practices, damming rivers and the changing climate, surface freshwater resources are rapidly being reduced in Australia. Mine pit lakes offer a large freshwater resource that if managed correctly may sustain significant environmental, social and economic benefits from selected end uses for the future. However, assessment of mine pit lakes needs to be achieved to validate end use options. The Collie Basin located in the southwest of Western Australia is a coal mining area with many abandoned open cast mines (OCM). Some of these OCM have filled with water forming mine pit lakes that are affected by AMD. The result is large freshwater bodies with moderate to high concentrations of metals and a low pH. High concentration of metals combined with low pH is of environmental concern to both the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem. Nevertheless, remediation techniques for AMD are available and applicable to these acidic lakes. However, the lakes in the Collie Basin are low in sulphatic compounds, therefore, restricting the use of the most common remediation treatment of bioremediation with sulphate reducing bacteria. Three remediation treatments were assessed for there efficacy in toxicity amelioration to three mine pit lakes. The treatments assessed were Limestone addition, phosphorus addition and a Rapid Catalytic Oxidation (RCO) treatment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acid and metal toxicity, aquatic organisms, acid mine drainage (AMD), environmental pollution</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17934</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reverse osmosis desalination in a mini renewable energy power supply system</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Yu</field><field name="description">The design, construction and testing of a reverse-osmosis (PV-RO) desalination system for fresh water shortage area is presented.

Based on this, an objective of creating a small-scale reverse osmosis desalination system was set out. Initially, the background information is presented. This includes the natural resources crisis and main desalination technologies and the viability of the integration with renewable energy source. A reverse osmosis (RO) desalination system was assembled and set up at the Curtin University of Technology, Perth, Western Australia Supervisor Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system was built using a Human Machine Interface software and a programmable logic controller (PLC).

While consumers&#8217; reluctance to purchase foreign products from countries that they have animosity towards is clearly evident in the current literature, little is known about consumers&#8217; attitudes towards hybrid products. As such, the study introduces this new construct (i.e. willingness to buy hybrid products) to the animosity model to determine if animositic consumers would be more receptive or willing to accept hybrid products where the animositic tendencies towards foreign countries in question can be negated by the products&#8217; domestic affiliations. To conduct this investigation, the study is undertaken in China where the Chinese consumers&#8217; animosity towards the Japanese was examined. The data with a usable sample size of 435 were collected in the Chinese city of Nanjing. The findings of the study revealed that the high level of animosity present against the Japanese resulted in the Chinese consumers&#8217; unwillingness to buy Japanese products. More importantly, results showed that the Chinese consumers are not any more receptive to hybrid products as such domestic affiliations have not diluted the animosity. Consistent with the literature, the study has also validated that consumer animosity to be a higher-order construct indicated by war and economic animosity. Under the conditions of extreme animosity, consumer ethnocentrism does not take a significant role in influencing other constructs in the animosity model.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">effects of animosity on consumers' willingness to buy hybrid products, foreign products, Chinese consumers, Japanese products</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17878</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping the semantic landscape of film: computational extraction of indices through film grammar</field><field name="creator">Adams, Brett</field><field name="description">This thesis presents work aimed at exploiting the grammar of film for the purpose of automated film understanding, and addresses the semantic gap that exists between the simplicity of features that can be currently computed in automated content indexing systems and the richness of semantics in user queries posed for media search and retrieval. The problem is set within the broader context of the need for enabling technologies for multimedia content management, and arises in response to the growing presence of multimedia data made possible by advances in storage, processing, and transmission technologies. The first demonstration of this philosophy uses the attributes of motion and shot length to define and compute a novel measure of film tempo. Tempo flow plots are defined and derived for a number of full length movies, and edge analysis is performed leading to the extraction of dramatic story sections and events signaled by their unique tempo. In addition to the development of this computable tempo measure, a study is conducted as to the usefulness of biasing it toward either of its constituents, namely motion or shot length. Thirdly, a refinement is made to the shot length normalizing mechanism, driven by the peculiar characteristics of shot length distribution exhibited by movies. The next aspect of film examined is film rhythm. In the rhythm model presented, motion behaviour is classified as being either nonexistent, fluid or staccato for a given shot. Shot neighbourhoods in movies are then grouped by proportional makeup of these motion behavioural classes to yield seven high-level rhythmic arrangements that prove adept at indicating likely scene content (e.g., dialogue or chase sequence). The second part of the investigation presents a novel computational model to detect editing patterns as either metric, accelerated, decelerated, or free.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">semantic gap indexing, automatic film interrogation, film grammar.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complex Adaptive Systems and Conversation Analysis: A New Perspective for Consumer Behaviour Research?</field><field name="creator">Whiteley, Jervis</field><field name="description">The research question for this study is &#8220;Can concepts from complex adaptive systems and conversation analysis be used to research consumer behaviour?" This is, primarily, a theoretical question. After a wide-ranging literature search no scholarly publications linking the qualitative aspects of complex adaptive systems theory to marketing or consumer research were located. In addition, there appear to be few papers on consumer research which use conversation analysis. A theory for the research methodology was developed. It was argued that the production of a research theory and methodology to test the relevance and appropriateness of two very different theories - complex adaptive systems and conversation analysis was the major undertaking of this thesis. The problem of combining an essentially scientific perspective (complex adaptive systems) with an essentially qualitative one (ethnomethodology and conversation analysis) was resolved as part of the research process. A bridging theory was developed through the common ground offered by the sociology of scientific knowledge on the one hand and social-constructionist theory on the other. This methodology was successful in supporting the choice of conversation analysis as the data-collection method and provided the rationale for observing five characteristics of a complex adaptive system. The methodology was tested empirically and, in keeping with exploratory work, iteratively. It is not intended that this type of research will have predictive value. The complex adaptive system studied was consumers in a small group. There were two research locations with six data-collection sessions in each. The first location collected data from organisational groups. The second collected data from groups of consumers convened in a meeting room.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">conversation analysis, consumer research, consumer behaviour, conservation analysis, complex adaptive systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12936</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cross-national study of classroom environment and attitudes among junior secondary science students in Australia and in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Adolphe, Francois</field><field name="description">One purpose of the present study was to validate a modified version of the What is Happening In This Class?

However, since the onset of the explosive growth in demand for wireless communications during the 1990's, researchers are giving increasing attention to the use of AAS technology to overcome practical challenges in providing the service. The main benefit of the technology lies in its ability to exploit the spatial domain, on top of the temporal and frequency domains, to improve on transceiver performance. This thesis presents a unified study on two classes of preprocessing techniques for uniform circular arrays (UCA's). UCA's are of interest because of their natural ability to provide a full azimuth (i.e. 360') coverage found in typical scenarios for sensor array applications, such as radar, sonar and wireless communications. The two classes of preprocessing techniques studied are the Davies transformation and the interpolated array transformations. These techniques yield a mathematically more convenient form - the Vandermonde form - for the array steering vector via a linear transformation. The Vandermonde form is useful for different applications such as direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and optimum or minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming in correlated signal environment and beampattem synthesis. A novel interpolated array transformation is proposed to overcome limitations in the existing interpolated array transformations. A disadvantage of the two classes of preprocessing techniques for UCA's with omnidirectional elements is the lack of robustness in the transformed array steering vector to array imperfections under certain conditions. In order to mitigate the robustness problem, optimisation problems are formulated to modify the transformation matrices.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">system level, link level, COST259 macrocell channel model, WCDMA, EGPRS, transformation error, EDGE/GERAN, wireless communications, third-generation mobile communications, array pattern synthesis, robustness, correlated signal environment, adaptive antenna systems, array imperfections, Davies transformation, antenna arrays, Vandermonde form, narrowband signals, interpolated array transformations, preprocessing techniques, uniform circular arrays, beamforming, direction-of-arrival estimation, optimum beamforming.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12983</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of genes derived from murine malignant mesothelioma by suppression subtractive hybridization</field><field name="creator">Thean, Ai Lee</field><field name="description">Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive tumour, which is highly associated with previous asbestos exposure and is resistant to most conventional anticancer therapies. Previous studies have used a mouse model of to 01 p effective approaches to induction of anti-tumour immunity using modification of tumour cells by the introduction of genetic constructs expressing genes such as that for B7-1 so that tumour growth can be inhibited in vivo. Transfectant clones, AC29 B7-7 and AC29 B7-6, which showed equal levels of expression of B7-1 but were markedly different in tumorigenicity were assessed using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) in order to isolate transcripts which may have been differentially expressed in the two clones. SSH allowed isolation of a number of cDNAs which were apparently differentially expressed in the cell lines. These required characterisation in order to determine their possible relevance to tumorigenicity. Two cDNAs designated as 7-7-76 and 7-7-43 had been isolated previously and the aim of this project was to characterise these cDNAs by sequencing, searching for their homology relationships and investigating gene expression profiles. Preliminary searches revealed that clone 7-7-43 had homology to cyclin-dependent kinase regulatory subunit 1 which plays a role in the cell cycle. On the other hand, clone 77-76 showed only homology to an EST of hypertension related protein and therefore, further investigation was required to obtain the identity of clone 7-7-76. The first part of this project was to in investigate and evaluate gene expression on clone 7-7-43, using both relative RT-PCR and Northern blotting.' In the second part of this project, a more intense study of clone 7-7-76 was conducted.

To continuously measure deep body core temperatures, heart rates, fluid intake, changes in hydration state and physical fatigue in order to establish acceptable levels of physiological strain. To develop a rational heat stress index compatible with these limits. To design working-in-heat protocols for a self-paced workforce. Methods: A series of studies was conducted over 77 shifts on a group of approximately 50 male volunteers working in thermally stressful environments. Continuously- recorded deep body core temperatures, heart rates, fluid consumption, urinary specific gravity and physical fatigue were measured and recorded. A new field protocol was developed to assess physical fatigue over the working shift. An original methodology was developed to allow any heat stress index to be assessed on a comparative basis with any other index. A review of the commonly used occupational heat stress indices was conducted. A new rational heat stress index was developed, based on existing biophysical relationships and recommended physiological strain limits of deep body core temperature and sweat rate. New protocols designed for self-paced work incorporating the significant risk factors for heat illness were developed and implemented in a workforce of approximately 2000 workers exposed to heat stress. The previous protocols used a shortened shift as the primary intervention to protect worker health. The subsequent protocols removed the shortened shift and replaced this with a range of other interventions. Deep body core temperature, heart rate, fluid consumption, hydration state and fatigue were measured before and after the changes in protocols.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">self-pacing, shift work, industrial worker, heat stress, index, standard, comparison, body temperature, fluid replacement, sweat rate, dehydration, extended shifts, fatigue, heart rate.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The export garments industry of Bangladesh with particular reference to women</field><field name="creator">Rock, Marilyn I.</field><field name="description">After gaining independence from Pakistan in 1971, the Bangladesh state moved from a mainly state-managed sector to a privatised one based on export-oriented industrialisation. Under this policy, the production of garments for export emerged in the mid-1970s to later become the most lucrative export earner for Bangladesh, underlining the fact that it has become an important world exporter of garments. In developing into the only multi-billion- dollar manufacturing export in the country, this industry has created employment for more than a million workers most of whom are young females from the impoverished rural areas of Bangladesh. This is socially significant because, for the first time, it marked the entry of Bangladeshi women into formal manufacturing employment. This thesis attempts to examine the origins and development of this export garments industry, with specific reference to the role of women workers in this process. In so it endeavours to contextualise these issues by arguing that the changes that it endeavours can be best explained according to a Marxist class analysis and by reference to a colonial history characterised by ongoing exploitation in an emerging manufacturing sector and by ongoing resistance to such exploitation by an emerging industrial workforce. Additionally, in examining the development of this industry, the thesis also sets out to show how the industry is the product of a conjuncture of forces, including an emerging capitalist class, a weak state, foreign capital and international state formations such as GATT and the ILO.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">export oriented industrialisation, Bangladesh, industrial workers rights, female factory workers, garment industry.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13589</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementing Innovative Technology: Towards the Transformation of a University</field><field name="creator">Pelliccione, Lina</field><field name="description">Growing pressure is being placed upon educational institutions as students, employers and governments look at the economic, demographic and technological environments of the present, expecting them to have the answers for the future. Many institutions are turning to information and communication technology (ICT) for some of these answers. The focus of this study is two fold - the use of ICT in teaching and learning by teaching staff within an Australian tertiary institution (Curtin University of Technology) and the mechanisms the University has established in order to realign themselves with the information age. At certain stages these two coincide to provide an insight into the organisational culture and teaching environment of one Australian University. The key research questions that guided this study are as follows: How are Curtin University teaching staff utilising ICT in their teaching and learning?; What is the relationship between the ICT behaviour of a University's teaching staff and the strategies used to implement the University's ICT strategic planning initiatives?; What is an appropriate model for future implementation of ICT into teaching and learning at an Australian university? A combination of qualitative (interview and case study techniques) and quantitative (survey and Likert-type instruments) methods was employed. Overall, this study can be described as longitudinal in nature, relying upon such tools as observation, interviews and survey instruments, to collect data at appropriate points in time from the various samples.

In order to determine whether the application of this model in a methodology could alter the teaching beliefs of newly enrolled students, a two-phase procedure was employed. First-year students in each phase of the study were involved in solving a teaching problem. Through self-articulation, group- and class-discussions and self-reflection, the students were examined to determine any change in their beliefs about teaching mathematics. Prior beliefs about mathematics teaching, and beliefs held at the end of the methodology module were determined and compared in order to determine if new learning was in evidence. The creation of an authentic interactive learning environment to foster the kind of learning desired - a potentially safe, trusting and non-judgemental environment for free disclosure of students' opinions and feelings about mathematics teaching - was investigated. Data was generated by different quantitative and qualitative methods.

The outcome of the study was the substantive theory of situational positioning, the process used by the RN participants when they were trying to get things right .In-depth interviews were conducted with 25 purposefully selected registered nurses and nursing home management staff. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, and analysed using the constant comparative method. Other sources of data. guided by theoretical sampling. were selected documents such as government reports regarding aged care, and some field observations. Situational positioning was a process that involved physical. cognitive, emotional, and moral dimensions, and reflected how the RN participants acted and responded when dealing with situations at work. Situational positioning was conceptualised as occurring along two intersecting continua of behaviours, and these behaviours emerged from the data as four interrelated categories. Yielding and confronting represented the poles on a continuum of action-oriented behaviour, with being flexible and being rigid on a continuum that reflected more affective or attitudinal responses. The four categories that made up the positioning continua had both positive and negative meanings in relation to the actions and responses of the participants, depending on the particular situation. Yielding was a conceptual category that reflected participants' comments about stopping a particular action and trying something else or giving up completely and even leaving the situation. f he term confronting was used to describe participants' actions that were based on assertiveness that was seen as a constructive behaviour, or anger that tended to be non-productive.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geriatric nursing, grounded theory, decision making, residential aged care.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13781</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of classroom environment on high school students' mathematics anxiety and attitudes</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Bret Allen</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to examine the possible associations between the perceived classroom environment of high school students, the level of mathematics anxiety that they possess, and their attitudes towards mathematics. This marks the first time that these three fields of research have been simultaneously combined. Data were gathered from 745 high school mathematics students in 34 classes in high schools in the Southern California area using three instruments: the What is Happening In this Class? (WIHIC) learning environment survey created by Fraser, McRobbie, and Fisher (1996), an updated version of Plake and Parker's (1982) Revised Mathematics Anxiety Ratings Scale WRS), and a mathematics version of selected scales from Fraser's (1981) Test of Science-Related Attitudes (TOSRA). This revised attitude instrument was called the Test of Mathematics-Related Attitudes (TOMRA). Using statistical methods, the three instruments were checked for internal consistency reliability, factor structure, and discriminant validity. The RMARS and WIHIC were both found to exhibit good reliability and factorial validity in mathematics classrooms in Southern California, while the TOMRA yielded two scales of the four a priori scales, Enjoyment of Mathematics Lessons and Normality of Mathematicians, which met reliability and factorial validity standards. Within-class gender differences were analysed using paired t-tests combined with a modified Bonferroni procedure and effect sizes. Between- student gender difference were investigated using MANOVA. Simple correlation and multiple regression analyses were performed to identify possible associations between the learning environment and anxiety/attitudes scales.

Neglecting the effect of seismic anisotropy in seismic processing algorithms may incorrectly image the seismic reflectors. This will also influence the quantitative amplitude analysis such as the acoustic or elastic impedance inversion and amplitude versus offsets analysis. Therefore it is important to obtain anisotropy parameters from seismic data. Conventional layer stripping inversion schemes and reflector based reflectivity inversion methods are solely dependent upon a specific reflector, without considering the effect of the other layers. This, on one hand, does not take the effect of transmission in reflectivity inversion into the account, and on the other hand, ignores the information from the waves travelling toward the lower layers. I provide a framework to integrate the information for each specific layer from all the rays which have travelled across this layer. To estimate anisotropy parameters I have implemented unconstrained minimization algorithms such as nonlinear conjugate gradients and variable metric methods, I also provide a nonlinear least square method, based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. In a stack of horizontal transversely isotropic layers with vertical axis of symmetry, where the layer properties are laterally invariant, we provide two different inversion schemes; traveltime and waveform inversion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shales, Fractures, Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, Thomsen&#8217;s anisotropy parameters</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a unique instructional paradigm for teaching English as a foreign language in Korea: an examination of its effectiveness</field><field name="creator">Kent, David Bradley</field><field name="description">The native language of South Korea has come to contain a linguistic subset consisting of English and European loanwords and pseudo-loanwords. The notion that the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learner is immersed in such a lexicon, and that this terminology can be utilized to effectively assist target language (Standard American English) vocabulary acquisition by the false-beginner through Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL), was evaluated and examined. The empirical investigation employed a within-methods (i.e. experiment and survey) design. To this end, the researcher developed and deployed multimedia-based learning environments to empirically test research suppositions. In particular, to examine how the student&#8217;s knowledge of English words adapted for use in the South Korean vernacular &#8211; loanwords &#8211; is affected by their attitudes towards computerized instruction, their preference for certain methods of learning and teaching, and also by the attributes of computerized instructional packages. Ultimately, a method of instruction grounded in both CALL and linguistic theory was developed and its effectiveness for use with South Korean EFL learners in a university English program setting assayed. Scholarly accounts of the South Korean cultural learning style were also taken into consideration, and the implications such accounts hold for the implementation of CALL initiatives scrutinized.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">South Korea, English as a foreign language (EFL), Computer assisted language learning (CALL), Linguistic theory</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self-efficacy Theory: Relevance of General and Specific Efficacy Beliefs for Psychosocial Adaptation to Chronic Illness Over Time</field><field name="creator">Rapley, Patrica</field><field name="description">Over the last decade or more, chronic illness research has consistently found that the lineaer relationship between knowledge and behaviour or between behaviour change and improved health outcomes does not exist. Furthermore, the link between behaviour and health status is not as strong as the link between illness-specific efficacy belier and health status. Strategies to increase confidence in illness-specific behaviours have gradually assumed more importance in improving health outcomes. Strategies to improve behaviour-specific efficacy belief can assist individuals to change their behaviour by influencing behavioural choices, effort and persistence with task man demands. Concomitantly, it has been suggested that there is a positive relationship between efficacy belief and psychosocial functioning. It is unclear as to whether this empirical evidence also applies to chronic illness conditions with a complex self-care regimen. The degree to which a more general level of confidence, or efficacy belief, can also contribute to psychosocial functioning is unknown. The focus of this study was to examine the relative impact of general and illness-specific efficacy expectations on psychosocial adaptation to illness over nine months. The study measured illness-specific efficacy beliefs when it was expected that they were still developing.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IMDSES, factor analysis, PAIS.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12145</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning environment, mathematics achievement and student attitudes among university computing students in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Margianti, Eko Sri</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the findings of a study of the influence of the classroom learning environment on students cognitive and affective outcomes among 2,498 third-year computing students in 50 university-level classes in Indonesia.

The study involved 620 teachers and 4645 students from 57 Australian secondary schools in all states and territories. Student outcome measures included mathematics achievement, attitudes and beliefs toward mathematics and were collected as part of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study. Teachers perceptions of their school environment were measured using the School Level Environment Questionnaire and included variables such as student support, affiliation, professional interest, mission consensus, empowerment, innovation, resource adequacy and work pressure. Previous research has shown that factors at the school level, like environment, influence education at the classroom level and to further investigate this, data regarding the instructional practices of teachers was included in the analysis. The unique methodology used to investigate influences on student mathematics achievement is also described in this thesis. A two-step approach to modelling consisted of the analysis of two conceptually distinct models. The first was an analysis of the measurement model, which specifies the relationships between the observed variables and the latent variables. The second involved a structural equation model, which specifies the relationships among the latent variables as posited by theory and previous research. In addition, a multilevel analysis was included to further partition the variance in student outcomes between the student level, the classroom level and the school level. The results of these analysis linked particular variables of interest to improved student outcomes.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">differences in achievement, student outcomes, SLEQ, mathematics education.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors determining the effectiveness of online access to the curriculum for students at risk</field><field name="creator">Nicholls, Bronte Kay</field><field name="description">This thesis reports a longitudinal study that investigated the factors affecting at-risk students' use of an online curriculum delivery mode for some Year 11 subjects. The study examined the skills and attitudes of the students during their online learning experience, and followed the teachers while they developed suitable teaching methods to be able to deliver their subject via online learning. Importantly, the students in the study were at risk of not completing subjects in the South Australian Certificate of Education (SALE) if some kind of curriculum intervention was not applied. Access to the school curriculum can be problematic for some young people for a variety of reasons, including a limited subject choice, an inability to attend programmed classes and exhibiting behaviour that is deemed to be inappropriate by school authorities. Students in this study were not able to study the subjects they wished because of timetable clashes, were not able to attend school regularly for personal reasons or had exhibited negative behaviour to their teachers and peers preventing them from attending certain classes. At the time of the study, all the students wished to complete their SALE, but limited access to the curriculum was likely to prevent this from occurring. The study used qualitative methods of data collection including interviews with students and teachers, analysis of students' work, electronic communications and other documents, and records of meetings. These were used to prepare case studies for each of the seven students involved. While the student sample was small, the varied personal experiences of the students in the study enabled the examination of many of the characteristics documented in the literature as those being associated with at-risk youth.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">online curriculum delivery, online learning environment, South Australia, at-risk students.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of traditional knowledge in understanding natural phenomena in the Gulf Province of Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Pauka, Soikava</field><field name="description">This study used qualitative (interviews) and quantitative methods (questionnaires) to investigate and describe (a) Papua New Guinea (PNG) village elders' traditional ideas and beliefs on natural phenomena, (b) PNG secondary school student's traditional science beliefs, (c) the sources of PNG secondary school students' explanations of natural phenomena, (d) the types of explanations PNG secondary school students provide to describe natural phenomena, and the views of science teachers and curriculum officers on the inclusion of traditional knowledge in the science curriculum..

Although it has been shown that only 3.1% of fallers sustained fractures (Nevitt, Cumming, Kidd, &amp; Black, 1989), injuries in older people are often more serious. For example, hospital charges for older adult fall injuries are about US $2,000 per person higher than for young fallers (Ellis &amp; Trent, 2001). Moreover, falling can lead to social isolation, physical restraint, disability and institutionalisation (Donald &amp; Bulpitt, 1999; Tideiksaar, 1994). Therefore falling in old age results in a considerable burden on, not only the individual concerned, but also the whole society. Internationally, a successful falls prevention program usually employs a multidimensional approaches (Alexander &amp; Edelberg, 2002; Mosley, Galindo- Ciocon, Peak, &amp; West, 1998). However, limited information about fall prevention has been reported in Thailand. A survey indicated that Thai elderly fall outside their homes which is different from the findings in Western countries (Jitapunkul et al., 1998). This suggests that adoption of fall prevention strategies from Western countries might not be successful in Thailand. Prior to this study, details of fall circumstances in terms of location, time, associated activity, hazards and type of falls in Thai older people were not available. Moreover, there was no information about fear of falling and activity restriction. These are important fall consequences that impact on quality of life and themselves are risk factors for falls. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of fear of falling, and to describe activity restriction in fallers and non-fallers, and the circumstances associated with falls in Thailand. No fear of falling measurement tools for Thai older people were available prior to the study.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SAFE Thai version, Thai elderly people, risk factors for falls.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The leadership of entrepreneurialism in technical and further education colleges</field><field name="creator">Whitley, Peter J.</field><field name="description">The provision of vocational education and training is largely provided by the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) colleges and institutes, which have been established throughout Australia. All of these colleges and institutes are the responsibility of the respective State governments and are generally considered by those governments as strategic instruments of government particularly in regard to the preparation of people for employment and addressing deficiencies within the workforce. As more emphasis has been placed upon government entities to be more entrepreneurial and corporate in their outlook, pressures for reform of the TAFE sector have also increased. These pressures have included changes to funding arrangements, increased compliance regimes and a freeing of the training delivery to encourage the establishment of private providers. This thesis explores how Chief Executive Officers and Middle Level Managers within the TAFE environment are responding to those challenges. Forty-seven senior TAFE managers are interviewed to ascertain their perspectives on the community and government expectations of TAFE and how they believe TAFE is reacting to these challenges. Resulting from the research has been the emergence of entrepreneurship in TAFE. The notion of entrepreneurship in TAFE seems to capture a sense of change, a sense of emerging vibrance, and is often used to describe innovation and risk taking within the TAFE environment. The word entrepreneurial, entrepreneurialism, entrepreneurship and other derivations of the word are loosely employed by TAFE personnel to describe particular phenomenon within TAFE. Within this thesis the treatment of entrepreneurship as a definitive concept is recognised as problematic and it is therefore treated in a way that aligns to the TAFE environment and not necessarily as defined by traditional entrepreneurial theory.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">leadership in TAFE, education in Australia, Technical and Further Education (TAFE).</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fractals and fuzzy sets for modelling the heterogenity and spatial complexity of urban landscapes using multiscale remote sensing data</field><field name="creator">Islam, Zahurul</field><field name="description">This research presents models for the analysis of textural and contextual information content of multiscale remote sensing to select an appropriate scale for the correct interpretation and mapping of heterogeneous urban land cover types. Spatial complexity measures such as the fractal model and the Moran&#8217;s I index of spatial autocorrelation were applied for addressing the issue of scale, while fuzzy set theory was applied for mapping heterogeneous urban land cover types. Three local government areas (e.g. the City of Perth, the City of Melville and the City of Armadale) of the Perth metropolitan area were selected, as the dominant land covers of these areas are representative to the whole metropolitan area, for the analysis of spatial complexity and the mapping of complex land covers. Characterisation of spatial complexity of the study areas computed from SPOT, Landsat-7 ETM+, and Landsat MSS was used for assessing the appropriateness of a scale for urban analysis. Associated with this outcome, the effect of spectral resolution and land cover heterogeneity on spatial complexity, the performance of fractal measurement algorithms and the relationship between the fractal dimension and Moran&#8217;s I were identified. A fuzzy supervised approach of the fuzzy c-means algorithm was used to generate fuzzy memberships of the selected bands of a Landsat-7 ETM+ scene based on the highest spectral separability among different urban land covers (e.g. forest, grassland, urban and dense urban) as determined by a transformed divergence analysis. Fuzzy land cover maps resulting from the application of fuzzy operators (e.g. maximum, minimum, algebraic sum, algebraic product and gamma operators) were evaluated against fuzzy memberships derived from the virtual field reference database (VFRDB).</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mapping urban land covers, remote sensing, interpretation of landscapes.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new taste of tradition : Chinese snacks and hawker-entrepreneurs in Singapore</field><field name="creator">Lee, Shereen</field><field name="description">Traditional Chinese snacks have been part of Chinese food culture for years but many types of snacks have been disappearing in Singapore as a result of globalization and modernization. Since the late 1990s, however, some types of Chinese snacks have become increasingiy popular as they are being marketed in new food retail spaces. In the 1940s, kaya toast started as an inexpensive breakfast snack for Chinese immigrants but has since evolved into a lifestyle snack enjoyed by Singaporeans at any time of the day. The growing popularity of kaya toast and some other types of snacks has revived the traditional Chinese snack food industry. This thesis examines the re-emergence of a traditional Chinese snack culture in Singapore. It discusses the history of traditional Chinese snacks, its continuity and the changing nature of Chinese snack foods in Singapore. Based on case studies conducted in 2005 with retailers of selected traditional Chinese snack foods, the study examines when such food enterprises in Singapore were established, why they were established and the ways in which they were able to survive in the highly competitive market for various kinds of snack foods. It examines the business characteristics and strategies of the new vendors by comparing them to traditional hawkers in the past. Techniques employed in this study include interviews, participant observation, spatial mapping and document analysis. The findings indicate that the adaptation of the retailers by fusing authentic recipes with new ingredients and flavours, using modern technology, adopting marketing techniques, using media promotion, as well as the offering of a diverse product mix and the setting up of numerous retail outlets have helped the new hawker-entrepreneurs to stay competitive in the growing snack food market in Singapore.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese snacks, Singapore, snack food industry, hawkers, retailers, entrepreneurs</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=118257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of fault and top seal effectiveness through an integration of hydrodynamic and capillary analysis techniques</field><field name="creator">Underschultz, James Ross</field><field name="description">Fault and top seal effectiveness has proved to be a significant risk in exploration success, and creates a large uncertainty in predicting reservoir performance. This is particularly true in the Australian context, but equally applies to exploration provinces worldwide. Seals can be broadly classified into fault, intraformational, and top seal. For geological time-scale processes, intraformational and top seals are typically characterised by their membrane seal capacity and fracture threshold pressure. Fault seals are typically characterised by fault geometry, juxtaposition, membrane seal capacity, and reactivation potential. At the production time scale, subtle variations in the permeability distribution within a reservoir can lead to compartmentalization. These are typically characterised by dynamic reservoir models which assume hydrostatic conditions prior to commencement of production. There are few references in the seals literature concerning the integration of hydrodynamic techniques with the various aspects of seal evaluation. The research for this PhD thesis by published papers includes: Methodology for characterising formation water flow systems in faulted strata at exploration and production time scales; a new theory of hydrodynamics and membrane (capillary) seal capacity; and case study evaluations demonstrating integrated multidisciplinary techniques for the evaluation of seal capacity (fault, intraformational and top seal) that demonstrate the new theory in practice. By incorporating hydrodynamic processes in the evaluation of total seal capacity, the evidence shows that existing shale gouge ratio &#8211; across fault pressure difference (SGR-AFPD) calibration plots need adjustment resulting in the calibration envelopes shifting to the centre of the plot.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fault, intraformational, top seals, exploration success, reservoir performance, effectiveness, membrane seal capacity, fracture threshold pressure, fault geometry</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=118307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quasi-Continuous GPS Steep Slope Monitoring: A Multi-Antenna Array Approach</field><field name="creator">Forward, Troy Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the design, implementation and validation of a multi-antenna GPS system to monitor the displacement of deforming slopes. The system utilises a switched antenna array design allowing data from multiple antennas to be sampled sequentially by one GPS receiver. The system provides quasi-continuous GPS observations that can produce a precise and reliable coordinate time-series of the movement of the slope under consideration. GPS observations and particularly those concerned with the monitoring of steep slopes, are subject to systematic errors that can significantly degrade the quality of the processed position solutions. As such, this research characterises the data in terms of multipath effects, the spectrum of the coordinate time-series, and the carrier to noise power density ratio of the raw GPS observations. Various GPS processing parameters are then investigated to determine optimal processing parameters to improve the precision of the resulting coordinate time-series. Results from data stacking techniques that rely on the daily correlation of the repeating multipath signature find that the GPS data actually decorrelates somewhat from day to day. This can reduce the effectiveness of stacking techniques for the high precision monitoring of steep slopes. Finally, advanced stochastic models such as elevation angle and carrier-to-noise weighting are investigated to optimise the precision of the coordinate time-series data. A new in-line stochastic model is developed based on weighting GPS observations with respect to the level of systematic error present within the data. By using these advanced types of stochastic models, reductions to the noise level of the coordinate time-series of approximately 20 and 25 percent are possible in the horizontal and height components respectively.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geodesy,  Surveying,  Global Positioning System,  Geomatic Engineering,  Rock Slope Engineering,  Landslide,  Slope Monitoring,  Geotechnical Engineering,  Monitoring, GPS,  Satellite Positioning, Satellite Geodesy.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=11914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the physics of prawn trawling for fisheries management</field><field name="creator">Sterling, David John</field><field name="description">Management of prawn trawling fisheries is a difficult task due to the competing interests of strongly motivated stakeholders and interest groups. This occurs because prawn trawling operations are technically complex, require large capital investments and exhibit high running costs while owners have limited property rights over the resources that they harvest. Prawn stocks are public resources and are managed with a view to provide maximum benefit to the broad community. Additionally their exploitation also involves the incidental capture of significant numbers of other animals of no commercial value (bycatch) and causes impacts on seabed morphologies, which are involved in many diverse ecosystem processes. At the policy level an intention to manage trawl fisheries in a comprehensive way is backed by a mandated approach that is designed to capture all of the above issues and interests. That approach is termed Ecological Sustainable Development (ESD). The work in this thesis is designed to produce a prediction tool for prawn trawling performance that is based on modelling the physical nature of prawn trawling activities. It is proposed that the resulting tool is essential for working to manage the multi-dimensional aspects of prawn trawling fisheries. Three discrete objectives for the thesis are; to expand and improve an existing Prawn Trawling Performance Model (PTPM) so that it is more accurate and relevant to a broader range of questions, to evaluate the capacity of the PTPM to predict the performance characteristics of real prawn trawling operations in terms of both engineering and catching performance and to investigate the problem space surrounding prawn trawl fisheries to identify and develop applications for the model. A rudimentary PTPM (Sterling 2000b) is expanded through the analysis of further empirical data collected for model and full-scale trawl gear.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fisheries technology, prawn fishery catch data, prawn trawling performance model (PTPM).</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16093</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parent and student perceptions of the science learning environment and its influence on student outcomes</field><field name="creator">Allen, Debra</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on the modification, validation and application of a classroom learning environment questionnaire.

Parents and students were interviewed to check further the validity and reliability of questionnaires and to enhance the richness of the quantitative findings. Interviews with parents and students, along with classroom observations, offered some insights into the quantitative findings. Data analyses supported the WIHIC's factorial validity, internal consistency reliability and ability to differentiate between the perceptions of students in different classrooms.

From a satellite-based perspective the radiative properties of the land surface and the atmosphere are inextricably linked. Knowledge of both is required if one is to accurately measure the temperature of the land surface from a space-borne platform. In practice, most satellite-based sensors designed to measure LST over the surface of the Earth are polar orbiting. They scan swaths of the order of 2000 km, utilizing zenith angles of observation of up to 60&#176;. As such, satellite viewing geometry is important when comparing estimates of LST between different overpasses of the same point on the Earth's surface. In the case of the atmosphere, the optical path length through which the surfaceleaving radiance propagates increases with increasing zenith angle of observation. A longer optical path may in turn alter the relative contributions which molecular absorption and emission processes make to the radiance measured at the satellite sensor. A means of estimating the magnitudes of these radiative components in relation to the viewing geometry of the satellite needs to be developed if their impacts on the at-sensor radiance are to be accurately accounted for. The problem of accurately describing radiative transfer between the surface and the satellite sensor is further complicated by the fact that the surface-leaving radiance itself may also vary with sensor viewing geometry. Physical properties of the surface such as emissivity are known to vary as the zenith angle of observation changes. The proportions of sunlit and shaded areas with the field-of-view of the sensor may also change with viewing geometry depending on the type of cover (eg vegetation), further impacting the surface emissivity.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">surface brightness temperature (SBT), land surface temperature (LST), remote sensing.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evidence-based model for determining treatment dosages in therapeutic ultrasound using thermometry: an in-vitro investigation using post-mortem pig tissues</field><field name="creator">Goh, Ah Cheng</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between the dosage parameters and temperature increase at the target tissues (up to 5 cm below the skin surface), and to explore the possibility of proposing a preliminary model to guide clinicians and researchers in determining treatment dosages based on expected increase in temperatures at the target tissue. Prior to the conduct of the main study several protocol-related issues were investigated. These included the reliability of the measurement procedures, the optimum speed of movement of the transducer, the optimum size of the treatment area, and the maximum output intensity that could be considered safe for treatment applications and investigations. An in-vitro post-mortem pig model was chosen for the experimental design using only adult-sized pigs, weighing between 60 to 80 kilograms. A total of 76 specimens were obtained from the shoulder and thigh sections of 19 pigs. The therapeutic ultrasound machine used throughout the study was the Omnisound 3000TM (Physio Technology Inc., Topeka, Kansas, USA) Output from the Omnisound 3000TM was checked and calibrated as necessary prior to each experiment using a power meter (Model UPM-DT-10, Ohmnic Instruments Co., St. Michaels, Maryland 21663, USA).

The main objective is to highlight the power of individual Indonesian FDWs and the collective power of these women in negotiating these structures of power in the context of a migration study as well as a `resistance' study. I argue that Indonesian FDWs are active agents who exercise individual agency and collective `resistance' in the migration system. As labour migrants they exert power in shaping the nature of the migrant institution. One of the means in which they do so is by perpetuating the informal networks of migration. Individual Indonesian FDWs are also capable of exerting power in circumventing elements of exploitation and domination they encounter during their migration process and employment in Singapore. Crucial to this capability is the ability to have access to a network of agents within the migrant institution. Some Indonesian FDWs are also active in exerting power as a group to present a collective resistance against negative stereotyping of their identities as the immigrant other in Singapore. They do so via a formal religious based social group.

The aim of this is so that Indonesian FDWs can be treated with respect and dignity in Singapore.

This study examined the practices of mathematics teaching in three township secondary schools by conducting a detailed investigation of eight teachers in three schools. Classroom observations and video recordings of teachers of Grades 10 to 12 served as the main data collection method. A sample of 12 lessons was analysed using the Secondary Teaching Analysis Matrix-Mathematics (STAM-Mathematics) (Gallagher &amp; Parker, 1995) instrument. The researcher used STAM to categorise teachers' classroom practices along a three pronged continuum, namely didactic, transitional and conceptual teaching for the purpose of answering research questions about the content, the teaching, the assessment practices, the interactions between the teacher and the student, and the resource availability. Analysis of the data collected using the 22 STAM descriptors showed that the practices of teaching mathematics in township secondary schools was primarily didactic, with only minimal characteristics of transitional teaching and fewer attributes of conceptual teaching. Identifying the gaps between the teachers' practice and the descriptors for transitional and conceptual teaching with respect to the content, the teaching, the approaches to assessment, interactions between teacher and students, and resources availability has provided insight and a baseline for teacher inservice. Consequently, this study has provided research-based evidence for appropriate intervention to improve mathematics teaching and learning as prioritised by the Department of Education since the creation of the democratic government in 1994.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Secondary Teaching Analysis Matrix (STAM), teaching styles, teacher training, mathematics education.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of males with spinal cord injuries in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Chinchai, Pisak</field><field name="description">The numbers of people with spinal cord injuries (SCI) in Thailand are increasing. Thai rehabilitation care focuses treatment on acute care with little attention to the lives of clients after discharge from institutions. To date, there has been no research on rehabilitation outcomes and factors relevant to these issues for people with SCI at home and in the community in Thailand. The purpose of this study was to identify and compare the outcomes of functional status, depression, anxiety and stress, and health status of people with SCI, both at discharge and at three months post-discharge from hospital. One hundred twenty-one participants with SCI were recruited from ten major hospitals in Thailand. Data was collected at 48 hours pre-discharge and again at three months post-discharge using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS), and the SF-36 Health Survey. The results demonstrated that mean scores of functional status at discharge were significantly higher than at three months post-discharge. Depression and anxiety scores at discharge were significantly lower than depression and anxiety scores at three months postdischarge. Stress score had not significantly changed from discharge to post-discharge. Health status scores at discharge were also higher than at three months post-discharge on eight subscales. Factors relevant to or predicting functional status were marital status, attendant care, number of architectural barriers, fulfilled occupational therapy (OT) needs, and number of different services required but not received. Factors predicting depression, anxiety and stress were marital and economic status, age at onset, education level, duration of disability, fulfilled OT needs, number of different services received, and numbers of different service required but not received.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), SCI, rehabilitation outcomes.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14061</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coordination studies of inositols with aluminium and related cations</field><field name="creator">Chokazinga, Davlin</field><field name="description">In this work cis-inositol, epi-inositol and myo-inositol carbonate were successfully synthesised and used for coordination studies. The preparation of cis-inositol was achieved by reduction of tetrahydroxybenzoquinone via hydrogenation with palladium hydroxide as the catalyst and was purified by chromatographic separation using Dowex resin. The synthesis of epi-inositol was achieved by the nitric acid oxidation of myo-inositol to form epi-inosose which was subsequently reduced by hydrogenation using palladium hydroxide as the catalyst. myo-Inositol was converted into its mono-orthoformate derivative and the equatorial hydroxy group was then protected as a tertiary-butyldimethylsilyl ether. The carbonate group was introduced onto this protected inositol and then the protecting groups were removed by acid hydrolysis. The coordination characteristics of four inositols, viz cis-inositol, epi-inositol, myo-inositol and myo-inositol carbonate with calcium, aluminium, gallium, lanthanum and samarium ions have been investigated. Interactions of the aluminate anion with epi-inositol and myo-inositol in deuterated sodium hydroxide were also investigated. Three methods were used in the study of complexation behaviour of these systems. namely, [superscript]13C NMR spectroscopy, HPLC and ion exchange chromatography. [superscript]13C NMR spectroscopy was found to be most useful for determining possible complexation behaviour of the inositols. Chemical shift changes of the resonance signals in the [superscript]13C NMR spectra on sequential addition of cations to solutions of the inositols at near neutral pH, have led to determination of possible coordination sites of the inositols. In general, large induced chemical shift changes have been interpreted to signify strong cation-inositol interaction at specific hydroxy groups.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spectroscopy, ion exchange chromatography, alumina production.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growth, survival, haemolymph osmolality and organosomatic indicies of the Western King prawn (Penaeus latisulcatus Kishinouye, 1896) reared at different salinities</field><field name="creator">Huynh, Minh Sang</field><field name="description">The western king prawn (Penueus Zarisulcutus) is one of the most economically valuable species of crustacean in Australia. The experiment was carried out for 60 days to determine the growth, survival, haemolymph osmolality and organosomatic indices of the western lung prawn (2.95 f 0.26 g mean initial weight) reared at 10, 22, 34 and 46 g L of salinities. In addition, haemolymph osmolality and osmoregulatory capacity (OC) of the western king prawn (5.37 f 0.1 g mean initial weight) reared at salinities (10, 22, 34 and 46 g/L) were determined following 7, 14 and 21 minutes of air exposure and compared with the brown tiger prawn (P, esculentus). Mean final weight, total length, carapace length and specific growth rate (SGR) of the western king prawn were highest at a salinity of 34 g/L. Moult increments (in weight and total length) of the western king prawn were not significantly different (P &gt; 0.05) when reared at four different salinities. Food conversion ratios were lowest in prawns reared at salinities of 22 and 34 g/L. Survival of the western king prawn was highest at a salinity of 22 g/L and lowest at a salinity of 10 g/L. Haemolymph osmolality of the western king prawn increased with an increase in salinity and weight. Isosmotic points of the western king prawn calculated from regression lines between haemolymph and medium osmolality were 28.87, 29.46 and 31.73 g / L at 0, 20 and 60 days of rearing (accordingly to 2.95 f 0.26; 4.02 f 0.47; 5.79 f 0.64 g body weight), respectively. Tail moisture content of the western king prawn decreased with the increase of salinity. After 60 days of rearing, the lowest hepatopancreas moisture content of the prawns was at a salinity of 22 gL.

To date, no research has been reported on adaptation of mustard in water limited Mediterranean-type environments in south Western Australia. Experiments presented in this thesis were undertaken to study adaptation of mustard in the Mediterranean-type environments in south Western Australia, with the hypothesis that mustard would be better adapted to these environments due to its reputation for drought tolerance. Experiments were conducted with three main aims. Firstly, to identify the effects of genotype, environment (times of sowing/seasons/sites) and genotype x environment interaction on the phenology, growth, dry matter production, seed yield, oil and protein contents of mustard and canola. Secondly, to identify phenological, morphological and physiological characters responsible for adaptation and yield improvement of mustard in these environments. Thirdly, to study the response of mustard to soil moisture deficits, especially in the post-flowering period, in comparison to canola. Adaptation of six mustard breeding lines/cultivars varying in maturity, height and oil quality and three canola cultivars varying in maturity were tested at a medium rainfall site (Northam) in the 1999 growing season. These genotypes were sown at four times after the break of the season and their phenology, growth, morphology, dry matter production and partitioning, radiation absorption, seed yield and its components, and seed oil and protein concentrations were measured. Adaptation of mustard to short season, low rainfall areas was tested, in the 2000 and 2001 growing seasons, at three sites (Merredin. Mullewa and Newdegate), by sowing seven genotypes of mustard and canola at three times after the break of the season.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environment interaction, canola, Mediterranean, mustard.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of pharmacist interventions on drug and dosage prescribing in pediatric settings</field><field name="creator">Angalakuditi, Mallik V.</field><field name="description">Objectives: To evaluate the influence of pharmacist interventions on drug and dosage prescribing in pediatric settings.

Jammu city is the winter capital of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, situated at the extreme north of India. This is the first time that any learning environment research has been conducted and reported from this part of the world.The objective of this research was to provide further validation information about two already existing learning environment instruments with Indian students and describe, discuss and analyse information on the associations between students perceptions of learning environment and their attitudes and cognitive achievements. Differences in the perceptions of different groups namely gender, religious and cultural were also investigated.The present study commenced with a more positivistic framework, with an aim of providing a large-scale quantitative overview. The Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction (QTI), the What is Happening in this Class? (WIHIC) and an Attitude Scale were administered to 1,021 students from 32 science classes in seven different co-educational private schools in Jammu.The data were analysed to determine the reliability, validity and mean of each scale. Students were interviewed to determine further the reliability of the questionnaires, in addition to providing information that might explain the QTI and WIHIC mean scale scores. As a result of critical reflection, the study moved towards a more interpretative framework, drawing on elements of the constructivist and critical theory paradigms.

The research employed the agency theory hypothesised by Jensen and Meckling (1976) from the view of contractual relationships among various parties involved within a company. It presents a longitudinal study of the 161 non- financial publicly listed companies in the Jakarta Stock Exchange between 1994- 2000. This design enables a researcher not only to examine the effects of various governance variables on corporate performance, but also to examine the extent to which such relationships vary with changes in the general economic environment. This study reveals that only a small proportion of private-domestic Indonesian firms have a widely dispersed ownership structure. Viewed from the standpoint of traditional agency theory, the separation of ownership and control seems to work differently in Indonesia. In this country the agency problem is not between the owners and the managers, as in Anglo-Saxon countries, but may be between &#8220;strong&#8221; controlling shareholders and &#8220;weak&#8221; minority owners. The findings suggest a strong association between degrees of ownership concentration, owner involvement in supervisory/management board and the existence of family business groups. These factors are interdependent, and each of them relates cohesively to the others within the organisation. In this regard, the collectivism and higher power distance value dimensions that are dominant in Indonesian society also heighten such relationships. Inappropriate institutional, law and legal enforcement provide the means for the controlling shareholders to continue these practices, which insulate them from external interference, monitoring and supervision.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ownership-performance relationship, performance measurement, governance structures in Indonesia.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluoride contaminated drinking water in Gokwe District (NW Zimbabwe): spatial distribution, lithostratigraphic controls and implications for human health</field><field name="creator">Mamuse, Antony</field><field name="description">The supply of drinking water in Gokwe District (NW Zimbabwe) is almost entirely based on groundwater drawn from boreholes and open dug wells. In certain areas of the district, the occurrence of dental fluorosis has been linked to excessive fluoride in the water supplies. A high prevalence of dental fluorosis (about 62%) was previously recorded among school children in the district. The aim of this study was to determine relationships between the spatial distribution of fluoride content in drinking water supplies in Gokwe, and lateral and vertical geological variation. A total of 224 water samples were collected from 196 water sources in the study area (a further 18 water sources just outside the study area were also sampled). All the samples were analysed for fluoride in the field using the fluoride ion selective electrode method (FISE). One hundred and fifty nine duplicate samples were analysed for fluoride and common anions and cations using High Performance Ion Chromatography (HPIC) in the laboratory. Two main groups of computer programmes were employed: (1) Geographic Information System (ArcView&#174; GIS) was used to store, analyse and display multiple layers of surface geologic and geographic information, and (2) a three-dimensional visualisation programme (Rockworks) was used to interpret and illustrate site stratigraphy based on borehole information. Results indicated that the fluoride content of drinking water in the study area ranges from 0 to 9.65 mg/L. Forty-seven water sources (24%) yielded water containing fluoride in excess of the World Health Organisation's (WHO) health limit of 1.5 mg/L F. Of the 47 high fluoride water sources, 43 were boreholes (pumped or artesian). The shallower water sources (dug wells, streams and dams) largely yielded low-fluoride water.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fluoride-rich water, fluorosis, fluorine and human health.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automated registration of unorganised point clouds from terrestrial laser scanners</field><field name="creator">Bae, Kwang-Ho</field><field name="description">Laser scanners provide a three-dimensional sampled representation of the surfaces of objects. The spatial resolution of the data is much higher than that of conventional surveying methods. The data collected from different locations of a laser scanner must be transformed into a common coordinate system. If good a priori alignment is provided and the point clouds share a large overlapping region, existing registration methods, such as the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) or Chen and Medioni&#8217;s method, work well. In practical applications of laser scanners, partially overlapping and unorganised point clouds are provided without good initial alignment. In these cases, the existing registration methods are not appropriate since it becomes very difficult to find the correspondence of the point clouds. A registration method, the Geometric Primitive ICP with the RANSAC (GPICPR), using geometric primitives, neighbourhood search, the positional uncertainty of laser scanners, and an outlier removal procedure is proposed in this thesis. The change of geometric curvature and approximate normal vector of the surface formed by a point and its neighbourhood are used for selecting the possible correspondences of point clouds. In addition, an explicit expression of the position uncertainty of measurement by laser scanners is presented in this dissertation and this position uncertainty is utilised to estimate the precision and accuracy of the estimated relative transformation parameters between point clouds. The GP-ICPR was tested with both simulated data and datasets from close range and terrestrial laser scanners in terms of its precision, accuracy, and convergence region. It was shown that the GP-ICPR improved the precision of the estimated relative transformation parameters as much as a factor of 5.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">close-range laser scanner data, point clouds from laser scanners, terrestrial laser scanner data.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indonesian cultural policy, 1950-2003: culture, institutions, government</field><field name="creator">Jones, Tod</field><field name="description">This thesis examines official cultural policy in Indonesia, focussing on the cultural policy of the national governments from 1950 until 2003. Drawing on Michel Foucault&#8217;s writings about government and debates about cultural policy in Cultural Studies, the study proposes that the features of cultural policy in Indonesia are primarily determined by the changing ways that the state has put culture to work in its versions of modern governance. Part I of the thesis provides a history of official cultural policy, including a background chapter on the late colonial era and the Japanese occupation. Although contemporary cultural policy was first articulated within Western liberal democracies to shape self-governing national citizens, the Dutch colonial cultural policy differed in that it assumed indigenous subjects had reduced capacities and focussed on managing ethnic populations. The cultural policies of subsequent governments maintained the twin imperatives of &#8216;improving&#8217; individuals and managing populations, but with different understandings of both imperatives. While a more autonomous subject was assumed during Constitutional Democracy, Guided Democracy exercised greater state guidance as part of Sukarno&#8217;s mobilisation of the population behind his political program. Cultural policy during the New Order era rejected Sukarno&#8217;s &#8216;politicisation&#8217; of culture, replaced &#8216;improvement&#8217; with &#8216;development&#8217; and further strengthened the role of the state in providing cultural guidance, a move justified by designating Indonesians backward by modern standards.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">culture in Indonesia, politics in Indonesia, cultural regulation, cultural leadership.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16663</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Online Assessment System with Integrated Study (OASIS) to enhance the learning of Electrical Engineering students: an action research study</field><field name="creator">Smaill, Christopher Raymond</field><field name="description">World-wide, there has been a large increase in tertiary student numbers, not entirely matched by funding increases. Consequently, instructors are faced with large, diverse classes, and find themselves struggling to provide adequate assessment and prompt feedback, two quantities critical in an effective learning environment. Personal computers and the Internet can help solve this problem. The aim of this study was to develop, implement and validate a Web-based software package that, through providing practice and assessment opportunities, improved student learning and reduced marking and related mundane aspects of instructor workload. At the start of the study, such a package already existed in prototype form: OASIS (Online Assessment System with Integrated Study). As the study progressed, this software package was first fully rewritten and then repeatedly modified. OASIS delivers individualised tasks, marks student responses, supplies prompt feedback, and logs student activity. Staff can deliver sets of practice questions and assessments to students: assessments may involve different questions for different students, not just numerically different versions of the same questions. Given my role as teacher, the traditional research ideal of observing without affecting the research environment was both impossible and unconscionable. In particular, since preliminary evidence suggested that OASIS did enhance student learning, I could not adopt a &#8216;two groups&#8217; approach to the research, with one group using OASIS while the other did not.

Emphasis is placed ondeveloping methods that are practical to use in order to facilitate prediction of slamming occurrence at the design stage. The methods used consist of three steps: Ship motion prediction, slamming identification and slamming pressurecalculations. Existing linear and non-linear ship motion prediction theories are used for high-speed power catamarans while a new strip theory has been developed specifically for motion prediction of sailing multihulls. Predicted shipmotion results are compared to full-scale experiments, both for high-speed powercatamarans and sailing catamarans. A new direct method for identification of slamming occurrence in the time domain is presented, as well as results using probabilistic methods. A comparison between the two methods is presented.Slamming pressure calculations are done using an existing two dimensional slamming theory and are compared with analytical results.

The local region comprises part ofthe rangelands area of Australia and has a semi-arid climate. The initial reason for planting olives was indirectly related to the rapid decrease in the local population and the economic downturn that resulted within that community during the late 1990's. This prompted an investigation into other possibilities for economic diversity for remote communities such as Laverton, which are located in the rangelands area of Australia. In Australia, much of the southern and eastern areas of the country have similar climate to traditional olive growing areas in Europe. [n the rangelands however, the environment is different to most other areas in the world where olive trees are grown and there is a notable absence of a commercial olive industry. Whilst locally, individual trees were also observed to be growing well and fruiting abundantly, it is not known whether it is possible to grow olive trees successfully on a commercial scale. Two preliminary trials were established in an ad-hoc manner, to examine whether olive trees could be grown successfully in the rangelands environment. Eighty-eight trees of 5 different cultivars were planted on a shallow, clay soil profile at the first trial site. Ninety-eight trees of 11 different cultivar were planted on a deep sand soil profile at the second site. Higher mortality rate occurred at the first site, with most tree deaths being recorded in the first two years. Peak growth of branch tips occurred during the spring-summer seasons at both sites. Differences in trial design and timing of planting prevented statistical comparison of growth performance between sites however.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Laverton Western Australia, semi-arid climate, rangeland environment, olive trees, European olive.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interaction of achievement goal orientations, self-regulated learning and learning environment in high school science classrooms</field><field name="creator">Iverach, Michael Robert</field><field name="description">Despite the substantial amount of education research on &#8220;teaching for understanding&#8221; and &#8220;learning for understanding&#8221; processes that has occurred in the fields of achievement goals, constructivist-based pedagogy, motivational beliefs and self-regulated learning there is little research that considers in unison the pillar constructs of these fields. Three studies comprised the present research which was designed to address the proposal that important social- and personal-based constructs associated with achievement goals, constructivist-based pedagogy, motivational beliefs, and self-regulated learning act in an interdisciplinary fashion to influence learning in the high school science classroom. All the large-scale quantitative studies presented a single-level structural equation model that was applicable to the general high school science student, controlling for the variance associated with age, gender, and student type (regular or selective high school student). Results from the two large-scale trait-level correlational studies of Study 1 (n = 655) and Study 2 (n = 617) using the Achievement Goals Questionnaire (Elliot &amp; Church, 1997), Constructivist Learning Environment Survey (Taylor, Fraser, &amp; Fisher, 1997) and the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (Pintrich, Smith, Garcia, &amp; McKeachie, 1991) as the main quantitative instruments found support for the hypothesis that a perceived emphasis on the constructivist-based pedagogical dimensions of personal relevance and student negotiation in science classrooms promotes the adoption of mastery-approach and intrinsic value. These analyses also showed the importance of self-efficacy in promoting mastery-approach, performance-approach and the use of regulatory strategies, and that test anxiety had positive associations with mastery-avoidance and performance-avoidance goals.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science classrooms, achievement goals questionnaire, constructivist-based pedagogy, motivational beliefs, self-regulated learning, constructivist learning environment survey, motivated strategies for learning questionnaire</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17676</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of hands-on activities in terms of learning environment, achievement, and attitudes in grades 4 and 5</field><field name="creator">Hilton, Elton</field><field name="description">A sample of 817 Grade 4-5 mathematics students in the diverse school district of Miami-Dade County Public Schools (MDCPS), Florida, USA was involved in an evaluation of the use of hands-on activities in terms of students' achievement, students' attitudes and students' perceptions of the mathematics classroom environment. Other aims included validating generally-applicable measures of classroom learning environments and students' attitudes to mathematics, and investigating associations between the classroom learning environment and the student outcomes of performance and attitudes. The study was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 had a sample of 442 participants and classroom environment was assessed with scales selected from the My Class Inventory, Questionnaire on Teacher lnteraction and Science Laboratory Environment Inventory. Factor analysis provided a degree of support for the factorial validity and internal consistency reliability (using Cronbach's alpha coefficient) for each of five classroom environment scales. Because of the small number of items per scale (15 items in five scales for the My Class Inventory, 12 items in four scales for the Question on Teacher Interaction and 15 items in five scales for the Science Laboratory Environment Inventory) in Phase I, it was not possible to replicate the a priori factor structure of each instrument scale. Scale reliabilities generally were acceptable. Phase 2, involving a sample of 375 Grades 4 and 5 students in four elementary schools, was necessary because questionnaires in Phase 1 had too few items to enable the researcher to establish satisfactory levels of reliability and validity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grade 4-5 mathematics students, hands-on activities, students' achievement, students' attitudes, students' perceptions, mathematics classroom environments</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing public participation in regional development : the case of Riyadh Regional Council</field><field name="creator">Alfaraj, Naif Faraj Saad</field><field name="description">This thesis examines public participation in regional development in Saudi Arabia at the local government level. The main objective of the study examines the current policies and practices of Riyadh Regional Council with regard to regional development, paying particular attention to the issue of public participation. Key decision-makers and decision locations are identified as focal points of policy development and implementation. The work begins from the premise that public participation is one of the key elements of effective regional policy that has so far been under-researched and consequently under-utilised in the Saudi Arabian context. The research opens by examining the national and cultural context of regional development in Saudi Arabia. It identifies and examines the relationship between policy development and the traditions and constitutional arrangements. These considerations are followed by an interrogation of the literature that reveals a range of concepts and perspectives on regional development and public participation. Of particular relevance to this study is the importance of the &#8216;institutional turn&#8217; in regional development and the role of public participation in enhancing the functioning of those institutions associated with regional development. Saudi Arabia has an economy that is largely dependent on revenues generated from the export of crude and refined petrochemicals. This places Saudi Arabia in a category of nations that are liable to suffer from the &#8216;resource curse&#8217;. The literature suggests that avoiding this particular phenomenon is in part dependent on having robust institutions. This firmly connects the research problem to previous research and provides a sound rationale for the conduct of the study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">regional development, Saudi Arabia, local government, Riyadh Regional Council, public participation, interpretivism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pullout behaviour of suction embedded plate anchors in clay</field><field name="creator">Song, Zhenhe</field><field name="description">In recent years oil and gas mining has moved into increasingly deeper water in search of undeveloped fields. As water depths approach and exceed 3000 m conventional offshore foundation systems become inefficient and ineffective in stabilising platforms and floating production storage units. The trend of supporting structure design in deep water has been to install catenary and taut leg mooring systems. Consequently, many types of anchoring systems are being developed and used in order to withstand large mooring forces. The SEPLA (Suction Embedded Plate Anchor) is ideal for use in this situation. This project has employed advanced numerical techniques and centrifuge testing to study pullout behaviour of plate anchor foundations in different soil profiles and suction caisson installation effect with the aim of generating a robust framework for design. The behaviour of strip and circular plate anchors during vertical pullout in uniform and normally consolidated clays has been studied by means of small strain and large deformation finite element analyses. Both fully bonded (attached), and &#8216;vented&#8217; (no suction on rear face), anchors have been considered. The current numerical results were compared with existing laboratory test data, finite element results and analytical solutions. This study showed that the ultimate pullout capacity factors (Nc) for deep embedment were 11.6 and 11.7 for smooth and rough strip anchors and 13.1 and 13.7 for smooth and rough circular anchors respectively. When the anchor base was vented, the soil stayed attached to the anchor base for deep embedment, and the pullout capacity was therefore the same as for the attached anchor. The separation depth ratio, Hs/B or Hs/D was found to increase linearly with the normalised strength ratio, su/&#947;'B or su/&#947;'D.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oil and gas mining, offshore foundation systems, platforms and floating production storage units, deep water, anchoring systems, SEPLA (Suction Embedded Plate Anchor)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Size exclusion chromatography as a tool for natural organic matter characterisation in drinking water treatment</field><field name="creator">Allpike, Bradley</field><field name="description">Natural organic matter (NOM), ubiquitous in natural water sources, is generated by biogeochemical processes in both the water body and in the surrounding watershed, as well as from the contribution of organic compounds that enter the water as a result of human activity. NOM significantly affects the properties of the water source, including the ability to transport metals, influence the aggregation kinetics of colloidal particles, serve as a food source for microorganisms and act as a precursor in the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs), as well as imparting a brown colour to the water. The reactivity of NOM is closely tied to its physicochemical properties, such as aromaticity, elemental composition, functional group content and molecular weight (MW) distribution. The MW distribution is an important consideration from a water treatment perspective for several reasons. For example, low MW NOM decreases the efficiency of treatment with activated carbon, and this fraction is thought to be the portion most difficult to remove using coagulation. The efficiency of membranes in the treatment of drinking water is also influenced by the MW distribution of NOM, while some studies have shown that the low MW fraction contributes disproportionately to the formation of bioavailable organic matter, therefore promoting the formation of biofilms in the distribution system. For these reasons, understanding the MW distribution of NOM is important for the treatment of natural waters for use as drinking waters. Optimisation of a high pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) method for analysis of the MW distribution of NOM in natural waters is described (Chapter 2). Several parameters influencing the performance of HPSEC are tested and an optimised set of conditions illustrated.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">natual organic matter, natural water sources, biogeochemical processes, organic compounds, drinking water, chromatography</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=18675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lumbar MRI abnormalities and muscle morphology, trunk kinematics and lower back injury in professional fast bowlers in cricket</field><field name="creator">Ranson, Craig A</field><field name="description">Lower back injury remains the most important injury problem in professional cricket with lumbar stress fractures in fast bowlers accounting for the most lost playing time. Previous research has associated workload, paraspinal muscle asymmetry and technique factors with lower back injury in fast bowlers, however, preventative strategies such as workload directives and coaching guidelines have not reduced the incidence and prevalence of these injuries. Recent developments in medical imaging technology have improved diagnosis of pathologies such as lumbar posterior bony element (partes interarticulares and pedicles) stress fractures and intervertebral disc degeneration in athletes whilst also allowing quantification of other, potentially associated factors such as paraspinal muscle asymmetry. However, there is very little published research regarding the use of modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the identification and prognosis of these types of injuries in fast bowlers. Similarly, advances in three-dimensional (3D) motion analysis has aided technique evaluation in a variety of sports, however, little remains known about the pathomechanics of lower back injury in fast bowling. Therefore, the aim of this doctoral research was to investigate relationships between lower back injury and; the MRI appearance of the lumbar posterior bony elements and intervertebral discs, MRI-derived lumbar muscle morphology and the three-dimensional (3D) trunk kinematics of professional fast bowlers in cricket. This was examined in a series of five studies. The first study undertaken was an investigation of the MRI appearance of the lumbar spines of 36 asymptomatic professional fast bowlers and 17 active controls.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lower back injury, lumbar MRI abnormalities, muscle morphology, trunk kinematics, fast bowlers, cricket players</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17693</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender Differences and the Effects of Cooperative Learning in College Level Mathematics</field><field name="creator">Olson, ViAnn Esther</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of cooperative learning in a liberal arts mathematics course and to examine any gender-related differences in the effects of cooperative learning in terms of achievement, composition of the cooperative groups, mathematics anxiety, attitudes toward mathematics, attendance, and retention. The quasi-experimental design compared a control section using individualized learning methods with three treatment sections using cooperative learning methods based on the Learning Together model of Johnson and Johnson (1991). The compositions of the three treatment groups varied: heterogeneous ability/heterogeneous gender, heterogeneous ability/homogeneous gender, and self-selected. The Academic Skills Assessment Program (ASAP) was used as a pre-test to show that the groups were equal. The Revised Math Attitude Scale and the Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (MARS) were used as pre- and post-tests to measure changes in attitudes and anxiety. Achievement was measured by individual and group course grades. Group grades were determined by taking 67% of a student's individual exam score plus 33% of the group's average on the exam. Cooperative learning and composition of groups had no significant effect on achievement. The differences between individual and group grades were insignificant, and the group grading method benefited the grades of only five students.

Schools in these communities are considered to be in poverty, they are largely populated by indigenous Australians, and situated in geographically isolated locations. It was important to establish the levels of student academic achievement and identify best school and classroom practices that centred on developing students' progress and achievement at school. The study was guided by the general research question: What are the effective ways school communities in the Kimberley work to improve student outcomes? Generating descriptions of best practices that make a geographical isolated school successful for students marginalised in the schooling process, and upon what criteria the success should be measured, were central to this research endeavour. It was critical to distinguish those dimensions of schooling in isolated areas that were malleable in improving the life chances of students. The study relied on an interpretive research methodology using both qualitative data and quantitative approaches to data collection, such as inquiry through conversations, informal and structured interviews, participant and non-participant observations, and the examination of material such as documents and students' work samples, complemented by a confirmatory survey and case studies. Participants in the study included school administration teams, teachers, students and their parents. The study was iterative and followed three distinct phases of development.

Professional agency is an element in the matrix representation of the philosophy of the degree programme. Relevant to this study a working definition of professional agency with regard to the practicum was articulated through a consultative process with early childhood colleagues and final year student teachers who were not involved in this investigation. Six student teachers volunteered to engage in this research. Their respective associate teachers and visiting lecturers also agreed to contribute to the investigation. All participants were interviewed by means of semistructured interviews before and after the final practicum. This process provided a total of thirty- six interviews, which were transcribed and analysed. The research was based in a constructivist-interpretive research paradigm with a view to understanding social reality as perceived by the research participants. The methodology encompassed a qualitative case study approach framed within Giddens' (1984) theory of structuration. Congruent with Giddens' theory the practicum was constructed as a social system and the relevant actors were identified. Subsequently, data analysis revealed the student teachers as actors who operated with agency. However, when the concept of professional agency was investigated only three of the six student teachers were deemed to have achieved all of the elements of the working definition. Pertinent to Giddens' theory the intersections of practice between the student teachers and their associate teachers and visiting lecturers were examined. This scrutiny illuminated factors that were perceived to have contributed to or detracted from professional agency.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">prac teacher, teacher training, learning environment.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13892</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors that affect the successful commercialization of intellectual capital</field><field name="creator">Brown, Christopher J.</field><field name="description">This research has investigated factors that affect the successful commercialization of intellectual capital. The concept of social constructs of meaning for the interview participants provides the fundamental perspective of this research. The research was undertaken on the basis of a constructivist ontology, the epistemology was interpretivist, and a qualitative methodology was used. A constructivist ontology was selected due to the research aim to understand the perceptions of the interview participants. The interpretivist approach provided the framework to interpret meaning of the perceptions in the appropriate business context. The data collection methods included unstructured interviews of people holding key decision making positions within their organizations. The conceptual nature of intellectual capital and commercialization enabled the research to be viewed from a phenomenological perspective and aspects of grounded theory were applied in seeking meaning from interviewee perceptions to surface a theoretical model. The data analysis included coding of the interview transcripts utilizing NVivo qualitative research software and sorting the data into nodes. The nodes represented categories of information which became the foundations of the constructs. These nodes were examined for relationship and meaning until a theoretical model emerged from the data. The findings culminated in six (6) main constructs which were subsequently aggregated to form a composite model of factors which influence the commercialization process.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">commercial value of intellectual capital, intangible assets.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seeing the light: an integrated design approach for Australian conditions</field><field name="creator">Crone, Simon Michael Dalrymple</field><field name="description">The field of lighting design is a highly specialised one. The control and manipulation of both natural and artificial light is a difficult aspect of building design. Proficient architects, interior designers and engineers must currently draw on their own experience and resources to evaluate their lighting designs. However, most often lighting design is overlooked and not fully understood by building designers. Those lighting designers that do have a good understanding of lighting are hampered by current conventional design methods when dealing with alternative and creative lighting designs. This is especially the case when dealing with natural daylight which tends to be under utilised, particularly in climatic areas that differ greatly from the European standard daylight design skies.There is clearly a need for a tool that enables building designers to quickly and accurately evaluate their use of localised natural light and specific artificial light in their building designs.The recent development of accurate, physically based computer models and the resulting photo realistic computer rendered images, can provide the basis of a platform for lighting designers to visualise their lighting designs. Such lighting platform enables designers to make more informed design decisions when looking at new approaches and unusual situations.The aim of this thesis is to explore and formulate a working example of such a lighting design platform, where by designers can easily evaluate lighting and daylighting designs based upon real world lighting and localised atmospheric conditions.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">natural light, computer modelling, lighting design.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intranet effectiveness and organizational commitment.</field><field name="creator">Weber, Paull C.</field><field name="description">The Intranet Pencil and Paper Checklist (Murgolo-Poore et al., 2002) is a new measure developed to gauge the perceptions of organization members as to the effectiveness of the firms Intranet, from an Internal Marketing and Human Resource perspective.

The literature provides strong evidence that the nature of the learning environment for females studying computing can be uninviting and may be influential in the low rates of female enrolments and retention compared with males. Studies indicate that the cultural norms and artefacts of computing, the minority status of women in computing courses, attitudes, language, experience and institutional context all contribute to a learning environment that proves unattractive and can be detrimental for some women. In recent years, there has been an increased enrolment by New Zealand educational institutions of new arrival students. Research suggests that new arrival students, who leave their home country to live and study in a foreign land, experience difficulties in their learning environment and often have problems adjusting to living and studying in their host country. This research used a mixed-method design to investigate first-year computer programming students' perceptions of their learning environment at three tertiary institutions in Wellington, New Zealand. A survey, the College and University Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI), was completed by 239 students, yielding quantitative data about students' perceptions of their Actual and Preferred learning environment.

The study involved the construction and validation of a learning environment questionnaire that was used by both parents and kindergarten students. Although the questionnaire was validated for use with five- and six-year-old kindergarten students, the same format was used for both parents and students. Prior learning environment studies (Fraser, 1998a) typically have involved the use of questionnaires neither by parents (with a notable exception being the recent study by Allen and Fraser, 2002) or by such young students. There is little doubt that, in just two decades, the field of classroom learning environment has progressed enormously (Fraser, 1998a) and that research involving qualitative methods and research involving quantitative methods each have made outstanding contributions to this overall progress (Tobin &amp; Fraser, 1998). A historical look at the field of learning environments over the past few decades shows that a striking feature is the availability of a variety of economical, valid and widely applicable questionnaires for assessing student perceptions of classroom environments (Fraser, 1998b). This learning environment study is significant not only because it involves very young students (kindergarten) and their parents, but also a classroom learning environment questionnaire was developed and validated in Spanish, for both students and parents.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">attitudes to science, very young students, science classrooms, learning environments.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13757</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The value of Acacia saligna as a source of fodder for ruminants</field><field name="creator">Howard, Delwyn M.</field><field name="description">Three pen trials were conducted to evaluate the value of A. saligna as a source of feed for ruminants. In Trial 1 A. saligna was inadequate as the sole source of nutrients for sheep. Furthermore, the level of detannification achieved in Trial 1, with the addition of PEG 4000 or PEG 6000, failed to improve the diet sufficiently. The antinutritional effects on the animals were largely attributed to the excessive biological activity of the phenolics in the A. saligna leaves. Feeding of these leaves, without PEG, had a definite defaunating effect on the ruminal fluid. The ruminal ammonia levels were all well below the threshold for maximal microbial growth. Given the results of Trial 1, the second trial was undertaken to determine if A. saligna was more useful as a supplement rather than a basal diet. The benefits of including A. saligna as a supplement to a basal diet of lupins and wheat straw were not clear. The benefits of including a detannification agent with the A. saligna were also not evident. Ruminal ammonia levels were much higher than in Trial 1 and animals generally maintained weight. Trial 2 revealed that the sheep were capable of consuming significantly more A. saligna than they did in Trial 1, but it was not clear whether this was due to the basal diet providing adequate nutrients or if it was due to differences in the A. saligna fed in the respective trials. Total phenolics, CT and PPC were considerably lower than those of Trial 1. Trial 3 was designed to investigate the use of A. saligna as the basal source of nutrients, with or without a supplement of N in the form of urea or PEG.

There is, therefore, the implication that effective learning requires some previous knowledge upon which to attach new concepts - and thus realisation of the importance of learning with respect to acquiring factual information as a prerequisite to learning new processes and/or skills. This issue has focussed my attention on the need to ensure that the more physiological skills of accessing 'memory', both for learning and recall, are optimised for maximum learning. Further, there are some indications that the physiological skills of memory access (storage and retrieval) may respond favourably to training and 'exercise'. This study was designed to find out whether or not a repeated 'exercise' using a simple memory enhancement technique would lead to a determinable and statistically significant increase in overall performance in a range of cognitive skills (as indicated by science and mathematics examination results), whether learning such a technique would affect a student's attitudes towards science, whether there was a relationship between the amount of time spent practicing the technique and the degree of effect, and whether the memory technique did actually improve the ability to recall lists of objects.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Although the analysis of data gathered during the course of this study did support an observation that there was a general increase in achievement in assessments, the improvement in results was not dramatic enough to be significant. No effect on attitudes towards science was evident. The data gathered concerning the amount of practice time proved to be insufficient to determine a trend. Within the limitations of the research, the data showed that the ability to remember a list of objects had been significantly improved, there was no clear evidence of transference of this ability to result in improved examination or assessment results.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=17778</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The construction of personal and professional boundaries in Australian social work: a qualitative exploration of the self in practice</field><field name="creator">Zubrzycki, Joanna</field><field name="description">The boundary between the personal and the professional self is a site of professional and personal creativity and tension, a space that reflects some of the key ontological and epistemological issues confronting social work. Exploring the social construction of the self through the stories of fifteen Australian social workers brings these issues into stark relief. The participatory and reflexive research process facilitated the development of knowledge about how a group of culturally diverse social workers construct personal and professional boundaries in practice.The need to explore these processes and relationships was predicated on a concern that while the self is generally recognised as shaping practice, there has been a paucity of attention given to what lived experiences constitute the self. Social work practice is broadly defined as a socially constructed profession, yet the personal and professional boundary is regarded as individually constructed and defined. This discourse neglects the influence of contextual, cultural, relational and structural dimensions of the self, thus denying the possibilities of practice being continually informed by a myriad of experiences.Recognising that the socially constructed self is situated within intersections of knowledge and meaning opens up possibilities for the development of dialogical practices within an ethics of care. The research also has implications for social work practice and education and for the way that we supervise and manage social work staff. Professional dialogue, debate and practice needs to reflect a diversity of experiences and recognise that the dominant discourse about boundaries and the self leaves many workers feeling that their practice reality is not a shared one.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">culturally constructed boundaries, professional identity, the self and boundaries, gendered boundaries.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The response of marine finfish and invertebrates to seismic survey noise</field><field name="creator">Fewtrell, Jane Leah</field><field name="description">The oil and gas industry is of major economic importance to Australia. Offshore seismic surveys are an essential component of exploration for fossil fuel reserves. Offshore seismic surveys involve the use of arrays of air-guns that produce repetitive high energy, low frequency sound. There is increasing concern about the effect that the noise generated by a seismic survey has on the surrounding marine life. Various species of captive marine fish and one species of squid were exposed to the noise from a single Bolt PAR 600 B air-gun with a 20 cui firing chamber and a source level at 1 m of 203.6 dB re 1 &#956;Pa mean squared pressure. Ten trials were conducted in Jervoise Bay and two were carried out off the coast of Exmouth. A different noise regime was used in each trial, however most involved the use of approach-depart scenarios to simulate an actual seismic survey and a 10 second duty cycle. Noise levels received by the animals ranged between 128 - 192 dB re 1 &#956;Pa mean squared pressure. Behavioural observations of the fish and squid were made before, during and after air-gun noise exposure. The physiological stress response of the fish was monitored by measuring plasma cortisol and glucose levels before and after noise exposure. The sensory epithelium was removed from the ears of the fish prior to, immediately after and up to 86 days after air-gun noise exposure and examined using a scanning electron microscope. No statistically significant physiological stress response in fish was detected as a result of the air-gun noise exposure regimes used. Significant damage to the ciliary bundles of the sensory epithelium of the sacculus was observed in pink snapper (Pugrus auratus) that had been exposed to air-gun noise between 144 - 191 dB re 1 &#956;Pa for 1.71 hours. No regeneration of the hair bundles was observed 58 days after exposure to air-gun noise.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">seismic survey, invertibrates, noise, finfish.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15125</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frequently bullied students: outcomes of a universal school-based bullying preventive intervention on peer victimisation and psychological health</field><field name="creator">Pintabona, Yolanda Christine</field><field name="description">Bullying occurs to some extent in all schools. Study 1 investigated and screened for frequently bullied students in a randomly selected and stratified sample of Year 4 students in 29 primary schools using multiple informants and a comprehensive measure of bullying. Using self- and/or parent-report, 16.3% of students were identified as frequently bullied, defined as 'about once a week' or more. There were no sex differences in the proportion of students identified as frequently bullied, however, frequently bullied boys were more likely to experience physical bullying and having money or other things taken away or broken. Self- and parent-report revealed significantly more depressive and anxiety symptoms, somatic complaints, and lower peer self-concept and general self-worth in frequently bullied students. Furthermore, a greater proportion of frequently bullied students experienced clinical levels of depressive, anxiety and/or somatic symptoms. The results clearly highlight the need for interventions that reduce and prevent the distress of frequently bullied students. In taking a universal approach to bullying intervention, it is important that the needs of targeted groups are not overlooked. In Study 2, a group randomised controlled trial with follow-up investigated the impact of the first year of a universal whole-school bullying preventive intervention, Friendly Schools, on the psychological health of frequently bullied students aged 8-9 years. The program utilised the Health Promoting Schools (HPS) approach to facilitate implementation of classroom curriculum, whole-school policy and practice, and partnerships with parents.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">effects of bullying, school bullying policy, preventing bullying.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=16785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Case Study of Design and Technology in the Early Years of Schooling</field><field name="creator">Rogers, Geoffrey Arnell</field><field name="description">Design, make and appraise (DMA) activities form a major component of the relatively new primary curriculum area of technology education.

The kinetics of soluble lipase was studied for establishing background of the lipase. The immobilization of lipase was adopted in order to repeatedly use the expensive lipase. The developed immobilization methods were based on the characteristics of carriers, but covalent bonding of lipase was preferred because of strong adsorption nature. Three types of materials, nylon membrane and polystyrene-divinylbenzene and silica gel beads, were used for studying the lipase immobilization characteristics. The lipase from Canada rugosa was chosen because of its relatively high catalytic activity and commercial availability. The oily wastewater sources used were a simulated mixture of olive oil and distilled water as well as actual restaurant oily wastewater. A packed bed reactor packed with immobilized lipase was suitable for the study. Moreover, a comparative study of anaerobic digestion of lipase treated and un-treated oily wastewater was undertaken to evaluate the efficiency of the lipase pre-treatment method due to lack of the relevant literature in the enzymatic wastewater treatment field. The kinetics of lipase catalyzed hydrolysis reactions was investigated in a stirred tank reactor. The experimental results confirmed that the lipase catalyzed reaction obeyed Michaelis-Menten model. The optimal pH and temperature of the lipase catalysed hydrolysis reaction were 7 and 37&#176;C, respectively. The conversion of oil to fatty acid was dependent on the reaction time and mass of the enzyme used. The lipase activities depended on the concentrations of some selected additives. Calcium ion improved lipase activity significantly amongst the additives used.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">enzymatic waste treatment, immobilized lipase, wastewater treatment.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=13326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radiometric processing of multitemporal sequences of satellite imagery for surface reflectance retrievals in change detection studies</field><field name="creator">Renzullo, Luigi John</field><field name="description">A relative, lie-value image normalisation (LVIN) procedure was investigated as a means of estimating surface reflectances from sequences of Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery, and standardising image data for change detection studies when there are uncertainties in sensor calibration and atmospheric parameters over time. The basis of the LVIX procedure is that for an A-date sequence, the digital numbers (DNs) of N-1 overpass images can be mapped to the reflectance values of a reference image for a set of pseudo- invariant targets (PITs) common to all images in the sequence. The robust M-estimator was employed to provide the transformation function that achieved the mapping. The investigation also showed that in some instances the LVIN procedure could incorporate the modelled Path DN-the modelled DN for a target of zero surface reflectance. A lack of surface validation data was a limitation in the investigation. However, a qualitative evaluation of the LVIN procedure was possible by examining the pre- and post-normalisation image histograms. In a comparison with the results of the 6S radiative transfer code, it war observed that when both overpass and reference images were acquired with the same sensor, the LVIK procedure appeared t o correct for atmospheric effects; and when overpass and reference images were with different sensors, the LVIN procedure also corrected for between-sensor differences. Moreover, it was demonstrated for the more "temporally-invariant" PITs that the procedure retrieved surface reflectances that were on average within &#177;0.02 reflectance units.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multitemporal analysis, satellite image data, radiative transfer, atmospherc physics.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors Affecting the Implementation And Use of Technology in Teaching Biology Courses in Florida's Community Colleges</field><field name="creator">Millen, James W.</field><field name="description">Students are constantly immersed in Hollywood glitz, MTV music videos and fastpaced television commercials. For "better or for worse" the movement to make communication a multimedia presentation is upon us. Educational technology -multimedia/Internet - is playing an increasingly important role as a teaching and learning supplement in modern classrooms and has been suggested as an avenue to improve science education. Potential benefits of the Internet, CD-ROMS, Videodiscs, WebCT, course web sites and other computer-based resources include increased communication among students and between instructor and students. Recently, although not a new idea for some, it has been demonstrated that for a significant number of students, learning occurs more readily if the material is presented visually as compared to verbally. Visual presentation is what multimedia is all about. Biology in particular seems to benefit from the application of technology in the classroom since rapid advances in the field make it nearly impossible for textbooks to remain current. Many biology instructors are seeking to take advantage of these benefits by using technology as an increasingly integral part of the teaching experience. This research involves an investigation into how multimedia and the Internet are or are not being used in the teaching of biology courses at the community college level in the State of Florida. A questionnaire was developed to elicit biology faculty perceptions of factors that encourage and those that inhibit their use of the Internet and multimedia in the classroom and in the laboratory.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education, science, multimedia, internet.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Students' Use Of Formal And Informal Knowledge About Energy And The Human Body</field><field name="creator">Mann, Michael Frank</field><field name="description">During the past three decades, much research has occurred into students' conceptions as well as factors influencing them and how the conceptions are formed. This study reports on students' conceptions involving energy and the human body. Initially, a number of student conceptions within the overarching area of energy and the human body were identified by developing and administering questionnaires to 610 students ranging from Year 8 through to Year 12. Students' responses to the questionnaire items resulted in previously identified conceptions as well as a number of unreported ones. The unreported notions included: carbohydrates are different to sugars; energy is needed for organs to function; fats and their role in energy storage; the eye and ear do not convert energy but transfer it to the brain; sweat cools the skin due to contact with air; objects need energy to start moving but not to move; and aspects of respiration and digestion. Conceptions such as the particulate nature of energy, energy's usefulness, conservation and transfer of energy, role of digestion and respiration, sources of energy were associated with previously identified notions which were derived from both informal and formal learning situations. But, it was not possible to distinguish which source knowledge was derived from. From these notions, a series of possible pathways for conceptual development within the area of energy and the human body were described. Further analysis of the data indicated a number of ontological changes that can occur as the student-cohort became older. These ontological changes included a decline in the notion of energy being particulate to being non-particulate and not being described, through to being involved in the chemical bonds of molecules, the role and processes of digestion, the number of energy types and energy sources and how the eye and ear function.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human body, formal knowledge, informal knowledge, student conceptions, energy, lesson sequence, intervention startegy, diagnostic instrument.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple Intelligences Learning and Equity in Middle School Mathematics Education</field><field name="creator">Young, Brian Edward</field><field name="description">This study offers a new approach to raising mathematics achievement through the synthesis of Multiple Intelligences theory and Self-Efficacy theory.

A mathematics learning program was developed for year eight students in a rural secondary school based on tasks resonating with their intellectual strengths. Both quantitative and qualitative indicators were used to compare the effects of the Multiple Intelligences learning program with the standard delivery of the mathematics curriculum to year eight students over their first term of study. After nine weeks participation in the Multiple Intelligences learning program, students demonstrated improved engagement and more positive attitudes in mathematics classes relative to their peers receiving standard instruction. The expected gains in mathematics achievement and self-efficacy were not demonstrated within the one-term span of the study. Assessment of the fidelity of implementation of the principles of Multiple Intelligences theory was confirmed through assessment of the classroom learning environment.

The new curriculum represents a crucial shift in emphasis from learners concentrating on formal and procedural mathematics (with an absence of meaning) to learners making meaning of mathematics and becoming flexible mathematical thinkers, with problem solving and mathematics investigations as central focus. This study reports on an action research collaboration between two teachers and myself, a university mathematics educator. It was conducted over a period of three years. The main purpose of our collaboration, and this thesis, was to explore mathematics teacher learning in the context of the OBE-based reforms. The data were gathered through questioning, journal keeping by the two teachers and my participant observations. Using the two teachers&#8217; reflective writings and field notes I analysed the data in two stages - narrative analysis and analysis of narratives. What emerged from the study were several issues clustered around three characteristics of teacher learning - teacher learning as situated, teacher learning as social and teacher learning as distributed. These three overlapping characteristics of teacher learning were used as heuristic devices or convenient organisers for the description, analysis and discussion of the issues that emerged. This study revealed several overarching propositions that may have applicability beyond its boundaries. The first proposition is that teachers reflect on and revise their personal practical knowledge if exposed to learning experiences that encourage them to attach meaning to and make sense of the underlying concepts of new curriculum reforms. The second proposition is that interactions with literature improve the quality of teacher learning.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teacher education, OBE curriculum, mathematics education.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15037</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aqueous film-coating with the ultra-coater (hybrid coater)</field><field name="creator">Kwok, Swee Har Teresa</field><field name="description">Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), which is available in different degrees of substitution and viscosity designations, is one of the most commonly used cellulosic polymers in aqueous film coating. It is relatively easy to process due to its non-tacky nature and has been known to produce smooth and clear films. For aqueous film coating, it is cost effective to use a coating formulation containing a high concentration of polymer without affecting the viscosity or spray rate and compromising on the quality of the film coat. Hence, it is ideal to use a polymer of low viscosity grade. The rheological properties of HPMC with various viscosity grades were determined. It was found that HPMC Methocel E3 had the lowest viscosity and was the least affected by the increase in polymer concentration. Additives can modify the film properties, including the glass transition temperature of the coating polymer. Glass transition temperature influences the viscosity of the coating solution and the mechanical properties, adhesion and permeability of the film coat. Various concentrations of different additives were incorporated in HPMC formulations to study the effect on these properties. Some long-chain fatty acids were included in the study to investigate if their hydrophobic carbon chains could retard moisture permeation of HPMC films. It was observed that HPMC films containing water-soluble additives produce films with clarity similar to those without additives, whereas those with hydrophobic additives tend to be patchy or hazy in appearance. A vinyl pyrrolidone / vinyl acetate copolymer (S630) was investigated for its influence on HPMC films, comparing the results with a commonly used plasticizer, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and another copolymer, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Intrinsic properties of the solutions, such as viscosity and glass transition temperature, were evaluated.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">film coating process, film coats, aqueous-based coating polymers.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=15059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accreditation of residential aged care facilities: experiences of service providers</field><field name="creator">Grenade, Linda Elise</field><field name="description">The need to address the issue of quality in aged care service provision in Australia has received increasing emphasis in recent decades. Particularly since the 1980s, the federal government has played a key role in ensuring that this is the case through the implementation of various reforms and regulatory strategies. In 1998, the national standards monitoring system which had been in place since the mid 1980s was replaced with a new system based on an accreditation model. In contrast to the former system which was wholly controlled by government and involved one-off inspections by government standards monitors, responsibility for managing the new system has been devolved to an independent body, the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency. One of the Agency's primary functions is to assess compliance with the accreditation standards. A key component of the new system is its emphasis on continuous improvement which has been incorporated into the accreditation standards. As a consequence, the new system requires a much greater level of involvement and commitment by providers than previously. In order to continue receiving government funding all facilities had to be accredited by January 1st 2001. This study represents an evaluation of the accreditation system based on the views and experiences of service providers in Western Australia. It explored a number of issues relating to the basic philosophy and principles underlying the new system, the implementation process, the accreditation standards that are used as a basis for assessing service quality and the overall impact of the system on providers. It also sought providers' views about the strengths and limitations of the system and any areas in need of change or improvement.

Such change has not just been in the way medicine is practiced, but also in the way the health dollar is spent. Hospitals have found themselves under constant and increasing pressure to not only reduce costs in relative terms, but also at the same time, provide new and expanded services. These pressures caused hospitals worldwide to closely examine the means by which they met the demands that were placed upon them (Royal Perth Hospital, 1994a; Asay and Maciariello, 1991). One common response was to embrace New Public Management strategies, such as devolved management. That is, to place the responsibility for managing diminishing health care resources, into the hands of those who use them the most - doctors (Chantler, 1993). To achieve this many hospitals adopted organisational structures known as clinical directorates (Chantler, 1993). Following international trends, the clinical directorate model was adopted by all of Western Australia&#8217;s public teaching hospitals in the mid 1990s. The belief was that by devolving hospital management to doctors, the clinical knowledge they possess will lead to improved clinical outcomes through the better allocation of resources. From the perceptions of Clinical Directors, Chief Executives, Nurse Managers, Business Managers and Department Heads, this research has developed a model, termed the Clinical Director Efficiency and Effectiveness (CD2E) model, that describes the dimensions of efficiency and effectiveness of Clinical Directors in the Western Australian public teaching hospital context.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">management of healthcare, clinical directorate model, public teaching hospitals, Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=115896</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utilising waste products from Kwinana industries to manufacture low specification geopolymer concrete</field><field name="creator">Slabbert, Michael Charles</field><field name="description">One technology that makes concrete without cement and does not have the associated carbon footprint is geopolymer concrete. This technology utilizes waste fly ash from power stations and mixes it with activating chemicals to form a binder with similar or better properties than cement. Not only does this technology directly reduce carbon emissions by replacing cement it also utilizes the waste bi-product from power stations and prevents it from going to landfill. Concrete is composed of coarse aggregates, sand and cementitious paste. It seemed possible to make geopolymer concrete from 100% waste. The aggregates would come from recycled concrete and hard brittle bottom ash from power stations, the sand would come from foundries and the fly ash binder would also come from the same power station as the bottom ash. All of these materials are waste and would all be dumped in landfill. Where would one find all these waste materials in one place? The industrial suburb of Kwinana outside Perth is home to a large number of industries producing all these wastes. To find products that have a specification that these materials would suit was a material with a relatively low specification, one such specification is the concrete masonry units&#8217; specification. For this to be adopted the mix design would then have to be altered to a drier type mix without any slump. As recycling facilities do not make a range of products it was decided to crush the aggregates in the laboratory specifically for this research and to blend all the waste materials. Numerous combinations were blended, analysed and assessed to establish which blends would best suit the aims and scope of this research. Eventually three blends were selected that encompassed all the waste products.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geopolymer concrete, concrete without cement, waste fly ash, power stations, carbon emissions</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=117996</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the central region of the sheep major histocompatibility complex</field><field name="creator">Qin, Jinyi</field><field name="description">The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a chromosomal region encoding molecules controlling adaptive immune response in vertebrates. In farm animals, many associations between MHC loci and productivity traits including disease susceptibility have been described. However, current knowledge about the structure and function of the MHC in domestic animals, especially sheep, is very limited. Characterization of the sheep MHC may potentially facilitate breeding for enhanced disease-resistant animals through use of marker assisted selection. The main aim of this project has been to provide insights into the organization of the genomic content of the central region of the sheep MHC. The work described herein has utilized subcloning of a sheep BAC genomic library in conjunction with DNA sequencing to generate a map of the central region of the sheep MHC covering &#8776;700 kbp. Within this map the relative order and identity of twenty five recognized loci were established. For some loci the intergenic distances were also determined. The final map is the most accurate map of this region reported to date and shows a high degree of similarity to the analogous region of the human MHC. This work has been published and a copy of the paper is included in Appendix 1. During the course of this work detailed genomic sequences were obtained for several sheep central region loci. Complete nucleotide sequences were generated for the complement factor B locus (CFB) and the TNF&#945; locus and a comparative analysis of these sequences confirmed their homology with other vertebrate orthologues.

Membranes are making an increasingly important contribution to meeting this need; however their performance is limited by fouling. This thesis reports on an investigation into the fouling of systems related to water treatment using the Direct Observation Through the Membrane (DOTM). The investigation focused on the measurement of critical flux and observation of particle behaviour under a variety of conditions and for a number of different particles. The range of meanings attributed to critical flux in the literature was analysed and several proposals made for the improved use of the concept. In particular, critical flux determination techniques were classified by whether they measure resistance changes or particle deposition; leading to the definition of Critical Resistance and Critical Deposition Fluxes. In this thesis the deposition definition is used exclusively. The effect of Reynolds number and spacer orientation on critical flux was correlated for spacer-filled channels. The heterogeneous deposition patterns observed with regions of heavy deposition next to areas of little or no deposition. This pattern was related to the local hydrodynamics of spacer cells (a few mm2 in size). The correlations developed for critical flux in spacer-filled channels were adjusted for submicron particle size and incorporated into a SpiralWound Module (SWM) leaf model and then used to simulate the fouling of SWM leaves under a range of operating conditions and operating policies. The Mass Balance technique of critical flux determination was also briefly assessed. The applicability of critical flux criteria to SWM arrays was discussed. Fouling, particle behaviour and critical flux were also investigated in air-sparged systems. The post-cleaning water flux was found to be enhanced when the membrane is fouled in the presence of bubbles. The rate of flux decline was reduced by bubbles. Critical flux increased with air flowrate, and decreased with increased liquid flowrate and concentration. Bubbles caused particles to periodically deposit on the membrane.

In the heated generational exchanges of the 1990s, feminists were cast according to age into opposing sides: old or young, mothers or daughters, second wave or third wave. These categories are limiting and the conflict harmful for feminist politics. In order to avoid these pitfalls, a theoretical framework is developed that draws on the work of Karl Mannheim and post feminist cultural analyses to elucidate the significance of popular culture in marking a generation. This framework then enables an examination of the way feminist discourses are played out in popular culture and helps explain young women&#8217;s complex engagement with feminism. This thesis brings together interviews with young Australian women and an analysis of two television programmes that exhibit post feminist characteristics: Sex and the City and Desperate Housewives. It examines the ways in which young women critically engage with these texts and explores popular culture as an arena where feminist discourses are contested. The era is characterised as post feminist because of the entanglement of feminism with popular culture, but it is also marked by the intersection of equality feminism with a neoliberal emphasis on individualism. Within this context, second wave feminist discourses of equality have slipped into the rhetoric of choice, which has important implications for feminist theory. The pervasive sense of choice and opportunity circulated by these discourses obscures the structural limitations that continue to affect women&#8217;s lives and demand that women make the &#8220;right&#8221; choices, build a successful career, find a suitable long-term partner, and become a good mother. This thesis mobilises post feminism as a valuable analytical concept that can be used to characterise the current generation of young women, not simply because they have grown up after the height of second wave feminism, but because the prevailing discourses of this historical moment reflect both continuity with, and a challenge to, earlier feminist debates. The mainstreaming of many feminist ideas and their reflection in popular culture provides the conditions for new forms of feminism to emerge.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feminist theory</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">women in popular culture</field><field name="subject">generation X</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">social conditions</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/37397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tones and vowels in Cantonese infant directed speech : hyperarticulation during the first 12 months of infancy</field><field name="creator">Xu, Nan</field><field name="description">In speech, vowels and consonants are two the basic sounds that combined result in lexically meaningful items in all languages. In tone languages, changes in pitch, tone differences also make meaningful lexical distinctions in spoken words. Young infants appear to have no trouble perceiving speech sounds and their production of sounds peculiar to their particular language environment proceeds relatively smoothly and rapidly compared with adults&#8217; acquisition of foreign languages. One way of looking at how infants come to acquire speech sounds of their first language is by examining the speech input they receive. The term infant-directed speech (IDS) has been coined to describe the special way adults and even older children speak to infants. IDS is different to adult-directed speech in various acoustic/phonetic modifications, such as exaggerated prosody, increased pitch and vowel hyperarticulation (Burnham, Kitamura, and Vollmer-Conna, 2002; Kuhl et al., 1997). The exaggerated prosody and increased pitch appear to be related to the expression of affect and gaining infants&#8217; attention (Burnham, Kitamura, and Vollmer-Conna, 2002), whereas vowel hyperarticulation appears to be related to infants&#8217; speech development for a number of reasons. Firstly, investigating how adults speak to foreigners, Uther, Knoll, and Burnham (2007) found that vowels are also hyperarticulated in foreigner-directed speech as in IDS, while other acoustic modifications such as exaggerated prosody and increased pitch, related to affective and attentional factors, are not present in foreigner directed speech. Secondly, Liu, Kuhl, and Tsao (2003) found a positive correlation between vowel hyperarticulation and infants&#8217; native speech perception; mothers who hyperarticulated their vowels more had infants who were better able to discriminate native consonant contrasts.\ While vowel hyperarticulation in IDS to 6-month-olds has been investigated in both tone languages such as Mandarin (Liu et al., 2003), and non-tone languages such as Russian, Swedish, American English (Kuhl et al., 1997) and Australian English (Burnham et al, 2002), no parallel studies have been conducted on the possibility of tone hyperarticulation in tone language IDS. If vowel hyperarticulation is related to infants&#8217; language development then tones in tone  hyperarticulated. The possibility of tone as well as vowel hyperarticulation in IDS of the tone language Cantonese, and the development of hyperarticulation across the first 12 months of infancy were investigated here using a longitudinal sequential cohort design. Two groups of native Cantonese mothers were recorded speaking to their infants, the first group at 3, 6, and 9 months, and the second at 6, 9, and 12 months. The study had four main aims (1) to investigate whether tone hyperarticulation occurs in IDS in a tone language Cantonese (2) to investigate whether vowel hyperarticulation occurs in IDS in Cantonese (IDS in this languages had not yet been investigated) and if 1 and 2 are the cases (3) to compare tone and vowel hyperarticulation, and (4) to chart the development of tone and vowel hyperarticulation across the infant&#8217;s first 12 months. Contrary to previous findings of vowel hyperarticulation in English Russian, Swedish, and Mandarin IDS to 6-month-olds (Burnham et al., 2002; Kuhl et al., 1997); vowel hyperarticulation was not found for Cantonese IDS. More detailed acoustic analysis examining different dimensions of the vowel space suggest that after the infant is 3 months old, mothers&#8217; vowels begin to be hypoarticulated in IDS compared to ADS on dimensions of back versus front, and high versus low. This pattern of results is consistent with vowel perception studies which suggest that infants have already tuned into the native vowel categories by 4 to 6 months (Polka and Werker, 1994). Tone hyperarticulation, on the other hand, was indeed present at 3 months and increased to peak at 6 to 9 months before declining at 12 months. This pattern of tone hyperarticulation across the first year of infancy is consistent with infant language development &#8211; in which attenuation of perception of non-native tones had been found between 6 to 9 months (Mattock and Burnham, 2006). Moreover, detailed phonetic analysis revealed that while the level tones are more hyperarticulated than the contour tones, tones with similar onsets and offsets (i.e., the two rising tones) are actually hypoarticulated in IDS at 9 and 12 months, a time when infants have already tuned into native tones. Finally, results from a preliminary native speech discrimination study using the same infants provide some initial indication that mothers who hyperarticulate tones more also had infants who are better able to discriminate native Cantonese consonants. Together these results suggest that in Cantonese IDS vowels are underspecified whereas tones are consistently over-specified particularly at 6 months when infants are tuning into native tones. Moreover, during this initial period of tone acquisition, only level tones are over specified while tones with similar onsets and offsets are underspecified. It seems likely that for Cantonese language environment infants, during the early stages of language acquisition, pitch information specified by level tones is sufficient for initial acquisition of information about the Cantonese tone space and that information about vowels is not so essential at this time. These studies show that there is indeed tone hyperarticulation in IDS in tone languages, and that in order to make sense of the vowel hyperarticulation data in tone languages, it is important to investigate both vowels and tones in tone languages with complex tone systems such as Cantonese, instead of simply applying Anglocentric notions of vowel hypoarticulation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cantonese dialects</field><field name="subject">tone</field><field name="subject">vowels</field><field name="subject">speech perception in infants</field><field name="subject">auditory perception in infants</field><field name="subject">language acquisition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/37423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of regulatory T cells and dendritic cells in allergen-induced airways hyperresponsiveness</field><field name="creator">Burchell, Jennifer Theresa</field><field name="description">Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is one of the primary features of allergic airways disease. Despite continuous allergen exposure atopic asthmatics do not develop progressively worsening AHR. The mechanism(s) that limit AHR are unknown. Two valid candidates are regulatory T cells (Treg) and antigen presenting cells (APC). Dendritic cells (DC) are the main APC within the airways. Presentation of allergens to T cells can result in the differentiation and expansion of different subsets of T cells including effector Treg cells. The precise role of Treg and DC in the attenuation of allergen-induced AHR remains unknown. The general aim of this thesis is to investigate mechanisms to limit AHR in a murine model of atopic asthma. Specific aims are to: 1. develop a murine model of allergen-induced attenuation of AHR, 2. determine the potential role of regulatory T cells (Treg) in allergen-induced AHR attenuation, and 3. determine the potential role of airway dendritic cells (DC) in allergen-induced AHR attenuation. Balb/c mice were sensitised with intraperitoneal Ovalbumin (OVA) in aluminium hydroxide and challenged with a single, 3-weeks or 6-weeks of OVA aerosols. Aerosols were 1% OVA in sterile saline delivered for 30 minutes for three days per week. Animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the final aerosol for measurements of lung function and Methacholine (MCh) responsiveness (low-frequency forced oscillation technique), collection of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum.   '...'  In contrast, 6-weeks of OVA challenges decreased Treg numbers back to control levels. Adoptive transfer of 1x106 Treg taken from DLN of 3-week challenged mice attenuated AHR in single-OVA recipients (p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, in vivo depletion of Treg in 3-week OVA challenged mice restored AHR (p&lt;0.05 compared with control). Similar proportions of CD4+ T cells became activated following both aerosol regimes, however total numbers of airway CD4+ T cells were decreased (p&lt;0.05), and OVA-specific CD4+ T cell proliferation in DLN was reduced (p&lt;0.05) after 3-weeks versus one OVA aerosol. Analysis of antigen handling by airway APC populations showed antigen uptake (OVA-647) and processing (DQ-OVA) by macrophages and airway DC subsets to be down-regulated (p&lt;0.05) after 3-weeks of OVA aerosols. In addition, adoptive transfer of Treg into single-OVA recipients did not affect antigen handling by airway APC populations. These data suggest that Treg are responsible for allergen-induced attenuation of AHR in vivo in established airways disease. AHR attenuation was associated with an altered function of airway DC, resulting in reduced antigen capture and processing, leading to limited clonal expansion of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells with limited production of Th2 cytokines. Furthermore, Treg were not directly responsible for the down-regulation of allergen capture in the airways. In conclusion, knowledge of the role of Treg and DC in attenuation of AHR could potentially result in improved and more directed therapies for the attenuation of AHR in atopic asthmatics.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Airway (Medicine)</field><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">Dendritic cells</field><field name="subject">Antigen presenting cells</field><field name="subject">Airway hyperresponsiveness</field><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">Regulatory T cell</field><field name="subject">Allergen</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mental toughness in Australian football</field><field name="creator">Gucciardi, Daniel F.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] At the commencement of this research project in February 2005, there was a paucity of empirical investigations that focused on understanding the psychological construct of mental toughness in sport (Bull, Shambrook, James, &amp; Brooks, 2005; Fourie &amp; Potgieter, 2001; Jones, Hanton, &amp; Connaughton, 2002). Although impressive, the available literature did little in offering consensus in terms of a definition and operationalising the construct in a consistent manner as well as understanding those factors contributing to its measurement and development. The absence of theoretically guided research, in particular, was noted as a major limitation of this research. The potential significance of mental toughness for performance excellence combined with the conceptual confusion and lack of rigorous empirical research highlighted the need for further research on mental toughness in sport. Accordingly, the purpose of this thesis was to examine issues pertaining to the understanding, measurement, and development of mental toughness in sport, using personal construct psychology (Kelly, 1955/1991) as the guiding theoretical framework. Australian football was chosen as the context to explore these issues. In the opening empirical chapter, two qualitative manuscripts in which Australian football coaches&#146; perspectives on mental toughness and those factors contributing to its development are reported. Three central themes for understanding mental toughness in Australian football were generated: characteristics (self-belief, motivation, tough attitude, concentration and focus, resilience, handling pressure, personal values, emotional intelligence, sport intelligence, and physical toughness); situations (e.g., injuries, success); and behaviours (e.g., superior decision-makers, consistent performance). '...'  In the final empirical chapter, two manuscripts in which the effectiveness of two different psychological skills training programs in enhancing mental toughness among youth-aged (15's) Australian footballers are reported. The first presents a quantitative analysis while the second presents a qualitative analysis. Multisource ratings (self, parent, and coach) of the AfMTI and self-reported resilience and flow indicated more positive changes in mental toughness, resilience, and flow than the control group. Similar patterns in the findings were evident across rating sources. Interviews with several players and one of their parents as well as the coaches generated their perceptions on the benefits of participating in the program (e.g., increased work ethic, tougher attitudes) and the processes by which the program had an effect (e.g., self-awareness; self-monitoring; self-regulation; and multi-perspective discussions) as well as suggestions for program improvement (e.g., parent and coach education programs). In summary, the results of the five studies presented in this thesis provide a comprehensive account of issues pertaining to the understanding, measurement, and development of mental toughness in Australian football. The findings are supportive of several aspects of previous research but also extend this line of inquiry in a number of ways. It is my hope that other researchers will be stimulated to engage in further research extending what is presented here and that practitioners will use this information to inform their professional endeavours.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sports -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Personal construct theory</field><field name="subject">Australian football</field><field name="subject">Positive psychology</field><field name="subject">Sport psychology</field><field name="subject">Multi-method research</field><field name="subject">Psychosocial development</field><field name="subject">Personal construct psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Restructuring partitioned knowledge : evidence of strategy retention in category learning</field><field name="creator">Sewell, David K</field><field name="description">A recurring theme in the cognitive development literature is the notion that people restructure their task knowledge as they develop increasingly sophisticated strategies. A large body of empirical literature spanning several domains suggests that in some cases, the process of knowledge restructuring is best characterized by a process of sequentially replacing old strategies with newer ones. In other cases, restructuring appears to be better characterized as a process involving changes in the way partial knowledge elements are selectively applied to a task. Critically, the former, but not the latter position, suggests that it may be quite difficult for people to revert to using an old strategy after restructuring has already occurred. The three experiments reported herein suggest that knowledge restructuring observed in experimental settings is aptly characterized by a process of strategy retention. Specifically, people are shown to readily revert to using an old categorization strategy even after demonstrably having restructured their knowledge, suggesting that knowledge is best conceptualized as having a heterogeneous structure. Formal modeling further supports this interpretation of the empirical results, and highlights the important role of selective attention in determining the manifest response strategy. The implications of these  findings are discussed in terms of an overarching mixture-of-experts framework of knowledge representation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Categorization (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Cognitive learning</field><field name="subject">Learning, Psychology of</field><field name="subject">Learning ability</field><field name="subject">Knowledge, Theory of</field><field name="subject">Category learning</field><field name="subject">Computational modeling</field><field name="subject">Knowledge partitioning</field><field name="subject">Knowledge restructuring</field><field name="subject">Mixture-of-experts</field><field name="subject">Strategy change</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How to find the one that got away : predicting the distribution of temperate demersal fish from environmental variables</field><field name="creator">Chatfield, Brenton Sean</field><field name="description">Knowing where species are and understanding why is paramount for developing relevant and sustainable conservation and resource management strategies. The need for this information is becoming urgent as fishing activity, resource extraction and the impacts of coastal developments continue to put marine resources under increasing pressure. As logistical and financial constraints can restrict our ability to collect data in the marine environment, the ability to predict distributions based on known associations with different environmental variables would enhance our capacity to manage these resources. Before attempting to predict the distribution of species and groups of species, the underlying species-environment relationships must be examined to determine whether associations between species and the environment can: (i) be identified, (ii) be used to develop models that can accurately predict distributions, and (iii) are general enough to allow accurate predictions beyond the sampled area. Most studies to date have compared the composition of fish assemblages between sites to determine how different environmental variables influence distribution. While widely applied, these methods do not consider how individual species respond to multiple environmental gradients and they lack the ability to predict distributions across different combinations of variables along those gradients. This lack of prediction also limits our capacity to assess what marine biodiversity is presently threatened by global, regional, and local human pressures on marine ecosystems. '...' Thus, summarising and modelling species data at higher levels would result in models with poorer predictive accuracy and a loss of ecological information. The generality of the species-environment relationships defined by the models were assessed by evaluating the transferability of models between different areas. Models developed from data collected over a wider geographic extent could more accurately predict the distribution of species across a smaller spatial extent than vice versa. This indicated that while general theories of the ecology of temperate demersal fish can be defined, the actual patterns of distribution may vary from site to site, suggesting caution when using predictions beyond the sampled area for management purposes. Overall, species distribution modelling identified how different species and groups of species responded to the combined influence of multiple environmental gradients and was able to accurately predict distributions based on the defined associations. Their application has led to a greater understanding of the species environment relationships and will help to identify those areas that may be important for conservation. Their predictive ability will allow general predictions of distribution of fish species across unsurveyed areas and provides the ability to assess the potential impact from implementing different policy and management strategies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Deep-sea fishes</field><field name="subject">Fishery management -- Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Fishery resources</field><field name="subject">Fishes -- Ecology</field><field name="subject">Species distribution models</field><field name="subject">Predictive modelling</field><field name="subject">Demersal fish</field><field name="subject">Species-environment relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Innovation in the Australian wool industry : a sensemaking perspective</field><field name="creator">Sneddon, Joanne</field><field name="description">Achieving the successful development, transfer and adoption of new agricultural technology is a popular issue in the innovation literature. Innovation diffusion and economic theory has informed this literature by emphasising the central role that technology attributes and economic rationality play in the adoption of new technology. In agricultural innovation context, research has traditionally taken a technological determinist perspective, assuming that technologies shape society and that all technological change is positive and progressive. As a result of limitations of the linear, determinist perspective of agricultural innovation to explain how new technologies are adopted and diffused, social constructivist approaches to agricultural innovation have emerged as a complement to this approach. However, a unifying framework of the social construction of new agricultural technologies has not been presented in the agricultural innovation literature. In this study Karl Weicks seven properties of sensemaking are used as the foundation for the development of a unifying conceptual framework for the examination of the social construction of agricultural technology. This thesis is a study of sensemaking in the context of agricultural innovation. It examines how participants in the Australian wool industry make sense of new technologies and how that sensemaking shapes their use of new technologies over time. The focal innovation initiative studied in this thesis is the development, transfer, adoption and abandonment of objective wool fibre testing technologies. This initiative commenced in the 1960s and has resulted in significant changes in the way that Australian wool is produced, marketed and processed. An interpretive research paradigm is adopted in this study. A theory-building case study approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis is used to capture the ongoing, iterative, enactive and social actions and interactions that occur throughout the agricultural innovation process. The case study is divided into three separate but interlocking empirical analyses which examine how industry participants' sensemaking shaped their use of wool testing technologies at the industry, technological system and individual farm level. The findings and implications of the three empirical studies in this thesis are discussed in relation to (1) the interpretation frameworks of agricultural industry participants and technology enactment, (2) the sensemaking process, (3) the social construction of shared technology frames, and (4) the social construction of industry belief systems. This study contributes to the debate on the social construction of agricultural technology and sensemaking in the innovation process by exploring the development, transfer, adoption and abandonment of new wool fibre testing technologies by industry participants over time. It builds on theoretical and empirical agricultural innovation and sensemaking research, and draws on a theoretical framework sensitive to the social construction of technology at the individual, group and industry levels. In doing so this study develops the concept of sensemaking in the agricultural innovation process as a way of deepening our understanding of how new agricultural technologies are transferred, adopted and diffused.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural innovations -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Psychology, Industrial</field><field name="subject">Technological innovations -- Management</field><field name="subject">Wool -- Marketing -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Wool industry -- Australia -- Technological innovations</field><field name="subject">Innovation</field><field name="subject">Wool industry</field><field name="subject">Sensemaking</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Incorporating complex systems dynamics in sustainability assessment frameworks : enhanced prediction and management of socio-ecological systems performance</field><field name="creator">Mamouni Limnios, Elena Alexandra</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The application of reductionism, breaking down problems to simpler components that can be solved and then aggregating the results, is one of the bases of classical science. However, living organisms, ecosystems, social and economic structures are complex systems, characterised by non-linear interactions between their elements and exhibit emergent properties that are not directly traceable to their components. Sustainability assessment frameworks oversimplify system interactions, achieving limited predictive capacity and causing managerial behavior that may reduce system's ability to adapt to external disturbance. Intrigued by the importance of complexity, we explore the central theme of how complex thinking can influence the understanding and progress towards sustainability. The purpose is to conceptualize the relationship of key terms (such as sustainability, functionality and resilience), and consecutively develop new or adjust existing sustainability frameworks to take into account complex systems interactions. We aim at developing theory and frameworks that can be used to raise awareness of the pitfalls of the growth paradigm and direct towards modest positions when managing complex systems. We seek to define the structural elements that influence system adaptive capacity, allowing identification of early signs of system rigidity or vulnerability and the development of knowledge and techniques that can improve our predictive and managerial ability. The focus has been on a variety of system scales and dynamics. At the collective community level, a number of stakeholder engagement practices and frameworks are currently available. However, there is limited awareness of the complexity challenges among stakeholders, who are commonly directed to a triple bottom line analysis aiming at maximizing a combination of outputs. An attempt is conducted to measure the functionality of the processes underlying a standing stock, in contrast to sustainability measures that only assess the variations of the standing stock itself. We develop the Index of Sustainable Functionality (ISF), a framework for the assessment of complex systems interactions within a large-scale geographic domain and apply it to the State of Western Australia. '...' Finally, we focus on smaller systems scales and develop a methodology for the calculation of Product Ecological Footprint (PEF) including elements from the accounting method of activity based costing. We calculate PEF for three apple production systems and identify significant differences from first stage calculations within the same industry. Cross-industry application will provide a practical way to link individuals' consumption with their ecological impact, reduce misperceptions of products' ecological impacts and develop a market-driven approach to internalizing environmental externalities. At the firm level PEF can be compared with investment costs, resulting in the opportunity to optimize both functions of financial cost and ecological impact in decision making. We have developed methods for incorporating complexity in sustainability assessment frameworks. Further work is required in testing and validating these methodologies at multiple system scales and conditions. Integrating such tools in decision making mechanisms will enhance long-term management of socioecological systems performance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economic development -- Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Environmental economics</field><field name="subject">Environmental responsibilty -- Economic aspects</field><field name="subject">Environmental risk assessment</field><field name="subject">Sustainable development -- Management</field><field name="subject">Sustainable development -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Product ecological footprint</field><field name="subject">Quantitative indicator</field><field name="subject">Strategic management</field><field name="subject">Complex systems</field><field name="subject">Resilience</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensitivity to correlation in probabilistic environments</field><field name="creator">Little, Daniel R</field><field name="description">Natural categories seem to be comprised of clustered stimuli that contain a myriad of correlated features; birds, for example, tend to fly, have wings, lay eggs, and make nests. Nonetheless, the evidence that people use these correlations during intentional category learning is overwhelmingly negative (Murphy, 2002). People do, however, show evidence of correlational sensitivity during other types of category learning tasks (e.g., feature prediction). The usual explanation is that intentional category learning tasks promote rule use, which discards the correlated feature information; whereas, other types of category learning tasks promote exemplar storage, which preserves correlated feature information. However, all of the intentional category learning tasks employed to examine correlational sensitivity to date have only used deterministic mappings of stimuli to categories (i.e., each stimulus belongs to only one category). The current thesis is concerned primarily with the effects introducing the probabilistic assignment of stimuli to categories on the acquisition of different types of correlational knowledge. If correlational knowledge depends on whether or not people selectively attend to the correlation then probabilistic reinforcement, which is predicted to increase attention shifting (Kruschke &amp; Johansen, 1999), should lead to increased correlational sensitivity. The first paper of this thesis confirms that selective attention provides a way to explain the presence or absence of correlational knowledge in different tasks. However, selective attention models have been unable to account for tasks in which people use the correlation between a non-relevant cue and regions of the category space to switch between the application of multiple rules. This phenomenon, known as knowledge partitioning, is explored in the second paper of this thesis. This thesis also extends the empirical implications of the first two papers to existing research (see included paper 3) and also provides recommendations of how utilize this conceptualization of knowledge for practitioners in the applied setting (see included paper 4). Finally, in addition to increasing attention shifting, probabilistic feedback is also assumed to result in an attenuation of learning over time (Kruschke &amp; Johansen, 1999); the fifth paper in this thesis provides empirical confirmation that people attenuate learning in response to unavoidable error.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Categorization (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Knowledge, Theory of</field><field name="subject">Learning, Psychology of</field><field name="subject">Categorization</field><field name="subject">Knowledge partitioning</field><field name="subject">Probabilistic feedback</field><field name="subject">Correlated cues</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Workplace bullying in Australian public service administrations</field><field name="creator">Hutchinson, Jacquie</field><field name="description">This is a study of workplace bullying policy in the public service. The research draws on interviews with policy actors from three groups located in four Australian states and one Australian territory. The groups are senior managers, policy implementors and employee advocates. The study is also informed by research and popular literature to examine how assumptions about what the problem is in workplace bullying dictates the direction taken in policy development. Unlike much of the research into workplace bullying that is based on psychological theorisations, this study is influenced by scholars who focus on the power imbalances that underpin workplace bullying. The key argument in this thesis is that the conceptual dominance of 'gender neutrality' operates to mask the gendered power imbalances which perpetuate bullying behaviour. Hence, to start to address workplace bullying, the effects of power must be acknowledged and addressed in the organisational policy responses to the growing phenomenon of workplace bullying. However, analysing the effects of power is insufficient if gender is not made visible in the analysis. The methodological touchstone for this is Carol Bacchi's 'whats the problem' approach (1999), which is taken further through feminist organisational theory, post modernist understandings of power realtions and a critique of New Public Management practices. The thesis shows how workplace bullying policies in Australian public service administrations have been carefully crafted as gender-neutral, and interweaves data and literature to develop a thesis for why such an approach is a deeply flawed outcome of gender politics. This thesis concludes with some modest suggestions about how organizations might more effectively develop more effective gender-sensitive approaches to workplace bullying.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bullying in the workplace -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Bullying in the workplace -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Public service employment -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maritime manoeuvring optimization : path planning in minefield threat environments</field><field name="creator">Muhandiramge, Ranga</field><field name="description">The aim of the research project that is the subject of this thesis is to apply mathematical techniques, especially those in the area of operations research, to the problem of maritime minefield transit. We develop several minefield models applicable to different aspects of the minefield problem. These include optimal mine clearance, shortest time traversal and time constrained traversal. We hope the suite of models and tools developed will help make mine field clearance and traversal both safer and more efficient and that exposition of the models will bring a clearer understanding of the mine problem from a mathematical perspective. In developing the solutions to mine field models, extensive use is made of network path planning algorithms, particularly the Weight Constrained Shortest Path Problem (WCSPP) for which the current state-of-the-art algorithm is extended. This is done by closer integration of Lagrangean relaxation and preprocessing to reduce the size of the network. This is then integrated with gap-closing algorithms based on enumeration to provide optimal or near optimal solutions to the path planning problem. We provide extensive computational evidence on the performance of our algorithm and compare it to other algorithms found in the literature. This tool then became fundamental in solving various separate minefield models. Our models can be broadly separated into obstacle models in which mine affected regions are treated as obstacles to be avoided and continuous threat in which each point of space has an associated risk. In the later case, we wish to find a path that minimizes the integral of the risk along the path while constraining the length of the path. We call this the Continuous Euclidean Length Constrained Minimum Cost Path Problem (C-LCMCPP), for which we present a novel network approach to solving this continuous problem. This approach results in being able to calculate a global lower bound on a non-convex optimization problem.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Path analysis (Statistics)</field><field name="subject">Submarine mines -- Detection -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Operations research</field><field name="subject">Constrained shortest paths</field><field name="subject">Path planning</field><field name="subject">Global optimisation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GIS based approach to economic assessment of residential flood damage at property level</field><field name="creator">Kamruzzaman, Khan</field><field name="description">Flood is one of the major natural disasters in Australia. It breaks down transportation and communication systems, disrupts businesses and causes damage to properties, loss of stock, crops and also loss of human lives. Better understanding of the impacts resulting from floods and other natural hazards can help to reduce the damages or losses. Flood damage assessment procedures estimate the impact of flood in monetary terms to help decision makers develop new policies, programs and development plans.      This study examines different techniques, procedures and underpinning philosophies that have been used in some major emergency management and insurance organizations in the world such as RAM, ANUFLOOD, and HAZUS and NHRC. From this examination the study finds that none of them are suitable for mitigation and emergency purposes in producing economic flood damage estimation at fine resolution with high accuracy. From this perspective the study develops a rigorous procedure for property level economic flood damage assessment. The assessment procedures are embedded within GIS (Geographic Information System) technology which can model and analyse the multidimensional phenomenon of flood and damage characteristics of residential buildings.      The damage estimation procedures developed in this study include flood modelling, collection and organisation of building inventory data; adopting a set of stage-damage curves; and measuring damage at property level. The quality of damage estimates derived from the procedures is highly influenced by quality of input data. The study also includes the implementation of the damage assessment procedure on the study area (a segment of Kororoit Creek and its adjacent area). The study uses data from a number of sources including Melbourne Water, NEXIS, VICMAP, a quick survey and literature.      The developed procedure will help many practitioners in flood loss assessment and natural hazard risk management to face the challenges they have in establishing damage estimates with high accuracy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flood model</field><field name="subject">flood damage assessment</field><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090403.160320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Working with parents and carers within psychodynamic child and adolescent psychotherapy</field><field name="creator">Widgery, Camilla</field><field name="description">This dissertation uses a modified systematic literature review to look at working with parents and carers within child and adolescent psychotherapy, and to consider this tasks relationship to therapeutic outcomes for children and adolescents. The topic is important because psychotherapy with children and adolescents inevitably involves additional relationships.  The literature indicates the way this undertaking has been regarded has varied through the history of psychodynamic child and adolescent psychotherapy. Numerous writers reflect on the ongoing neglect and absence of systematic thinking in relation to the task of work with parents and carers. This lack of attention is understood to have been influenced by the traditional model of child and adolescent psychotherapy where the source of the child or adolescent&#8217;s distress or difficulty was regarded as being primarily intrapsychic. What is now known regarding the current and active nature of the child or adolescent&#8217;s relationship with the parent or carer, and the power and persistence of the parent-child bond has resulted in an acknowledgement of the need for a more equitable balance of focus between internal and external factors. In acknowledging that the external can no longer be seen as peripheral there are compelling clinical reasons to work with parents and carers. This undertaking should not be seen as dependant on the therapist&#8217;s orientation or interest. The significant scope of possibilities for work with parents and carers within child and adolescent psychotherapy is explored; however there is a lack of data relating to the clinical effectiveness of these approaches. The future need is for systematic thinking, and the development of practice guidelines for this clinical task.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Modified systematic literature review</field><field name="subject">Transgenerational issues</field><field name="subject">Parent therapy</field><field name="subject">Parent child psychotherapy</field><field name="subject">Psychotherapy of parenthood</field><field name="subject">Parent therapist alliance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal source coding with signal transfer function constraints</field><field name="creator">Derpich, Milan</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">source coding</field><field name="subject">differential pulse-coded modulation</field><field name="subject">filter banks</field><field name="subject">rate-distortion theory</field><field name="subject">signal processing, quantization</field><field name="subject">sigma-delta converters</field><field name="subject">oversampling</field><field name="subject">image processing</field><field name="subject">causality</field><field name="subject">feedback</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/34249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A unified framework for the analysis and design of networked control systems</field><field name="creator">Silva, Eduardo</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">networked control systems</field><field name="subject">quantization</field><field name="subject">signal to noise ratio</field><field name="subject">optimal control</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/34256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parenthood and mental illness: a sociological journey through silenced experiences of illness</field><field name="creator">Boursnell, Melanie Suzanne</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philisophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parenthood</field><field name="subject">mental illness</field><field name="subject">family</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/34263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using evidence to inform equity assessment in health services</field><field name="creator">Stewart Williams, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">equity</field><field name="subject">health inequalities</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">health services research</field><field name="subject">evidence based</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/34270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monsters in our minds : the myth of infanticide and the murderous mother in the cultural psyche</field><field name="creator">Scher, Ingrid Lana, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">If, as author Toni Morrison believes, we tell stories about what we find most terrifying, then our cultural narratives suggest an overwhelming preoccupation with the murderous mother ??? the monster in our minds. This dissertation examines some of the most powerful and enduring stories told about the murderous mother and considers how these stories are shaped by the unconscious fears and fantasies that dominate the cultural psyche. Revolving around the idea of infanticide as an ???imaginary??? crime, this dissertation uncovers the psychoanalytic foundations of the obsessive telling and consumption of stories of maternal child-murder in Western culture and contends that infanticide narratives can be read as symptoms of psychocultural dis(-)ease. Underlying all stories about the murderous mother is an unconscious fear of infanticide and fantasy of maternal destructiveness that is repressed in the individual psyche. These fears and fantasies are expressed in our cultural narratives. Chapter 1 examines fairytales as the literary form that most clearly elaborates individual fears and psychic conflict and locates the phantasmic murderous mother within psychoanalytic narratives of individuation. Chapter 2 shows how individual fears and fantasies of maternal monstrosity are transferred to society and revealed in the myths through which our culture is transmitted. Chapters 3 and 4 focus on the particular neuroses of ancient Greek society and early modern culture and consider stories of the murderous mother that most powerfully reflect anxieties of maternal origin and fantasies of maternal power. Chapters 5 and 6 shift to a contemporary setting and consider stories that reveal, in differing ways, how the murderous mother haunts the cultural psyche. Examining a variety of texts and drawing material from a spectrum of disciplines, including law, literature, criminology, theology, philosophy, and medicine, this dissertation concludes that it is only by exposing the underpinnings of our cultural stories about the murderous mother that we can hope to break free from the unconscious attitudes that imprison us. Emerging from this study is an original and important theoretical framework concerning conceptualisations of infanticide, the ways in which we imagine maternal child-murder and the limits of that imagination, and how we might escape the murderous maternal monster buried deep in the labyrinths of the mind.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infanticide</field><field name="subject">mothers</field><field name="subject">folklore</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">mythology</field><field name="subject">women murderers</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">archetype</field><field name="subject">archetypes in civilization</field><field name="subject">myth</field><field name="subject">psychoanalysis and culture</field><field name="subject">psychoanalysis and folklore</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Communities out of joint: A consideration of the role of temporality in rethinking community</field><field name="creator">Bastian, Michelle Harmonie, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis brings together two important aspects of Feminist Theory, the problem of reconceptualising community in terms of difference, and the role of temporality and futurity within feminist visions of the political. I argue that rethinking community directly entails a rethinking of temporality. This is initially suggested in my examination of the work of anthropologists Carol Greenhouse and Johannes Fabian, who argue that conceptions of time play an important role in social methods of ??managing?? difference. I then turn to an analysis of a number of different feminist accounts of community in order to show that, in each case, the attempt to rethink community in terms of an openness to diversity is invariably accompanied by a contestation of dominant linear temporal concepts. I suggest that these accounts represent a shift to an understanding of time as fractured, dislocated or out of joint. While this shift is explicit in some of the work I examine, specifically in Linnell Secomb and Rosalyn Diprose??s work, for the most part, the problem of temporality is not explicitly thematised. I therefore seek to uncover an emerging critique of linear temporality within feminist accounts of community, while also arguing for a greater recognition of the way time systems shape the way we understand and relate to difference. In order to extend the contestation of linear temporality developed in the first section, I turn to the work of Jacques Derrida. I extend the gesture towards a dislocated time by examining Derrida??s deconstruction of Aristotle??s account of time and his quasi-concept, diff??rance. Both of these accounts challenge the self-presence of the now. What proves to be particularly important for the problem of community is the way this fundamental dislocation suggests a reworking of social understandings of the heritage, transformation and political action. This suggestion is developed through an analysis of two of Derrida??s later essays ??The Other Heading?? and ??Psyche: Inventions of the other??, where I draw out his claim that an openness to the coming of the other involves both the active disruption of convention and tradition as well as a passive relation to an open and incalculable future. I conclude this thesis by arguing that Derrida??s account of time, as a disruptive exposure to alterity, is a provocative candidate for a model of temporality congenial to feminist projects of reconceptualising community. Accordingly, this thesis makes a unique contribution to feminist theory by connecting two significant but often separate concerns, in the process providing new avenues for feminist theorisations of community.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Derrida</field><field name="subject">Community</field><field name="subject">Feminist theory</field><field name="subject">Temporality</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41489</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and application of an evaluation framework for injury surveillance systems</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Rebecca Jane, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Information from injury data collections is widely used to formulate injury policy, evaluate injury prevention initiatives and to allocate resources to areas deemed a high priority.  Obtaining quality data from injury surveillance is essential to ensure the appropriateness of these activities.  This thesis seeks to develop a framework to assess the capacity of an injury data collection to perform injury surveillance and to use this framework to assess the capacity of both injury mortality and morbidity data collections in New South Wales (NSW) Australia to perform work-related or motor vehicle crash (MVC)-related injury surveillance.  An Evaluation Framework for Injury Surveillance Systems (EFISS) was developed through a multi-staged process, using information from the literature to identify surveillance system characteristics, SMART criteria to assess the suitability of these characteristics to evaluate an injury data collection, and by obtaining feedback on the characteristics from a panel of surveillance experts using a two round modified Delphi study.  At the conclusion of development, there were 18 characteristics, consisting of 5 data quality, 9 operational, and 4 practical characteristics, that were identified as important for inclusion within an EFISS.  In addition, a rating system was created for the EFISS characteristics, based on available evidence and reasonable opinion.  The evaluation of six injury data collections using the EFISS for their capacity to perform either work- or MVC-related injury surveillance illustrated the inability of any of the data collections to enumerate all cases of either work- or MVC-related injury mortality or morbidity in NSW or to capture all of the data considered necessary for work- or MVC-related injury surveillance.  This evaluation has identified areas for improvement in all data collections and has demonstrated that for both work- and MVC-related injury surveillance that multiple collections should be reviewed to inform both work- and MVC-related policy development and injury prevention priority setting in NSW.  The development of an EFISS has built upon existing evaluation guidelines for surveillance systems and provides an important step towards the creation of a framework specifically tailored to evaluate an injury data collection.  Information obtained through an evaluation conducted using an EFISS would be useful for agencies responsible for injury data collections to identify where these collections could be improved to increase their usefulness for injury surveillance, and ultimately, for injury prevention.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">framework</field><field name="subject">injury surveillance</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generalisations of the fundamental theorem of projective geometry</field><field name="creator">McCallum, Rupert Gordon, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The fundamental theorem of projective geometry states that a mapping from a projective space to itself whose range has a sufficient number of points in general position is a projective transformation possibly combined with a self-homomorphism of the underlying field.

At the same time, this thesis also presents evidence for a new concept of neo-normativity, where the stereotypical is normalised, both internally and externally, and actively reproduced. Neo-normativity, in turn, succeeds in explaining the many abjected relationships that between non-heterosexual communities and the stereotypical and quintessentialised performances. At the 2005 SGLMG parade such quintessentialised (or neo-normalised) performances were treated with both contempt - for being stereotypical and narrowly representative of the very diversity of non-heterosexual communities - as well as a tool for attracting commercial sponsorships which have growingly become an integral part to the continued survival of the annual parade. On a different level, another expression of abject was also revealed when these neo-normalised performances are persistently criticised by academics, news reporting and official photography for being stereotypical and non-representative which in itself are both a recognition as well as an ejection of the non-normative aspects of non-heterosexualities. Such an expression of abject was also evident in latrinalia found in several public toilet facilities throughout Greater Sydney were the interplay of desire and ejection were played out in a more covert manner, all the while highlighting the marginality of non-heterosexualities in these presumably heteronormative spaces. This application of abject theory emphasises neo-normative performances as permanently peripheral, a marginality of which makes these performances (and identities) intrinsically Queer.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Latrinalia</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">Mardi Gras</field><field name="subject">Abjection</field><field name="subject">Queer</field><field name="subject">performativity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructive neural networks : generalisation, convergence and architectures</field><field name="creator">Treadgold, Nicholas K., Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Feedforward neural networks trained via supervised learning have proven to be successful in the field of pattern recognition. The most important feature of a pattern recognition technique is its ability to successfully classify future data. This is known as generalisation. A more practical aspect of pattern recognition methods is how quickly they can be trained and how reliably a good solution is found. Feedforward neural networks have been shown to provide good generali- sation on a variety of problems. A number of training techniques also exist that provide fast convergence. Two problems often addressed within the field of feedforward neural networks are how to improve thegeneralisation and convergence of these pattern recognition techniques. These two problems are addressed in this thesis through the frame- work of constructive neural network algorithms. Constructive neural networks are a type of feedforward neural network in which the network architecture is built during the training process. The type of architecture built can affect both generalisation and convergence speed. Convergence speed and reliability areimportant properties of feedforward neu- ral networks. These properties are studied by examining different training al- gorithms and the effect of using a constructive process. A new gradient based training algorithm, SARPROP, is introduced. This algorithm addresses the problems of poor convergence speed and reliability when using a gradient based training method. SARPROP is shown to increase both convergence speed and the chance of convergence to a good solution. This is achieved through the combination of gradient based and Simulated Annealing methods. The convergence properties of various constructive algorithms are examined through a series of empirical studies. The results of these studies demonstrate that the cascade architecture allows for faster, more reliable convergence using a gradient based method than a single layer architecture with a comparable num- ber of weights. It is shown that constructive algorithms that bias the search direction of the gradient based training algorithm for the newly added hidden neurons, produce smaller networks and more rapid convergence. A constructive algorithm using search direction biasing is shown to converge to solutions with networks that are unreliable and ine??cient to train using a non-constructive gradient based algorithm. The technique of weight freezing is shown to result in larger architectures than those obtained from training the whole network. Improving the generalisation ability of constructive neural networks is an im- portant area of investigation. A series of empirical studies are performed to examine the effect of regularisation on generalisation in constructive cascade al- gorithms. It is found that the combination of early stopping and regularisation results in better generalisation than the use of early stopping alone. A cubic regularisation term that greatly penalises large weights is shown to be benefi- cial for generalisation in cascade networks. An adaptive method of setting the regularisation magnitude in constructive networks is introduced and is shown to produce generalisation results similar to those obtained with a fixed, user- optimised regularisation setting. This adaptive method also oftenresults in the construction of smaller networks for more complex problems. The insights obtained from the SARPROP algorithm and from the convergence and generalisation empirical studies are used to create a new constructive cascade algorithm, acasper. This algorithm is extensively benchmarked and is shown to obtain good generalisation results in comparison to a number of well-respected and successful neural network algorithms. A technique of incorporating the validation data into the training set after network construction is introduced and is shown to generally result in similar or improved generalisation. The di??culties of implementing a cascade architecture in VLSI are described and results are given on the effect of the cascade architecture on such attributes as weight growth, fan-in, network depth, and propagation delay. Two variants of the cascade architecture are proposed. These new architectures are shown to produce similar generalisation results to the cascade architecture, while also addressing the problems of VLSI implementation of cascade networks.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural networks Computer science</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An ado/aptive reading and writing of Australia and its contemporary literature; The metaphor of an adopted body.</field><field name="creator">Dunne, Catherine Margaret</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Literary Theory</field><field name="subject">Adoption</field><field name="subject">Australian Literature</field><field name="subject">Peter Carey</field><field name="subject">Janette Turner Hospital</field><field name="subject">Luke Davies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/2320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Panics and Principles: A History of Drug Education Policy in New South Wales 1965-1999</field><field name="creator">Pettingell, Judith Ann</field><field name="description">PhD</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug Education Policy History Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ANDROGENS INDUCE GENDER- &amp; DOSE- SPECIFIC EFFECTS ON ATHEROGENESIS</field><field name="creator">Sharp, Danae Maree</field><field name="description">Master of Science in Medicine</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">atherosclerosis</field><field name="subject">androgens</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Midges (Chironomidae: Diptera) in Australian freshwater lakes and upland streams</field><field name="creator">Wright, Ian A.</field><field name="description">This thesis revealed Australian lakes to be richer in chironomid (Diptera: Insecta) species than was previously recognised. A methodology for the collection of chironomid exuviae from lakes was developed using a 12-month study of exuviae from a single lake, Lake McKenzie, Jervis Bay. The method is a rapid and effective way to produce an inventory of species living within a lake. In addition, a distinct biogeographical pattern was detected for chironomid species from a survey of chironomids from southern and eastern Australian freshwater lakes. Geographical location of the lake was more influential on the distribution of chironomid species than was the type of lake. The majority of lake dwelling chironomid species in this investigation were restricted to lakes within one of four geographic lake regions; Tasmania, south-eastern Australian mainland, Fraser Island or tropical north Queensland. A temporal investigation of chironomid exuviae was conducted on a pair of small upland Blue Mountain waterways. Abundance and species richness of exuviae exhibited diurnal patterns. A chemical and macro-invertebrate survey of zinc and sewage organic waste discharges to upland streams in the Blue Mountains detected marked ecological impairment. Macro-invertebrate families responded in different ways to the two different types of waste discharge. According to the family-level results, chironomid larvae responded negatively (reduced abundance) to the zinc pollution and positively (increased abundance) to the sewage pollution. Another major finding from this thesis was that chironomid species assemblages, in the streams surveyed, were strongly impaired by zinc-contaminated mine drainage and sewage effluent. This differed to the family-level larval results. This thesis provided the first Australian evidence that many chironomid species are intolerant of heavy-metal pollution. This research also revealed further evidence that many chironomids species are intolerant of sewage pollution.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">midges</field><field name="subject">aquatic ecology</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">chironomidae</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">diptera</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/16095</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of empowerment in the wellbeing of cancer patients</field><field name="creator">Bulsara, Caroline E.</field><field name="description">The concept of patient empowerment, although acknowledged by the medical community as important, is rarely understood and seldom given priority in the illness trajectory of the cancer patient. A pilot study of a Shared Care Model amongst haematological cancer patients highlighted the fact that some patients spoke of a sense of empowerment and an overall sense of greater control when more fully included in the treatment and management of their condition. The research which forms the basis of this thesis focused on the role of empowerment in the wellbeing of cancer patients. There were three objectives to be met by completing this research. Firstly, to demonstrate that empowerment is a uniquely identifiable concept and can be measured separately from other quality of life indicators. Secondly, the study sought to explore that concept that empowerment takes into account the way in which patients act upon their prognosis and optimise the outcomes of treatment. Thus it is believed that accessing tailored resources and support structures benefit cancer patients and those who are caring for them such as close family members and friends by helping the patient achieve an individual level of empowerment. Finally, the research sought to explore the concept that empowerment improves psychological outcome in patients. The benefits are increased empowerment and an active use of coping strategies amongst patients in order to regain a measure of control over their illness. The Patient Empowerment Scale was developed to measure empowerment as an individual construct. '...'  The Patient Empowerment Scale (15 items) was shown to be a reliable measure of empowerment and fitted the model well. A qualitative methodological approach sought to address and explore the second and third concepts. In addition, the concept of empowerment as it relates to motivation and self-efficacy was investigated qualitatively using in-depth interviewing technique. A phenomenological methodology was used to explore the 'lived experience of cancer patients' in regard to regaining control of their illness and the management thereof. Participants were interviewed using concepts identified for the Patient Empowerment Scale such as support strategies and use of resources. A series of interviews with breast cancer patients were conducted whereby patients responded to a number of questions. The questions explored areas such as support mechanisms in relation to cancer, their relationships with health professionals and significant others and their attitude toward and use of other resources and support systems such as support groups, spirituality, complementary therapies. In addition their views on acceptance and adaptation to their altered health status were explored. Results The research confirmed that it is feasible to measure empowerment as a separate quality of life indicator. Furthermore, that empowerment is linked to motivation and self-efficacy beliefs. The research also demonstrated that there are a number of core areas which are fundamental to regaining control and increasing empowerment for patients. These core areas are linked to support mechanisms, willingness to adapt and to access resources tailored to meet their needs. Patient empowerment emerged as a key aspect of enhanced quality of life regardless of prognosis and improved psychological outlook.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer -- Patients -- Psychology</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Treatment -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Patient empowerment</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Rasch models</field><field name="subject">Psychosocial oncology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making a Difference?  Exploring the impact of privately owned Registered Training Organisations in the Victorian VET system.</field><field name="creator">McPhee, Joan Melville</field><field name="description">This research investigates how the nature and scope of vocational education and training (VET) in Victoria has changed as a result of legislation passed in 1990 to enable privately owned Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) to provide government accredited training.      An interpretive paradigm and multiple data gathering techniques have been applied. These included the examination of primary historical and economic documents which demonstrated why the VET system changed in Australia and quantifiable statistics which illustrated how the system changed over the period covered; from 1990/1 to 2002/3. Semi-structured interviews with a purposeful sample of 21 RTOs  assisted in exploring the impact of the entry of privately owned RTOs into the Victorian training market. The wide experience and in-depth knowledge of the VET sector by the researcher acted as an underpinning device.      The evidence from my interviews illustrated how the privately owned RTOs in my sample provided relevant, customised and contextualised training, differentiated their services to ensure they met client needs, responded rapidly to changes in demand and exhibited considerable adaptability in their arrangements for training delivery. This adaptability extended, amongst other things, to the location, timing and mode of delivery.      It became apparent that the increased diversity found, had unintended consequences.  These included an increase in the perceived complexity of the VET sector for those working within it and adversely affecting the extent to which national consistency has been achieved.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Competition</field><field name="subject">Client Satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Policy Analysis</field><field name="subject">Private Training Provider</field><field name="subject">Quality</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090407.101914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Integration of ASEAN5 Equity Markets, GDP and Trade and their Relationships with Asset Pricing</field><field name="creator">Md Nor, Zarina</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on five of the founding nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The countries are Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines (ASEAN5). Asset pricing for the ASEAN5 equity markets is the main focus of this thesis, although we also develop vector error correction models (VECM) for GDP, trade and local equity market returns for the ASEAN5. While this allows further analysis of the robustness of asset pricing models, it also facilitates study of the fundamental links that exist within these economies.     	The traditional CAPM and the four factor-model that include market, size, value and momentum effects (Fama and French, 1993; Carhart, 1997) are employed in testing the variation in size/book-to-market equity (size-BTME) and industry portfolio returns for these markets for the period from January 1990 to March 2006. Three macro factors as well as world excess returns are then added to the basic four-factor asset pricing model. These macro factors include unexpected GDP, unexpected total trade and unexpected equity market returns, which are derived from VECM or VAR estimates for ASEAN5 GDP, total trade and equity market returns. This model is referred to as the macro-factor model.    	The results suggest that the explanatory power of the four-factor model consistently exceeds those of the one-factor CAPM in explaining size-BTME and industry portfolio returns. Further, the macro-factor model analysis suggests that collectively, this model does not substantially improve the explanatory power of the basic four-factor model, suggesting that the variation in portfolio returns is mostly captured by the four-factor model. There is some cross-country variation in these results. Regardless, these macro factors &#8722; taken as a group or individually &#8722; are statistically significant, particularly for Thailand and Malaysia.     	 In addition, the cointegration test results document evidence of long-run linkages for the equity markets within the ASEAN5. This is also true for GDP within the ASEAN5. In both cases, closer links prevail in the post-crisis period. This is not the case for trade where there is little consistent evidence of close links between the countries. Mixed results are found for different ASEAN5 trade measures where the linkages for total trade, import and exports vary substantially according to the selected period of study, whether full period, pre-crisis or post-crisis period.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ASEAN integration</field><field name="subject">Equity Markets</field><field name="subject">GDP</field><field name="subject">Trade</field><field name="subject">VECM</field><field name="subject">Asset Pricing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090407.120156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection of Enteric Bacteria in Raw Food Samples from Vietnam and Evaluation of Antibiotic Resistance</field><field name="creator">Van, Thi Thu Hao</field><field name="description">This study was conducted to examine the rate of contamination and molecular characteristics of enteric bacteria isolated from a selection of food sources in Vietnam.    One hundred and eighty raw food samples were tested and 60.8% of meat and 18.0% of shellfish samples were found to be contaminated with Salmonella spp. which belonged to variety of serogroups and serotypes. More than 90% of all food sources contained Escherichia coli and 32% of 50 shellfish samples were contaminated with Vibrio parahaemolyticus. PFGE was used to determine the degree of relatedness of Salmonella spp. There were 33 distinct PFGE patterns from 51 Salmonella spp. isolates tested, indicating that PFGE could be used as an alternative method for serotyping for use in epidemiology of Salmonella spp.    Susceptibility of the isolates to 15 antimicrobial agents was investigated. Moderate to high frequencies of resistance to antibiotics were observed in Salmonella spp. and E. coli isolates and multi-resistance, defined as resistance to at least 4 antibiotics, was observed. All of the V. parahaemolyticus isolates were resistant to ampicillin/amoxicillin but not to other antibiotics. Betalactam TEM gene and tetracycline resistance tetA, tetB genes were widely distributed in both E. coli and Salmonella spp. isolates. Other resistance genes, including sulI, cmlA, aadA, aphA1, dhfrV, and aac(3)-IV were also present at high to moderate levels.    Identification and characterisation of the mobile genetic elements, including identification of class 1 integrons and plasmids were carried out for multi-resistance isolates. The integrons harboured varying gene cassettes, including aadA1, aadA2, aadA5, aacA4, dhfrXII, drfA1 and dhfrA17, blaPSE1 and catB3. Thirty-five percent of Salmonella spp. isolates and 76% of E. coli isolates harboured plasmids of more than 95 kb. Transfer of resistance phenotypes between the isolates via conjugation and phage transduction was also demonstrated. Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1), a 43-kb genomic region contains a 13-kb antibiotic resistance gene cluster, has been identified in an isolate of S. Albany from chicken.   The presence of Salmonella spp. virulence genes was investigated to examine the pathogenicity potential of the isolates. The invA gene was present in all Salmonella spp. isolates and the plasmid virulence gene spvC was detected in one S. Typhimurium isolate only, on a 95 kb virulence plasmid. Invasion assays performed in vitro demonstrated that all Salmonella isolates  were capable of invading human intestine INT407 cells. In addition, the investigation for the presence of 58 selected virulence genes showed  that all the tested isolates contained at least one virulence gene and there were 16 genes which are associated with different pathotypes detected.    The data obtained in this study indicates that raw food in Vietnam is a potential reservoirs for many pathogenic organisms, and confirms the role of food animals as a reservoir of multidrug resistant E. coli and Salmonella spp.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salmonella</field><field name="subject">Escherichia coli</field><field name="subject">Vibrio</field><field name="subject">Food</field><field name="subject">PFGE</field><field name="subject">Antibiotic resistance; Resistance gene; Virulence gene</field><field name="subject">Integrons</field><field name="subject">Plasmid</field><field name="subject">Conjugation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090407.141836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of surface science to sulfide mineral processing</field><field name="creator">Goh, Siew Wei, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Surface spectroscopic techniques have been applied to facets of the flotation beneficiation and hydrometallurgical extraction of sulfide minerals to enhance the fundamental understanding of these industrially important processes. As a precursor to the determination of surface chemical composition, the sub-surface properties of some sulfide minerals that have not previously been fully characterised were also investigated. The electronic properties of ??-NiS and ??-NiS (millerite), Ni3S2 (heazlewoodite), (Ni,Fe)9S8 (pentlandite), CuFe2S3 (cubanite), CuFeS2 (chalcopyrite), Cu5FeS4 (bornite) and CuS (covellite) were investigated by conventional and synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy augmented by ab initio density of state calculations and NEXAFS spectral simulations. Particular aspects studied included the relationship between sulfur coordination number and core electron binding energies, the higher than expected core electron binding energies for the sulfur in the metal-excess nickel sulfides, and the formal oxidation states of the Cu and Fe in Cu-Fe sulfides. It was concluded that the binding energy dependence on coordination number was less than previously believed, that Ni-Ni bonding was the most likely explanation for the unusual properties of the Ni sulfides, and that there was no convincing evidence for Cu(II) in sulfides as had been claimed. Most of the NEXAFS spectra simulated by the FEFF8 and WIEN2k ab initio codes agreed well with experimental spectra, and the calculated densities of states were useful in rationalising the observed properties. XPS, static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and NEXAFS spectroscopy were used to investigate thiol flotation collector adsorption on several sulfides in order to determine the way in which the collector chemisorbs to the mineral surface, to differentiate monolayer from multilayer coverage, and to characterise the multilayer species. It was found that static SIMS alone was able to differentiate monolayer from multilayer coverage, and together with angle-resolved NEXAFS spectroscopy, was also able to confirm that 2-mercaptobenzothiazole interacted through both its N and exocyclic S atoms. The altered layers formed on chalcopyrite and heazlewoodite during acid leaching were examined primarily by means of threshold S KLL Auger electron spectroscopy, but no evidence for buried interfacial species was obtained.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surface chemistry</field><field name="subject">Sulphide minerals</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mutual fund investment bias around the world</field><field name="creator">Tian, Shu, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation consists of three stand-alone but interrelated empirical studies investigating various aspects of the well-documented ??home bias anomaly?? in international investment. The findings help to understand the international investment allocation behaviour of mutual funds as well as their implications for asset pricing and mutual fund evaluation.  The first study investigates the roles of various firm attributes that encapsulate the deadweight costs in determining firm level investment bias. The main findings suggest that firm characteristics related to transaction costs, corporate governance and information asymmetry create significant barriers for fund managers. In addition, foreign funds are more constrained than domestic funds by information asymmetry, even in developed and liberalized markets. Moreover, this study stylises the international investment allocation model in Cooper and Kaplanis (1986) with a quadratic cost function, which reveals the marginal influence of market level deadweight costs on the relationship between firm characteristics and investment bias. It is found that when market level cross-border barriers are exacerbated, as in the case of emerging and restricted financial markets, foreign fund managers become more sensitive to market level deadweight costs and ignore firm characteristics. In general, these findings imply that the market level ??home bias anomaly?? is an outcome of the complementary effects of investment barriers at both firm and market levels. The second study examines the role of firm level investment bias in predicting future stock returns. It is found that both firm level foreign and domestic biases contain valuable information with respect to firm prospects. However, domestic bias is more informative than foreign bias in terms of subsequent stock returns, partially because of information asymmetry. The third study explores the determinants of fund level investment bias and its ability to predict fund performance. It is found that fund portfolio attributes determine fund level investment biases after controlling for market and fund investment objective specific effects, and fund level investment bias is positively related to fund performance due to lower deadweight costs. Moreover, good macroeconomic environments foster the development of the mutual fund industry.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information asymmetry</field><field name="subject">home bias</field><field name="subject">mutual fund</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Do managers look beyond cost when making outsourcing decisions? The role of innovation benefits and value appropriation</field><field name="creator">Perm-Ajchariyawong, Nidthida, Strategy &amp; Entrepreneurship, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The question of whether outsourcing is a good or bad organizational practice has traditionally come down to whether the positive financial impact of outsourcing overcomes the potential organizational liabilities. The theoretical model proposed in this thesis argues that such thinking underestimates the positive organizational benefits that arise from outsourcing by giving inadequate consideration to impacts that outsourcing has on the innovation cycle of outsourcing providers.  This research adds to our understanding of outsourcing decision-making in three important ways. First, the thesis presents how innovation benefits can arise from outsourcing and proposes four potential innovation benefits from outsourcing &#150; the motivation for creativity, innovation scale, innovation scope and complementarity of capability. The central hypotheses argue that these beneficial factors should increase the likelihood of a decision to outsource an activity. Second, this research extends our understanding of outsourcing by examining the moderating effect of value appropriation on the decision to outsource. Third, the thesis provides a rigorous empirical utility theoretical approach &#150; best-worst scaling and discrete choice modeling &#150; to understanding managerial preferences and the components of outsourcing decision making.  The findings reveal that a significant segment of managers do indeed look beyond cost in choosing to outsource, focusing instead to concentrate broadly on a supplier&#146;s commitment to innovation, complementarity of capabilities and the ability of an outsourcing contract to appropriate value created in a relationship. This implies that the managerial application of outsourcing is not restricted to a short-term solution for cost savings, but can potentially be thought of, and used as, a strategic mechanism to drive innovation in organizations. Some benefits may not be immediately obvious (e.g., a supplier&#146;s motivation for innovation) and require more awareness from managers. Together, the theory and empirics provide insight into outsourcing decision-making and the opportunities for extending outsourcing as a strategic mechanism to drive innovation more broadly.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Value appropriation</field><field name="subject">Strategic outsourcing</field><field name="subject">Innovation</field><field name="subject">Choice experiment</field><field name="subject">Managerial decision-making</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical study of children's musical experiences in Italy, South Africa and Bali, discussing the nature of the transmission of musical knowledge</field><field name="creator">De Francesco, Luca, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The central interest of this thesis is the nature of the transmission of musical knowledge, and its meaning and purpose to different societies and within different contemplations of life and beliefs. In my case, I will specifically refer to what I learnt from the fieldwork I carried out in Southern Italy (2004), in some South African contexts (2005), and in the village of Batuan (Bali, Indonesia; 2006, 2007). All such experiences will be put, so to say, in a 'dialogue' with each other in order to suggest a few considerations.  The methodological tools employed to sustain my argument are Clifford Geertz's concept of thick description, and the audio-visual material collected throughout my fieldwork, which will further support my commentary. Using Clifford Geertz's approach, I suggest that in exploring the relationship between human beings and the various practices of 'music' existing, as well as their contents and aims, we need to look at music not as an isolated element on its own, as mostly conceived of in the West, but rather as an integral aspect of life itself. The facts and observations reported from my fieldwork show that what in the West is called music and music education can elsewhere be experienced and thought of in very dissimilar ways. In the village of Batuan, for example, music is not a special event, but an ingredient of the local community's life and its spirituality.  The final ruminations will speculate on the fact that in the West the fragmentation through which life is understood, and that has destroyed the bond between life and the arts, is also reflected in the educational system. In modern Western societies, the detachment of arts from life has created a craving and a need for artistic exclusivity, which celebrates the individualistic rather than the communal, and aesthetics rather than spirituality, unlike Bali, for example. As a starting point, we are asked to ponder whether, and how, in the West we can still entertain the hope to reconcile such a fragmentation with a more holistic approach, where music becomes equal to the other daily activities taking place within our community.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fieldwork in Italy, South Africa and Bali</field><field name="subject">Musical knowledge</field><field name="subject">Children and music</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of hypnotic reading disruptions</field><field name="creator">Hung, Lynette Faye, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated hypnotic reading disruptions to identify parameters of hypnosis that may influence reading and to inform the broader issue of whether hypnotic suggestions impact phenomenal experience versus perceptual-cognitive processing.  Chapter 1 reviews the relevant literature and identifies core issues addressed by this program.  Chapter 2 presents two experiments and two case studies, which focused on establishing a paradigm for investigating hypnotic reading disruptions; in particular, modulation of the Stroop effect.  Findings indicated that disruptions of reading experience and/or reading processing may be influenced by the complexity of the suggestion and the natural response strategies of individuals.  Chapter 3 presents two experiments that examined the influence of test time and test demands, and explored the experiential factors underlying response to different suggestions.  Findings indicated that both hypnotic and posthypnotic suggestions produced disruptions of reading experience but not reading processing.  Also, individuals?? experiences and cognitive strategies varied depending on the suggestion they received.  Chapter 4 presents two experiments that compared the impact of three suggestions on reading experience and reading processing.  Findings indicated that highs were more likely to achieve disruptions of reading experience in response to a suggestion compatible with their natural strategies.  Notably, some highs altered their reading processing and hypnotically modulated Stroop interference.  Other highs and lows modified their reading processing, but independent of hypnosis, hypnotisability and a suggestion.  Chapter 5 presents one experiment that examined the time course of hypnotic reading disruptions and the influence of test context.  Findings indicated that highs could maintain disruptions of reading experience over time.  They also modified their reading processing independent of hypnosis and a suggestion.  Chapter 6 presents one experiment that examined implicit perception, and the impact of hypnosis and hypnotisability.  Findings indicated that highs were influenced by information from reading processing despite their experiences of disrupted reading.  Chapter 7 interprets the findings of this program within a proposed model of hypnotic disruptions of reading and Stroop performance.  This model differentiates between the mechanisms that may underlie reading experiences, the mechanisms that may underlie reading processing and their interaction, and highlights the value of hypnotic models of cognitive processes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stroop</field><field name="subject">Hypnosis</field><field name="subject">Reading</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrating subsurface ocean temperatures in the statistical prediction of ENSO and Australian rainfall &amp; streamflow</field><field name="creator">Ruiz, Jose Eric, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">As a global climate phenomenon, the El Ni??o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) involves the coupling of the ocean and the atmosphere. Most climate prediction studies have, by far, only investigated the teleconnections between global climatic anomalies and the ???surface??? predictors of ENSO. The prediction models resulting from these studies have generally suffered from inadequate, if not the lack of, skill across the so-called boreal ???spring barrier???. This is illustrated in the first part of this thesis where the applicability of the SOI phase for long-lead rainfall projections in Australia is discussed. With the increasing availability of subsurface ocean temperature data, the characteristics of the Pacific Ocean???s heat content and its role in ENSO are now better understood. The second part of this thesis investigated the predictability of ENSO using the thermocline as a predictor. While the persistence and SST-based ENSO hindcasts dropped in skill across the spring barrier, the thermocline-based hindcasts remained skillful even up to a lag of eighteen months. Continuing on the favorable results of ENSO prediction, the third part of this thesis extended the use of the thermocline in the prediction of Australia???s rainfall and streamflow. When compared to models that use ???surface??? predictors, the model that incorporated thermocline information resulted in more skillful projections of rainfall and streamflow especially at long lead-times. More importantly, significant increases in skill of autumn and winter projections demonstrate the ability of the subsurface ocean to retain some climatic memory across the predictability barrier. This resilience can be attributed to the high persistence of the ocean heat content during the first half of the year. Based on weighting, the model averaging exercise also affirmed the superiority of the ???subsurface??? model over the ???surface??? models in terms of streamflow projections. The encouraging findings of this study could have far-reaching implications not only to the science of ENSO prediction but also to the more pragmatic realm of hydrologic forecasting. What this study has demonstrated is an alternative predictor that is suitable for the long range forecasting of ENSO, rainfall and streamflow. With better hydrologic forecasting comes significant improvement in the management of reservoirs which eventually leads to an increase in the reliability and sufficiency of water supply provision.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ocean temperature</field><field name="subject">rain and rainfall</field><field name="subject">streamflow</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">El Ni??o current</field><field name="subject">southern oscillation</field><field name="subject">thermoclines (oceanography).</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of supervised and unsupervised learning to analysis of the arterial pressure pulse</field><field name="creator">Walsh, Andrew Michael, Graduate school of biomedical engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an investigation of statistical analytical methods applied to the analysis of the shape of the arterial pressure waveform. The arterial pulse is analysed by a selection of both supervised and unsupervised methods of learning. Supervised learning methods are generally better known as regression. Unsupervised learning methods seek patterns in data without the specification of a target variable. The theoretical relationship between arterial pressure and wave shape is first investigated by study of a transmission line model of the arterial tree. A meta-database of pulse waveforms obtained by the SphygmoCor"??" device is then analysed by the unsupervised learning technique of Self Organising Maps (SOM). The map patterns indicate that the observed arterial pressures affect the wave shape in a similar way as predicted by the theoretical model. A database of continuous arterial pressure obtained by catheter line during sleep is used to derive supervised models that enable estimation of arterial pressures, based on the measured wave shapes. Independent component analysis (ICA) is also used in a supervised learning methodology to show the theoretical plausibility of separating the pressure signals from unwanted noise components. The accuracy and repeatability of the SphygmoCor?? device is measured and discussed. Alternative regression models are introduced that improve on the existing models in the estimation of central cardiovascular parameters from peripheral arterial wave shapes. Results of this investigation show that from the information in the wave shape, it is possible, in theory, to estimate the continuous underlying pressures within the artery to a degree of accuracy acceptable to the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. This could facilitate a new role for non-invasive sphygmographic devices, to be used not only for feature estimation but as alternatives to invasive arterial pressure sensors in the measurement of continuous blood pressure.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">self organising maps</field><field name="subject">SOM</field><field name="subject">blood pressure</field><field name="subject">supervised learning</field><field name="subject">independent component analysis</field><field name="subject">sphygmocor</field><field name="subject">arterial pressure</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24841</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women's magazine editors : Story tellers and their cultural role.</field><field name="creator">DAVIES, Kathryn</field><field name="description">This is an ethnographic study of contemporary Australian women's magazine editors and their perceptions about their role and function within their workplaces, and, as creators of media products, within culture itself.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">magazines</field><field name="subject">editor</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.ecu.edu.au/adt-public/adt-ECU2009.0002.html</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autocatalyst-derived platinum group elements in the roadside environment - occurence, mobility and fate</field><field name="creator">Jason D. Whiteley</field><field name="description">The emission of the platinum group elements Pt, Pd and Rh (PGE) from automobile
catalytic converters has led to rapid increases in Pt, Pd and Rh concentrations in roadside
media. The vast majority of previous research examining autocatalyst-derived PGE
in the urban environment has been performed in Europe or North America. Although
catalytic converters became mandatory on all new cars sold in Australia from 1986, no
prior studies have focussed on urban platinum group element (PGE) concentrations in
Australian environments.

In general, the results of previous studies suggest a limited post depositional
mobility of catalyst derived PGE. However, these findings are from research conducted in
cool-temperate climate zones with regular rainfall and from environments where soils and
sediments differ from the typically coarse grained, sandy soils with low levels of organic
matter found in Perth. The relevance of European and North American findings to other
regions with different climates and soils is therefore unclear and where the climate regime
and properties of soils and sediments are not comparable to those previously studied, the
potential exists for different geochemical behaviour of autocatalyst-derived PGE. Through
investigations of spatial and temporal distribution and the identification of some of the
main factors controlling transport and fixation, the principal aim of the research presented
in this thesis was to elucidate aspects of the post depositional geochemical behaviour of autocatalyst derived PGE in selected roadside environments in Perth, Western Australia.

The quality of some of the reported PGE data has been questioned by a number of
workers. Possibly the most intractable diffculty in the determination of low concentrations
of PGE in environmental samples by ICP-MS is the control of interferences from common
matrix components. To ensure accurate and reliable data in this research, prior to
the analysis of environmental samples, the optimal instrumental conditions for PGE
determination and two commonly applied matrix separation methodologies (tellurium
coprecipitation and ion-exchange) were investigated. The most effective matrix separation
technique for the accurate determination of PGE in the environmental samples applicable
to this study, such as road dusts and roadside soils, was found to be cation exchange.

The lack of knowledge regarding urban PGE concentrations in an Australian context
was addressed through examinations of PGE levels in road dusts, roadside soils and
infiltration basin and wetland sediments. Data show significant elevation of all three
PGE above local background and average upper crust values. PGE ratios in surface road
dusts and soils were consistent with known catalytic converter compositions and while Pt
and Rh concentrations are comparable with European studies, Pd levels were generally
higher in these Australian samples.

The effect of climate on PGE levels in roadside environments was investigated by
repeat sampling of road dusts and roadside soils over a twelve month period. Both
sample media exhibited seasonal variations. The presence of seasonal variability in
PGE concentrations in roadside soils suggests that this environmental compartment
does not represent a long term accumulative matrix for autocatalyst-derived PGE.
Further examination of spatial distribution revealed that the PGE exhibit greater vertical mobility in the soils of Perth than has previously been reported, with elevations above
local background concentrations occurring at depths of 14-20cm. Neither small scale
spatial variability nor vertical mobilisation were of su&#177;cient magnitude to explain the
observed temporal variability. Based on the pattern of seasonal PGE distribution and
that of rainfall, temporal fluctuations are attributed to transport by stormwater. The
mobilisation of PGE by stormwater is thought to occur principally via the water-mediated
transport of PGE bearing particulates. However, PGE fractionation leading to a
greater post-depositional mobility of Pd may occur during transport through the urban
stormwater system.

In the urban environment of Perth, infiltration basin and wetland sediments represent
a sink for autocatalyst-derived PGE. Based on the examination of PGE ratios, and the
vertical distribution of PGE in infiltration basin sediments, Pt and Rh remain associated,
whereas Pd may be differentially mobilised. For both soils and infiltration basin sediments,
variation in pH was limited and does not show any correlation with vertical profiles of PGE,
suggesting that pH does not act as a major control on PGE mobility. The role of organic
matter is less clear, and although no straightforward relationships were apparent, where
high levels of organic matter were present, profiles suggest an increased mobilisation of
Pd. This differential mobilisation of Pd may therefore be caused by the formation of an
organo-metallic species.

Temporal fluctuations in PGE levels in road dusts and roadside soils indicate that
inputs of PGE to aquatic environments are likely to occur as seasonal pulses. The routing
of road runoff into urban wetlands therefore represents a major pathway by which aquatic
ecosystems may be exposed to autocatalyst-derived PGE. The impact of such inputs is unclear, however, as other recent studies have shown that a portion of autocatalyst-derived
PGE, and especially Pd is bioavailable, the potential for ecosystem degradation due to
PGE contamination represents a major avenue for further research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">autocatalyst</field><field name="subject">urban environment</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051012.143138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In A City Like Delhi: Sustainability and Spirituality</field><field name="creator">Y.Narayanan@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The broad purpose of &#145;In A City Like Delhi&#146; is to make an argument in favour of the positive link between spirituality and sustainability. Sustainability, at its core, requires an ethical commitment, and the thesis proposes that spirituality may be that vital means through which sustainability may be truly animated, in theory and in practice.  The thesis is particularly preoccupied with considering the yet fully unrealised competence of spirituality to enrich the understanding and practise of sustainability in the urban space. To this end, it uses a very particular case study to make a modest exploration of such a conceptual association &#150; the city of Delhi. 

The concept of sustainability, as articulated in the West, is primarily a secular notion. While international religious and spiritual organisations have taken up the sustainability challenge, the reverse is less true &#150; sustainability planning is rarely conducted in a dialogue with religious or spiritual institutions and resources. In this context the case study of an Indian megacity to examine the relationship between religion, spirituality, secularism and development, is particularly interesting. The thesis explores, as one example of the potential interface, how Hindu spirituality as interpreted by Mahatma Gandhi, may usefully inform a spiritual philosophy to enliven a sustainability consciousness in Delhi. 

The theoretical speculations of the thesis are grounded in the local context by seeking the perspectives of twenty primary informants from Delhi who are all associated with various levels of planning and implementing development in the city. I specifically chose my interviewees from secular development backgrounds (rather than religious and spiritual representatives) because this would enrich critical understanding of how spirituality may be viewed within a secular sustainability discourse. I use their views on spirituality, sustainable development, and any affinities between the two notions to balance my own perspective, derived from both my research and my personal experience of the city of my birth. The interviews gave added depth to the environmental, economic and social challenges confronting the city of Delhi, which were already evident in the literature review. Additionally however, the interviews confirmed the hypothesis that sustainable development and spirituality together could have a productive, coherent and an even inseparable grounding union in Delhi and that spirituality may be vital in facilitating that essential shift in consciousness that a sustainable mindset requires. These findings are crucial to any study or strategy considering comprehensive sustainable development for Delhi.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="subject">Delhi</field><field name="subject">Hinduism</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080714.153121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of artificial neural networks in early detection of Mastitis from improved data collected on-line by robotic milking stations</field><field name="creator">Sun, Zhibin</field><field name="description">Two types of artificial neural networks, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Self-organizing Feature Map (SOM), were employed to detect mastitis for robotic milking stations using the preprocessed data relating to the electrical conductivity and milk yield. The SOM was developed to classify the health status into three categories: healthy, moderately ill and severely ill. The clustering results were successfully evaluated and validated by using statistical techniques such as K-means clustering, ANOVA and Least Significant Difference. The result shows that the SOM could be used in the robotic milking stations as a detection model for mastitis. For developing MLP models, a new mastitis definition based on higher EC and lower quarter yield was created and Principle Components Analysis technique was adopted for addressing the problem of multi-colinearity existed in the data. Four MLPs with four combined datasets were developed and the results manifested that the PCA-based MLP model is superior to other non-PCA-based models in many respects such as less complexity, higher predictive accuracy. The overall correct classification rate (CCR), sensitivity and specificity of the model was 90.74 %, 86.90 and 91.36, respectively.

Thailand has shown a clear policy transition for foreign investment over time from an import-substitution regime to an export-oriented regime. Before the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis (1985-1996), Thailand had the fastest growing level of exports in manufactured goods among Asian economies. FDI plays a significant role in the Thai economy. Thailand has been pursuing different foreign investment policies at different times depending on the development objectives and economic situation in the country. The main objective of this research is to evaluate the determinants of FDI and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) in Thailand using the extended Gravity Model. Panel data is used to estimate and evaluate the empirical results based on the data for the years 1980 to 2004. It also examines the FDI flows between different locations and their geographical distances in Thailand. The primary research question addresses what factors motivate, attract, and sustain the FDI and FPI in Thailand. In addition, this study also examines the effects of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis on the inflows of FDI and FPI into Thailand. The results show that the inflows of FDI in Thailand, which are supply-driven, are significantly influenced by its 21 largest investing partners. The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis has no impact on the determinants of the inflows of FDI into Thailand, but positively influences the inflows of FPI into Thailand. Our results also show that increases in GDP and trade between investing partners and Thailand potentially attract more FDI and FPI into Thailand. Investing partners closer to Thailand draw more portfolio investment into Thailand than distant partners &#8211; emphasising that distance has a negative impact on the portfolio investment but a negligible impact on the FDI.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">foreign direct investment</field><field name="subject">portfolio investment</field><field name="subject">FDI</field><field name="subject">FPI</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Asian financial crisis</field><field name="subject">Gravity Model</field><field name="subject">regional integration</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340206 International economics and international finance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of resource subsidies in enhancing biological control of aphids by hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae)</field><field name="creator">Laubertie, Elsa</field><field name="description">In this thesis, experiments were conducted in the laboratory and the field to determine whether the provision of floral resources to hoverflies could enhance the biological control of aphids. The overall aim was to clarify hoverfly behaviour and ecology in an agroecosystem in order to understand the potential of these insects for biocontrol under a conservation biological control (CBC) regime. A preliminary experiment in New Zealand compared the effect of different coloured water-traps on catches of the hoverflies Melanostoma fasciatum (Macquart) and Melangyna novaezelandiae (Macquart). Significantly more individuals were caught in completely yellow traps than in traps with green outer walls and yellow inner walls or in completely green traps. This suggested that if a measure of hoverfly numbers relating to a particular distance along a transect is required, consideration should be given to the ability of hoverflies to detect yellow traps from a distance. The use of traps that are green outside would more accurately reflect the local abundance of hoverflies, as the insect would be likely to see the yellow stimulus only when above or close to the trap. Also, the addition of rose water significantly increased the number of M. fasciatum caught. From a suite of flowering plants chosen for their ability in other studies to increase hoverfly visit frequencies, laboratory experiments were conducted in France to determine the plant&#8217;s effectiveness at enhancing Episyrphus balteatus (De Geer) &#8216;fitness&#8217;, and to evaluate whether adult feeding on flowers was related to performance. Phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia Bentham cv. Balo), followed by buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench cv. Katowase) and coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) gave the optimal reproductive potential of female E. balteatus. There was no correlation between pollen and nectar consumption, and there was no discernible positive correlation between the quantity of pollen ingested and the resulting female performance. Phacelia and buckwheat were then studied as resource subsidies in the field in New Zealand. The effect of incorporating phacelia or buckwheat in the margins of 5 m x 5 m broccoli plots was tested for hoverfly activity and floral &#8216;preferences&#8217;. Hoverflies which had fed on phacelia and buckwheat pollen were found up to 17.5 m from the floral strips and females of M. fasciatum and M. novaezelandiae consumed more phacelia pollen than that of buckwheat in the field. These results support the choice of phacelia as an ideal floral resource subsidy in crops for enhanced biological control by these New Zealand species. The need for studying hoverfly movement in a large-scale field experiment was apparent from the field studies, so the next experiment was carried out in a field 450 &#215; 270 m and flies were marked via their ingestion of the pollen of phacelia. The focus was on the proportion of flies having consumed the pollen. Although large quantities of pollen were found in some hoverfly guts, most did not contain phacelia pollen and very few were captured at 50 m from phacelia, compared with numbers at the border of the floral strip. A possible explanation was that hoverflies feed on a large variety of pollen species, reducing the relative attraction of phacelia flowers. Another possibility was that hoverflies dispersed from the phacelia away from the crop. Also, pollen digestion rates are likely to be a factor. Finally, a series of experiments was conducted in the field and laboratory to study hoverfly efficacy through oviposition and larval behaviour. In field experiments, female M. fasciatum and M. novaezelandiae laid more eggs where buckwheat patches were larger; however higher oviposition rates did not lead to improved aphid population suppression. In greenhouse experiments, larvae of E. balteatus could initiate a decline in aphid numbers at the predator: prey ratio 1: 8.3, however this control did not persist. Experiments in the laboratory showed that hoverfly larvae became more active and left the system while aphid numbers declined or numbers of larvae increased. This behaviour was caused by two factors: hunger and avoidance of conspecific larvae. Further experiments showed that the avoidance of conspecifics was caused by mutual interference rather than cannibalism. The results of this work highlight the importance of hoverfly dispersal ability. Given the observations of foraging behaviour of females and mutual interference observed between larvae, and the lack of success in CBC by hoverflies in experiments at the crop scale, it is essential to assess the impact of insect predators and parasitoids at a landscape scale.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hoverflies</field><field name="subject">Melanostoma fasciatum</field><field name="subject">Melangyna novaezelandiae</field><field name="subject">Episyrphus balteatus</field><field name="subject">aphids</field><field name="subject">selective resource subsidies</field><field name="subject">biological control</field><field name="subject">fitness</field><field name="subject">hoverfly movement</field><field name="subject">oviposition</field><field name="subject">foraging behaviour</field><field name="subject">mutual interference</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300204 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/984</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of some infectious and genetic factors involved in cervical cancer</field><field name="creator">Hoang, Kim Lien Thi, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide and in Vietnam. The causal role of Human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical cancer has been firmly established. However, there have been only a few studies of HPV infection of the cervix in Vietnam, and in cervical cancer in particular. This project was conducted to investigate infectious and genetic factors that may be involved in cervical cancer in Vietnam. The study comprises two parts: the first part examines the relationship between HPV and Chlamydia trachomatis infections and cervical cancer, and the second part focuses on the impact of HPV infection on microRNA expression. The aims of the first part were to assess prevalence of HPV and its subtypes, C.trachomatis infection and their relationship in cancer of the cervix. The investigation was performed on two populations: Vietnamese (cancer and non-cancer groups), Australian (normal cytology and abnormal cytology groups). The results reveal that (i) both HPV, especially high ?? risk types, and C.trachomatis are significantly more prevalent in cervical cancer and in cytologically abnormal cervix; (ii) C.trachomatis is a cofactor with HPV and is associated with high-risk HPV types in cervical cancer; (iii) 75% non-cancer women in this Vietnam cohort were infected with high-risk HPVs; (iv) Most of HPV-16 positive Vietnamese samples harbor E6 East-Asia variant whose oncogenicity is potentially greater than the prototype (Europe variant). Together these findings explain in part high rate of cancer of the cervix in Vietnam. The main aim of the second part was to investigate miRNA expression in HPV-16 E6/E7 transfected keratinocytes, in HeLa, SiHa, and C33A cell lines in order to ascertain whether or not HPV and different HPV types affect cellular miRNA expression. These experiments revealed overexpression of some miRNA oncogenes in E6/E7 containing keratinocytes together with underexpression of some miRNA tumor suppressors in (HPV positive) HeLa and SiHa compared with (HPV negative) C33A suggesting that regulation of miRNA expression is an addtional pathway for HPV-induced carcinogenesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41755</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining the role of &#946;-tubulin isotypes in drug resistance and tumourigenesis in lung cancer cells</field><field name="creator">Gan, Pei Pei, Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and in its advanced stage, has a poor clinical outcome. Resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, either intrinsic or acquired, is the primary cause of treatment failure in NSCLC. Tubulin binding agents (TBAs), such as paclitaxel and vinorelbine are important components in the treatment of NSCLC. Upregulation of the neuronal specific class III &#946;-tubulin (&#946;-III-tubulin) is frequently found in drug resistant cancer cell lines and human tumours, lending support that &#946;III-tubulin might play a role in the development of drug resistance in cancer cells. However, to date, compelling evidence supporting its direct role in drug resistance and response has been lacking.  To address its role in NSCLC, RNA interference (RNAi) was employed to knock down &#946;III-tubulin expression in two drug naive NSCLC cell lines, Calu-6 and H460. Specific knockdown of &#946;III-tubulin resulted in increased sensitivity to TBAs and DNA damaging agents, two classes of agents that are commonly used in the treatment of NSCLC. Increased sensitivity to TBAs and DNA damaging agents in the &#946;III-tubulin knockdown cells was due to an increased propensity of the cells to undergo apoptosis, suggesting that this tubulin isotype may be a cellular survival factor. Interestingly, specific knockdown of &#946;II- or &#946;IVb-tubulin hypersensitised the cells to Vinca alkaloids but not taxanes, demonstrating that each isotype is unique in terms of drug-target interactions. Moreover, the &#946;-tubulin isotype composition of a cell can influence response, and therefore resistance to TBAs.  To determine whether &#946;III-tubulin differentially regulates microtubule behaviour and influences cell proliferation via an effect on microtubule dynamics, siRNAs were used to knockdown &#946;III-tubulin expression in H460 cells stably expressing GFP-&#946;I-tubulin and the dynamic instability behaviour of individual microtubules was measured by time-lapse microscopy. In the absence of drug, silencing of &#946;III tubulin alone did not significantly affect the dynamic instability of interphase microtubules. However, at the IC50 for proliferation of either paclitaxel or vincristine, the overall dynamicity was suppressed significantly in the &#946;III-tubulin silenced cells as compared to the control, indicating that &#946;III-tubulin knockdown induces paclitaxel or vincristine sensitivity by enhancing the ability of these agents to suppress microtubule dynamics. At a concentration of drug that represented the IC50 for mitotic arrest, for either paclitaxel or vincristine, increased apoptosis induction was found to play a dominant role in &#946;III-tubulin knockdown, further supporting a role for &#946;III-tubulin as a cellular survival factor. Collectively, when &#946;III-tubulin is overexpressed in tumours cells, it is highly likely to be promoting cellular survival and resistance to TBAs.  In addition to its proposed role in drug resistance, high expression of &#946;III-tubulin in tumours of non-neuronal origin such as NSCLC, has been positively correlated with the degree of tumour aggressiveness. H460 cells are known to display substrate- independent growth in soft agar and tumourigenicity in nude mice and provided an ideal model to investigate the role of &#946;III-tubulin in tumourigenesis. To address the role of &#946;III-tubulin, H460 cells stably expressing &#946;III-tubulin shRNA were generated, validated and examined using both in vitro and in vivo methods of tumourigenesis. Colony formation of H460 cells stably expressing &#946;III-tubulin shRNA was dramatically reduced in soft agar and significantly delayed tumour growth and reduced tumour incidence of subcutaneous xenografted tumours in nude mice when compared to respective controls. These results provide new insights into the function of &#946;III-tubulin and suggest that &#946;III-tubulin may play an important role in tumour development and progression in lung cancer.  In conclusion, &#946;-tubulin isotype status can serve as a valuable molecular marker capable of distinguishing patients with differential sensitivity to TBAs. These results not only shed new light on the role of specific &#946;-tubulin isotypes in the response to TBAs, but also the role of &#946;III-tubulin in the biology of cancer that will lead to new treatment strategies for NSCLC.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tumourigenesis.</field><field name="subject">&#946;-tubulin.</field><field name="subject">Drug resistance.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing the effect of infiltration variability on the performance of surface irrigation</field><field name="creator">Gillies, Malcolm H.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Infiltration variability is a major issue during the design phase and management for all types of irrigation systems. Infiltration is of particular significance for furrow irrigation and other forms of surface irrigation as the soil intake rate at any given position not only determines the depth applied but also governs the distribution of water to other locations in the field. Despite this, existing measurement and evaluationprocedures generally assume homogeneous soil infiltration rates across the field to simplify data collection and computational requirements. This study was conducted to(a) determine whether spatial and temporal variations in soil infiltration characteristics have a significant impact on the performance of surface irrigation and (b) identify more appropriate management strategies that account for this variability and substantially improve irrigation performance.The soil infiltration rate is typically expressed as an empirical function of opportunity time. The infiltration function parameters cannot be directly measured but are commonly estimated from field hydraulic measurements using an appropriate simulation model. The volume balance model as used in the inverse solution for infiltration (e.g. Two Point Method) was modified to enable runoff data collected during the inflow period to be used in the estimation of the infiltration parameters. The resulting model, IPARM also accommodates the full (variable) inflowhydrograph rather than relying on a constant inflow assumption. Inclusion of runoff data in the inverse solution improved the accuracy of the infiltration curve during the runoff phase and hence offered the greatest benefit where the irrigation time exceededthe completion of advance. Analysis of field data collected from multiple furrows at a single site indicated that accounting for the variable inflow in IPARM both reduced the variability (e.g. reduction in the coefficient of variance (CV) of cumulative infiltrated depths of 18.6% and 11.5% at opportunity times of 100 and 500 minutes,respectively) and standardised the shape of the estimated infiltration curves. Hence, a significant proportion of the apparent variability in soil infiltration rates was shown to be a consequence of the constant inflow assumption. Sensitivity analysis indicatedthat IPARM is highly sensitive to the runoff measurements but is not influenced by the relative numbers of advance and runoff data points. Validation of IPARM estimated infiltration parameters using the full hydrodynamic model SIRMOD showed that the inclusion of runoff data in the inverse procedure did not compromise the ability to predict the measured advance trajectory but significantly improved the fit to the measured runoff volumes (average decrease in absolute error of simulated runoff volumes of 84%). Whereas the use of runoff data enabled SIRMOD to estimate runoff volumes, accounting for variable inflow improved the fit of the predicted runoff rates to the shape of the measured outflow hydrograph.Field data collected from several sites across the Darling Downs, Queensland has shown that the infiltration rates vary significantly (e.g. by up to 65% at 500 minutes),both spatially between furrows and temporally over the season. For the sites studied, the spatial variance in infiltration was surpassed by the seasonal variance (e.g. average CV of infiltration of 33.1% compared to 12.5%) but no consistent trends were identified. It was found that the lognormal distribution provided the best fit for thevariance in the infiltration curves which was in turn strongly related to the statistical distribution of the infiltration term of the volume balance. From this research, a procedure was developed to predict the infiltration parameters using a single advancepoint and any number of &#8220;known&#8221; infiltration curves from the same field.The IrriProb model was developed to extend the process of simulation from a single furrow scale to the whole field scale. IrriProb performs the full hydrodynamicsimulation for multiple independent furrows which are combined to form a spatial representation of the water application. Each furrow can have a unique infiltrationrate, inflow rate (Q), time to cut off (TCO) and soil moisture deficit. Validation of IrriProb using multiple sets of field data demonstrated that the single furrowsimulations failed to predict the true whole field irrigation performance (e.g. furrow distribution uniformity (DU) between 72.2% and 86.2% compared to the whole field DU of 64.8%).An optimisation routine was developed within IrriProb to maximise irrigation performance through identification of optimal values of Q and TCO. The optimisation objective function is comprised of a Boolean combination of customisable performance criteria. The user selects the appropriate performance terms and the optimal management is determined through a graphical overlay of the complyingranges of Q and TCO. Hence, the objective function of IrriProb retains the importance of each individual performance term, an advantage over those based on numerical combinations of weighted terms. Simulation of the whole field application under practical ranges of Q and TCO demonstrated the complex interactions between theperformance indices (e.g. the trade off between requirement efficiency (RE) and application efficiency (AE)). In cases of low infiltration variability it was possible to optimise the whole field performance using a single value of Q and TCO. However, under increased infiltration variability it was more appropriate to manage the field using two or more different management strategies. Irrigation optimisation based onmeasurements from a single furrow or the average infiltration curve, cannot identify the optimal combination of Q and TCO for the whole field. Simulation of field management based on the optimisation strategy obtained from single furrow measurements results in lower whole field performance than estimated from simulation of the single furrow data (e.g. field RE, AE and distribution uniformity of the root zone up to 26%, 18% and 66% lower than predicted). Field trials were used to demonstrate the ability to estimate whole field infiltration variability, evaluate whole field irrigation performance and optimise whole field irrigation management while taking into account the influence of spatial variability.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">infiltration</field><field name="subject">variability;</field><field name="subject">surface</field><field name="subject">irrigation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004082/</field></doc></add>
