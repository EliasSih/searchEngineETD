Biotic pollination services are in decline, necessitating maintenance of either landscape elements required by pollinating species or the development of new ways to enhance currently managed species or potential new ones (Allen-Wardell et al 1998, Heard 1999).
 
 In this empirical study I have surveyed the potential pollinators and measured fruit productivity within a tropical horticultural crop (Annona squamosa x A. cherimola cultivar (cu.) &#8216;Hillary White&#8217;: custard apple) across a northern Australian tropical landscape comprised of a matrix of agricultural land and remnant rainforest patches. 
 I tested the relationship between floral visitor species richness and abundance and two variables; distance that a custard apple orchard was located from naturally occurring rainforest and rainfall. I also tested for a relationship between fruit productivity (initiation) and the distance a custard apple crop was located from naturally occurring rainforest.
 
 Unfortunately, due to the absence of replication of the variable &#8216;orchard distance from naturally occurring rainforest&#8217;, all conclusions must be seen as relationships between measured floral visitor and fruit production variables and orchard location in the landscape. The mechanism/s driving these patterns could be a number of factors associated with the landscape gradient such as north-south gradient, rainfall decline or distance that the orchard was located from naturally occurring rainforest and it will take further empirical study to qualify the most important ones. For simplicity here I have retained the variable &#8216;distance from naturally occurring rainforest&#8217; or &#8216;crop isolation&#8217; in the thesis as it was the variable that determined the selection of sites.
 
 I found 19 species of floral visitors (18 beetles and 1 thrip) to female custard apple flowers; 16 of which are potentially new records for custard apple pollination. 
 Species richness and abundance declined exponentially with distance that a crop was located to naturally occurring rainforest indicating that these floral visitors rely, at least in part, on rainforest resources in the landscape. This is some of the first evidence published (see Blanche &amp; Cunningham 2005) of an effect of crop isolation from native habitat (landscape structure) on a pollinator assemblage other than social bees.
 
 Fruit productivity showed the same relationship; flowers were pollen limited in all orchards but there was an exponential decline in productivity with crop isolation indicating that pollen limitation was more pronounced in orchards isolated from naturally occurring rainforest. Empirical evidence for an effect of landscape structure on pollinator assemblages and resultant fruit production has also been found in tropical crop species such as Macadamia tetraphylla (Macadamia nut), in southeastern Australia and Coffea arabica (Coffee) in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia (Heard &amp; Exley 1994, Klein et al 2003).
 
 I propose from this evidence that the configuration of landscape elements, such as remnant native rainforest, across an agricultural landscape must be considered in proposals to expand crop areas. Ignoring these elements including threshold distances between pollinator &#8216;sources&#8217; and crop plants will be detrimental and costly to growers and ultimately may jeopardise the sustainability of agricultural crops.
 
 I have also shown in this research that current hand-pollination practises essential to custard apple growers for producing a viable crop may not be ideal. Custard apple growers&#8217; hand-pollinate female custard apple flowers using pollen sourced from either &#8216;Hillary White&#8217; or &#8216;African Pride&#8217; cultivar trees. I found that flowers hand-pollinated using cu. &#8216;African Pride&#8217; produced larger and more symmetrical fruit (better fruit quality) than those hand-pollinated using cu. &#8216;Hillary White&#8217;. These parameters of a fruit are important to growers because larger and more symmetrical fruit are more valuable on the market. The difference in fruit quality was not associated with a decline in fruit quantity in flowers pollinated using cu. &#8216;African Pride&#8217;.
 
 Hand-pollination is a incredibly time consuming practise and any progression in traditional hand-pollination techniques that improves fruit production either through an increase in fruit quantity or quality is likely to be embraced by custard apple growers.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4909/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/4909/2/02whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematics, phylogeny and ecology of Australian Leptophlebiidae (Ephemeroptera)</field><field name="creator">Christidis, Faye</field><field name="description">An understanding of the processes that govern patterns of distribution and abundance of organisms remains a central goal in ecology. Ecologists have traditionally focussed on proximate factors to explain patterns in community structure; however, the importance of historical factors in determining some present-day ecological patterns is increasingly being recognised. In this thesis I examine phylogenetic relationships among the Australian Leptophlebiidae (Ephemeroptera) and use the phylogenetic hypotheses obtained to investigate the role of evolutionary history in shaping selected ecological and morphological traits of these stream dwelling mayflies.
 
 A cladistic parsimony analysis based on 43 morphological characters was used to explore phylogenetic relationships among the Leptophlebiidae genera from Australia, and selected genera from South America and New Zealand. The outcomes from this analysis were consistent with higher-level relationships previously proposed byPescador and Peters (1980). The only point of conflict was the monophyly of the Hapsiphlebia lineage. Although the basal position of genera assigned to this lineage was confirmed, these genera did not form a monophyletic group in the present analysis. Clarification of the affinities of four Australian genera (Neboissophlebia, Bibulmena, Loamaggalangta and Kaninga) suggested that they belong to lineages not previously recognised among the Gondwanan Leptophlebiidae.
 
 Three new species of Austrophlebioides were described from the Wet Tropics bioregion. Phylogenetic relationships among species of the genus Austrophlebioides were examined using cladistic analyses based on morphological characters of the
 nymph and the adult. The results from these analyses support the recognition of three monophyletic species groups within the genus, the &#8220;wet tropics&#8221;, &#8220;pusillus&#8221; and &#8220;marchanti&#8221; clades. The &#8220;marchanti&#8221; clade was the most basal clade within the genus, and the &#8220;pusillus&#8221; clade was sister to the &#8220;wet tropics&#8221; clade. Congruence among phylogenies derived from different life-history stages and combined adult and nymph data, along with good bootstrap support, indicated that the proposed relationships within the genus were robust.
 
 Minimal overlap was observed in the geographic distribution of the three Austrophlebioides clades. The &#8220;wet tropics&#8221; clade is confined to the Wet Tropics bioregion of north-eastern Queensland. The &#8220;pusillus&#8221; clade is restricted to eastern Queensland and northern New South Wales with the exception of A. pusillus, which extends to Victoria. The &#8220;marchanti&#8221; clade occurs in southern New South Wales,
 Victoria and Tasmania. Distributional limits of the three clades correspond with the presence of recognised biogeographic barriers (Burdekin Gap, Hunter Valley and Bass Strait), strongly suggesting that vicariance has been important in the differentiation of the group and in determining present-day distributions of species.
 
 The phylogenetic hypothesis for the genus Austrophlebiodes was used to infer the pattern of evolution of labrum morphology in the genus, and evaluate the importance of flow regimes in the evolution of labrum shape. Reconstruction of ancestral characterstates suggests that a broad labrum and use of high flow environments are ancestral features that have evolved only once, early in the evolutionary history of the genus. A narrow labrum and the use of slow flow habitats appear to have evolved secondarily on two independent occasions. Retention of a broad labrum in species that occur in fast flow, and evolutionary changes from a broad to a narrow labrum with shifts from fast to slow flow habitats, suggest that flow has been an important selective factor in the evolution of labrum morphology in Austrophlebioides. However, high levels of conservatism were observed within individual clades, indicating that phylogenetic history is also an important determinant of labrum morphology and habitat use in this genus.
 
 The incorporation of phylogenetic information into the ecological study of leptophlebiid mayfly assemblages of four streams in the Wet Tropics revealed that substrate and habitat use among species often reflected phylogenetic relationships. The high levels of segregation observed on the basis of substrate type, with stones and leaf litter supporting distinct assemblages, appears to be the result of historical differences among lineages in the use of substrate type. The leaf litter fauna was dominated by species of the Nousia lineage, whereas the stone fauna was dominated by species of the Meridialaris lineage. Similarly, the association of species within some lineages to certain habitat types contributed to the distinctiveness of mayfly assemblages of pools,runs, and riffles. These findings suggest that phylogenetic history is important in determining some ecological traits of leptophlebiid species and their present-day distributions among substrate and habitat types. However, patterns of habitat and substrate use did not always reflect phylogenetic relationships. Within the Meridialaris lineage, coexisting species often differed in their use of pool, run or riffle, and tended to separate along a velocity gradient. Similar trends in habitat segregation were observed among the Nousia species (Nousia lineage). In such instances present-day ecological factors may play an important role in determining the distributions of species.
 
 Overall, the present-day structure of tropical mayfly assemblages in the four study streams appears to be the outcome of a combination of historic (phylogenetic) and
 contemporary ecological processes. Without knowledge of phylogenetic relationships among species, the historical basis for some present-day patterns of substrate and
 habitat use would have gone unrecognised. The integration of phylogenetic and ecological approaches has provided a greater understanding of the processes that shape contemporary ecological patterns in Leptophlebiidae mayfly assemblages.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5123/1/Thesis_front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5123/2/Thesis_whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of Acropora AmTPR1, Drosophila Dpit47 and
 mouse TTC4 &#8211; a tetratricopeptide (TPR) gene family involved
 in development and cell proliferation</field><field name="creator">Tomljenovic, Lucija</field><field name="description">The tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) is a protein-protein interaction motif present in a  variety of functionally unrelated proteins. Recently, the first TPR gene was cloned from the coral Acropora millepora-AmTPR1. AmTPR1 has high similarity to human TTC4 and Drosophila Dpit47, genes implicated in tumorigenesis and cell proliferation. Using a comparative genomics approach, this thesis characterises the AmTPR1/Dpit47/TTC4 gene family in an attempt to understand the evolution of function. 
 
 Semi-quantitative PCR analysis indicates that AmTPR1 is expressed at low levels throughout the early development of Acropora. The AmTPR1 transcript was generally distributed in the early embryo, but by the end of gastrulation, transcripts were specifically associated with a subset of transectodermal cells. Treatment of Acropora embryos with the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)-specific inhibitor alsterpaullone resulted in increased expression of AmTPR1, suggesting a role of canonical Wnt/b-catenin signalling in regulating AmTPR1 expression. Consistent with this, several sequences showing 100 % homology to the core TCF/LEF-binding consensus sequence, were identified in the putative promoter regions of AmTPR1 and its closest relatives Hydra HmTPR1 and Nematostella NvTPR1 genes. Compared to AmTPR1, Drosophila Dpit47 showed different expression characteristics. Dpit47 transcripts could not be detected in early development of Drosophila (stages 6-11), while in late embryos (stages13-16), strong and specific expression of Dpit47 was observed in the central nervous system. Furthermore, in contrast to AmTPR1, the expression of Dpit47 is likely to be regulated by Myb/E2F/DREF- and not by Wnt/b-catenin-dependent transcriptional regulation. Despite having different expression patterns, yeast 2-hybrid analysis indicates that both AmTPR1 and Dpit47 interact with Hsp90 and DNA polymerase a, suggesting the possibility of functional conservation. 
 
 The expression profile of mouse TTC4 differed from both AmTPR1 and Dpit47. In mouse neuroblastoma N2A cells, treatment with the GSK- 3 inhibitors kenpaullone and LiCl had no effect on TTC4 expression. Instead, the expression of TTC4 in N2A cells was downregulated in response to depolarizing stimuli, such as 85 mM KCl. Addition of 2.3 mM Ca2+ exacerbated the extent of depolarization-induced downregulation of TTC4, indicating that TTC4 expression was Ca2+-dependent. However, the mechanism of Ca2+-dependent regulation of TTC4 expression under depolarizing conditions did not require extracellular Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) - receptor channels as treatment of N2A cells with nifedipine (L-type Ca2+ channel blocker), and NMDA did not affect the extent of TTC4 downregulation in response to 85 mM KCl. Instead, treatment with 20 mM tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) greatly exacerbated the extent of TTC4 downregulation in response to 85 mM KCl in N2A cells. The K+ channel opener mallotoxin and the mitogen bradykinin were both able to attenuate the effect of TEA on TTC4 expression under depolarizing stimuli, indicating that TTC4 expression was dependent on K+ channel activity. Consistent with the involvement of Ca2+ in regulating TTC4 expression, four nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) binding sequences were found in the 2 kb 5&#8217; region of the mouse TTC4 gene. Finally, TTC4 expression was higher in proliferating than in quiescent N2A cells and the greatest extent of upregulation was observed at the G1/S transition, suggesting TTC4 transcription was cell-cycle dependent.
 
 In summary, despite lineage-specific differences in the expression patterns and regulatory characteristics, Acropora AmTPR1, Drosophila Dpit47 and mouse TTC4 each appear to function as developmental genes involved in the regulation of proliferation coupled to the cell cycle.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5137/1/Thesis_front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5137/2/Thesis_whole_OPTIMIZED.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tropical hypogeous fungal sporocarp distribution in time and space.
 Implications for an endangered specialist, Mycophagous Marsupial, Bettongia tropica</field><field name="creator">Abell-Davis, Sandra</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors in
 determining the temporal and spatial distribution of tropical hypogeous fungal sporocarps
 along an altitude gradient of ecotonal sclerophyll forest. The implications of the fungal
 distribution on the habitat restriction within this ecotonal forest for an endangered
 specialist mycophagous marsupial, Bettongia tropica Wakefield, were subsequently
 investigated.
 
 Fungal availability was quantified in the Early-Wet, Late-Wet, Early-Dry and
 Late-dry seasons within known B. tropica habitat in seven surveys over a period of two
 years. A total of eighteen sites within three vegetation types, including wet sclerophyll
 forest, Allocasuarina forest and Eucalyptus woodland, were examined using the time
 standardised raking method, in Far North Queensland, Australia.
 Bettongia tropica is thought to be restricted to habitats where seasonal availability
 of hypogeous fungi, their principal food resource, remains high. In the first year of
 sampling a relationship was found between precipitation and fungal availability. The
 abundance of hypogeous fungi was significantly lower in the late dry season. Fungal
 availability correlated strongly with the seasonal rainfall pattern determined from 74-year
 monthly means. Alloteropsis semialata R.Br. (cockatoo grass) use by bettongs increased
 significantly during the period of low fungal availability. Bettongia tropica appear to be
 restricted to habitats where seasonal availability of hypogeous fungi, in synchrony with
 the availability of critical grass resources, remains high.
 
 Temporal fruiting and availability of ectomycorrhizal hypogeous fungal species
 has previously been linked with both temperature and moisture (season) in temperate
 northern and southern hemisphere ecosystems. In contrast, the first year of data
 suggested that precipitation may be the sole factor influencing fruiting and diversity in
 tropical ecosystems. This hypothesis was tested using the data from all seven surveys.
 Season or temperature did not appear to be associated with fruiting of tropical hypogeous
 fungi. Instead, highly significant correlations between precipitation and abundance as
 well as biomass of sporocarps were detected. Precipitation also correlated with species
 richness and significantly influenced hypogeous fungal taxonomic assemblage.
 Availability of moisture appears to be the sole factor influencing the temporal distribution
 of fruiting and diversity of hypogeous fungi in this tropical ecosystem.
 
 Spatial patterns of animal and plant diversity are used to infer mechanisms
 underlying community composition. Species distributions, associated with latitude and
 altitude gradients, are often positively correlated with moisture availability. Fungal
 taxonomic assemblage did not differ between the three contiguous vegetation types.
 Counter-intuitively, less fungal productivity occurred in one of the wettest forest types;
 wet sclerophyll forest. Higher sporocarp abundance and biomass were found in the
 Allocasuarina forest that had equivalent soil moisture levels. Fungal abundance and
 biomass appeared to be reduced by high inorganic nitrogen and phosphorous in the wet
 sclerophyll forest, while the effect of high nitrogen was counteracted by low phosphorous
 in the Allocasuarina forest.
 
 The effects of soil phosphorous as well as other environmental variables on
 hypogeous fungal availability and richness were examined further at the micro-spatial
 scale of site. As predicted, negative correlations between phosphorous and fungal
 availability were also observed at this finer scale. However, phosphorous levels could
 not entirely explain the spatial patterns of fungal richness observed. Positive correlations
 were found for the mean number of Allocasuarina stems with the number of fungal
 genera as well as species. The most plausible explanation for the mean number of fungal
 species was an interactive effect between the number of Allocasuarina stems and a
 positive correlation with altitude. As well as strengthening the evidence that phosphorous
 levels affect the availability of hypogeous fungi, analysis at the micro-spatial scale
 allowed new information about fungal richness to be uncovered. An increase in host
 monodominance appears to increase fungal richness within this ecotonal sclerophyll
 forest.
 
 These findings help to explain the habitat restriction of B. tropica within wetter
 sclerophyll habitats, increasing the temporal availability of their principal resource
 hypogeous fungi. The spatial distribution of fungal, as well as other important food
 resources, also explains B. tropica spatial habitat restriction within Allocasuarina forest
 and Eucalyptus woodland. The habitat restriction of the endangered B. tropica within a
 narrow band of ecotonal sclerophyll vegetation along the western margin of Wet Tropical
 rainforests in North Queensland Australia, can be attributed to the availability of their
 critical food resource hypogeous fungi, in both time and space.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5138/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5138/2/02whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Benefits of marine protected areas beyond boundaries: an evaluation for two coral reef fishes</field><field name="creator">Mannering, Thomas</field><field name="description">Increases in the numbers and sizes of predatory fishes in well established no-take marine
 protected areas (MPAs) on coral reefs are well-known. However, few studies have
 investigated whether adult spillover or recruitment subsidies lead to higher adult and
 juvenile densities in fished areas adjacent to MPAs, compared with fished sites further
 away from MPAs. Our understanding of these phenomena has been limited because most
 MPA studies have been restricted to comparisons of MPAs and fished areas, and do not
 consider fished areas that do not benefit from MPAs. On the Great Barrier Reef, adults of
 two recreationally important coral reef fish (Plectropomus maculatus and Lutjanus
 carponotatus) have been observed to increase in numbers in inshore no-take areas
 (&#8220;green zones&#8221;). In this thesis I made a preliminary investigation of the potential for adult
 spillover and recruitment subsidies by comparing fished areas, near to and distant from
 green zones. Firstly, I examined the early age and growth of juvenile fishes at the Keppel
 Islands, in order to define the size of young-of-the-year (0+) and estimate settlement and
 spawning periods. I used this information to estimate the densities of adults and 0+ year
 fish within green zones, fished areas within 1km from green zones and at sites greater
 than 5km from the nearest protected area.
 
 The size-age relationships for the 0+ year cohorts were determined by studies of
 sectioned sagittal otoliths. Juveniles were collected between October and November in
 2006, and May and June in 2007. The youngest P. maculatus and L. carponotatus recruits
 caught were 63 (53mm FL) and 66 days old (49mm FL) respectively, but ages extended
 to 334 days (220mm FL) for P. maculatus and 345 days (183mm FL) for L.carponotatus. Juvenile growth was rapid in both species, with P. maculatus and L.
 carponotatus averaging 0.96 mm d-1 and 0.72 mm d-1 respectively. The estimated PLD
 of P. maculatus was 28.6 days, while L. carponotatus was 33.6 days. Based on the
 observations from this study, recruitment surveys approximately two months after
 spawning would be sufficient, however, in order to include additional 0+ age cohorts,
 surveys would ideally take place 160 days after initial spawning.
 
 The potential for local benefits of MPAs were examined by comparing adult and
 recruit densities outside MPAs, both near to and distant from the MPA boundary. Adults
 and juveniles of P. maculatus and L. carponotatus were surveyed at both the Keppel
 Islands and Palm Islands, two inshore networks of no-take MPAs on the Great Barrier
 Reef. Within each region, the abundance and biomass of adults and recruits were
 compared for three treatments: (1) Within MPAs; (2) Nearby fished areas (&lt; 1km from
 MPA boundaries) and (3) distant fished areas (&gt; 5km from MPA boundaries). Site
 variation accounted for the majority of differences in both adult and recruits of P.
 maculatus and L. carponotatus. Hence, no significant differences were found for any of
 the treatments. Low densities of juveniles and patchiness in their distribution appear to
 combine to make detecting recruitment subsidies extremely difficult. I suggest
 refinements of the sampling technique, as well as alternative approaches to solving this
 problem.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5140/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5140/2/02whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temporal and environmental influences on the early establishment and
 maintenance of coral-symbiodinium symbioses</field><field name="creator">Abrego, David</field><field name="description">Understanding mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of coral-
 Symbiodinium symbioses as well as factors affecting the integrity of these symbioses is
 critical to predicting how coral holobionts might change in response to warming oceans
 predicted by climate change. Research reported in this thesis aims to enhance current
 knowledge of coral-Symbiodinium symbioses by: (1) examining temporal variation in
 Symbiodinium uptake by coral juveniles, (2) exploring the role of parental effects and
 ontogenetic stage in determining Symbiodinium associations, (3) assessing the impact of
 environmental parameters in the establishment of symbioses, and (4) evaluating whether
 some host-symbiont combinations are more resilient to environmental stress than others.
 
 I found that newly settled juveniles of the corals Acropora millepora and A.
 tenuis do not necessarily take up the Symbiodinium type present in parental colonies,
 and that a potentially opportunist type D Symbiodinium quickly dominates symbioses in
 juveniles of both species at three sites in the central Great Barrier Reef. I also found that
 adult patterns of association may not become established for up to 2.5-3.5 years,
 suggesting a delay in the expression of symbiont specificity. In A. tenuis, continuing
 changes in Symbiodinium communities over the first 3.5 years are interpreted as finetuning
 of specificity mechanisms leading to establishment of the homologous algal
 symbiont characteristic of adult populations. Algal endosymbioses were much more
 stable over the same time period in juveniles of A. millepora, although further research
 is required to distinguish between absence of specificity and delayed expression of
 specificity. Changes in Symbiodinium communities in A. tenuis juveniles are not linked
 to the onset of reproductive maturity but may be linked to changes in microenvironmental
 conditions (possibly light intensity or access to nutrients) associated with
 growth of the colony.
 
 Field studies investigating the role of environmental parameters in the
 establishment of symbioses revealed that light has little effect on the type of
 Symbiodinium initially acquired by both A. millepora and A. tenuis. This result was
 confirmed by experimental manipulations in aquaria where equal amounts of
 Symbiodinium types C1 and D were offered to newly settled juveniles maintained in two
 light levels by three temperature treatments. In contrast, I found that temperature has a
 significant effect on algal symbioses by affecting the type of Symbiodinium acquired by
 both coral species and by slowing and potentially stopping Symbiodinium uptake and
 the onset of symbioses at elevated temperatures. Type D Symbiodinium was found in
 larger proportions in juveniles at elevated temperatures (30 and 31&#176;C), providing further
 evidence of the infective and potentially opportunistic nature of this Symbiodinium type.
 The benefits of type D to the host require further investigation as these juveniles had
 low levels of infection and it is unclear if their survival would depend on other
 mechanisms, such as a shift towards heterotrophy.
 
 Comparisons of the resilience of corals hosting type C1 or D Symbiodinium to
 environmental stress indicate that A. tenuis juveniles have lower metabolic costs and
 enhanced physiological tolerance when hosting type C1 Symbiodinium. In other studies,
 the same D-type has been shown to confer higher thermal tolerance than both C2 in
 adults and C1 in juveniles of the closely related coral A. millepora. My results challenge
 speculations that associations with type D are universally most robust to thermal stress
 and highlight a potential role of host factors in determining the physiological
 performance of the holobiont. They also show that although the heat tolerance of corals
 may be contingent on the Symbiodinium strain in hospite, their response to heat and
 light stress is determined by species-specific interactions between both partners in the
 association.

The present study investigated growth mechanisms underlying sexual size dimorphism in protogynous hermaphrodites, using tropical wrasses as a focal study group. The aims were to: 1) identify a relationship between the strength of the social organization within a group and the timing of growth divergence between sex changing and non sex-changing individuals; and 2) to identify changes in behaviour and space use associated with sex change within a group. It was predicted that where individuals were under strict social control, sexual size dimorphism would come about by a growth spurt associated with sex change. It was also predicted that in more loosely controlled social groups, prior growth history would play a greater role in the development of sexual size dimorphism.
 
 The strength of social systems for four species of wrasse (family: Labridae) was quantified by behavioural observations and compared to growth trajectories of sex-changing and non-sex-changing females. The wrasse species used in this study were: Coris batuensis, Stethojulis strigiventer, Halichoeres miniatus, and Cirrhilabrus exquisitus. Behavioural observations were made throughout a male removal experiment to observe changes in behaviour within a group during the process of sex change. Growth patterns were estimated through analysis of otolith microstructures using daily increment width as a proxy for daily somatic growth. Comparisons were made of social systems and growth patterns both across species and within a species to determine if social influences on growth were species specific or specific to the social system.
 
 Check marks in the otoliths at the time of sex reversal were identified in three of the four species, with the mark occurring only in male fish.A check mark was experimentally validated in H. miniatus as occurring within the time period of sex change.When social groups were experimentally manipulated to induce sex change by removing the male, the dominant female changed sex, completing gonadal changes in less than 44 days. An increase in otolith accretion rate, or a growth spurt, was also found in sex-changing fish and this corresponded to an increase in somatic growth rate.
 
 The strength of the social systems of the study populations was found to influence the growth patterns of component individuals. Both across species and within species, size differences between males and females were found to be due to growth spurts around the time of sex change in social groups with strict social control. In contrast, prior growth history was found to be more important in the
 expression of sexual size dimorphism in groups with looser social organisation. In three of the species an initially larger increment size was found in the females that changed to male suggesting a larger otolith size at hatching in females that eventually change sex. Growth spurts were found to be important for the size dimorphism in three out of four species. Results suggest that the social system may play a major role in influencing the growth associated mechanism underlying the sexual size dimorphism in sex changing fishes, and that at times, pre-larval factors may be influencing which individuals end up becoming the dominant males in the system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5362/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5362/2/02whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chronic effects of herbicide exposure on photosynthesis, symbiosis and reproduction of reef building corals</field><field name="creator">Cantin, Neal</field><field name="description">The herbicide, diuron, is found at levels equivalent to 1 &#956;g l-1 within sediments in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, where it potentially reduces photosynthesis and carbon fixation within Symbiodinium, the dinoflagellate symbiont associated with reef corals. Little is known about the potential of diuron to reduce energy acquisition and change energy allocation strategies to reproduction in corals. The objective of this study was to examine the importance of carbon-based energy (carbohydrates) derived from photosynthesis for gametogenesis, gamete viability and larval quality of corals following the first long-term, experimental exposures to diuron and to investigate the influence of symbiont type on energy provisioning to host tissues under normal conditions and in the presence of diuron. This is the first study to investigate the chronic sub-lethal effects of herbicide-induced photoinhibition on coral symbionts and the subsequent flow on effects to the fitness of the coral host.

Total lipid content (coral tissue, oocytes and planulae) was reduced by 2.5- to 5-fold for the three species in the presence of diuron, indicating significant use of storage lipid to meet nutritional demands under conditions of chronic photoinhibition. Polyp fecundity in A. tenuis was not impacted, however it was reduced by 6-fold in A. valida, and both A. valida and P. damicornis were unable to spawn or planulate following long-term exposures to 10 &#956;g l-1 diuron.
 
 Maternal provisioning of lipids, pigments and antioxidants to coral eggs that lack Symbiodinium provides energy and protection essential for the development, survival and dispersal of coral larvae. For corals that were able to spawn or planulate following 2-3 month experimental exposures to diuron (i.e. A. valida and P. damicornis in the 0 and 1 &#956;g l-1 treatments; A tenuis in the 0, and 10 &#956;g l-1 treatments), gamete fertilisation was not affected (Chapter 3). Larvae from each of these species also successfully metamorphosed into juvenile corals following parental exposures to the above diuron treatments. Although gametes were viable, gamete quality was reduced in A. valida following even low exposures to diuron. Peridinin, the major carotenoid pigment identified in A. valida eggs, was 10-fold lower in eggs derived from corals exposed to 1.0 &#956;g l-1 diuron compared with tank controls. The tank controls in turn contained 5-fold less peridinin than field controls. In contrast, no difference in vitamin E (&#945; &#8211; tocopherol) was detected in any of the treatments. Peridinin in combination with xanthophylls may enhance the capacity of buoyant coral eggs to absorb potentially harmful high-energy photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400 - 530 nm) that is not absorbed by mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and vitamin E. All of these compounds are likely to work synergistically to protect eggs from oxidative damage.
 
 Algal endosymbionts of the genus Symbiodinium play a key role in fulfilling the nutritional requirements of reef building corals, however comparisons of photosynthetic capacity among different Symbiodinium types in hospite within the same coral species have only recently become possible. A sensitive quantitative PCR assay was developed for Symbiodinium spp. (Chapter 4) based upon chloroplast (cp) large subunit (23S) ribosomal DNA sequences, to detect low level background strains of Symbiodinium spp. It was then applied to verify symbiont assemblages within juvenile colonies of Acropora millepora that had been experimentally infected with two different symbiont types (Chapter 5). Using experimentally infected C1- and D-juveniles of A. millepora, relative electron transport (rETRMAX) of PSII, was found to be 87% greater in Symbiodinium C1 than in Symbiodinium D in hospite in the control treatment, resulting in a doubling of 14C photosynthate incorporation (energy) into juvenile tissues of A. millepora (Chapter 5). Symbiodinium C1 corals, however, lost this competitive advantage in the presence of diuron, due to inhibition of rapid electron transport. There was no observable difference in phytotoxicity of diuron between genetically distinct symbionts in situ. The finding that genetically distinct Symbiondinium spp. are not functionally equivalent, highlights the importance of symbiont identity in the nutritional physiology of the coral-algal holobiont.
 
 These results provide evidence of a link between reduced energy acquisition due to diuron exposure causing significant PSII photoinhibition and reduced reproductive output in zooxanthellate corals. Energy allocated to reproduction was directed towards maintaining and releasing fewer eggs and larvae, while ensuring the full developmental viability of these progeny. Along with diuron, other herbicides such as atrazine and Irgarol 1051 that are designed to target the PSII in the same manner as diuron, are commonly found entering the marine environment, which could create an additive effect on the chronic impacts induced by diuron exposure within the natural environment. The observed reductions in reproductive development (A. valida) and reproductive output (A. valida and P. damicornis) caused by the inhibition of energy acquisition from photosynthesis following long-term diuron exposure, highlights the importance of carbon-based energy from photosynthesis for coral reproduction and provides further evidence of physiological trade-offs that can result following events that limit the availability of energetic resources to individual coral colonies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5331/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5331/2/02whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Female biology as sacred: Australian women's bio-spiritual experiences of menstruation and birth</field><field name="creator">Moloney, Sharon</field><field name="description">This thesis illuminates the spirituality of women's experiences of menstruation and birth. In Western, patriarchal culture, these female body processes are usually seen as non-spiritual and medical concerns. Women learn to devalue and detach from our menstrual rhythms which
 become associated with pathology, shame and the profane. In contrast, pre-patriarchal cultures and some Indigenous and Eastern traditions have recognised menstruation and birth as times of heightened spirituality. For many women, myself included, birth is something of profound spiritual significance. Yet obstetric medicine, which is widely accepted as the norm for our birth practices, does not regard spiritual experience as its domain. For most Australian women, birth occurs in hospital with an intervention model that treats the process as purely physical. As a consequence, many women experience high rates of intervention, birth trauma, spiritual distress, lactation problems, difficulties bonding with their babies and post-natal depression.
 
 The aim of my qualitative feminist study was to explore how patriarchal constructions of female body processes influence women's experiences of menstruation, birth and spirituality. To examine the links between cultural attitudes to menstruation, women's birthing experiences
 and spirituality, I used a cultural feminist perspective. Cultural feminism views patriarchy as the cultural dynamics that devalue women, rather than supposedly inherent male characteristics. Affirming the affinity of the female body with the Earthbody, it studies both pre-patriarchal and
 Indigenous cultures that have honoured the sacred aspects of the female dimension of being. Quantum theory, with its assertion of a fundamental underlying unity in the universe and its radically different conceptualisation of order, was the paradigm underpinning the research.
 
 The methodology I used was Organic Inquiry, a new and emerging methodology which presumes research as a partnership with Spirit. Situated in a participatory paradigm rather than the modernist worldview, Organic Inquiry is ideally suited to topics with a psycho-spiritual
 orientation. It incorporates feeling, intuitive and body-based information alongside intellectual knowledge as vital aspects of human experience in both data collection and analysis. To my knowledge, my research is the first organic study to be completed in the Australian context. My study involved ten in-depth interviews and seven women's circles with Queensland women, with my subjectivity and personal experiences of the topic transparently included as part of the data.
 
 My research findings exposed the cumulative gendered oppression that women experience through the patriarchal construction of both menstruation and birth. Menstrual
 shame was identified as a core patriarchal organising principle that inculcates and perpetuates male dominance and female subordination. Engendering the perception of female physiology - and thus womanhood - as inherently flawed, menstrual shame was a key factor that predisposed
 women to approach birth feeling fearful, disempowered and vulnerable to intervention. The dominance of obstetric discourse in the hospital environment, perpetuated by both obstetricians and midwives, was identified as a cultural maladaptation which is a major source of women's
 disempowerment at birth. Disguised under the rhetoric of 'risk' and 'safety', the patriarchal underpinnings of this discourse avoid detection and gain widespread acceptance. Women were often traumatised by their hospital birth experiences but interpreted the trauma as their own
 failure and subsequently felt disempowered as mothers.
 
 However, despite the pervasive effects of these patriarchal constraints, my research also unearthed a robust counter-cultural group of women who had transformed their relationship with both menstruation and birth. Many underwent a remarkable transformation of meaning in
 which their bleeding became sacred. There were three main pathways for this change: the birth of a first or subsequent child, attending a menstruation workshop or ceremony, and a spontaneous spiritual awakening. Redesignating menstruation as a spiritual phenomenon
 enabled women to heal their menstrual shame, connect with their female spirituality and give birth fearlessly and powerfully. My findings also show how the process of labour, with its unique hormonal and physiological states, makes it possible for a woman to penetrate beyond the hubris of patriarchal conditioning into a life-changing spiritual experience of self. When women felt safe, supported and treated as the central person in the process, they described how labour and birth became an altered state of consciousness associated with intense pleasure,spiritual bliss and deep personal transformation.
 
 In Western culture, the spirituality of menstruation and birth has been forgotten. This thesis recommends widespread cultural reform of derogatory attitudes to menstruation, beginning at menarche, as a precursor to confident birthing. Indigenous and Eastern spiritual traditions provide examples of cultural practices that honour women for the cosmological power of their bodies. These practices could be adapted to suit the contemporary Western context.
 Humanising birth and respecting its sacredness requires a major attitudinal shift by caregivers away from the positivist approach which is demonstrably damaging for mothers and babies. The quantum paradigm more accurately reflects the understanding that we exist in a web of
 relationships, that observation changes what is observed, that wholeness is the fundamental principle of the universe and that human beings - especially birthing women - can access this underlying wholeness in a special and trustworthy way during labour and birth.
 
 This thesis recommends that the profound spirituality of birth be safeguarded by a revolution in caregivers' training. Recommended curriculum reforms are a shift to the quantum paradigm, the teaching of professional reflexivity and accountability skills, the presumption of birth as a trustworthy natural process for the majority of women and a woman-centred model of care. It is further recommended that accountability protocols be incorporated into existing
 maternity services. In addition, women and their partners need to put themselves back at the centre of the birth process, no longer looking to obstetrics as the expert authority on healthy birthing.
 
 Unshackling female biology and the Sacred Female from their patriarchal moorings are critical feminist projects with global repercussions for the twenty-first century. When women reclaim menstruation and birth as our sacred territory, we recover our connection to nature, to the Earth and to our own life-giving power and authority. At this critical time in the history of our planet when climate change increasingly threatens our survival, the resurgence of this sacred aspect of the female dimension of being can playa pivotal role in countering the destructive aspects of patriarchal modernity and restore humanity's life-sustaining connection to the Earth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5377/1/01Extended_abstract.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of shock protein 70 (hsp70), ubiquitin and gill-associated virus in loss of production on prawn farms</field><field name="creator">Elliott, Elisabeth</field><field name="description">Shock protein 70 (hsp70), ubiquitin (Ub) and gill-associated virus (GAV) were chosen as bio-indicators in an attempt to determine if they could be used to predict production of Penaeus monodon on a farm. To investigate the response of these bio-indictors with respect to changes in environmental factors, an ELISA for Ub was developed and previously developed ELISAs for hsp70 and GAV were optimised. 
 
 The utility of the ELISAs with respect to farm conditions, changes in the expression of hsp70 and Ub relative to health status, transportation and laboratory-induced hypoosmotic stress in cultured P. monodon was investigated. Protein expression as determined by ELISA, showed samples from the high yield pond had significantly lower optical density for hsp70 and Ub than the low yield pond (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001 respectively). Transport (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.05) and osmotically stressed (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001) groups showed a significantly higher response for hsp70 and Ub when compared to the control group. These results indicated that further investigations using farm data were justified. 
 
 A trial was undertaken in collaboration with a commercial prawn farm who supplied all the environmental and production data for the trial period. Two investigations were undertaken using this data. The first was to investigate changes in the hsp70, Ub and GAV responses in relation to environmental factors. There were significant correlations between all factors, the greatest number were associated with hsp70 (22 significant correlation coefficients) followed by GAV (18 significant correlation coefficients) and then Ub (17 significant correlation coefficients). In general the correlations between bio-indicators were positive and the environmental factors showed mostly negative correlations with the bio-indicators. 
 
 To determine the biological significance of these interactions, correlation analysis was conducted for each bio-indicator and environmental factor for all ponds daily from six days prior to sampling up to and including the day of sampling. The major environmental factors identified were pH (am) and salinity (am).
 
 Morning pH was negatively correlated to hsp70 at day of sampling and four days prior to sampling with a dramatic correlation coefficient increase at five and six days prior to sampling. A similar pattern was noted with Ub. Salinity (am) was negatively correlated to hsp70, Ub and GAV at all days. Principal component analysis was used in an attempt to better understand the underlying factors that explained the correlations and to reduce the data necessary for farmers to monitor. Five components were produced. Component one consists of four factors; days in pond, salinity (am), hsp70 and GAV. Components two to five consists of two factors in each component being temperature (am and pm) in component two, secchi (am and pm) in component three, pH (am and pm) in component and DO (am) and Ub in component five. The total cumulative variance explained by the five components was 74.3%.
 
 The next study investigated changes in the hsp70, Ub and GAV responses in relation to production factors. There were significant correlations between all factors, the greatest number were associated with hsp70 and GAV (28 significant correlation coefficients) and then Ub (10 significant correlation coefficients). In general, correlations between hsp70 and GAV and production factors were positive. Survival was the only exception with negative correlations for hsp70 and GAV.
 
 Production factors and the bio-indicators were subjected to principal component analysis. Two components were produced. Component one consisted of five factors, being days in pond, average body weight, yield, hsp70 and food conversion ratio. Component two consisted of two factors, survival and Ub. The total cumulative variance explained for the two components was 61.7%.
 
 Discriminant analysis was performed to determine 1) if the bio-indicators and environmental factors could be used to distinguish between specified production outcomes and 2) which factors contribute most to these outcomes. Production factors were separated into the mutually exclusive categories of &lt; or &gt; 70% survival and &lt; or &gt; 7 tonnes/hectare (yield).
 Using am data only, the number of factors required to correctly classify greater than 70% of the ponds for both survival and yield was reduced to seven and five respectively.
 
 Of these, the factors most important in distinguishing between the categories were days in pond, hsp70, salinity and to a lesser extent, dissolved oxygen. Using classification and regression tree analysis, decision trees were developed for the production factors. A maximum average body weight of 23.9 g was predicted if the minimum morning salinity can be kept below 38 ppt and the morning pH can be kept below 7.8. A minimum average body weight of 13.4 g was predicted if the minimum morning salinity was &gt;= 38 ppt and the prawns had been in the pond for &lt; 129.5 days. A maximum survival of 85% was predicted if the morning dissolved oxygen level can be kept at &gt;= 4.4 ppm and the optical density of GAV is &gt;= 0.191. A minimum survival of 50.8% was predicted if morning dissolved oxygen levels are &lt; 4.4 ppm and the minimum evening salinity is &lt;32.8 ppt. Food conversion ratio appears to be largely dependent on days in pond. The best food conversion ratio (1.43) was predicted if the prawns were in the pond &lt; 113.5 days and the worst (1.8) was if the prawns had been in the pond between 113.5 and 136.5 days and the morning pH was &gt;= 7.95. A maximum yield of 8.01 tonnes/hectare was predicted if the prawns had been in the pond for &gt;= 166.5 days and the minimum was 3.11 tonnes/hectare at &lt; 119 days in pond. Secchi and GAV also played a role in yield outcomes. A maximum biomass of 6650 kg/pond was predicted if morning salinity was kept below 40 ppt and the prawns were in the pond for &gt;= 168 days and a minimum biomass of 2740 kg/pond was predicted is morning salinity was above 41.5 ppt.
 
 It is concluded that hsp70 may be a useful indicator relating to transport stress, survival and yield of P. monodon in a commercial setting. The results presented here show the successful development of statistical models based on environmental factors for the prediction of production outcomes that are both practical and interpretable at farm level. Continued investigation and development of predictive methods for production outcomes and profitability associated with prawn farms is recommended.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5379/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5379/2/02whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors responsible for the high rate of kidney disease in Indigenous Australians: a multifaceted approach focusing on streptococcal disease
</field><field name="creator">Boon, Virginia</field><field name="description">Indigenous communities in rural Australia have high rates of streptococcal disease including
 post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). The epidemiology of PSGN and
 streptococcal infection and the pathogenesis of streptococcal disease in these lower socioeconomic
 communities is complex and not well understood. To gain an understanding of
 some aspects of this problem, this study tested several hypotheses. The major hypothesis
 underlying this project was that streptococci isolated from these communities will produce
 particular virulence factors (proteins) that will cause PSGN and that this can be demonstrated
 both in an animal model and in individuals with end-stage renal failure (ESRF). A second
 hypothesis was that dogs in these communities will play a role in the epidemiology of human
 streptococcal disease. These hypotheses gave rise to three objectives. Firstly; to determine if
 dogs residing in Indigenous communities carry streptococci that may be implicated in the
 high rate of streptococcal disease in the human residents of these communities. Secondly; to
 develop a murine model of PSGN to investigate the role of streptococcal inhibitor of
 complement mediated cell lysis (SIC) and the genetics of host in the pathogenesis of PSGN.
 Thirdly; to determine the association between elevated streptococcal antibody levels in
 patients to several streptococcal virulence factors and the presence of ESRF.
 
 The first objective was achieved by sampling dogs residing in two geographically distinct
 Australian Indigenous rural communities to reduce the possibility of location bias. Both
 pharyngeal and skin swabs were obtained from the study animals. Utilising routine
 microbiological tests and culturing methods, presumptive streptococcal species were
 isolated. Following this, the isolate was identified to the species level with biochemical tests
 and Lancefield serological grouping was also performed. The study isolated streptococcal
 species of Lancefield&#8217;s group A, B, C, D, G and L from the dogs. The specific species
 isolated were Streptococcus orisratti (Lancefield group A), Streptococcus dysgalactiae
 subsp. equisimilis (Lancefield&#8217;s group A, C, G or L), Streptococcus agalactiae (Lancefield&#8217;s
 group B), Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (Lancefield&#8217;s group C),
 Streptococcus equi subsp. equi (Lancefield&#8217;s group C), Streptococcus canis (Lancefield&#8217;s
 group G), Streptococcus bovis I (Lancefield&#8217;s group D), Streptococcus minor (no
 Lancefield&#8217;s group identified) and Streptococcus suis sp. (no Lancefield&#8217;s group identified) .
 In this study the fact that the two species that carried the Lancefield&#8217;s group A antigen were
 not biochemically identified as Streptococcus pyogenes highlights the need to assign species
 based on biochemical tests and not rely solely on serological grouping systems. The overall
 prevalence of pharyngeal and skin carriage (including the following genera&#8217;s: Streptococcus,
 Enterococcus, Lactococcus and Aerococcus) was 47 and 10.8%, respectively.
 
 Furthermore, in the current study, ten strains of large-colony forming beta-haemolytic
 S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis were identified from the pharynx of dogs which were
 taxonomically identical to &#8216;human strains&#8217;. This species of Lancefield group C and G are
 important human pathogens that share virulence factors with S. pyogenes and pharyngeal
 carriage of this bacterium in Australian Indigenous communities is high. Therefore,
 molecular studies were undertaken on the dog isolates to determine if they share virulence
 factors with the &#8216;human&#8217; strains. Specifically, bacterial isolates of Lancefield&#8217;s group A, B,
 C, G or L were included in the molecular study and an isolate of Streptococcus minor which
 is a newly recognised species. To determine if these bacteria possessed virulence factors
 which have been identified in S. pyogenes of pathogenic origin, the isolates were screened by
 polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides that were specific for S. pyogenes
 virulence genes. The gene for the M or M-like protein was found in isolates of S. canis,
 S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis and S. equi subsp. equi at a prevalence of 23.1, 90 and
 100%, respectively. Tested isolates of S. agalactiae, S. canis, S. dysgalactiae subsp.
 equisimilis and S. orisratti harboured the streptokinase (ska) gene at prevalence rates of 62-
 100%. None of the dog isolates tested harboured a gene encoding the streptococcal C5a
 peptidase protein. The gene encoding streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin type G was found in
 80% of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strains and 100% of S. minor strains. Ten percent
 of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strains carried a gene encoding the fibronectin binding
 protein.
 
 This aspect of the study found that genes for various virulence factors considered significant
 to human health were present in the dog isolates at varying prevalence rates. This study
 showed that dogs residing in Australian Indigenous communities, where socioeconomic
 factors such as overcrowded housing conditions and poor water quality exist, carry
 streptococci which may mediate human disease. Furthermore, these findings suggest that in
 these populations where humans and animals live in close proximity, gene-transfers have
 occurred between traditional human and animal streptococcal populations.
 
 The findings of this study are highly significant and support the hypothesis that streptococci
 carried by dogs are important in the epidemiology of streptococcal disease in Indigenous
 residents of rural communities. This project has provided the justification for integrated
 epidemiological studies of humans and dogs in these communities to further test the
 hypothesis.
 
 To investigate the pathogenesis of PSGN a murine model for PSGN was developed using the
 congenic variant (NOD.C-Hc) of the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse and the streptococcal
 virulence protein SIC. We found that the production of complement component 5 was a
 genetic factor that was involved in the development of PSGN. Furthermore, using this
 murine model for PSGN, we showed that the production of SIC protein by nephritic strains
 of S. pyogenes is related to the capacity of the strain to induce nephritis.
 
 Finally, to investigate whether streptococci played a role in ESRF, ELISA tests were
 developed to detect antibodies against virulence factors in human serum and used to screen
 patients on haemodialysis. A significantly higher proportion of patients compared to controls
 were seropositive to SIC (P=0.018), CRS (P=0.0098) and DRS (P=0.0003). Regression
 analysis showed seroreactivity to DRS (R2=0.85, P=0&#8226;001) predicted the development of
 ESRF. These results suggest that these ESRF patients were exposed to strains of S. pyogenes
 that secrete SIC, CRS and DRS and may have a pathological significance. No significant
 difference was observed between Indigenous patients and the non-Indigenous patients.
 
 The studies described in this thesis have resulted in significant advances in our
 understanding of streptococcal disease, particularly as it relates to renal disease in
 Indigenous communities in rural Australia. The project has contributed significantly to
 knowledge in the three study topics. Firstly, carriage of streptococci by dogs has been
 demonstrated. Furthermore, the horizontal transfer of genes for virulence factors present in
 human streptococcal strains to canine streptococci is a major advance. It highlights the
 necessity to consider dogs in the epidemiology of streptococcal disease in Indigenous
 communities. Secondly, the rodent model for PSGN appears to be arguably the best
 developed so far and will allow testing of more virulence factors. Finally, the demonstration
 of an association between ESRF and antibody levels to particular virulence factors supports
 the hypothesis that chronic streptococcal infection plays a role in this disease and justifies
 further studies to test the hypothesis, even antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent progression of
 PSGN.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5463/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5463/2/02whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation genetics of the Java sparrow (Padda oryzivora) and an analysis of its viability</field><field name="creator">Yuda, Pramana</field><field name="description">The problem of how to conserve small and declining populations is currently
 receiving considerable attention in the ecological literature, particularly through the
 theoretical development of conservation biology and its application to endangered
 species conservation. This is true despite basic information on the natural history of
 most endangered species being very limited; not only for species that are very rare,
 elusive or living in remote areas, but also for species which occupy more accessible
 habitat (i.e. cultivated areas), such as the Java sparrow (Padda oryzivora).
 
 In the research outlined in this thesis, field studies and molecular analyses
 were combined to establish the current population status, level of continued threat,
 contemporary connectivity among remnant populations and the genetic diversity of
 the endangered Java sparrow. Field work included intensive censuses at 6 sites across
 Central and East Java during the 2004 and 2005 breeding seasons. To gain
 information about the current scale of trading and trafficking of Java sparrows, the
 numbers of birds for sale were surveyed at 7 bird markets, mostly situated close to
 the bird census sites. Further interviews with bird trappers established the level of
 trapping and distribution of trapping sites.
 
 DNA was extracted from both fresh whole blood (field samples) and tissue
 samples (museum specimens) and analysed using two different molecular marker
 systems &#8211; part one and two of the mtDNA control region and 5 independent nuclear
 microsatellite loci. MtDNA sequence data were used to infer phylogeography and
 historical demography of the Java sparrow, while, multi-locus microsatellite
 genotyping was used to assess contemporary connectivity and levels of genetic
 variation. In order to predict the future fate of the Java sparrow, a PVA and
 sensitivity analysis was also undertaken. Stochastic modelling was carried out using
 the program VORTEX.
 
 The results of this study highlight that remnant populations of Java sparrow
 in Central and East Java are currently small and highly fragmented. Based on roost
 counts at 6 sites, population estimates range from 5.8 (&#177; 0.2 SE) to 125.2 (&#177; 1.7 SE).
 The total estimated population for Central and East Java did not exceed 1000 individuals. If other regions of Indonesia within the species&#8217; natural range have
 similar abundances, then the total Java sparrow population in Indonesia is likely to
 be at the lower end of the range of 2500 &#8211; 10,000 individuals that is currently used to
 classify the species as &#8216;Vulnerable&#8217;.
 The major threat from trapping and trading is still ongoing at a high level,
 with an average 59.3 % of the total population estimates being trapped during the
 study period. This threat is particularly severe in central Java, where market demands
 were mainly supplied by local wild caught birds. In contrast, in the east Java bird
 markets, introduced and captive bred birds were substituted to satisfy high market
 demand. These findings emphasize the potential abundance of Java sparrows that
 may occur in currently unstudied introduced populations on outer islands (e.g.
 Kalimantan), and the important role that introduced and captive bred birds currently
 have in mitigating further declines. They also highlight the potential usefulness of
 these introduced populations as part of future conservation schemes for the Java
 sparrow.
 
 Analysis of mtDNA sequence data was used to infer the effects of historic
 habitat changes on population demography and genetic diversity in the Java sparrow.
 Despite an expectation that this species would have increased habitat availability
 during glacial maxima, analysis based on standard mtDNA mutation rates revealed
 that major climatic shifts have caused bottlenecking in Java sparrows similar to those
 observed in temperate species impacted by expanding ice sheets. Alternatively, using
 more recently derived and contrasting mtDNA mutation rates suggests the Java
 sparrow was bottlenecked during the expansion of rainforest in the early Holocene,
 and likely expanded during deforestation associated with the arrival of cultivation to
 Java. If correct, this finding adds to an increasing number of studies highlighting the
 impact of human colonization on the distribution and abundance of endemic species.
 
 Microsatellite genotyping demonstrated that genetic variation in remnant Java
 sparrow populations was low, in the middle range of genetic variation observed for
 other endangered species. Levels of diversity among contemporary populations did
 not differ from historic samples. In addition, significant structuring was found among
 remnant but not historic populations, implying recent fragmentation and limited
 current inter-population movement. Therefore, it is likely that while recent population declines have, as yet, had limited impact on genetic diversity, they have
 had a significant impact on levels of inter-population gene flow.
 
 Stochastic PVA modelling suggested that, under a best case scenario, Java
 sparrows would be able to recover. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the PVA models
 were most sensitive to mortality and fecundity schedules. However, the results
 highlighted that further field studies of these parameters are necessary to gain a more
 realistic assessment of the potential fate of the Java sparrow over both the short and
 longer term. PVA also suggested that if the current level of trapping continues Java
 sparrow will become extinct within a very short period of time. Given that
 terminating trapping seems an unlikely short-term management option, these
 findings highlight the immediate need to formulate a trapping/harvesting strategy
 that minimizes the risk of extinction.
 
 The implications of the results of this research are as follows:
 1. It is proposed that the conservation status of Java sparrow to be transferred from
 Vulnerable to Endangered (A2a,b,d; E). This research also provides a more
 robust, high quality data set that can be used for conservation status assessment.
 2. Trapping remains the main threatening process and must be reduced before other
 conservation measures can be effective. The use of captive bred and/or
 introduced birds should be encouraged to meet market demands. Further
 population studies on introduced populations (e.g. in Kalimantan) are a necessity
 to develop the sustainable use of these resources.
 3. For management purposes the Java sparrow can be considered as a single
 Management Unit. However, to develop a sound conservation strategy for this
 species, it is important to take into account the concept of &#8220;ecological
 exchangeability&#8221;. For this purpose we need studies of behaviour, life history, and
 morphology relative to environment. Such studies will allow more meaningful
 assessment of biologically relevant differentiation among the remnant
 populations of the Java sparrow.
 4. There is also a need for further research on demographic parameters and breeding
 biology to gain more realistic predictions of population viability.
 5. There is a critical short-term need to formulate a trapping/harvesting strategy to
 minimize the extinction risk. Working thresholds need to be established as a short-term management priority and as a basis for more effective and sustainable
 management strategies over the longer term.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5461/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5461/2/02whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The multi-term Boltzmann equation analysis and Monte Carlo study of hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic charged particle swarms</field><field name="creator">Dujko, Sasa</field><field name="description">The progress and further improvement of modern technology associated with the non-equilibrium magnetized plasma discharges require the most accurate modeling of charged particle transport under the influence of electric and magnetic fields in neutral gases. It is the aim of this Thesis to present a theoretical and numerical investigation of hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic charged particle swarms in neutral gases under the influence of dc and ac electric and magnetic fields with applications of non-equilibrium magnetized plasma discharges to plasma processing, gas laser discharges and drift chambers for detection particles in mind. Two complimentary techniques are developed: A time-dependent true multi-term solution of Boltzmann&#8217;s equation and a Monte Carlo simulation technique, both adapted to consider both time-dependent hydrodynamic and steady state non-hydrodynamic conditions. The accuracy and generality of both techniques are established in their application to benchmark systems (existing and developed as part of the thesis) as well as the application to real gaseous systems.
 
 Binary elastic, inelastic and non-conservative (attachment and electron impact ionization) collisions between the swarm particles and neutral gas molecules are considered. The angular dependence of the phase space distribution function in velocity space is represented in terms of an expansion in spherical harmonics. No restrictions are placed on the number of spherical harmonics in the polynomial expansion nor on the space and time-dependence of the phase space distribution function. In addition, there are no restrictions on the mass ratio between the swarm particle and neutral gas molecule (e.g., the present formalism is equally valid for electrons and ions) nor on the neutral gas temperature and cross sections. The speed dependence of the phase space distribution function is represented by an expansion in Sonine polynomials about a Maxwellian distribution function using a well-known two-temperature method. By doing so, the Boltzmann equation is decomposed into a hierarchy of coupled kinetic equations for tensorial expansion coefficients.
 
 For time-dependent hydrodynamic regime, the space dependence of the phase space distribution function is represented in terms of powers of density gradient operator. A second order density gradient expansion was required to highlight the explicit modification of transport coefficients about by non-conservative collisional processes of attachment and electron impact ionization. Employing the implicit finite difference scheme for evaluation of the time-derivatives, the Boltzmann equation under conditions of time-dependent hydrodynamic regime is transformed into a hierarchy of doubly infinite coupled inhomogeneous matrix equations for the
 time-dependent moments. Truncation of both the Sonine polynomials and spherical harmonics results in a sparse system of coupled complex equations. This system of equations is solved using standard sparse inversion routines.
 
 Under non-hydrodynamic conditions (such as those found in an idealized steady-state Townsend (SST) experiment) a density gradient expansion procedure is not valid and the space dependence of the phase space distribution function is retained explicitly throughout the entire decomposition process of the Boltzmann equation. For numerical discretization in configuration space the finite difference scheme and pseudo-spectral method are employed. Boundary conditions are specified for swarms undergoing conservative collisions only and techniques for solving the resulting large system of algebraic complex equations are discussed. The explicit effects of ionization and attachment on the spatially resolved electron transport properties under non-hydrodynamic conditions are investigated by a Monte Carlo simulation technique. In particular, we identify the relations for the conversion of hydrodynamic transport properties to those found in an idealized steady-state Townsend experiment. Our Monte Carlo simulation code and sampling techniques appropriate to these experiments have provided us with a way to test these conversion formulae and their convergence.
 
 For swarms moving in an unbounded gas under hydrodynamic conditions when non-conservative collisions are operative, we focus on two situations: (i) temporal relaxation of the electrons in dc electric and magnetic fields crossed at arbitrary angle; and (ii) time-dependent behavior of electron swarms in ac electric and magnetic fields crossed at arbitrary angle and at arbitrary phase difference. There are no restrictions on the field amplitudes nor on the frequency of the applied electric and magnetic fields. Recent studies on the temporal relaxation of electrons in
 gases are extended by overcoming the inherent inaccuracies of the two-term approximation for solving the Boltzmann equation and by addressing the temporal relaxation of spatial inhomogeneities through a study of the diffusion tensor. In the framework of ac studies, the variation of the electron transport coefficients with electric and magnetic field strengths, field frequency, phase difference between the fields and angle between the fields is addressed using physical arguments for certain model and real gases. A multitude of kinetic phenomena were observed that are generally inexplicable through the use of steady-state dc transport theory. Phenomena of significant note include the existence of transient negative diffusivity, time-resolved negative differential conductivity and anomalous anisotropic diffusion. Most notably, a proposed new mechanism for collisional heating in inductively coupled plasmas has emerged from this thesis. It is shown that the synergism of temporal non-locality and cyclotron resonance effect under conditions of time-dependent, high frequency electric and magnetic fields can be used to pump the energy into the swarm. In particular, it is demonstrated that the magnetic field amplitude, phase-difference between the fields and field frequency can be tuned to exploit/control this phenomenon.
 
 The synergism of magnetic field and non-conservative collisions on spatial relaxation of a swarm of charged particles in an idealized SST experiment is investigated. Results are presented for electrons in varying configurations of dc electric and magnetic fields for certain model and real gases. It is found that the spatial relaxation characteristics including the type of relaxation (monotonic/oscillatory), the relaxation length and period of oscillations can be controlled either by the variation of the magnetic field strengths or by the angles between the fields.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5479/1/Thesis_front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5479/2/Chapters_1-6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5479/3/Chapter_7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5479/4/Chapter_8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5479/5/Chapters_9-10.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5479/6/Appendices_and_Bibliography.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A rheological study of ammonium phosphate slurries
</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Graeme Robert</field><field name="description">Phosphate Hill is a mine site located in North West Queensland. At the site, mined phosphoric rock is reacted with sulphuric acid to produce phosphoric acid. The phosphoric acid is combined with ammonia in a reactor known as the pre-neutraliser. The reaction forms a very hot and viscous slurry which is later further ammoniated in a cylindrical vessel known as a granulator, to produce solid fertiliser granules of mono-ammonium phosphate (MAP) or di-ammonium phosphate (DAP). Two important parameters used in the processing of ammonium phosphate slurries are the nitrogen to phosphorous mole ratio (MR) and the specific gravity (SG). Both of these parameters can affect the rheology of the slurry produced inside the reactor. The impurities carried over in the phosphoric acid from the reaction with the phosphate rock can also have significant effects on the rheology of the slurry. The objective of this study was to examine the rheological characteristics of the ammonium phosphate slurries formed in the pre-neutraliser (PN) and determine how the viscosity changes with mole ratio, impurity composition and specific gravity.
 
 There is a lot of variability in the literature on the rheology of ammonium phosphate slurries. Previous work did not take into account the non-Newtonian nature of the slurry, whilst also basing their findings on plant based measurements, where proper control of the slurry properties would have been difficult. A bulk quantity of phosphoric acid was collected from Phosphate Hill and used as a baseline for testing the effect of adding impurities. Laboratory grade FePO4, AlPO4 and Mg3(PO4)2 were added to the plant acid to form acids of varying impurity content. Further to the viscosity experiments, work was conducted to determine the slurry particle size, chemical composition (by XRD/XRF analysis), solubility of precipitates and physical characteristics, in an attempt to explain the mechanisms behind the observed viscosity changes. Testing the viscosity of ammonium phosphate slurry was found to be very time consuming and problematic. The experimental work was complicated by a multitude of factors, including high temperatures, slow reaction and evaporation times, the precipitation of impurities and the solidification of the slurry.
 
 The trend in the viscosity with mole ratio for the as-received acid was similar to that seen in the literature. The addition of both aluminium and iron caused an increase in the viscosity around the MAP minimum solubility point of 0.9 MR. In both cases, the formation of hydrolysis products were shown to have reduced the particle size of the precipitating ammonium phosphate crystals, thus increasing the viscosity. As the mole ratio is increased, mono-ammonium phosphate combines with the additional ammonia to form di-ammonium phosphate. The hydrolysis products for iron also changed at the same time and the resultant slurry formed particles with high interparticle attractive forces which in turn formed a flocculated suspension. Increasing the iron content not only increased the viscosity in this region, but also lowered the mole ratio whereby the increase in viscosity is seen to occur. An increase in the aluminium content had no effect on the viscosity at higher mole ratios. Based on the findings, it is recommended that slurries containing high iron be preferentially processed to make mono-ammonium phosphate and slurries with high aluminium be preferentially processed to make di-ammonium phosphate.
 
 Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling was conducted on the mixing dynamics of the PN vessel. The CFD model showed that the upper region of the vessel was the least well mixed. The potential for stagnation of the flow field and subsequent solidification increases when the viscosity of the slurry also increases. To counteract this threat, the volume of slurry in the reactor must be decreased, or the agitation speed increased. The most effective method to ensure proper mixing dynamics in the vessel was to lower the viscosity, by preferentially processing each slurry by its impurity content as mentioned above.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5485/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5485/2/02whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using the Rasch model to validate the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales&#8211;second edition in infants and pre-school children</field><field name="creator">Chien, Chi-Wen</field><field name="description">The current research utilized the Rasch model analysis to examine the dimensional structure of the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-Second Edition (PDMS-2). Furthermore, the three-point rating scales, differential item functioning (DIF), and hierarchical structures of the PDMS-2 items were examined for their utility in discriminating various levels of motor development, for items&#8217; function stability across gender and disease entity, and for positioning in a valid hierarchy of difficulty.
 
 The study tested a total of 419 children in Taiwan (including 342 normal children and 77 children with motor delays or difficulties) using the PDMS-2. The three-point rating scales of 180 PDMS-2 items exhibited problems (such as infrequently used categories and disordering step calibration), and thus the rating scales for these items were collapsed to allow only dichotomous responses. Each of the six PDMS-2 subtests formed a unidimensional scale after 21 misfitting items were removed. Additionally, the gross motor, fine motor, and overall motor ability were constructed by combining certain subtests, supporting the theorized dimensionality of the PDMS-2. Fifty-eight items within the subtests demonstrated DIF between children with/out motor problems, while only 35 items demonstrated DIF across gender. The hierarchical order of the PDMS-2 items established using Rasch model showed considerable similarity to the original hierarchy that was ranked by age. The PDMS-2 items had wide coverage but inadequate targeting of the children in the study.
 
 The findings from the research indicated that the reduced PDMS-2 test encompassing dichotomous rating scales in the particular items, is a valid measure of motor development in infants and preschool children. However, further work is needed to improve the inadequate targeting by adding more suitable items.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5486/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/5486/2/02whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The people's university : a study of the relationship between the South Australian School of Mines and Industry/South Australian Institute of Technology and the University of Adelaide (with reference to the relationship between the School/Institute and the South Australian Department of Education) 1987-1977</field><field name="creator">Aeuckens, Annely.</field><field name="description">A thesis presented for the Degree of Master of Arts, Department of History, The University of Adelaide.

In this thesis we demonstrated various applications of optical tweezers in botanical sciences, chemical engineering and anatomical sciences. The investigation of the three-dimensional shape of spinach chloroplasts has been accomplished. This was done using a steerable and a stationary trap system. A trapped rotating calcite crystal positioned close to a chloroplast provided means for inducing the rotation and orientation of chloroplast. The utility of rotating birefringent particles is demonstrated for the first time in biological applications. The stirrer method is a versatile method in orienting any biological object to study its shape and/or structure. Also, we demonstrated the ability of optical tweezers to fix and displace chloroplasts inside a living spinach plant cell. In the second part of the work described in this thesis, the steerable trap was used to study the viscoelastic properties of a polymeric filament that connects a single bacterium to an activated sludge floc. Also we estimated the minimum bonding force that can cause a weak interaction between the bacterium surface and the filament using optical tweezers as a transducer. This force was estimated to be at least 10 pN. These measurements are of value in improving activated sludge flocculation and ultimately the wastewater treatment process. In addition, the steerable trap was used to move small organelles inside large bacteria cells. The repositioning of organelles resulted in creating new internal cell structure. In the final part of the thesis, experiments are described where the laser tweezers system was combined with a cw argon-ion laser microbeam to investigate the fusion of smooth muscle cells and macrophages. In order to minimize the optical damage to the cells, a special arrangement was established to create short pulses for cutting the contact of the cell membrane of the two-fusion cell partners. The effectiveness of the cutting function of the pulsed system when used at 488 nm wavelength varied from cell to cell. The laser parameters such as laser power, pulse duration and repetition rate were varied in order to obtain the best working function of the setup. But overall the results indicate that the relatively long (ms) pulses possible may not be well suited to such applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240402 Quantum Optics and Lasers</field><field name="subject">biological micromanipulation</field><field name="subject">optical tweezers</field><field name="subject">steerable traps</field><field name="subject">particles</field><field name="subject">micromanipulation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10613</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solar Line Asymmetries: Modelling The Effect Of Granulation On The Solar Spectrum</field><field name="creator">Nieminen, Timo A.</field><field name="description">A parametric model of granulation employing a small number of parameters was developed. Synthetic spectra calculated using this model closely match observed spectra and, in particular, reproduce the asymmetries observed in spectral lines. Both the microturbulent motions and the large-scale flow velocity decrease exponentially with a scale height of 368 km as the height within the photosphere increases. The model agrees with observations of the solar granulation (from which it was derived). The horizontal motions associated with granulation were found and used to calculate spectra emergent away from disk centre. These calculated spectra were compared to observed spectra, with the agreement supporting the accuracy of the granular model. Also in the course of this work, the Brueckner-O'Mara damping theory was found to predict damping constants accurately. The photospheric abundances of a number of elements were determined. The abundance obtained for iron agrees with the meteoric iron abundance.

Indeed, such adaptation must be consolidated and recalled when appropriate such that we do not have to continually relearn skills we once possessed. By manipulating the sensory feedback available from the visual and proprioceptive systems during learning, it is possible to determine those facets of the sensory feedback that are essential for adaptation to occur. The thesis consists of seven chapters. The first and last provide a conceptual basis for, and an overall discussion of, the research. Chapter 2 reviews current visuomotor adaptation research, with particular focus on the manner in which information about novel tasks is stored within the CNS as we adapt, and the sensory information that is necessary to allow this adaptation to occur. Furthermore, this chapter serves to introduce many of the experimental techniques that are used to investigate motor learning in humans. Chapter 3 is a report of an investigation of the issues of interference and consolidation in an isometric target acquisition task. Exposure to a 30&#176; counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation was followed by a period of rest, trials with no rotation, or trials with a 60&#176; clockwise (CW) rotation. Retention of the initial adaptation was assessed 5 hours later. Full interference was manifested in circumstances in which either counter-rotated or non-rotated trials were encountered following the initial learning period. These results are consistent with the view that the observed interference is anterograde in nature, and highlight differences in the mechanisms employed by the CNS when compensating for novel kinematics (e.g. visuomotor rotations) compared with adapting to novel dynamics (e.g. external forces). Chapter 4 is a report of an investigation of the role of visual feedback in adapting to novel visuomotor environments in an isometric target acquisition task. Following trials with no rotation, participants adapted to a 60&#176; CCW visuomotor rotation before returning to the non-rotated condition. Separate groups received either continuous visual feedback (CF) of cursor position during task execution or post-trial visual feedback (PF), both indicating task performance. One CF group were instructed to make any (feedback) modifications necessary during the task to reduce errors and acquire the target, while another CF group were instructed to make uncorrected, ballistic movements. Colour cues permitted the identification of the task environment (nonrotated/ rotated) on every trial. The results indicate that an automatic recalibration of the visuomotor mapping occurs when CF is provided, and suggest that performance improvements with PF may occur via the adoption of a cognitively mediated strategy. Furthermore, execution of feedback motor commands to correct errors did not enhance the adaptation that occurred when CF was provided, indicating that the perception of sensory errors (and not feedback commands that may be applied to reduce those errors) drives feedforward visuomotor adaptation. To investigate whether additional proprioceptive feedback associated with movement altered the adaptation patterns observed in chapter 4, a study similar to that reported in chapter 4 was undertaken, and is reported in chapter 5. In this instance a discrete, goaldirected, movement task replaced the isometric task. Subjects were deprived of vision of their arm, but were provided with PF or CF indicating task performance. The patterns of adaptation noted in the isometric task were also exhibited in this dynamic task, indicating that the timing of the visual feedback of task performance has a profound effect on how performance improvements in a novel visuomotor rotation occur. The experiment reported in Chapter 6 assessed the ability to adapt to two conflicting visuomotor rotations interleaved within the same training period, when each task variant (rotation) could be identified by contextual (colour) cues. While full dual adaptation was not observed, the results suggest that the colour cues may have been utilised to explicitly select distinct motor commands for each task rotation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321400 Human Movement and Sports Science</field><field name="subject">320702 Central Nervous System</field><field name="subject">skill acquisition</field><field name="subject">CNS</field><field name="subject">central nervous system</field><field name="subject">visuomotor environment</field><field name="subject">sensory feedback</field><field name="subject">adaptation</field><field name="subject">relearning</field><field name="subject">proprioception</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131122</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation framework for collaborative management of protected areas: a cross-cultural case study in Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Izurieta, Arturo</field><field name="description">Management of protected areas and natural resources is shifting from sole control by government agencies to a more collaborative and shared approach to governance between agencies and civil society. This collaboration, known as co-management (collaborative management or sometimes co-operative management) brings together elements of sharing power, decision-making and actions, with trust and capacity building. The engagement of Indigenous people in co-management of protected areas and natural resources in Australia is still maturing. Sharing authority and responsibility with Indigenous people in marine and coastal protected areas is more complicated than on land, since the legal impetus for co-operation is less clear and the &#8216;country&#8217; of Indigenous people does not recognise governance differences between land and sea. Responsibility and legislation concerning both land and sea differs greatly across Australian administrative systems. Indigenous people continue their search for mechanisms that allow them to exercise more control over the land and sea &#8216;country&#8217; that was once theirs. The Cardwell Indigenous Ranger Unit (CIRU) is an initiative to share the management of two world heritage areas, the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area and the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area of Queensland, between the Girringun Aboriginal Corporation (GAC) an organisation of Traditional Owners, and Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS). This co-management initiative opens an opportunity for Traditional Owners to share with QPWS the responsibilities for and decisions on the management of their land and sea country, through shared management of the ranger unit. It also opens opportunities for QPWS to work closely with Indigenous people, to know more about their culture and to have their support in the day-to-day management of these two iconic protected areas. Their shared objective is protection and sustainable use of the natural resources within these two protected areas. The PhD research focused on the development of a participatory monitoring and evaluation framework to help the parties assess progress in, and thus continuously improve, their collaborative effort. It examined whether a participatory monitoring and evaluation process could enhance the effectiveness of the CIRU co-management initiative and promoted an adaptive management approach to governance and operation of the Indigenous Ranger Unit. Additionally, the research assessed whether the participatory process of building the framework contributed to strengthening the cross-cultural partnership between GAC and QPWS. A Participatory Action Research approach provided the way to identify the current cross-cultural co-management situation, common visions and objectives and to develop criteria and indicators to monitor and evaluate their co-management initiative. Two cycles of assessment enabled the parties to test the indicators they had developed, and to experience the benefits of dialogue and of acting on their assessment findings. The building of the framework contributed to information-sharing and communication, assisting GAC and QPWS in their day-to-day decision-making process and operations in regards to the CIRU. The information-sharing and communication processes also helped build understanding of the issues affecting their co-management arrangement and thus strengthened their partnership. The evaluation framework helped implement an adaptive management approach by providing the parties with information that allowed them to take decisions and adapt them to the circumstances. Decisions were monitored and amended, engaging GAC and QPWS in a learning experience to improve their governance and operations as they continued working together. The research is significant in that evaluation of protected areas has strong international momentum through sponsorship and co-ordination by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and co-management has a thirty year history in parts of the world, yet it is rare for co-management to have consistent evaluation. The participatory approach to evaluation, by and for the co-managing parties, enables them to take ownership of the improvement process for their own benefit and that of the areas and species they manage.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131157</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disease and Stress in Reef Building Corals</field><field name="creator">Ainsworth, Tracy Danielle</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131158</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foreign Aid, Agricultural Development and Economic Growth: An International Perspective</field><field name="creator">Derek Headey</field><field name="description">This dissertation is comprised of four essays which use cross-country analysis to analyze the sources of economic growth in less developed countries (LDCs) over the post independence era. These common features aside, each essay aims to answer a reasonably distinct research objective. The Principal Components of Growth seeks to test alternative determinants of growth in LDCs using a robust empirical methodology which combines factor analysis, crosssectional growth regressions, growth accounting, and several techniques which limit the influence of outliers. This approach permits the author to better identify the principal determinants of growth in LDCs, as well as the limitations of cross-country growth regressions. The identified determinants of growth are highly varied, but jointly explain a large proportion of the variation in long run growth rates. Moreover, these determinants provide plausible explanations of growth rates in real developing countries, such as in the East Asian &#8216;Miracles&#8217;. But the limitation of growth regressions is that in many contexts the identified factors can only be interpreted at a highly general theoretical level, so that cross-sectional growth regressions yield very few inferences of immediate policy relevance. Geopolitics, Foreign Aid and Economic Growth investigates whether foreign aid has been effective at increasing growth rates from 1970 to 2001. But in contrast to most of the existing research on aid effectiveness the author indirectly tests the influence of geopolitical factors on aid effectiveness, specifically distinguishing between bilateral and multilateral aid effectiveness during and after the Cold War. The author reaches some important conclusions regarding the effectiveness of foreign aid in recent decades. Under reasonable assumptions there is evidence that improving the methodology of aidgrowth regressions - in terms of aid measurement, regression specification and the estimators used - consistently increases the observed effect of aid on growth. Moreover, the author presents evidence that aid effectiveness has not been constant either across time or across donor types. Bilateral aid appears to have been much less effective than multilateral aid on average over 1970-2001, but the observed ineffectiveness of bilateral aid appears to be due to the low effect of bilateral aid during the Cold War. In contrast, evidence from the post Cold War era suggests that both multilateral and bilateral aid flows have had reasonably large and significant effects on economic growth. Dualism, National Policies and Economic Growth gauges the implications of incorporating dualism into cross-country growth analysis. Specifically, the author defines dualism in this context as a situation in which production in the agricultural and nonagricultural sectors respond differently to &#8216;national&#8217; growth determinants, especially national economic policies. Importantly, the author finds that whilst national factors from the conventional growth literature still explain nonagricultural growth in a similar fashion to the aggregate GDP growth results, growth in the agricultural sector responds differently to most national economic policies. &#8216;Market-friendly&#8217; economic policies, in particular, do not appear to have any positive effect on growth in low income countries, except in the case of fewer price controls, although here too the evidence is by no means robust. And contrary to the prevailing wisdom of the so called &#8216;Washington Consensus&#8217;, larger government seems to be associated with faster growth rates in agriculture. The author concludes with a discussion of whether methodological problems might explain these results, but generally concludes that such problems do not obviously impact on the majority of the above findings in nay substantial fashion. Agriculture, Development and Urban Bias explores whether LDC governments and aid donors have continued to discriminate against the agricultural sector, despite the importance of State-led agricultural growth for overall development, and despite an earlier literature on the prevalence of urban bias in development strategies. The essay begins by verifying the case for State-led agricultural development as an engine of growth and poverty reduction both inside and outside the agricultural sector. The paper then proceeds to demonstrate that urban biases have persisted within LDC policy regimes, largely as a result of domestic political economy factors. But the essay also identifies increasing bias against agricultural development in foreign aid allocations, World Bank research, and in the international trade regime. The chapter then concludes with an in-depth analysis of why agricultural development was increasingly neglected in the Washington Consensus development strategy, and stresses the need to reincorporate State-led agricultural growth as a vital component of post-Washington growth strategies. And finally, several research objectives cut across more than one chapter, thus providing some unifying themes. Obviously, the main unifying objective for all chapters was to better understand what it is diverse international experiences teach us about the process of development. The role of agriculture in development is also the focus of more than one chapter (Chapters 4 and 5). And finally, a key objective of the more statistically oriented chapters (Chapters 2, 3 and 4) was to assess the validity of crosscountry econometric techniques as a means of investigating growth in developing countries. All these issues are touched on to some extent in both the introductory chapter (Chapter 1) and in the concluding chapter (Chapter 6).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131179</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and forecasting cultural and environmental changes</field><field name="creator">Sinay, Laura</field><field name="description">Much of the discourse on cultural change has been descriptive and explanatory, with few attempts to be predictive. Where indicators of and buffers to change are identified, they tend only to be post-event assessable. The need for a tool with strong predictive power is fundamental to cultural (and environmental) impact assessment and the rationale behind this developmental work. Focusing on traditional cultures and their environmental context, and based on a case study of the Juatinga Ecological Reserve, Brasil, this research advances knowledge on modelling cultural and environmental changes, and how to manage these changes for accepted goals. A heuristic tool is presented for assessing the impacts of pressures on a culture and its related environment as well as the efficacy of management responses. This tool is associated with methods to assist in developing predictive models representing the change processes. The change model building process involves consulting stakeholders as a way of integrating different perceptions, to identify pressures, responses and links associated with cultural and environmental change. This assists in creating a co-learning environment, which facilitates communication between stakeholders. The change modelling approach permits incorporation of the complexity and uncertainty of the system represented, and enables scenario analyses. These allow expected local and flow-on impacts of management interventions to be tested. This approach is more efficient than stand-alone performance indicators that do not allow for the synergic impacts of management interventions to be observed and assessed. Using the models representing the cultural and environmental change processes of the Cai&#231;aras of the Juatinga Ecological Reserve, this research identifies that tourism is a major pressure for change (at that locality). This study also identified that tourist numbers at new and small tourism destinations, as well as on a continental scale, can be forecast using exponential and polynomial functions. Yet, tourism flow may be perturbed at any given time by, for example, acts of violence and when the type of marketing changes. In addition, tourist numbers cannot be greater than the total population, therefore it cannot grow indefinitely as exponential and polynomial functions suggest. Hence, the use of exponential and polynomial functions to forecast tourist numbers is more reliable for short periods, such as four or five years, and when based on six or more sets of data points. The greatest contribution of this research to the cultural change discourse is its innovative approach to study, forecast and manage cultural and environmental changes. The continuation of this research may lead to identifying general theories relating pressures and responses to indicators of cultural and environmental changes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350500 Tourism</field><field name="subject">300801 Environmental Management and Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">cultural changes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131277</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Duty, Beauty, Delight &amp; Happiness : Motivations For Nature Conservation</field><field name="creator">Carol Booth</field><field name="description">Some environmental philosophers have lamented that philosophical work contributes little to nature conservation. In this thesis I argue that to more effectively contribute to conservation, environmental philosophy needs a motivational turn &#8211; by referencing its explanatory, normative, and strategic work to naturalistic accounts of motivations for conservation. With people in modern industrial societies having largely accepted that conservation is the right thing to do, the main challenge for conservationists is motivating people to live in ways consistent with such beliefs. Here I particularly focus on motivations to participate in activism directed towards the large-scale systemic reform needed to redress the conservation crisis. Motivation is rarely explicitly addressed in environmental philosophy. Yet, most analyses presume some theory of motivation, most obviously in the case of deontological arguments relying on motivational internalism. One central argument here is that environmental philosophers should consider empirical evidence about motivation, along the lines of Elizabeth Anscombe&#8217;s contention that moral philosophy requires a philosophy of moral psychology. Unfortunately, conservation motivations have also been neglected in psychology, and motivation psychology in general is fragmented, theoretically diverse and far-from-comprehensive, an uncertain basis from which to proceed in environmental philosophy. Because conservation motivations have been neglected in both philosophy and psychology, this thesis is primarily exploratory rather than definitive. I first justify a motivational focus for environmental philosophy, and consider how motivation has been studied and characterised in philosophy and psychology &#8211; from the ancient Greek philosophers&#8217; holistic tripartite scheme of motivation corresponding to different parts of the soul to the empirically based, but fragmented, mini-theories of modern psychology. To understand human motivations for conservation, we need a comprehensive understanding of human psychology and neurobiology &#8211; in other words, of human nature. I consider the state of knowledge in these areas, and the implications for environmental philosophy. There are three overarching questions about motivation relevant to environmental philosophy: o Ought people be motivated to conservation nature? o How are people motivated to conserve nature? o How ought people be motivated to conserve nature? Most of the work in environmental philosophy has focused on the first question, and I presume an emphatic yes to it. The work here is focused on the other two questions. These two thematic questions are addressed within four different domains of conservation motivations that are of philosophical interest: moral, aesthetic, relational and eudaimonic motivations (or, colloquially, those of duty, beauty, delight and happiness), considered in Chapters 1-4, respectively. I consider motivations for both engagement with and conservation of nature, as the former is considered vital for the latter. To address the first thematic question about what motivates conservation, in each chapter I characterise motivation in a naturalistic way, with reference to psychological literature &#8211; firstly, describing the felt psychological demands, capabilities and vulnerabilities affecting people&#8217;s desires and capacities to participate in conservation reform, and then characterising the beliefs, emotions, perceptions and identities that constitute &#8216;motivational complexes&#8217; for conservation. To address the second thematic question about how ought people be motivated &#8211; both a normative and strategic question &#8211; I assess how well motivation has been considered in environmental philosophy in each of the domains, critiquing the lack of focus on, or poorly justified assumptions about, motivation. I draw on the accounts of motivation to develop motivationally relevant criteria for environmental philosophy that can better align the normative work of philosophy with the motivational realities of human psychology. To keep the thesis grounded in the practical challenges of conservation I refer to conservation issues in Australia, particularly of flying-foxes. In Chapter 1 on moral motivations, I explain the widespread conservation rhetoricbehaviours gaps in modern industrial societies as motivational. As Elizabeth Anscombe and others have argued &#8211; and as is highlighted by the motivational challenges of conservation &#8211; moral philosophy should be referenced to moral psychology, and focused on motivation rather than relying on an authority-like approach to moral compliance. Much of the apparent moral hypocrisy associated with the rhetoric-behaviours gap of conservation is attributable to a mischaracterisation of moral values in terms of moral beliefs rather than motivational complexes. Referring to the psychological literature, I characterise moral motivations and moral agents in ways that belie the too-easy cynicism about the possibility for large-scale moral reform for nature. A motivation turn in environmental ethics requires a much greater focus on moral motivation and explicit reference to naturalistic accounts of motivation, the alignment of normative precepts with motivational characteristics, and more effective ways of promulgating environmental ethics. Each of these attributes is discussed and exemplified. For normative alignment, environmental ethicists should ensure that presumed motivations are feasible, moral demands are sufficient, motivationally optimal and consistent with capabilities, motivational self-knowledge is fostered, moral pluralism is recognised and motivational allies for morality and motivational strategies for compliance are embraced. Conservation ignores one of nature&#8217;s strongest motivational assets if it fails to engage people through environmental aesthetics. In Chapter 2 on aesthetic motivations, l characterise the aesthetic experience (including the sublime), starting from the Kantian account, and proceeding to more psychological accounts, in particular of aesthetic motivational complexes for conservation. Aesthetics has strong motivational potential with its capacity to arrest attention from self and engage interest and sympathy for nature, but a better naturalistic understanding is necessary as a basis to increase the congruence between its motivational power and its cultural status. Understood as a deeply pleasurable way of intensifying our engagement with the world, an aesthetic focus on nature should increase the demand for it as an everyday rather than occasional experience. From a motivational perspective, I examine key aesthetics debates in environmental philosophy &#8211; whether all of nature is beautiful; appropriate interpretative frameworks for nature aesthetics; links between aesthetics and ethics; and the moral status of destruction of beauty. A motivation turn in environmental aesthetics requires more explicit recognition of the motivational strengths of environmental aesthetics, reference to naturalistic accounts of aesthetic motivation, a stronger alignment of normative and motivational status, and more effective ways of promulgating conservation as an aesthetic endeavour. For normative alignment, there needs to be recognition of both the links and conflicts between aesthetics and ethics. The conflicts could be reduced by developing ecological frameworks for aesthetics, and expanding aesthetic appreciation beyond the postcard clich&#233;s of spectacular scenes and charismatic species. The greatest challenges are not to convince people that nature is beautiful, but to expand the range of aesthetic experiences, elevate their priority and promote conservation as an aesthetic endeavour to protect and restore beauty. It is well recognised that to better motivate conservation, we need to create powerful connections between humans and nature. At the macro-level, the conservation task has typically been cast as the re-integration of humans into nature; at the micro-level as the fostering of positive personal relationships with nature. In Chapter 3 on relational motivations, I examine motivations to engage in relationships with nature, both conceptual and experiential, and to honour them through conservation. Initially, I characterise motivations for human-nature relationships by examining human propensities and capabilities for relationships. Unfortunately, there seems little potential for conservation in the notion of biophilia as specifically evolved capabilities for relationships with nature &#8211; rather, the relational capabilities we rely on for conservation are non-specific for nature. I also characterise relational motivations in terms of emotions, beliefs, perceptions and identities constituting motivational complexes. Each of the potential models for human-nature relationships used in environmental philosophy &#8211; dominion, unity and community models &#8211; are assessed and found to have problems. The best of them from a motivational perspective are community models, such as popularised by Aldo Leopold. &#8216;Community&#8217; is ambiguous enough to encompass nature, but exemplifies yet another stretching of the human circle to encompass nature, rather than development of concepts particular to nature. As a compromise, we can focus perhaps on models of &#8216;bio-communities&#8217;, which add to our relational identities rather than subsume nature within an existing model. A motivation turn in environmental philosophy requires more explicit recognition of the motivational merits of human-nature relationships, reference to naturalistic accounts of relational motivation, development of conservation-motivating relationship models, and the alignment of humannature relationship norms and their motivational efficacy. I identify desirable attributes for relationship models and nominate particular types of human-nature relationships &#8211; including attachment, local community, citizen, special obligation and contract/service sorts of relationships &#8211; that may be motivating for conservation. As a way of expressing the normative link between relationships with nature and conservation, I develop the notion of &#8216;honouring&#8217; human-nature relationships through activism. In Chapter 4 on eudaimonic motivations, there is a convergence of the other chapter themes in an exploration of conceptions of the good life and their relationship with nature engagement and conservation. Large-scale happiness surveys apparently reveal that most people are happy. But philosophical conceptions of the good life based on the notion of eudaimonia are much richer and more demanding than those assessed in surveys, and there is reason to be skeptical about the eudaimonic status of many citizens. I explore links between five themes I consider important in a narrative conception of the good life and the benefits deriving from nature engagement and conservation, finding strong alignments. Conservation needs a strong philosophical challenge to the alleged neutrality of liberal societies about conceptions of the good life, for this failed neutrality justifies considerable loss of good-life potential within nature. The perennial philosophical questions about the relationships between morality and eudaimonia remain highly relevant, relying on naturalistic conceptions of happiness and morality instead of the teleological links of ancient Greek philosophy. A motivation turn in environmental philosophy requires more explicit recognition of the motivational potential of eudaimonic goals for conservation, reference to naturalistic accounts of eudaimonic motivation, development of particular conceptions of the good life that are motivating for conservation, and identification of social and political reforms to increase alignment between human happiness and nature conservation. As the conservation crisis deepens, environmental philosophers will increasingly question their relevance to reform efforts. I conclude that the most practicable contribution environmental philosophy can make is to revisit philosophical questions of old about the nature of the human and human motivation. With a naturalistic approach, environmental philosophers have considerable potential to challenge invalid presumptions about motivation and develop new insights to inspire and guide conservation reform. In sum, to more effectively contribute to conservation, environmental philosophy needs a motivation turn.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131280</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of Attentional Deficiency in Depressive Negative Thought and its Relationship to Lateralized Cerebral Dysfunction</field><field name="creator">Broome, Annette S.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131281</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping the Edge: An analysis of regional responses in the Queensland house</field><field name="creator">Musgrave, Elizabeth A.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1201 Architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131282</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Replication Limited, Trans-Complemented Ross River Virus</field><field name="creator">Pyke, Alyssa</field><field name="description">Conventionally, live virus propagation in either cell culture or animal systems has been employed for the production of Ross River virus (RRV) antigens for use in diagnostic applications. Due to the continual increase in safety and biological containment regulations imposed within modern virology laboratories, now only a few certified facilities remain within Australia where the growth and manipulation of live virus can be performed. Recently, rigorous binary ethylenimine (BEI) inactivation procedures have been included in the manufacture of RRV antigens to minimise viral safety risks, however, these methods pose other potential health hazards and may result in the loss of important antigenic epitopes. In the present study, an alternative method which could transpose the infectious propagation and time-consuming inactivation techniques currently used for RRV antigen production was sought. A unique replication system was developed permitting continued propagation of non-infectious, wild-type (wt) RRV particles. Firstly, a full-length RRV cDNA infectious clone (pCMV-RRV), which retained the genetic and biological properties of the RRV prototype T48 strain (originally isolated by Doherty R.L., 1959), was constructed under the control of the immediate early human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. An essential gene, namely the structural envelope (E) E1 gene, was then deleted to facilitate the production of a mutant construct, pCMV-RRV&#916;E1. Normally, this lethal E1 gene deletion would disable infectious RNA transcription and prevent virus formation. However, further investigations revealed that RNA derived from pCMV-RRV&#916;E1 was capable of trans-complementation in the presence of E1 and therefore could be used to generate replication deficient, RRV particles. In order to perform the pCMV-RRV&#916;E1 trans-complementation experiments, a tetracycline inducible cell line (6K-E1 6B), constitutively expressing the RRV E1 glycoprotein was developed using human equine kidney (HEK) 293T-REX &#8482; cells (Invitrogen, California). The expression vector engineered to develop the transgenic cells included the 6K gene translocation signal sequence immediately upstream of the E1 gene sequence. Rescue of defective replicon RNA was achieved following transfection of pCMV-RRV&#916;E1 DNA into 6K-E1 6B cells and resulted in the formation of transcomplemented RRV (RRVcomp) particles. Examination of infected cell sections by electron microscopy (EM) revealed the presence of cytoplasmic viral RNA complexes known as spherules and virus-like structures which were morphologically similar to viral particles derived from the parent pCMV-RRV clone. Interestingly, budding of RRVcomp from the plasma membrane (PM) could not be demonstrated which inferred that particles may have budded via a defective or alternate mechanism. In addition, conspicuous cytoplasmic vacuoles (CVs) were present in many uninfected and RRVcomp infected 6K-E1 6B cells which suggested intracellular retention of the transgencially expressed E1. However, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequence analysis of nucleic acid recovered from RRVcomp provided evidence that the E1 gene sequence deletion had been maintained following ten passages. Furthermore, transmission could not be detected when RRVcomp was serially passaged in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells which strongly suggested that replication of the recombinant was exclusively limited and therefore could only occur within the complementing 6K-E1 6B cells. Significantly, the nucleotide sequence analysis of the RRVcomp genome also revealed the presence of a single base insertion in the 3&#8217; terminal end of the 6K gene sequence. This unprecedented mutation was shown to result from RRVcomp replication in vivo and was introduced into the replicon genome after passage 3. Given this evidence, it is highly likely that translation and processing of the RRVcomp structural C-PE2-6K polyprotein was adversely affected and it is doubtful that a functional 6K species was produced. Indeed, failure to synthesise an authentic 6K would probably have disrupted normal viral assembly processes and perhaps this could account for the budding defects observed by EM. The absence of 6K may also have led to inefficient membrane fusion events by reducing the stability of the RRVcomp trimer complex. Conceivably, this could partially explain why appreciable RRVcomp titres were not produced following growth curve experiments. However, despite these abnormal RRVcomp growth characteristics, it could be argued that the 6K mutation was an acquired adaptation which promoted host cell signalase cleavage of the PE2-6K precursor protein. Logically, this would be a favoured event and may have led to more efficient heterodimerization between RRVcomp derived E2 and complementing E1 in trans. Although originating from separate plasmid constructs, the production of both structural glycoproteins E1 and E2 from RRVcomp infected 6K-E1 6B cells was demonstrated by western blot analyses. A protein with a molecular weight (MW) of 49 kDa corresponding to the authentic E1 could be demonstrated from samples of cell lysates but not from culture supernatants which supported EM findings and confirmed that a large proportion of synthesised E1 was being retained within the transgenic cells. By comparison, the presence of an authentic E2 glycoprotein with a MW of 52 kDa could not be demonstrated or was at a level too low for detection. Alternatively, an aberrant E2 form, possibly corresponding to an uncleaved precursor species, was observed from samples of both cell lysates and culture supernatant. Resembling the aberrant E2 molecule (E2*) reported in previous Semliki Forest virus (SFV) studies, this secreted protein demonstrated altered sensitivity to endoglycosidase treatment compared to wt E2 and was indicative of abnormal glycoprotein processing. Clearly, these results together with the evidence of a 6K mutation, underscore the defective replication properties of RRVcomp in the trans-complementation system. Despite this, EM detection of intact replication complexes and virus-like structures, combined with evidence of exclusive transmission in 6K-E1 6B cells suggested that correctly packaged RRVcomp particles were being formed, albeit at reduced levels. In the final analysis of the study, an antigen produced from RRVcomp infected cultures was produced to investigate if this reagent was suitable for RRV diagnostic ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) technologies. The complemented antigen was used in capture ELISA assays to analyse a panel of 60 patient sera for the presence of anti-RRV IgM and IgG antibodies. Patients were also tested in parallel assays using inactivated wt RRV antigen. The results of the separate RRVcomp antigen assays correlated highly with each of the wt antigen IgM and IgG assays respectively, indicating that replication limited, trans-complemented RRV may be useful for the development of safer, non-infectious diagnostic reagents.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131284</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining Farmer Decision Making With Systems Models for Restoring Multi-Functional Ecohydrological Systems in Degraded Catchments</field><field name="creator">Justin Ryan</field><field name="description">In agricultural landscapes, native ecosystems are largely replaced by non-native crop and pasture species, with the extent of modification dependent on land use history and the management practices of current farmers. The result is greater complexity in some parts of the landscape, while other areas become more simplified. Of critical importance, however, is that many landscapes become &#8216;leaky&#8217; due to the impaired feedback mechanisms between the types of vegetation present (i.e. land cover) and their ability to efficiently cycle water, sediment, nutrients and carbon between the lower atmosphere, vegetation, soil, and hydrological systems, causing landscapes to become ecohydrologically dysfunctional. In many mixed cropping-grazing landscapes of Australia, ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes exhibit declines in soil condition, water quality and quantity, rising salinity levels, higher wind speeds and temperatures, reduced rainfall, and a loss of biodiversity and production capacity. Ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes also are less resilient to climatic variations, which during extended dry periods, can result in water shortages with potentially dire socioeconomic consequences. This Thesis focuses on how landscape designs comprised of particular types and locations of land covers can improve and restore the ecohydrological functioning of mixed cropping-grazing landscapes. The specific aim of this Thesis is to show &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; for the &#8211; development of a new modelling approach which automatically calculates the effects that land cover changes at specific locations across hillslopes have on ecohydrological systems functioning, and to use this information to delineate landscape designs that enhance water retention within the landscape while minimising sediment and nutrient export to the catchment. To support this aim, the Thesis has three major objectives: 1) develop a complex adaptive systems conceptual model of ecohydrological systems functioning within landscapes; 2) develop a participatory survey method to capture the expert knowledge of farmers in terms of preferences for a given land use and changes in these preferences during seasonal variations in rainfall; and 3) demonstrate &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; that a combination of expert systems and hydrological process models can be employed to automatically delineate landscape designs which restore ecohydrological functioning within mixed cropping-grazing landscapes in sub-tropical Australia. The development of a rigorous theoretical basis of ecohydrological systems function within the landscape in terms of adaptations to environmental flux in climate and human forcings such as land cover change, was achieved by integrating the concepts of both complex adaptive systems and landscape ecology theories. The resulting framework, termed &#8216;Complex Adaptive Landscapes&#8217; (CAL), derived six core tenets which described the system dynamics of a landscape: 1) a continuum of scales; 2) open systems; 3) non-linear feedback mechanisms; 4) aggregation of components; 5) self-organisation; and 6) multiple meta-stable states. The participatory survey method resulted in the development of the &#8216;Graphical Landscape Map Survey&#8217; (GLAMS). This process applied three-dimensional representations of the landscape (i.e. Graphical Landscape Maps) in combination with Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to capture farmer&#8217;s expert knowledge. GLAMS generated probability estimates (P) that highlighted the importance of ecohydrological functioning to farmers and the locations and change in land use through time in both average and extended dry seasons. Achievement of the last objective resulted in the &#8216;Landscape Ecohydrological Attenuation Configuration System (LEACS). This system utilised farmer decision rules as probability estimates (P) for a given land cover within the STELLA systems software, and then revised these P estimates depending on the magnitude of runoff from a hillslope following an intense thunderstorm event as calculated by a distributed hydrological process model (MIKE SHE). The fundamental dynamics of the LECAS model was based on iterative feedback between the outputs of water at the end of the catchment and changing the spatial locations of particular land covers within the catchment over time. Together the three objectives highlighted the following major implications for natural resource and catchment management: i) the CAL framework may be used to design both sampling and monitoring strategies in natural resource and catchment management. CAL suggested that monitoring timeframes should be decadal in time-frame, and the feedback mechanisms of landscape must be accounted for if the longer-term sustainability of human-modified landscapes is to be achieved. A basis to such complexity is likely to form around aggregated components such as native vegetation patches, and these in turn, are important for self-organisation of a desirable landscape state to be maintained through increased resilience to disturbances and climatic fluxes; ii) participatory survey methods, such as GLAMS, are an excellent means to capture farmer expert knowledge in a manner that is intuitive to the farmers. The GLAMS approach accounted for any desired set of management actions put forward by a Landcare group or catchment body, differentiated between property sizes, and incorporated landscape heterogeneity in time and space. The framework helped to prioritise the level of support for a given set of NRM actions by farmers, including where activities were best placed. The approach also aided in identifying future landscape states based on a priori conditions and farmer preferences; and iii) the LEACS model demonstrated an approach capable of providing estimates of where it would be best to locate land cover changes (e.g. tree belts) to aid in the restoration of ecohydrological functioning in the landscape. A secondary outcome for simulations which tested the effects of tree belts in specific configurations was that these designs were an effective ecohydrological restoration technique that reduced water velocities and increased infiltration across steep hillslopes in the Maronghi Creek catchment, Southeast Queensland.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131285</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chronic fatigue syndrome in Queensland: An investigation of fatigue, incidence of falls and fear of falling, and balance and mobility function</field><field name="creator">Jane Anne Clarke</field><field name="description">This study was conducted in two parts, a survey study and a comparative balance and mobility pilot study. Firstly, a series of self-administered questionnaires were mailed to people in Queensland with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The main purpose of the survey study was to 1) develop a demographic and health profile of the population of people who suffer from CFS in Queensland; 2) to establish the reliability and validity of an alternate measure of fatigue, the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF) and 3) to document functional mobility, history of falls and degree of fear of falling experienced by those with CFS. The average age of CFS subjects who participated in the survey study was 52 years, and 69 percent were between the ages of 40 and 70 years. Seventy-seven percent of the subjects were women. CFS subjects reported a mean duration of CFS symptoms of 16.95 years. Sixty-three percent of CFS subjects suffered from a concomitant diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Fatigue severity was measured by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and the MAF. The mean fatigue score obtained from the FSS and the MAF was 6.3 (SD+/-0.7) and 37.81 (SD+/-6.96) respectively. The FSS (Intraclass Coefficient=0.9, p&lt;0.001) and the MAF (Intraclass Coefficient=0.84, p&lt;0.001) were highly reliable when measuring fatigue in CFS over two occasions within a one-month period. There was a weak, but significant correlation between the MAF and the FSS (Spearman&#8217;s Rank Order Coefficient=0.476, p&lt;0.001), indicating that the MAF is a reliable and valid measure of fatigue in the CFS population. Fifty-one percent of the CFS cohort reported a history of a fall occurring in the past six months, while thirty-nine percent of the total CFS cohort were identified as recurrent fallers. A fear of falling was reported by fifty-two percent of CFS subjects. The mean modified falls efficacy score for the CFS cohort was 7.7 (SD. +/-2.24). Falls and fear of falling appeared to be related to a concurrent diagnosis of fibromyalgia. The high incidence of falls and fear of falling in the CFS population prompted a pilot comparative study of balance and mobility function in women with CFS. The main aims of this study were to 1) identify the type of balance and mobility deficits experienced by a cohort of younger women with CFS; 2) to compare balance and mobility function of women with CFS to an age matched control group and 3) to identify the test conditions that are best able to differentiate the balance and mobility performance of the CFS cohort and controls. The grip strength, gaze stability and balance and mobility function of 14 females with a current diagnosis of CFS and 20 age matched control females was tested. Upper limb strength (p&lt;0.003) and dynamic visual acuity (p&lt;0.003) were significantly reduced in CFS subjects when compared to control subjects. There were no significant differences between CFS and control subjects for postural stability measures of bilateral stance on the Clinical Test of Sensory Integration of Balance. There was a strong trending increase in velocity of postural sway demonstrated when CFS females stood on a firm surface with eyes closed (p=0.018). No significant difference between the CFS cohort and the controls was demonstrated for all single leg stance (SLS) time and sway measures. However there was a strong trend for increased postural sway and less time measured for left and right SLS with eyes open. Slower reaction times when weight shifting in a mediolateral direction ((R) p=0.004, (L) p=0.007) were demonstrated in CFS subjects. CFS subjects performed the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, manual TUG and the combined TUG significantly slower than control subjects (p=0.001). Gait parameters were significantly different between the two groups on all 10m walk tests. CFS subjects exhibited a slower gait velocity, shorter step length, less cadence and longer duration of gait cycle. Dual tasking did not appear to effect the gait pattern of CFS subjects more than controls, however, more complex multitask conditions may have identified greater differences between the two groups. This study has demonstrated that a community based cohort of the CFS population in Queensland experience significant levels of impairment and disability associated with fatigue and other CFS symptoms, falls and perceived fear of falling. Preliminary findings suggest that people with CFS exhibit mild balance and mobility deficits and impaired upper limb strength and gaze stability. Recommendations are made regarding the future delivery of intervention programmes for people with CFS in Queensland.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131286</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical Activity And Quality Of Life Among Colorectal Cancer Survivors</field><field name="creator">Lynch, Brigid Mary</field><field name="description">Colorectal cancer is the second most common invasive cancer in Australia, and as the population ages, the prevalence of the disease is expected to increase accordingly. The long-term health issues specific to colorectal cancer survivors are emerging as a public health concern. Whilst some ongoing morbidity is inevitable in this growing population, physical activity has potential to increase quality of life and functional capacity, decrease co-morbid conditions, and extend survival for those who have had colorectal cancer. The majority of research on the relationship between physical activity and quality of life in cancer survivors is comprised of intervention studies, with more than 35 published randomised, controlled trials in the area. Only 13 observational studies have documented the associations. Studies to date have methodological limitations, and have largely focussed on breast cancer survivors. The progression of knowledge in this field has been limited by a lack of sound epidemiological studies documenting associations between physical activity and quality of life in cancer survivors. The studies described within this thesis investigate physical activity and quality of life in a large sample of colorectal cancer survivors (n = 1,966) recruited via the Queensland Cancer Registry. Preliminary work included conducting in-depth interviews and focus groups to determine the most salient dimensions of quality of life for colorectal cancer survivors. This work guided the selection of the quality of life measure utilised in the main study of this thesis. Prior to commencing the main study, a pilot study was conducted to assess the appropriateness of the physical activity and quality of life outcome measures. A subgroup of the main study sample were re-interviewed so that the test-retest reliability of the physical activity measure could be established. The aims of the main study were twofold: first, to describe the physical activity of colorectal cancer survivors, including a description of the factors that predict physical activity participation in this population; and second, to document the associations between physical activity and quality of life among colorectal cancer survivors. Telephone interviews were conducted with 1,996 colorectal cancer survivors recruited through the Queensland Cancer Registry. Data were collected on current quality of life; physical activity pre- and post-diagnosis; cancer treatment and side-effects; and general sociodemographic attributes. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the physical activity levels reported pre- and post-diagnosis, and post-diagnosis quality of life. Logistic regression identified explanatory variables significantly associated with achieving the recommended amount of weekly physical activity (150 minutes) post-diagnosis. Multinomial regression was used to determine the sociodemographic and disease-related factors associated with categories of physical activity change from pre- to post-diagnosis. Hierarchical generalised linear models identified variables significantly associated with quality of life. Thirty-two percent of participants (36% of males, 28% of females) met the physical activity guideline post-diagnosis. Meeting the guideline post-diagnosis was associated with: being male; having a higher level of formal education; having private health insurance; not smoking; having a healthy body mass index; having had surgery only; and no reported fatigue. Attributes associated with a decrease in physical activity following diagnosis were: being female; having adjuvant therapy; having a stoma; and experiencing fatigue. After controlling for sociodemographic variables, disease-specific variables, treatment side-effects and pre-diagnosis physical activity, there were significant differences in quality of life scores by post-diagnosis physical activity category. Compared to participants who were inactive after their diagnosis, those who were sufficiently active had a 17% higher total quality of life score. Physical activity also had a significant independent positive effect on the physical well-being, functional well-being, and additional concerns subscales of the quality of life measure. The study findings support the case that colorectal cancer survivors should be encouraged to be more physical active, and within this thesis the characteristics of those who would benefit most from additional physical activity are identified. The natural patterns and physical activity preferences of colorectal cancer survivors described in this study may assist the development of relevant health promotion programs. Further research into the relationships between physical activity and quality of life for colorectal cancer survivors is warranted. To build on the findings from this thesis, prospective follow-up of participants will continue. Physical activity interventions based on the preferences of colorectal cancer survivors are needed, to establish clearly whether increasing physical activity does enhance quality of life for this population.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131287</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predictive Utility Of The Six-Minute Walk Distance On Survival In Lung Transplant Waiting Lists</field><field name="creator">Tuppin, Michael P.</field><field name="description">The six-minute walk distance (6MWD) is a widely used clinical indicator of exercise capacity. Although used as part of the assessment process in determining a candidate&#8217;s suitability for lung transplantation (LT), the literature describing the impact of the 6MWD in predicting survival on LT waiting lists is limited. The sixminute work (6MWork) and percent of predicted 6MWD (%Pred6MWD) have been proposed as useful measures of exercise capacity, but their predictive utility within LT has not been determined. The aims of this study were to: 1. Describe how the 6MWD is utilised by physiotherapists and physicians in managing patients on the LT waiting list. 2. Determine the relationship of the 6MWD, 6MWork and %Pred6MWD to survival in lung transplant waiting lists. 3. Describe the pattern of deterioration of the 6MWD in listed patients. 4. Determine the hazard function associated with the 6MWD, 6Mwork and %Pred6MWD and its utility relative to other prognostic variables. The research project consisted of four studies conducted in two distinct stages. Stage 1: A descriptive study incorporating semi-structured interviews with physiotherapists and physicians working within the QLTU of at least four years experience within the field of LT. Interviews were analysed by means of a simple pattern analysis to determine how the 6MWD is used in managing patients on the LT waiting list (Study 1). Stage 2: Retrospective chart review of 163 patients who were listed for single or double LT within the Queensland Lung Transplant Unit (QLTU), and either survived until transplant or died on the waiting list. Subjects from both groups were casematched according to age, body mass index (BMI), gender, diagnosis and time on the waiting list, and a comparison made of their 6MWD, 6MWork and %Pred6MWD at the time of assessment (Study 2). The change in 6MWD as a function of time was compared between case-controlled pairs and analysed by means of a simple pattern analysis on statistical process control charts (Study 3). Finally, a Cox regression for survival analysis stratified by diagnostic group was conducted utilising 6MWD, exercise oxygen saturation levels (SpO2), age, gender, height, weight, blood type, cardiac function (echo ejection fraction), and lung function testing (forced expiratory volume (FEV1), diffusion capacity (KCO), and forced vital capacity (FVC)) (Study 4). Study 1 highlighted a perception amongst clinicians in the QLTU that the 6MWD has some clinical utility in LT, although this was felt to vary between the diagnostic groups. However, there was some difference of opinion regarding the prognostic value of the 6MWD when compared to other markers of disease severity. Study 2 demonstrated a relationship between the 6MWD, 6MWork and %Pred6MWD and survival on the LT waiting list when controlled for diagnostic group, age, gender, BMI and time accumulated on the waiting list. Those who survived to transplant had higher mean values for 6MWD, 6MWork and %Pred6MWD than those who died on the waiting list (all p&lt;0.05). Study 3 was exploratory in nature and was unable to conclusively determine the pattern of deterioration of patients subsequent to listing for LT. However, the construction of statistical control charts defining the average and lower control limit (LCL) for the 6MWD rate of change over time did yield some interesting observations. It may be that a rate of change greater than the LCL (-1.99 metres/day), or consecutive changes more than the average (-0.12 metres/day) indicates a greater risk of death on the waiting list. The construction and use of statistical control charts may prove to be a useful direction for future research. Study 4 demonstrated a high utility for the 6MWD in predicting survival in LT waiting lists (-2Log Likelihood=162.557, c2=13.125, p&lt;0.001). In fact, it proved to be the only significant covariate in the Cox regression for survival analysis (B=-0.006, Wald=12.496, p&lt;0.001), with all other variables eliminated as non-significant. The 6MWD demonstrated a protective effect with a standardised coefficient (Exp (B)) of 0.994, (95% CI=0.990, 0.997) and showed a higher utility in the diagnostic groups of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and cystic fibrosis (CF), while it appeared to have a lower utility for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The 6MWork and %Pred6MWD also demonstrated a similar utility to the 6MWD (p&lt;0.001). This research demonstrates that the 6MWD may be useful in managing patients on the LT waiting list by identifying those patients with a significantly higher risk of mortality. The use of the hazard function based on the 6MWD at the time of assessment for LT will enable the associated risk for each patient to be identified, and monitored and managed appropriately.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131290</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Dualism to Wholeness: Understanding Religion and Politics in the West</field><field name="creator">Erin Wilson</field><field name="description">International Relations (IR) scholarship has largely viewed the relationship between religion and politics in the West as irrelevant, owing to dominant perceptions of the West as secular. Yet this attitude is increasingly recognised as mistaken. I argue that the significant role of religion in Western politics has gone largely unnoticed because of deeply entrenched dualistic thinking in the West. Firstly, religion and politics are viewed as separated by the public/private divide. Secondly, religion itself is understood through three dichotomies &#8211; institutional/ideational, individual/communal and irrational/rational. However, only one side of each dichotomy has been emphasised. This has resulted in a limited understanding of religion as institutional, individual and irrational. After examining the reasons for and implications of dualistic thinking, the dissertation develops a holistic definition of religion that values all six elements: institutional, ideational, individual, communal, irrational and rational. I then apply this holistic definition of religion to a case study of US foreign policy. By conducting a close textual analysis of five State of the Union addresses, I reveal how religion plays an integral role in foreign policy, a role that is generally masked by embedded dualism within the West. The application of a holistic definition of religion serves to overcome dualistic thinking.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131292</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Context Information Privacy and Context-Enhanced Distributed Authentication for Pervasive Computing Environments</field><field name="creator">Ryan George Wishart</field><field name="description">Rapid advances in computing technology have made it possible to create a pervasive computing environment where computing resources and facilities are available wherever a user may be. This pervasive computing environment goes beyond the concept of city-wide, or nation-wide, wireless network coverage and aims to make interaction between the user and the computing facilities as easy and natural as possible. This requires intelligence on the part of the underlying networks and software supporting the pervasive computing environment, and also awareness of the environment and the context in which the user is operating. Intelligence and awareness on the part of the pervasive computing environment are provided by analysing what is referred to as &#8220;context information&#8221;. This context information can be obtained from hardware or software sensors in the environment, be based on profiled information or derived from context information already known to the pervasive computing environment. The potential to misuse the pervasive computing infrastructure to violate the privacy of users is significant. These violations can range from trading context information about users without consent to abusing a user&#8217;s location information to stalk them. To make the link between users and context information gathered by sensors we developed a concept of contextdependent, multi-party context information ownership. In our approach, ownership of context information entitles the owner(s) to determine how, to whom and under what conditions context information is disclosed to third-party entities. This concept of ownership was then developed into modelling techniques and a representation compatible with a wide range of Object Oriented context modelling approaches. Context information privacy for the users of the pervasive computing environment was then addressed by building on our concept of context-dependent, multi-party context information ownership. Owners of context information, identified using our ownership modelling approach, were able to specify their disclosure preferences for context information modelled as belonging to them. These preferences were captured using a context-dependent privacy preference language. As part of the contribution to the field of context information privacy a context information obfuscation mechanism was also developed. Control of this obfuscation mechanism was integrated with the preference language permitting users to specify not only when, how, why and for what purpose their context information can be disclosed by the pervasive computing environment, but also at what level of detail disclosure may take place. If necessary, the obfuscation mechanism operates on requested context information to reduce its detail level to meet these disclosure requirements. After developing a context information privacy mechanism, we then focused on enhancing the operation of security mechanisms within pervasive computing environments by using context information. From a security perspective, the pervasive computing environment represents a significant challenge as (1) there is no single administrative entity to establish and enforce security policy, (2) nodes are highly mobile and may need to interact with other nodes with which they have no previous relationship and (3) connectivity may be intermittent meaning that trusted infrastructure may not always be available. These features of pervasive computing environments mean that existing approaches to security that rely on the existence of trusted infrastructure, need well-defined network boundaries and require pre-existing relationships between the security service are unable to function. As the security field is very broad, this thesis focused on one aspect: authentication. To facilitate authentication in pervasive computing environments, we developed the Distributed Certification and Authentication Service (DCAS). DCAS acts as a distributed Certification Authority comprised of a group of trustworthy nodes that collaborate to provide the services of a Certification Authority and can be set up on-the-fly to service clusters of isolated nodes. The trusted nodes within DCAS not only issue public key certificates, but also perform authentication of applicant nodes. Applicant nodes are able to authenticate using &#8220;traditional authentication factors&#8221; (such as public key certificates), as well as context information sensed from the environment, or a combination of both. To demonstrate the viability of DCAS, its core functionality was implemented and deployed on a small IEEE 802.11b network. In order to aid in establishing a DCAS within a network, a probability-based model of DCAS behaviour under certain conditions was created. This model was verified using simulation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131293</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing and evaluating a community website-delivered physical activity program</field><field name="creator">Shannon Ferney</field><field name="description">Regular walking has established health benefits and is a safe and accessible form of physical activity. It is recognised as the most appropriate type of physical activity to promote to large numbers of inactive middle-aged adults. Interventions delivered through the Internet, using websites and email, have the potential to deliver low cost physical activity (and in particular walking) programs. To date, website-delivered physical activity programs have been guided by individually-focused theories of behaviour change. Studies trialling their efficacy have reported modest increases in physical activity in volunteer participants. Greater increases in physical activity may be possible if programs adopt a more ecological approach and focus on aspects of the environment by promoting local opportunities for walking. The main aims of the research presented in this thesis were to develop a new website-delivered physical activity program that focused on aspects of the community and then, to examine whether this program could promote physical activity (primarily walking) and positively influence perceptions of the neighbourhood environment. A secondary aim was to explore participant use and perceptions of the new community website-delivered physical activity program. Recommendations from previous research have focused on the need to develop innovative physical activity websites that can maintain participant engagement. Therefore, to maximise participants&#8217; use of the community website-delivered physical activity program, a user-centred approach guided its development. Social Cognitive Theory was integrated into an ecological model of physical activity to focus the content of the program on both individual (primarily self-efficacy and social support) and environmental (perceived access, convenience and aesthetics) attributes known to be related to walking and overall physical activity. Program content was also guided by the findings from focus group discussions conducted with 40 adults. Focus group participants expressed a preference for a physical activity website that was easy-to-use and that included interactive features together with information on local opportunities for physical activity. Consistent with a user-centred approach, two phases of user testing were conducted with potential users to improve the design and content of the website. The efficacy of the community website-delivered program was evaluated within a randomised trial. One hundred and six volunteer participants were randomly allocated to receive access to the community website-delivered physical activity program or to a standard website-delivered physical activity program. Participants had continual access to their respective program for the duration of the 26-week trial. Telephone surveys were conducted at baseline (week-0) and again at 12- and 26-weeks post baseline. The primary measures of interest were neighbourhood walking, walking for transport, walking in general and perceptions of the neighbourhood environment. Additional measures included total physical activity, self-efficacy and social support. Participant use of both websites was objectively monitored for the duration of the trial. Post-trial focus group discussions were conducted with a sub-sample of intervention group participants (n=10) to further explore perceptions and use of the community website-delivered physical activity program. Data were analysed by Intention-to-Treat using 3 &#215; 2 ANOVAS and Chi-square tests for independence where appropriate. Treatment Received analysis, using participants&#8217; data who could recall the program materials, was also conducted on primary measures. Separate analysis (Impact of Use) was conducted on intervention group participants&#8217; data to examine a possible &#8216;dose-response&#8217; relationship between use of the community website-delivered program and the primary measures. The mean age of participants was 52 yrs (SD = 4.57) and most were female (72%). Except for the proportion of overweight and obese adults (which was significantly greater in the intervention group), there were no significant differences between intervention and comparison group participants. Findings from Intention-to-Treat and Treatment Received analyses were similar and revealed that over time, participants in both groups reported statistically significant increases in time (min/week) spent walking anywhere in the neighbourhood (p &lt; .01), walking along the community walking path (p &lt; .01) and walking in total (p &lt; .001), but not walking for transport. Generally, the increases were greater among intervention group participants; however, the differences between the groups were not statistically significant. For example, at week-26 intervention group participants&#8217; data showed an increase in total walking of 26.5 min/week above baseline compared to an increase of only 4.8 min/week in the comparison group. The lack of significant between group differences was likely due to the small sample size which was insufficient to detect this meaningful increase in total walking. Over time, Intention-to-Treat and Treatment Received analysis revealed that participants in both groups reported statistically significant increases in perceptions of street connectivity (p &lt; .00), availability of walking/cycling facilities (p &lt; .05), and crime safety (p &lt; .00) but not perceptions of access, aesthetics or pedestrian/traffic safety. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups for any of the environmental attributes, suggesting that the community website-delivered program was not more effective at altering participants&#8217; perceptions of their environment compared to a standard websitedelivered physical activity program. There was a statistically significant (p &lt;.05) time effect for total physical activity (expressed as the total number of minutes spent in physical activity with vigorous activity weighted by two; wt.min/week). By week-26, intervention group data showed an increase in total physical activity of 57.7 wt.min/week compared to an increase of 12.7 wt.min/week in the comparison group. The difference between the groups was not statistically significant. At week-26, the proportion of intervention group participants who reported meeting the Australian and American College of Sports Medicine/Centres for Disease Control Physical Activity Guidelines increased by 25% compared to an increase of 6% in comparison group participants. Nonetheless, there were no statistically significant differences between groups. In terms of individual level correlates, there were small, but statistically significant within group increases in self-efficacy (p &lt; .01) and family social support (p = .05), but no between group differences. Consistent with previous research, objectively determined use of the community website-delivered program was associated with changes in walking. Participants who accessed the website more frequently (&gt;2 times) had a statistically significantly greater increase in time (min/week) spent walking along the community walking path (p &lt; .05) than did participants who accessed the website less frequently (&lt;2 times). There were also greater increases in overall neighbourhood walking and total walking in participants who accessed the website; however these differences were not statistically significant. Participants in the intervention group demonstrated significantly greater use of their website, logging in nearly three times more than participants in the comparison group. Overall, however use of the community website-delivered physical activity program was low and declined substantially over time. Participants in the post-trial focus group discussions rated the community websitedelivered physical activity program favourably. In particular, focus group participants reported liking the fact that the website focused on their community and provided specific information on the opportunities for physical activity. Although not statistically significant the increases in walking and total physical activity in the intervention group were comparable to, and in some instances better than, previous trials of website-delivered physical activity programs that also involved volunteer participants. Overall, the findings reported in this thesis suggest that a community website, delivered in a real-world setting, may have the potential to promote meaningful increases in physical activity to large numbers of adults. Further research evaluating the longer-term impact of the program in a larger and more representative sample of participants is required. Also, the potential of additional strategies that encourage participants to use features of the website-delivered programs needs to be explored.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131294</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fatigue of a Sintered 2xxx Series Aluminium Alloy</field><field name="creator">Grayson, Gemma Nicole</field><field name="description">In recent years, rapid growth has been seen in the use of aluminium powder metallurgy (PM), largely driven by the automotive industry. However, there are limitations on the use of aluminium PM components, which are due, in part, to their mechanical properties. The fatigue properties are particularly limiting, as they are insufficient for use in many loadbearing applications. Although the mechanisms and fracture mechanics of fatigue in aluminium alloys have been well documented for wrought and cast material, it was not clear whether this research could be directly applied to sintered materials because of their unique microstructural features. Therefore, the primary objective of this research was to investigate and characterise the fatigue behaviour of a sintered 2xxx series aluminium alloy. Specimens were prepared from a pre-mixed, elemental powder, AMB-2712 (Al-3.8Cu- 1Mg-0.7Si-0.1Sn + 1.5% Acrawax). The powder was compacted uniaxially in a floating die, with a compaction pressure of 200 MPa. Green parts were then sintered in a dry, high purity nitrogen atmosphere. The standard sintering parameters were 30 minutes at 600&#176;C. Fatigue testing was carried out in 3-point bending, under constant cyclic loading conditions and with a stress ratio, R, of 0.1. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the tensile surface and the fracture surface of fatigued specimens. Sintered aluminium alloy AMB-2712 (compacted at 200 MPa and sintered for 30 mins at 600&#176;C) has a 0.2% yield strength of 138 MPa and 2% ductility. The density is 2.67 g/cm3, corresponding to a porosity of 4.4%, and the average grain size is 93&#177;7 &#956;m. The fatigue endurance strength is ~145 MPa (R=0.1). Fatigue crack initiation occurs at a pore or pore cluster, located either at or slightly below the tensile surface. SEM analysis showed that the fatigue fracture surface can be divided into three regions, in terms of the dominant crack propagation mechanism in each. Region 1 contains the fatigue initiation site and initial, transgranular crack propagation, whilst propagation in Region 2 is primarily intergranular. The transition from transgranular to intergranular propagation occurs when the size of the plastic zone preceding the crack tip is approximately three times the grain size. At this point, Al2Cu particles in the grain boundaries ahead of the crack tip are fractured, creating an easier path for propagation. Region 3 is the fast fracture region, where crack propagation is by ductile overload. A number of distinctive features were observed on the fatigue fracture surfaces, including striations, microvoid coalescence dimples and a wide variety of step-like features. The morphology of the features observed within a transgranularly grain are thought to be determined by the level of mismatch between the plane of crack propagation and the crystallographic orientation of the grain in which they form. Porosity has significant deleterious effects on the fatigue properties of sintered AMB-2712, primarily due to its role in fatigue initiation. Relationships between the fatigue-initiating pore size and the fatigue life are well described by classical fracture mechanics. The empirical Paris Law constants m and C are 4.48 and 10-10.7 respectively. These values are in good agreement with those reported for aluminium castings, suggesting that fatigue behaviour of sintered AMB-2712 is analogous to that of cast Al alloys. Fatigue life was observed to decrease exponentially with decreasing density &#8211; i.e. as porosity increases. The experimentally derived relationship between density and fatigue life may have potential use in predicting the approximate fatigue lives of sintered AMB-2712 components prior to installation. Oxide films, located in the grain boundaries of intergranularly cracked regions, were observed on the fatigue fracture surfaces of sintered aluminium specimens. It is suggested that the films are artefacts of fatigue testing, which occur due to local fretting of mating fracture surfaces during cyclic loading.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131295</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavior of Helical Steel Culverts</field><field name="creator">Pritchard, Ross William</field><field name="description">This thesis has undertaken extensive field investigation into the response of helical culverts during incremental backfilling and under legal live loads on sinusoidal profile and ribbed profile helical culverts. Deformation, earth pressure and steel strains were measured. The strains were decomposed into hoop force and bending moment. Force-deflection tests were undertaken to determine the effective section properties that took into account the cold-formed section properties and irregularities from rolling during manufacture. High lateral earth pressures were measured during backfilling. A model was developed to demonstrate the formation of those pressures that approach the passive state. This has important implications for the design of buried structures and retaining walls. The response of helical culverts to legal live loads was examined. The effect of vehicle offset and time-dependent effects were considered. Dynamic load allowance was determined. The thesis also examined collapse mechanisms of helical culverts. It is essential that installers fully understand the response during backfilling A simplified design method has been developed which incorporates the maximum crown moment during backfilling. This is the critical load case.

They include molluscs, and share highly conserved cleavage patterns, cell lineages and embryogenesis, but exhibit a wide diversity of adult body plans. This makes them an excellent group for studying the mechanisms by which changes to developmental programs give rise to evolution of new body plans. Spiralian cleavage results in an embryo that is divided into quadrants of tiered blastomeres designated A, B, C and D, which form the left, ventral, right and dorsal regions of the embryo respectively (Verdonk and van den Biggelaar, 1983). The establishment of the dorsoventral axis and the organization of the embryo are closely linked in molluscs and involve the specification of the dorsal, D-quadrant. In equally cleaving gastropods, one macromere at the 32-cell stage is induced by the overlying micromeres to become the D-quadrant macromere, 3D (van den Biggelaar and Guerrier 1979, Arnolds et al., 1983; Boring, 1989). The 3D macromere is required for the formation of the mesendoderm, a dorsoventral cleavage pattern and the specification and organization of the ectoderm (van den Biggelaar and Guerrier 1979, Boring 1989, Damen and Dictus 1994, 1996) This thesis investigates the molecular mechanisms of gastrulation in the gastropod mollusc Haliotis asinina. In particular it focuses on the role that the 3D macromere plays in regulating the development of the molluscan embryo. The induction of the 3D-macromere was inhibited by independent treatments: first by interrupting the MAPK signalling cascade using the inhibitor U0126; and second by preventing micromere-macromere interactions with the chemical monensin. Genetic markers for morphogenetic domains were used to assess the hypothesised roles of 3D in generating the mesendodermal lineage, inducing the surrounding ectodermal micromeres, establishing the dorsoventral axis, and regulating morphogenetic movement. Microarray analysis of treated embryos was conducted to determine the role that 3D induction plays in regulating gene expression during early development. Both U0126 and monensin treatments of H. asinina embryos yielded abnormal trochophores, similar to those of other gastropods whose normal development has been perturbed by inhibiting 3D specification (Arnolds et al., 1983; Boring, 1989; Damen and Dictus, 1996a; K&#252;htreiber et al., 1988; Lambert and Nagy, 2003; Martindale, 1986; Martindale et al., 1985; Raven, 1976; van den Biggelaar and Guerrier, 1979). Analysing these treatments revealed that MAPK is a crucial component of the 3D induction pathway in H. asinina, as found for Ilyanassa and Tectura (Lambert and Nagy, 2003; Lambert and Nagy, 2001), with its inhibition resulting in a loss of mesendodermal patterning. The induction of the 3D-macromere results in the establishment of a molluscan organiser, which is responsible for widespread gene activation during early development and is required for proper morphogenetic movements associated with gastrulation. There appears to be similarities in the inductive processes in gastrulation between vertebrates and gastropods. In particular the patterning of the midline and flanking neuroectoderm, which is induced to form neuronal tissue by underlying mesoderm. Inhibition of 3D induction prevented neurogenesis, supporting the hypothesis of a 3D-dependant inducer of the neuroectoderm, possibly the mesodermal bands (van den Biggelaar and Dictus, 2004). The establishment of the dorsoventral axis and patterning of the gastrulating gastropod appears more complex that previously suggested. It appears that the patterning of the gastropod is compartmentalised. The 3D macromere is required for the induction of quadrant identity and patterning of the pretrochal ectoderm, and preventing 3D induction results in a radialisation of gene expression patterns. In the posttrochal ectoderm preventing 3D induction does not prevent dorsoventral patterning in at least the vegetal ectoderm. This suggests that there is either 3D independent induction or regulatory processes involved in the axial patterning of the mollusc.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270504 Invertebrate Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131299</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models for predictive control of electric mining shovels</field><field name="creator">Wallis, Douglas</field><field name="description">Electric mining shovels are used in open pit mining. Their efficiency of operation directly effects mine productivity and profitability. Shovel technologies such as trajectory following are a first step towards autonomous operation and have perceived cost saving benefits through improved efficiency and collision avoidance strategies. The development of such technologies requires rigorous testing which carries a high risk of lost production time and the potential for damaging machinery. The cost of lost production, and the remote location and nature of the environments in which electric mining shovels operate, make on site testing expensive and often infeasible. This thesis develops and validates a Simulink model of a P&amp;H-class electric mining shovel. The model provides a framework for developing and testing shovel technologies. Its usefulness is shown in simulations which test model predictive control (MPC) as a control strategy for point-to-point motion control of each of the three freedoms of a P&amp;H-class electric mining shovel. The thesis first presents a Simulink model describing the rigid body dynamics of a P&amp;H-class mining shovel. The model is based on work presented by Wauge [1] and relates torques applied by the three actuating drives to motions of the shovel dipper. The material of this thesis differs from that of Wauge [1] in two respects; (i) the model is presented from a systems (input/output) perspective for implementation in Simulink, and (ii) explicit expressions for various terms are given. The rigid body dynamics model is extended to include models of the DC motors, power electronics and the control loops. The input to the extended shovel model is a joystick position and outputs are drive position, speed, armature current, armature voltage, and field current. The model is validated against data collected from a P&amp;H 2100BLE mining shovel and the predicted shovel response is shown to be in close agreement with measured values. MPC uses fit-for-purpose models to predict future plant behavior, from which a set of control inputs is computed that commands the plant to a desired output. Calculating good control inputs relies heavily on the ability to accurately predict future plant behavior. This thesis develops linear state space prediction models for each of the shovel&#8217;s three freedoms. The prediction models are verified against data collected from a P&amp;H2100 BLE mining shovel and shown to provide &#8220;accurate enough predictions&#8221; for the purpose of predicting future plant behavior. A typical MPC optimization problem is formulated that uses the linear state space prediction models to optimize a cost function and command time-optimal point-topoint motion of each of the shovels three freedoms. Simulations which use the shovel model as a proxy for a real machine show that MPC is capable of commanding timeoptimal point-to-point motion control for the swing and crowd drives. Hoist drive non-linearities cause predictions to become inaccurate and the hoist drive is shown to become unstable when controlled using MPC.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131301</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher as Professional: Negotiating Teacher Identities within a Teacher Learning Community</field><field name="creator">Masuda, Avis Michie</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131302</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Challenges for Australian Tribunals; Towards Aretaic Practice Principles</field><field name="creator">Christou, Alison</field><field name="description">&#8216;&#8230;more citizens&#8230; receive their justice from agencies than the courts&#8217; (Chitra: 3). The last 30 years of administrative law practice in Australia have been characterised by the proliferation of tribunals and other bodies engaged in quasi-judicial work. These organisations have developed on a largely ad hoc basis, particularly at the state and territory level. Despite this rapid growth &#8211; or perhaps as a result of it - a clear articulation of the underlying practice principles pertinent to tribunals has yet to occur in any coherent fashion. This thesis canvasses the current mechanisms used to assist tribunal members in their work, including legislative and ethical parameters. The argument is then mounted that more guidance is needed in relation to the normative excellences of the tribunal member&#8217;s role. An analysis of the systemic and cultural challenges faced by the sector is presented, highlighting the lack of sector definition, disparate practices, resource limitations and institutional isolation that characterise Australian tribunal work. Canadian and United Kingdom experiences provide a useful context for Australian impediments and developments. A state-based merits review body is used as a case study throughout the thesis to illustrate these issues. It is posited that greater emphasis upon the philosophical underpinnings of tribunal practice will assist in improving cohesion among sector members, leading to enhanced delivery of administrative justice. A stance from virtue ethics is adopted as a starting point for this endeavour, on the basis that improved decision-making commences with close analysis of the excellences defining the tribunal member&#8217;s role. This aretaic approach highlights the importance of &#8216;practical wisdom&#8217; or phronesis in tribunal work. Methods for implementing and enhancing discussion of relevant tribunal practice principles are then examined, with various innovative legal training tools being nominated as particularly useful in the tribunal context. The tribunal sector is generally seen to have operated adequately to date. A more normative approach to decisionmaking excellence within the tribunal field is required, however, with this thesis forming the staring point of such analysis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131304</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">You Should've Been Here Yesterday: Tales from Surfing Mythology</field><field name="creator">Southhorn, Edward James</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420307 Consumption and Everyday Life</field><field name="subject">379999 Studies in Human Society not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131307</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive Developmental Analysis of Apostasy from Religious Fundamentalism</field><field name="creator">Raoul Adam</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a broad exploratory analysis of apostasy from religious fundamentalism in light of cognitive developmental theory. Reciprocally, the thesis provides a critique of cognitive developmental theory in light of its application to apostasy from fundamentalism. Autobiographical narratives of approximately 200 apostates from Christian and Muslim fundamentalisms are used to represent the experience of apostasy. Three related and representative cognitive developmental theories are used to inform the analysis of these apostate narratives. These theories include James Fowler&#8217;s Stages of Faith (FDT) (1981); Fritz Oser and Paul Gm&#252;nder&#8217;s Stages of Religious Judgment (RJT) (1991); and Helmut Reich&#8217;s Levels of Relational and Contextual Reasoning (RCR) (2002). These three representative theories are used to generate cognitive developmental hypotheses for the experiences of apostates from fundamentalisms. There are three primary hypotheses guiding the research: (i) Fundamentalist contents predispose a particular form of cognitive operations. (ii) Fundamentalist contents suspend equilibration between accommodation and assimilation. And (iii), some forms of apostasy from fundamentalism are the product of a sociocognitive conflict. These hypotheses are addressed through four research questions: (i) How do fundamentalist cultures sponsor or arrest cognitive development? (ii) What are the developmental characteristics of apostates&#8217; experiences? (iii) What are the implications of cognitive development for apostasy and fundamentalism? And (iv), what are the implications of apostasy from fundamentalism for theories of cognitive development? The thesis utilises a paradigm of critical realism and a theory of interactionism. Critical realism assumes the existence of an objective reality, while acknowledging its exclusively subjective mediation. The interactionist approach acknowledges the potential influences of genetic predisposition, social-environmental context, and individual agency affecting cognitive development and apostasy from fundamentalism. A dual methodological approach is used to collect and analyse data relevant to the hypothesis. Data collection involves two phases: (i) Collection of existing unstructured apostate narratives. And (ii), collection of semi-structured apostate responses. The first phase narratives are collected using online databases, published anthologies, and solicited scripts. The second phase responses are collected using a semi-structured survey. The dual methodological analysis combines coded content analysis and narrative analysis. Coding is informed by the three developmental theories. The qualitative thesis findings may be summarised in two parts. The first pertains to apostasy from fundamentalism; the second pertains to cognitive developmental theory. Of the former, the research found: (i) Cognitive development represents a significant and even primary influence in some forms of apostasy from fundamentalism. And (ii), some forms of fundamentalism sponsor stage specific structures. Reflecting on cognitive theories of religious development, the research found: (i) Sociocultural, affective, and noncognitive physical influences may directly and indirectly facilitate or inhibit cognitive development. (ii) Specific stages and structures of cognitive development may be culturally embedded. (iii) Cognitive development may be compartmentalised. (iv) Cognitive development may regress or fracture when faced with transitional crises and environmental changes. (v) There are diverse trajectories of religious development. And (vi), fractured development at one stage may perpetuate fractured development in the next stage. Finally, the thesis discusses implications of these findings for contemporary dialogue on religious development. These collective findings provide support for a religious styles model (i.e. Streib&#8217;s Religious Styles Perspective, 2001) that integrates a cognitive stream based on Fowler&#8217;s faith development into a more multiperspective understanding of religious development. Such a model would account more adequately for the diverse influences interacting to produce different trajectories of religious development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440000 Philosophy and Religion</field><field name="subject">Apostasy</field><field name="subject">Fundamentalism</field><field name="subject">Cognitive Development</field><field name="subject">Religious Development</field><field name="subject">Faith</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131309</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamental Study of Turbulence and Turbulent Mixing in a Small Subtropical Estuary</field><field name="creator">Trevethan, Mark</field><field name="description">The flow of water in natural systems such as estuaries is a turbulent process, with Reynolds numbers greater than 105. Understanding the turbulence properties of an estuary is important for the investigation of mixing, dispersion and sediment transport within an estuary. This study investigates the turbulence properties in a typical small subtropical estuary (Eprapah Creek, Australia). Small coastal plain type estuaries constitute approximately 60 % of all estuaries in Australia, yet no thorough study of the turbulence properties of this type of estuary has been conducted. To date only a limited number of turbulence studies in estuaries have been undertaken. One reason for this was the lack of appropriate instrumentation to collect turbulent velocity measurements with fine spatial and temporal resolutions. This is especially true of turbulence studies in small estuaries, with the majority of published turbulence studies being performed in relatively large systems. Previous studies of turbulence in estuaries were mostly conducted for relatively short periods (up to 6 hours) and by collecting data over long periods in bursts of several minutes. The present study showed that acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV) was well suited for the measurement of turbulence properties in small estuarine systems. A unique aspect of this study was the continuous collection of turbulence data at high frequency ( scan f K 25 Hz) for relatively long periods ( study T up to 50 hours). This approach characterised the estuarine turbulence properties for up to two complete tidal cycles. The data analysis showed that continuous collection of high frequency turbulence data was essential to accurately characterise the rapid fluctuations of turbulence in an estuary. The field data showed that the turbulence flow properties were highly fluctuating in a small estuary. All turbulence properties exhibited large and rapid fluctuations over the investigation period of each field study. The variations in time scales were related to both the instantaneous local flow properties and the tidal fluctuations. Some long period oscillations observed in the water level and velocity data also had a significant impact on the turbulence properties. These long period oscillations had periods similar to resonance periods generated both internally in and externally to the creek. Many turbulence properties showed an asymmetrical response to the tidal forcing, especially under spring tidal conditions. Large turbulent velocity fluctuations were, however, observed throughout all investigation periods, including during the slack tides. Substantial fluctuations in the normal and tangential Reynolds stresses were observed in the middle and upper estuarine zones. The turbulent velocity data showed some non-Gaussian behaviour and the Reynolds stresses were non-Gaussian throughout all investigation periods. Field data collected mid estuary under spring and neap tidal conditions showed two distinctly different turbulence responses for spring and neap tides. During spring tides, the magnitudes of all turbulence properties were up to an order of magnitude larger than for neap tides. The turbulence properties showed some increased tidal asymmetries under spring tidal conditions. Further two field studies were conducted under similar neap tidal conditions in the middle and upper estuarine zones. A comparison of these two data sets showed that the turbulence properties in the middle and upper estuaries differed substantially. Mid estuary, the magnitude of the turbulence properties were up to an order of magnitude larger than those observed in the upper estuary, thereby indicating that at least three distinct sets of turbulence properties existed in this small subtropical estuary. This study included some turbulence data collected in a large tidal lake with a restricted entrance (Hamana Lake, Japan). This turbulence data was compared with the data measured in Eprapah Creek. The comparison showed similar tidal patterns in some turbulence properties were observed close to the bed despite the distinct topography and hydrodynamics of the two estuaries. Some of these patterns in turbulence properties were also observed in previous studies of turbulence in estuaries. However, the spring tide data collected in the small estuary showed an increased magnitude of turbulence and a more asymmetrical response than other estuarine turbulence studies. The ratio of local tidal amplitude and local mean depth l l a h was used to characterise the local turbulence properties for a certain tidal range. A critical value of the ratio l l a h was 0.5, corresponding to the local tidal range being equal to the local mean depth. If the tidal range was greater than the local mean depth (i.e. l l a h &gt; 0.5), a more asymmetrical tidal response and some increased turbulence property magnitudes were observed. A comparison of the turbulence properties in two distinct tidal systems (Eprapah Creek and Hamana Lake) showed similar tidal patterns for l l a h &lt; 0.5.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131310</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Museum of the Self and rewriting the masculine: exile, return, self-knowledge</field><field name="creator">Bruce Llewellyn Russell</field><field name="description">This thesis contains two parts, a creative component, &#8220;The Museum of the Self,&#8221; and a critical essay, &#8220;Rewriting the Masculine: Exile, Return, Selfknowledge.&#8221; The creative component, a novel titled &#8220;The Museum of the Self&#8221;, concerns a man, Mick Fowler, who takes leave from his work as a headhunter to attend to the mess in his shed, material remains of the life he once shared with Joni. Mick&#8217;s journey sees him fabricate a &#8220;museum&#8221; out of objects and memories, join a men&#8217;s therapy group and become a grandfather. The novel seeks to represent one man&#8217;s journey to self-understanding and contribute to a more expansive discourse on masculinity. The critical essay, &#8220;Rewriting the Masculine: Exile, Return, Selfknowledge&#8221;, links the construction of a masculine self with the processes of self-curating and therapy. Beginning with images from Ovid&#8217;s Metamorphoses, the essay briefly revisits some of my own fictions, published and unpublished, written over the course of thirty years. Journeys of exile and discovery are discussed, including the journey of men and feminism. The &#8220;unimagined arts&#8221; of shed life and therapy are compared and the &#8220;fatal apprenticeship&#8221; of filialness is canvassed. Finally, I address the same questions raised by the creative project: is the novel adequate to contain such material? Why not a memoir? Tracing a line through my previous representations of the masculine, I ask how hard would it be to represent a happy man in a fiction? Finally, I consider the &#8220;flightless bird&#8221; of realism, its possibilities and limitations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131312</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local Government Policies For Economic Development: The Experience Of Brisbane, Melbourne And Fremantle</field><field name="creator">Jones, Stephen M.</field><field name="description">In the Australian context policies impacting on economic development have traditionally been the preserve of Commonwealth and state governments. Economic restructuring, particularly since the early 1980&#8217;s, has seen the rise of local government as a more active participant in promoting economic development at the local level. What emerged was a highly competitive environment where local governments established their own policies to attract and promote private sector investment and employment growth. Policy makers were faced with the difficult task of identifying the most appropriate policy levers and frameworks that covered a diverse and often competitive range of issues. Australian local governments that established economic development policies were placing themselves in a scenario that was outside the statutory parameters of their legislative frameworks and often well beyond their resource capacity. A prerequisite for effectiveness in this complex area of public policy would be a clear understanding of economic development and the ability of councils to participate in the process. The aim of this research is to establish a model which can explain the role that local government can play in achieving local economic development. By examining the international and Australian literature a broad-based multi-disciplinary model is developed to facilitate interpretation of the concept of economic development in a manner suitable for policy makers in the local government context. This model is tested against in depth case studies of three Australian local governments which have embarked on strong economic development policies. The conclusions focus on the relevance of the model through determining its &#8216;fit&#8217; with the established policies, and its potential contribution to concept and practice.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360201 Public Policy</field><field name="subject">360202 Public Administration</field><field name="subject">340209 Public Sector Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131959</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adults Before Their Time: Parentification During Adolescence In Divorcing And Married Families</field><field name="creator">Rogers, Carla Maree</field><field name="description">In broad terms, parentification can be defined as a child taking on the role of parent to his or her own parents; though in reality the construct is more complex. Although related constructs (e.g. boundary transgressions, role reversal, &#8216;hurried child&#8217;) have been discussed in the literature for many years, the term &#8216;parentification&#8217; per se is a relatively new one within the field of psychological research and empirical studies are still limited. When researching in the field of parentification, an issue that is apparent is the lack of adequate measures of parentification available for children and adolescents. The few measures of parentification that exist have been (a) retrospective (asking adults to recall levels of responsibility within their families of origin as adolescents) and/or (b) uni-dimensional (measuring parentification as a single score rather than taking into account different facets such as confidant to one&#8217;s own parents, mediator between conflicting parents, &#8216;pseudo-parents&#8217; to siblings, or excessive household responsibilities). The first aim of the current research was to develop a reliable and valid multidimensional measure of parentification that was appropriate for completion by children and adolescents. The series of studies that follow utilise this newly developed parentification scale to examine parentification of adolescents aged 10-16 years from families undergoing parental divorce. A comparison group of children from two-parent continuously married (not remarried) families were included. A previously validated uni-dimensional measure of parentification, the Parentification Questionnaire &#8211; Youth (PQ-Y: Godsall &amp; Jurkovic, 1995) was also used throughout the studies (although in the current sample, this measure was multidimensional, yielding two factors labelled Alienation and Tangible Tasks). Broad research goals of the studies are: 1. to examine parentification (and its association with family functioning and sibling relationship quality) from the perspective of multiple family members, 2. to explore parentification differences between families on variables of age, sex, birth order, family size and parental marital status, and 3. to assess the extent to which parentification affects adolescent psychological adjustment, and how burden of parentification may mediate the relationship between parentification and psychological adjustment. Parents and children aged 10-16 years from 304 families (127 divorcing; 177 married) were invited to participate in a 12-month study of parentification that included questions about demographics, family responsibilities, family functioning, adolescent adjustment, and sibling relationships. In addition, in divorcing families, both parents and one child (target child) were invited to be interviewed regarding their experiences surrounding the separation and divorce. The measure of parentification designed for the current research adapted the multidimensional, retrospective measure written by Mika, Bergner and Baum (1987). This new measure was labelled the Youth Parentification Scale (YPS), and findings suggest that it is a reliable measure of parentification in the current sample of married and divorcing families. Results revealed that children from divorcing families and girls reported higher levels of parentification (across various factors). Results on multiple perspectives within the family were mixed. In general, children were more likely than their parents to report higher levels of parentification within the family, although this effect differed slightly dependent upon parental marital status. Siblings who reported offering support to other members of the family also rated their relationship with their sibling as warmer: this result held true for both firstand second-born children. Additionally, both first- and second-born children agreed that parentification may affect the relative status/power between siblings. While few direct associations between parentification and adjustment existed, negative adjustment outcomes (higher anxiety, higher depression and lower self-esteem) were evident when the burden associated with increased responsibility was taken into account. Taking on the role of confidant to one&#8217;s parents, playing &#8216;pseudo-parent&#8217; to one&#8217;s siblings, or feeling alienated within one&#8217;s family of origin was associated with higher levels of burden, which in turn led children to report higher depression and anxiety and lower self-esteem. Additionally, taking on a parentified role was associated with higher levels of burden, which in turn was associated with reports of lower levels of family functioning (i.e. lower intimacy, higher conflict, and a more controlling parenting style). The current research has implications for the development and refinement of future measures of parentification for use in empirical studies. The Youth Parentification Scale showed that different facets of parentification do seem to exist, and that offering comfort and support to mothers or fathers seems to have an association with various aspects of adjustment, sibling relationships and general family functioning. Alienation (a factor emerging from the PQ-Y), while not actually associated with increased responsibility or parentification per se, showed associations with parentification that indicate that this may be an important construct to include in future attempts at developing a comprehensive measure of parentification. Additionally, the current research unveiled findings that may have clinical importance. Findings revealed that while children from divorcing families did exhibit higher scores on various scales of parentification, outcomes were not necessarily worse for these children than for children within married families who were similarly parentified. Adolescence is a time of emotional growth when some age-appropriate adoption of adult responsibility is warranted; and in fact for children undergoing the transition of parental separation and divorce, adoption of extra responsibilities may be adaptive, perhaps even protective inasmuch as it may bring the child closer to parents during a time when anxiety about family dissolution is high. Further studies (preferably longitudinal) exploring the adaptive facets of parentification are warranted.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">380105 Social and Community Psychology</field><field name="subject">389999 Other Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">parentification</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">families</field><field name="subject">role reversal</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">parents</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132033</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improvements To Personalised Recommender Systems</field><field name="creator">Ma, Shanle</field><field name="description">The tremendous growth of information on the Internet has been above our ability to process. A recommender system, which filters out useful information and generate recommendations, has been introduced to help users overcome the information overload problem and has been widely applied in an ever-increasing number of e-commercial websites. Collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation methods are two major approaches used in recommender systems. The collaborative filtering predicts items which a particular user prefers by using a database about the past preferences of users with similar interests. The content-based method analyses the content of the objects to generate a representative list of the user&#8217;s interests, and then compares the similarity of item descriptions. These two methods have some drawbacks in dealing with situations such as sparse data and cold start problems. Recently, hybrid methods combining collaborative filtering and content-based methods have been proposed to overcome these limitations. However, personalized recommender system attempt to penetrate people&#8217;s various demand and generate the tailored recommendations. A highly effective and personalised recommender system may still face new challenges including interestdrifting and multicriteria optimisation. For example, a user&#8217;s interest may change over time. They may no longer like a item which was strongly preferred. Another example is that a person&#8217;s preference is varying and always has multiple criteria. Classic collaborative filtering uses a single overall rating for prediction. It does not properly reflect the opinion on a item and the reason why people rated this item high or low. Unfortunately, the current recommender systems do not consider these important factors. First, we proposed a novel hybrid recommender system to overcome interest-drifting by embedding the time-sensitive functions into the recommendation process. The experimental results show that the intergraded approach with interest-drifting can constantly perform better and provide users with higher quality recommendations. Meanwhile, the experimental results on different size of training dataset show that our algorithm can boost the prediction accuracy for all configurations. The contributions of this proposed algorithm are in two main aspects. First, using time function to reflect users&#8217; intersts changing in order to achieve higher quality of recommendations. Second, using intergraded methods to solve some problems such as sparsity and cold start. Then we developed a new technique to aggregate the multicriteria ratings for predicting more accurate recommendations. The results show that our algorithms outperforms the traditional collaborative filtering recommender system on both accuracy of predicting ratings and accuracy of recommendations. The one of contributions in this proposed method is that we introduced the multicriteria concept into recommender systems to reflect the users&#8217; opinion more accurate. Another contribution is that we develop a linear method to aggregate multicriteria to single rating for higher quality of recommendations. Our experiments demonstrate that the recommendation achieved better performances when interest-drifting and multicriteria ratings were considered. The significance of our research study is that we consider incorporating interest-drifting, and multicriteria ratings into a recommender system to generate personalised and effective recommendations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280101 Information Systems Organisation</field><field name="subject">280104 Computer-Human Interaction</field><field name="subject">280107 Global Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132035</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crisis Management in the MICE Sector: Critical Success Factors</field><field name="creator">Campiranon, Kom</field><field name="description">As a lucrative tourism sector, the meetings, incentives, conventions, and exhibitions (MICE) sector has been significantly affected by crises in recent years, from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, to the SARS and bird flu epidemics, to the tsunami of late 2004. One of the key effects of such crises has been growing safety concerns when it comes to crisis-struck MICE destinations. In turn, this has impacted on both MICE customers&#8217; perceived risk in terms of purchasing MICE products, and their decision to follow through on planned MICE events. In addition, the MICE sector reveals noticeably differing levels of crisis vulnerability when compared to other tourism sectors; in particular, one of the clear differences lies in the decision making process itself, given that MICE sector buyers sponsor the endusers of MICE products, and are thus heavily liable for the safety of attendees. Not surprisingly, any life-threatening situation in MICE destinations discourages buyers from taking the decision to purchase. In contrast to other tourism sectors where the buyer and end-user are generally one and the same, in MICE tourism customers and consumers remain distinct. Taken together, both the impacts of crisis and crisis vulnerability suggest that crises can affect business continuity in the MICE sector significantly. In turn, MICE suppliers need to understand the impacts of crisis on tourism demand in the MICE sector, and come to terms with the key factors contributing to crisis vulnerability in order to better cope with, and sustain, their MICE businesses through crisis situations. To this end, the core aim of this research is to identify the critical success factors responsible for effective crisis management in the MICE sector. To achieve this, this research has developed three research questions, and investigated these questions through qualitative data collection and analysis of thirty-seven in-depth interviews with MICE suppliers in Thailand. The findings of these interviews provide both rich and substantively meaningful understandings of pertinent crisis management issues. More specifically, through detailed analysis of this data, this research examines the impact of crises on tourism demand in the MICE sector; the factors contributing to crisis vulnerability in the sector; and finally, the critical success factors of crisis management as they apply to the sector. In sum, this research achieves its research aims by providing ten critical success factors (CSFs) which organizations need to implement to successfully manage crisis situations. In summary, the findings of this research provide a contribution to knowledge by highlighting that the characteristics of the MICE product market not only contribute to fragmentation within the MICE sector, but also to both crisis vulnerability and crisis management approaches in a context of MICE tourism. Both the contributions and implications of this research have the potential to contribute to better crisis management in the MICE sector and tourism industry as a whole.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350505 Tourism Economics</field><field name="subject">350506 Tourism Forecasting</field><field name="subject">350501 Tourism Policy and Planning</field><field name="subject">meetings</field><field name="subject">incentives</field><field name="subject">conventions</field><field name="subject">exhibitions</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132037</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Subcellular localisation of key enzymes that regulate mammalian egg maturation</field><field name="creator">Edgecumbe, Paul Christopher</field><field name="description">Meiosis requires cells to undergo two successive rounds of division without an intermediate synthesis or S-phase. This results in a gamete with half the number of chromosomes that can then combine with those of another gamete to begin the development of a new offspring. Once an oocyte enters meiosis it is arrested in late prophase I and remains in that state until the animal reaches sexual maturity and undergoes ovulation. Upon hormonal stimuli, the oocyte is released from its first meiotic arrest, undergoes oocyte maturation, arrests in metaphase II and is ovulated to await fertilisation. The process of oocyte maturation is governed by the interaction of many different protein kinases, phosphatases and proteases. How these proteins co-localise with each other during oocyte maturation is a central aim of this thesis. One central protein is maturation promoting factor or MPF. MPF is composed of a catalytic subunit, cdc2 and a regulatory subunit, cyclin B1. Throughout oocyte maturation MPF activity is dynamic and changes in MPF activity coordinate the progression of oocyte maturation. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) plays a role in regulating the activity of MPF at specific times during oocyte maturation by targeting and degrading the cyclin B1 subunit. In this thesis the 20S proteasome &#8216;core&#8217; of the 26S proteasome was localised in bovine and murine oocytes undergoing maturation in vitro. The 20S proteasome was found in the germinal vesicle prior to maturation in both species. Once germinal vesicle breakdown occurred, the proteasome consistently localised around the developing spindle in both species. Cyclin B1, an important target of the UPP was also localised in murine oocytes to see how the UPP interacted with its substrates during oocyte maturation. Cyclin B1 was found to have similar localisation patterns throughout oocyte maturation to the 20S proteasome. This demonstrates that the 26S proteasome moves to the location of its substrates in order to degrade them. To confirm the role of the UPP in cyclin B1 degradation, we inhibited proteasome function using MG132, a known inhibitor of proteasome function. Polar body 1 (PB1) extrusion declined significantly (P&lt;0.05) in a dose dependent manner, confirming that the UPP is essential for the continuation of meiosis. Our localisation data indicated that cyclin B1 interacted with the UPP during the GV stage and around GVBD. Inhibition of the proteasome, again using MG132, prevented oocytes from undergoing GVBD and arrested them in the GV stage. This demonstrated that the UPP was essential for oocyte maturation as well as indicating a potential switch in substrate during this transition. The deubiquitinylating enzyme, Fat Facets in Mouse (FAM also know as USP9x), an antagonist of the UPP, was also localised in murine oocytes undergoing maturation in vitro. FAM was found primarily in the cytoplasm prior to germinal vesicle breakdown however it relocalised to the developing spindle upon germinal vesicle breakdown. FAM is known to rescue a number of specific substrates from ubiquitinylation and degradation, one being I- catenin, a multifunctional protein, not previously implicated in oocyte maturation. Localisation of I-catenin during oocyte maturation revealed distinct staining at specific stages of meiosis. Staining was observed on the plasma membrane and in the GV prior to maturation. During MI and MII it appeared to co-localise with FAM. When homologous chromosomes divided at AI/TI I-catenin distinctly localised to the cleavage furrow indicating its involvement during cytokinesis. To determine if FAM activity was essential for oocyte maturation we inhibited FAM function by microinjecting anti-FAM serum into eggs post GVBD. Inhibition of FAM prevented PB1 extrusion. Some oocytes appeared to attempt PB1 but failed to complete (Hoechst staining of the chromatin revealed these cells remained in MI). This finding strongly indicates that FAM maybe rescuing I-catenin from degradation during MI until it is needed at AI/TI. However further examination of this interaction are needed to clarify the data. This research demonstrates that regulation of turnover of key proteins is essential for progression through oocyte maturation. It also demonstrates that multiple pathways may regulate the same processes.

The effort to commercialise this plant has intensified in the last decade. That guayule can survive extreme environmental conditions makes it more attractive to farmers, especially under conditions of moisture stress. Recent research has indicated that guayule grows well in Australia producing high rubber and resin yield. Efficient seed production technology resulting in high quality seed is vital to full commercialisation of this crop. The main objective of this research was to investigate production, harvesting and processing of guayule seed. This included investigation on flowering nature of guayule, determination of optimum seed maturity, effect of plant population on seed yield and quality and the development of harvesting and seed processing technology. Guayule was established in the field at four plant populations. A seed harvester was developed and tested over two production seasons. A seed threshing and cleaning machine was also developed and evaluated. Flowering behaviour of guayule was studied over three years with the objective of determining when peak flowering occurs and to investigate factors affecting flower initiation and pattern of flowering. The results indicated that photoperiod is the likely main trigger for flower initiation with soil moisture and temperature also having some influence. With rainfall as the only source of moisture, flowering peaks occurred in mid-spring (October) and in Summer (February) in Southeast Queensland, Australia. After initial flowering, the flowering pattern was mainly affected by soil moisture. High summer temperatures reduced the number of flowers. The optimum harvest maturity and indicators of maturity for guayule were investigated by harvesting seed sequentially after flowering and comparing seed quality parameters. Heat units expressed as growing degree days after flowering were calculated and related to seed development stages and quality. Seed quality was assessed by germination test, capitulum dry mass, 1000-seed mass and percentage of filled seeds. Results indicated that guayule seed can safely be harvested at about 329 growing degree-days (GDD) or 28 days after flowering under south-east Queensland climatic conditions. At this date seed quality was better and seedhead colour was comparable to cinnamon (code 165C) on the Royal Horticultural Society (R.H.S) standard colour chart. Of all the parameters, GDD, 1000-seed mass and percentage of filled seeds provided more rapid and reliable measures of optimum seed maturity. The effect of plant population on seed yield and quality was studied by planting guayule at 4444, 8300, 12500 and 25000 plants/ha. Data were collected at 16 and 28 months after planting. Seed was harvested manually multiple times over 4 weeks each year following the main flowering period in spring. Harvested seed was threshed and clean seed yield was compared among different plant populations. Seed quality was also compared in terms of 1000-seed mass and seed size. Lowest plant population of 4444 plants/ha provided the highest yield at 28 months but produced the lowest yield at 16 months from planting when the plants had not yet reached full size to compensate for wider spacing. However, at both ages this treatment produced heavier and larger seeds. The difference in yield or seed quality between plant populations ranging from 8300 to 25000 plants/ha was not significant. Overall results of the study demonstrated that seed yield and seed size, which is important in direct seeding, can be affected by plant population. A single-row guayule seed harvester was developed after investigating different methods of seed dislodgement and collection. The harvester consisted of a seed dislodgement mechanism that removes seeds by vibration of spring steel rods. An axial flow fan placed directly over the vibrating rods catches the seed before it falls to the ground. The seed is then conveyed by the air stream through an inflatable canvas tube to a collection bin. The design and selection of the seed catching system was based on terminal velocity of the unthreshed seed. Vibration frequencies ranging from 9.9 to 14.5 Hz and amplitude from 4 to 5.5 cm were used to test the harvester in the field. Harvested seed was analysed for percentages of clean seed in the harvested material, seed loss and immature seeds harvested. The performance of the machine was evaluated based on harvesting capacity and efficiency. Guayule seed harvested by the machine ranged from 1.73 to 7.18 kg/ha and harvest efficiency varied from 77 to 91%. The percentage of immature seeds removed from the crop during mechanical harvesting was as low as 0.1%. Although there was a trend for better efficiency from higher vibration frequencies, the variation was not statistically significant. Nearly 21% of clean seed was obtained in the harvested material which was much higher than that reported by other researchers. The harvester can be converted into a multiple row machine to increase its capacity. A guayule seed processing system consisting of a belt thresher, a vibrating screen separator and horizontal air grading unit was developed and evaluated. The machine efficiency was up to 77% with little seed injury. Seed purity reached 98% and germination 76%. Of the 3 grades of seed collected from the machine, up to 63.5% of the seed processed was first grade with 1000-seed mass achieving 764 mg; this is highly desirable for direct seeding. The processing capacity of the threshing unit can easily be upsized by increasing belt width. Threshing clearance and belt speed affected seed quality and grade as well as overall efficiency of the machine. The greatest efficiency was obtained with a combination of clearance between 0.75 and 1 mm and belt speed of 9 m/s.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132159</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models and frameworks that enhance systematic planning for coral reef biodiversity conservation</field><field name="creator">Beger, Maria</field><field name="description">The global decline of coral reef biodiversity requires rapid, efficient and practical solutions. No-take marine reserves and reserve systems and other managed marine conservation areas are currently considered one of the most effective management methods to deal with this ongoing decline. Although the effects, design, and establishment of coral reef reserves have been widely debated in the literature, few examples of systematic approaches to the design of reserve systems exist. Systematic conservation planning is a procedure to prioritise sites for their inclusion in reserve systems based on data and a set of conservation principles. For coral reefs the systematic design of reserve systems has been hampered by the lack of spatially explicit data, and the lack of practical recommendations to resource managers of how to apply new scientific findings. This thesis fills critical gaps at the interface between theory, planning, and implementation of coral reef reserve systems, and provides practical guidance to reef managers. In the first chapter, literature on marine reserves is discussed and the implications for coral reef reserves are considered. Chapter 2 discusses the lessons learned in the design and implementation of a community-based marine reserve in the Philippines. Reviewing relevant literature, a framework of &#8216;lessons learnt&#8217; during the establishment of local protected areas is presented, highlighting the importance of a number of factors that are vital to the success of these reserves: (a) an island location; (b) small community population size; (c) minimal effect of land-based development; (d) application of a bottom-up approach; (e) an external facilitating institution; (f) acquisition of title; (g) use of a scientific information database; (h) stakeholder involvement; (i) the establishment of legislation; (j) community empowerment; (k) alternative livelihood schemes; (l) surveillance; (m) tangible management results; (n) continued involvement of external groups after reserve establishment, and (o) small-scale project expansion. To manage coral reef species it is important to understand the processes that influence their distribution. Chapter 3 identifies the environmental factors most influential in determining coral reef fish species distributions on a regional scale. Logistic regression models for 227 fish species related presence-absence data to four remotely determined environmental predictor variables: depth 500 m away from a reef, presence of a land-sea interface, exposure, and the distance to the nearest estuary. A novel method of evaluating model significance identified suitable models for 134 species. All four predictor variables were important for the distributions of the chosen suite of fishes. Depth was the most frequently significant variable in single variable models, and the proximity of a reef to an island was the least frequently important variable. For combinations of two predictor variables, depth and exposure as well as depth and distance from the nearest estuary were the prevalent predictors of fish distributions. Several fish species responded to the combination of the distance from an estuary and the presence of the terrestrial-marine interface, indicating that these species depend on intact coastal reef habitat, which is in decline near the main sediment-laden rivers. Significant models were predominantly developed for habitat specific species. These habitat specific species are of greater conservation concern than widespread species because of their restricted range, or because threats affect them more severely if they are selectively affecting their habitat. For this reason, species distribution modelling may be an efficient method to inform reserve design. The relevance of cross-taxon congruence to the suitability of taxa as conservation representation surrogates of coral reef biodiversity across the Indo-Pacific is tested in Chapter 4, using species lists of fishes, corals, and molluscs. Congruence is identified with a linear regression analysis of dissimilarity values. The utility of a surrogate was determined by the degree to which each taxon can represent the others in a marine reserve network using a greedy reserve selection algorithm. None of the taxonomic groups examined was capable of acting as a general conservation representation surrogate. Even a data-rich taxon like fishes could be severely under-represented in reserve systems designed based on a surrogate taxon such as corals, implying that data-deficient taxa are unlikely to be represented adequately where surrogate taxa are used for planning. Despite the high cross-taxon congruence between fishes and corals, and between corals and molluscs for some regions, cross-taxon congruence was not always a reliable indicator of conservation representation surrogacy. Consequently, in Indo-Pacific coral reef ecosystems one can only be sure that a target taxon is represented fully in a marine reserve network when data on this taxon are used to select reserve sites. The fifth chapter provides a theoretical and practical framework for incorporating ecological processes that span terrestrial, marine, and freshwater environmental realms into systematic conservation planning. Firstly the types of processes are classified as interactions that exist: a) on narrow interfaces such as inter-tidal zones; b) on broad interfaces such as mangrove swamps; c) along constrained connections such as corridors used by amphibian movements between natal ponds and adult habitat; and d) through diffuse connections like bird migrations. A framework of conservation planning approaches to promote the persistence of these types of processes and examples of how they might be implemented is developed. The framework focuses both on problem formulations consistent with existing decision support tools, such as the conservation planning software MARXAN, and on new methods. The review is aimed at a broad audience of scientists, planners, and managers and takes a practical and illustrative approach, providing examples of existing work and pointing readers to tools that are available to enhance conservation planning across realms. In the concluding chapter ideas from all chapters are synthesised. This chapter discusses how the approaches and frameworks presented here could be extended, and profitable areas for future research are suggested. Overall this thesis provides new insights, concepts, and tools that can assist reef managers and scientists struggling to minimise the loss of coral reefs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300803 Natural Resource Management</field><field name="subject">300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132162</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the Mechanisms of SugarBooster&#8482; Effects</field><field name="creator">Long, Hao</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132166</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nuclear Body Formation by the Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigen-3 Family Proteins</field><field name="creator">Burgess, Anita Gay</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132170</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of parasitic and micropredatory isopods on coral reefs</field><field name="creator">Jones, Conor McNamara</field><field name="description">Arthropod parasites and micropredators, such as ticks and mosquitoes, influence terrestrial ecosystems and harm their hosts directly and indirectly by vectoring micro-organisms. Whether micropredators similarly affect marine ecosystems and hosts is not well understood. In coral reef fish communities, the most abundant micropredators are isopods, in particular, gnathiids. Our understanding of how isopods affect fishes has been restricted by a lack of information regarding basic isopod biology including; patterns of abundance, parasite identity, host specificity and host pathology. Also it is unknown if small juvenile fish are parasitised by isopods, and if this affects their survival. Sequentially, the aims of my PhD thesis were to understand the ecology of several lesser known parasites in sufficient detail to perform manipulative experiments that could test the effects of micropredation on small juvenile reef fish. All field studies took place at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef My first study aimed to describe temporal and spatial patterns of isopod abundance by measuring emergence rates. Gnathiid isopod juveniles emerge from the benthos into the water column to find hosts or change locations. Although diel patterns have been demonstrated, the relationship between substrate and emergence on coral reefs is not clear. I measured emergence rates of parasitic isopods (Gnathiidea and Flabellifera) in 6 &#8220;habitats&#8221; at 2 very different sites at Lizard Island. Isopods were collected from the periphery and centres of 3 sizes of reef, and from the substrate between these reefs (sand or rubble). At both sites, the most abundant gnathiid species (Gnathia falcipenis and Gnathia sp C), was exclusive to that site. Although strong diel patterns in emergence were observed, gnathiid abundance could not be predicted by habitat. However, gnathiids were larger and more often fed over reef borders than in the centres of reefs. To explain these patterns, I suggested that first stage larvae had the largest influence on total abundance and were patchily distributed in accordance with adults from which they had recently hatched. As later stage larvae also depend on fish, more successful (fed and older larvae) are found on the edges of reefs where appropriate hosts may be more abundant. Gnathiids were over-dispersed in all habitats investigated, including apparently homogeneous beds of coral rubble and sand. This indicated that gnathiid distribution may be better predicted by very fine scale differences in substrate, or that larvae are simply gregarious, and that abundance may be difficult to predict on the basis of substrate. Without reliable differences in parasite abundance among habitats at Lizard Island, subsequent studies would rely on manipulating parasite abundance via excluding wild parasites in the field (which proved very difficult) or by controlling abundance in laboratory simulations. I then investigated host specificity in the 2 most abundant gnathiid species from the previous study. Discrete species distributions between the two sites suggested that the 2 parasites may have had different diets. Host-specificity data for gnathiid isopods are scarce because the parasitic juvenile stages are difficult to identify and host-parasite contact is often brief. Engorged third stage gnathiids were photographed and permitted to moult into adults to allow identification. I compared mtDNA sequences from their blood meals to host sequences available on GenBank. The host frequency distributions used by each species were significantly different; only four host families were shared. I concluded that G. falcipenis and Gnathia sp C operate as preferential feeders. Importantly, this work showed that G. falcipenis was indeed a natural parasite of several species of damselfish (Pomacentridae) that could be collected as young recruits and used in manipulative experiments. I then used G. falcipenis as a model parasite to investigate the effects of isopods on recently recruited Dischistodus perspicillatus and small juvenile Acanthochromis polyacanthus damselfishes. Working with honours student Ms Rose Penfold, we determined that A. polyacanthus was infected by gnathiids in the wild at sizes as small as 4.2 mm SL. Laboratory infections revealed that larger A. polyacanthus were much better at eating gnathiids, a behaviour which prevented infection, and that smaller fish were more likely to die post-infection. Infection prevalence was &gt; 3 % during the day, but we could not sample fish for nocturnal infection prevalence. A caging experiment suggested that most micropredation on damselfish took place at night. For D. perspicillatus, I found that exposure to 2 parasites each evening for 7 nights after settlement halved the growth of these fish. Lastly, numerous free-swimming cymothoid isopods were found associated with larval fish in light traps. Cymothoids have a multi-morphic life cycle composed of micropredatory stages that eventually become females, which are permanently attached to fishes. Because cymothoid taxonomy is based around female morphology, natatory-stage cymothoids can not be identified. I sequenced mtDNA from natatory and adult female life history stages and matched 4 of 11 natatory cymothoid morphotypes. Molecular data were also used to produce a phylogeny exploring the evolution of different forms of host attachment within the Cymothoidae. This phylogeny suggests that external attachment, formerly thought to be plesiomorphic, is a derived condition and has evolved several times independently. I suggest that attachment to the buccal cavity or gills is a primitive form of attachment. This research has provided information on emergence patterns and hostspecificity which is necessary for the future study of isopod vector biology. It also provides a platform for future taxonomic and phylogenetic studies on cymothoids. I demonstrate that gnathiids infect juvenile coral reef fish and suggest that they may influence survival both directly and indirectly by reducing growth and predisposing infected fish to size-selective mortality. Thus, interactions between isopod micropredators and recruiting fishes may determine the survivorship of individual fish and influence the subsequent community structure.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300700 Fisheries Sciences</field><field name="subject">270703 Terrestrial Ecology</field><field name="subject">270304 Infectious Agents</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132177</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vulnerable Machine: Writing a Personal Illness Discourse</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Alyssa</field><field name="description">The Vulnerable Machine is a book-length collection of poems that explores my ideas of the ill identity and the ill body. The title, The Vulnerable Machine, reflects both the personal&#8212;vulnerable&#8212;aspect of illness, and the cultural aspect, where illness is a construction and the body a machine that can be broken, fixed, and changed. The collection attempts to reveal my personal experience of illness, current social constructions of illness, and cultural representations of illness to arrive at a point where a personal voice of illness emerges. Many of the first person&#8212;and therefore more personal&#8212;poems explore my reactions to illness, as both a patient and a writer. With poems such as &#8220;I remember my body,&#8221; &#8220;the results come back,&#8221; and &#8220;writing on codeine,&#8221; I comment on the effects of illness on my sense of self; the effects of illness, hospitalisation, and medication on personal identity and body; and the shifting relationship between the self and the body as it changes from healthy to ill. In other poems such as &#8220;the doctor&#8217;s inheritance&#8221; and &#8220;a brief history of pain,&#8221; I investigate the social aspects of illness by examining the history of illness and medicine and the constantly changing body of medical knowledge and &#8216;truth.&#8217; Such poems were inspired by the research I had done for the critical essay and illustrate a more critical engagement with illness. Different poems such as &#8220;Charles Bukowski,&#8221; &#8220;Virginia Woolf,&#8221; and &#8220;Charlotte Bront&#235;&#8221; come from my position as both a patient but also a writer learning from other writers, and express the cultural representations of illness by considering the works of other writers, the cultural trends in illness writing and the demands placed on the ill by cultural expectations. The illness discussed in the work remains unnamed and undefined in the hope that from a beginning that avoids labels and categories a personal voice of illness is free to emerge. With this in mind, the speaker also remains anonymous. My desire with both the creative and critical works is to focus on the experience of illness as a phenomenon, and not a particular illness. In the critical essay I consider how to write an inclusive discourse for illness. The essay begins with an analysis of the processes of narration and its cultural imperatives to deduce ideas about the control of biomedical rhetoric in personal illness voices. With this idea in mind, The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly, by Jean- Dominique Bauby, is discussed as an example of the heroic quest; the essay argues that it is a contemporary manifestation of Talcott Parsons&#8217; concept of the sick role, which leads into an interrogation of new ways of writing illness. I briefly analyse Eric Michaels&#8217; AIDS diary, Unbecoming, as representative of a resistant narrative. The work of Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray offers suggestions for the restoration of &#65533;&#65533;criture f&#233;minine&#8212;feminine language&#8212;that sheds light on the development of a new discourse for illness. Exploring feminist ideas about destabilising patriarchal language leads to an exploration of the potential of lyric poetry to facilitate such renegotiations of language. This draws on the lyric technique of using personal experience to inform universal ideas, and the use of image and refrain to structure meaning. The discussion of the lyric is followed by an examination of &#8220;The Glass Essay,&#8221; by Anne Carson, in order to develop a method that may offer an alternative to current representations of illness. This is done by suggesting Carson&#8217;s work offers a technique to represent an independent, personal voice in illness. The essay suggests that the lyric poem is an ideal form for expressing a personal, subjective voice that nevertheless discusses larger issues and therefore removes the patient from their isolated social position.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420217 Textual Transmission and the Material Record</field><field name="subject">429999 Other Language and Culture</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132187</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study Of The Mechanism By Which Cobalt Ions Minimize Corrosion Of Lead Alloy Anodes During Electrowinning Of Base Metals</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Thu Kieu Thi</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291302 Physical Metallurgy</field><field name="subject">291301 Process Metallurgy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132196</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Units Of Genetic Transfer In Prokaryotes</field><field name="creator">Chan, Cheong Xin</field><field name="description">The transfer of genetic material and integration of the material into a genome via recombination are important in gene repair, maintenance of genetic variation, and initiation of DNA replication in prokaryotes. Lateral transfer of genetic materials between two species creates mosaic phylogenetic relationships in different regions across genomes, complicating the inference of a single species phylogeny based on gene sequences. To date, most studies of genetic transfer in prokaryotes have been restricted by the implicit assumption that the units of genetic transfer are whole genes. This thesis documents the implementation of a rigorous phylogenetic approach in the first systematic study of the unit of genetic transfer in prokaryotes. Two core aspects of the thesis are reviewed in detail: (a) the modelling of sequence changes in the study of molecular evolution, and (b) the detection of recombination (thus genetic transfer) in molecular sequences. A &#8216;shotgun&#8217; strategy is adopted to obtain optimal sequence alignments for subsequent analysis of genetic transfer, in which multiple alignments resulting from various algorithms were validated using a novel pattern-centric objective function presented in this work. A two-phase strategy is introduced to detect recombination at large scale: simple statistical tests are used to detect phylogenetic discrepancies within a group of sequences, and a rigorous Bayesian phylogenetic approach is then used to locate more precisely the breakpoints at which the recombination occurred. To formulate this strategy, an extensive benchmark study on various recombination-detecting approaches was conducted using simulated sequence data, focusing on the effects of subsequent evolutionary events in obscuring recombination. The alignment and recombination-detection strategies were applied to analyse the units of genetic transfer in (a) single-copy gene families from 144 prokaryote genomes and in (b) single-copy and multicopy gene families from 13 Staphylococcus genomes. In prokaryotes, within-gene (fragmentary) genetic transfer is generally more frequent than whole-gene transfer in singlecopy gene families. In Staphylococcus, however, both within-gene and whole-gene transfer contribute almost evenly. The units of fragmentary genetic transfer are found to correlate with protein structural features. A significant functional bias of whole-gene transfer was observed in single-copy and in multi-copy gene families of Staphylococcus, suggesting that fixation of an exogenous gene is influenced by the presence of similar gene copies in the target genome. This work demonstrates that units of genetic transfer in prokaryotes are not restricted to whole genes, and the extent of genetic transfer in prokaryotes could have been underestimated. The results support the view that both genetic transfer and gene duplication contribute to functional innovation in prokaryote genomes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132182</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of Myosin VI in E-cadherin Adhesive Contact Biogenesis</field><field name="creator">Maddugoda, Madhavi</field><field name="description">The architecture of epithelial monolayers is critically influenced by the adhesion-mediating signalling receptor, E-cadherin. E-cadherin has long been known to be fundamental for maintaining cell-cell cohesion and cell-cell junctional integrity, and this relies on its close association with the actin cytoskeleton. The exact underlying molecular mechanism of Ecadherin-actin cooperation at contacts is, however, poorly understood. Analysing the many effector proteins that mediate the cadherin-actin interaction is the first step toward a clearer understanding of this interaction. The interaction between E-cadherin and actin is complex. This is likely due to the dynamic nature of intercellular contacts. A pertinent example of the dynamic evolution of cell-cell contacts is seen when cell contacts mature in relation to one another over a period of time. Here, initial discontinuous contacts are replaced by continuous linear contacts and cadherin and actin morphologies undergo a concomitant transformation. In this study I have identified a molecular pathway that is necessary for this intercellular contact maturation process. I now report that Myosin VI critically regulates the morphogenesis of epithelial cellcell contacts. When epithelial monolayers mature in culture, Myosin VI is recruited to cell contacts as they become linear and cohesive, where it forms a biochemical complex with Ecadherin. Myosin VI is necessary for strong cadherin adhesion, for cells to form cohesive linear contacts, and for the integrity of the apical junctional complex. Importantly, I found that vinculin mediates this effect of Myosin VI. In the absence of Myosin VI, vinculin is lost from cell-cell contacts and is unable to interact with E-cadherin. Further, vinculin is able to rescue contact integrity even in the absence of Myosin VI, thus identifying vinculin as a downstream effector of Myosin VI necessary for the biogenesis of intercellular contacts. Together this shows that the actin effector proteins, Myosin VI and vinculin, form a molecular apparatus that generates cohesive cell-cell contacts in cultured mammalian epithelia. From a broader perspective, this work emphasises the dynamic nature of cadherinactin interactions at cell-cell contacts and its regulation by the recruitment of specific actin effectors in a time-and context-dependent manner.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270200 Genetics</field><field name="subject">270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132203</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diversity and ecology of Symbiodinium in pocilloporid corals</field><field name="creator">Sampayo, Eugenia M.</field><field name="description">The decline of coral reefs is well documented, yet a detailed understanding of the processes involved in the establishment, persistence, and ecology of the coral-dinoflagellate associations still remains largely unknown. The advent of molecular techniques has resulted in significant advances in understanding the molecular diversity present of symbiotic dinoflagellates from the genus Symbiodinium, but information concerning the functional, ecological, and biogeographical significance of this expanding symbiont diversity remains limited. This thesis therefore used molecular methodologies to uncover Symbiodinium diversity in Stylophora pistillata, Pocillopora damicornis, and Seriatopora hystrix at ecological scales, in response to thermal stress, and to long-term environmental shifts. In addition, all the molecular methods currently used in Symbiodinium research are critically reviewed to provide an important baseline for future studies. The application of ITS2-DGGE coupled with the integration of alternate speciation concepts and analyses showed great merit in assessing Symbiodinium diversity in S. pistillata, P. damicornis, and S. hystrix along a depth gradient (3 m to 18 m) at Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reef (Australia), and emphasizes that sampling regimes should focus on the role of symbionts within their functional habitat. S. pistillata associates with symbionts C78 or C35/a in shallow areas and C79 in the deep, but also harbors a generalist type C8/a that can be found at all depths. P. damicornis harbors C42/a in shallow areas while C33/a is generally found in deeper reef zones, although it is occasionally observed in the shallows. On the other hand, S. hystrix only harbors a single symbiont (C3/t) at all depths. The data from Chapter 2 therefore shows that closely related symbionts within a single clade can diverge rapidly under influence of ecological differentiation whereby each symbiont represents a separately evolving lineage that occupies a specific ecological niche. As such, closely related symbionts are likely to have evolved specializations that optimize performance within their environmental range. Previous studies have sought to explain the bleaching susceptibility of scleractinian corals as a function of the presence or absence of six major clades of Symbiodinium. In chapter 3 it is shown that sub-cladal types of clade C in S. pistillata differ in their response to thermal stress, and these differences are as large as those previously reported between different clades. Molecular (ITS2-DGGE) data is integrated with physiological measurements (PAM fluorometry, host protein, symbiont cell density) to investigate the response to stress (bleaching) and is directly related to fine-scale differences in symbiont-types. This suggests that the cladal distinction of Symbiodinium is insufficient to explain the highly variable responses commonly seen in reef-building corals. Furthermore, the results highlight that shifts in symbiont community within a host population are due to differential mortality rather than the uptake of novel symbionts. It therefore appears that changes in the thermal tolerance of corals by acquiring novel more resistant Symbiodinium to meet the challenges of global warming may be restricted, and as such cannot be expected to prevent large-scale reef degradation. Whilst most Symbiodinium cladal studies have focused on bleaching, Chapter 4 combines molecular (ITS2-DGGE) and physiological analyses (PAM fluorometry) to assess the flexibility of the coral&#8211;symbiont assemblages in S. pistillata, P. damicornis, and S. hystrix when faced with long-term shifts in key environmental conditions. To test this, a 32 month reciprocal transplant experiment was set-up on Heron Island, whereby corals were transplanted to a new light environment, i.e. shallow to deep, or deep to shallow. Although some host-symbiont combinations were able to shuffle sub-cladal symbiont types, almost all colonies reverted back to their original type within 7 to 12 months. Interestingly, transplanted colonies showed a broad acclimatory response by adjusting their physiological responses to those of the control colonies at the transplanted depth. However, those that persisted with sub-optimal symbiont types suffered disproportionate rates of mortality at the onset of additional stress (bleaching). This suggests that, despite their large acclimatory capacity, the holobiont was likely living at the limits of its tolerance range. As such, it appears that coral species cannot readily form a novel symbiotic unit by changing their symbiotic partner in response to prolonged periods of change, and it is therefore unlikely that they will be able to adjust their symbionts in an attempt to cope with changing global conditions. Finally, Chapter 5 reviews the different DNA markers (18S, 28S, ITS1, ITS2, cp23S) and screening methods (RFLP, LICOR, SSCP, DGGE, cloning-sequencing) currently applied to uncovering Symbiodinium diversity. Current rDNA markers are used to identify ancient or more recent evolutionary lineages and separate symbionts into broad groups such as clades, as well as uncovering fine-scale differences between ecologically different sub-cladal types. The 18S and 28S rDNA in combination with RFLP are appropriate for studies that focus on large groupings at the cladal level and may uncover broad biogeographical. However, studies on the ecology or physiology of host-symbiont associations clearly benefit from the capacity to detect the full level of variability present within a community (e.g. 28S-SSCP, ITS2-DGGE). Despite the suitability of the rDNA, it is an imperative that sequence information is combined with ecological data in order to accurately predict how each hostsymbiont combinations responds as a unit that is optimized to function within the range of its distribution. Symbiont types present in individual hosts are shown to be distinct cohesive groups that are not interchangeable on an ecological, functional and evolutionary scale. In summary, this thesis expands on the current knowledge of the role of Symbiodinium on coral reefs and introduces a number of novel concepts. It is imperative that effort and resources continue to be channelled to combine genetic and ecological studies on Symbiodinium, as they appear to be an important factor driving responses of their host. Although diversity assessments would benefit from the development of a single-copy molecular marker, it is important to continue utilizing current methodologies to increase our knowledge of coral-symbiont diversity if we are to understand and manage coral reefs in the short-term as environmental conditions continue to change.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270401 Plant Systematics, Taxonomy and Phylogeny</field><field name="subject">270702 Marine and Estuarine Ecology (incl.

M.</field><field name="description">Yellow head virus (YHV) is highly pathogenic and was identified as the cause of mass mortalities associated with yellow head disease (YHD) that first appeared in Penaeus monodon farmed in Thailand in 1990. By 1992-1993, YHD was widespread throughout the Thai shrimp farming industry, causing losses estimated at ~US$70 million per annum. By the mid 1990s, gross signs consistent with YHD were also being reported in P. monodon farmed in many regions of the Indo-Pacific. Due to its high pathogenicity and economic impact, YHV has been listed as a notifiable pathogen by the OIE and the control of YHD remains a significant concern. At the outset of this study, two genotypic variants of YHV (genotype 1) had been detected in P. monodon in Australia (gill-associated virus, GAV, genotype 2) and Vietnam (genotype 3), suggesting that more variants might exist in other regions. The aim of this study was, therefore, to test the hypothesis that genotypic variants existed in P. monodon from other locations, and if so, to determine their genetic relationships to the three known genotypes. The study also aimed to improve existing PCR diagnostic protocols to accommodate the detection of all genotypes in the YHV complex. Fifty-seven field isolates of YH-complex viruses were detected by RT-PCR in tissues of P. monodon sampled from nine Indo-Pacific countries. Phylogenetic relationships determined for these isolates using a 671 nucleotide (nt) C-terminal region of the ORF1b gene identified 46 isolates that clustered with the three know genotypes and 11 isolates that clustered in at least three distinct new genotypes. All isolates other than genotype 1 (YHV) were detected in tissues of healthy shrimp. Genotype 4 isolates were detected only in shrimp from India and were slightly less distantly related at the nucleotide level to genotype 5 (85.2% identify) than the other genotypes (80.3%-82.3%). Genotype 6 isolates were only detected in shrimp from Mozambique and were least divergent (3.5%) from genotype 2. One each of three genotype 5 isolates was detected in shrimp from Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. The genotype 5 isolate from the Philippines was, however, 6.7% and 7% divergent from the other two isolates, respectively. This level of divergence was greater than found between genotypes 2 and 6 and was similar to that found between isolates of genotype 2 and genotype 3 (~6.7%). This suggests that the Philippine genotype 5 isolate might ultimately be considered as the founding member of a seventh genotype. Genotype 5 isolates were slightly more closely related to genotype 4 (~85.2% identity) than the other genotypes (83.4%-84.8% identity). Genotype 1 (YHV) isolates were only detected in Thai shrimp affected by YHD. Genotype 2 isolates were detected in Australian shrimp as well as shrimp from Vietnam and Thailand. Genotype 3 had the broadest geographic range, being detected in four countries in Southeast Asia. The finding of single genotypes in Australia (genotype 2), India (genotype 4) and Mozambique (genotype 6) supports the hypothesis that they have evolved independently in geographically-isolated populations of P. monodon. The detection of multiple genotypes in Vietnam (genotypes 2 and 3), Malaysia (genotypes 2, 3 and 5) and Thailand (genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 5) suggests that these genotypes have been disseminated by movements of infected P. monodon and the trade in live broodstock used for aquaculture. A ~1.3 kb amplicon at the 5&#8217;-terminal region of the ORF3 gene was sequenced for 28 field isolates to examine phylogenetic relationships to assess whether there is evidence of recombination between genotypes. The region, corresponding to N-terminus of gp116 envelope glycoprotein, displayed more sequence variation than the ORF1b amplicon. All isolates of the virulent genotype 1 (YHV) possessed a unique sequence (TILAGIPEKE/D) at the N terminus of gp116 adjacent to the site of endo-proteolysis that cleaves gp116 from the ORF3 polyprotein. In some genotype 1 isolates this unique sequence was followed by a 54 aa deletion that was also not present in other genotypes. The potential role of this unique sequence as a virulence determinant for YHV requires further investigation. Phylogenetic relationships deduced using the ORF3 amplicon sequences were similar to those deduced using the ORF1b amplicon sequence except that genotype 4 was more closely related to genotype 2 than was genotype 3. However, only 18 of the 28 isolates included in the analysis of both ORF1b and ORF3 amplicons clustered in consistent lineages and were assigned as the same genotypes. Inconsistent phylogenies were observed for ten isolates of which six clustered as genotype 3 in ORF1b and as genotype 2 in ORF3, two isolates clustered as genotype 3 in ORF1b and as genotype 5 in ORF3, one isolate clustered as genotype 5 in ORF1b and as genotype 2 in ORF3, and one isolate clustered as genotype 5 in ORF1b and as genotype 3 in ORF3. Discrepancies in genotype assignments were only observed to involve permutations of genotypes 2, 3 and 5 and involved isolates from healthy shrimp originating from Southeast Asia. Sequence analysis of the ~3.2 kb region spanned by the ORF1b and ORF3 amplicons of three putative recombinant viruses VNM-02-H258 (genotype 3/5), IDN-04-H10 (genotype 3/2) and PHL-03-H8 (genotype 5/3) indicated that recombination had occurred at a position just upstream of the ORF1b gene 3&#8217;-terminus. These data provide the first evidence of genetic recombination for any shrimp virus. The high prevalence of recombinants amongst isolates from Southeast Asia has significant implications for diversification, disease emergence and assignment of genotypes for YH-complex viruses. The region of the genome from the poly[A] tail to the 3&#8217;-end of the ORF1b gene (containing all structural protein genes) was sequenced for representative isolates of genotypes 3 and 4. The analysis was conducted to determine whether the evolutionary divergence in the structural protein genes differed significantly from the replicase (ORF1b) gene and to identify conserved motifs likely to be important for protein function and the regulation of RNA transcription and replication. The sequence of the near 3&#8217;-terminal genome region of a genotype 5 isolate was also determined to examine whether it possessed an ORF4 gene like genotype 2 or whether it was truncated as in genotypes 1, 3 and 4. Comparisons of the intergenic regions (IGR) upstream of ORF2 and ORF3 identified a conserved sequence 5&#8217;-GUCAAUUACACxxAxxUU-3&#8217; surrounding the central adenosine residue corresponding to the 5&#8217;-terminus of the sub-genomic (sg)mRNAs that is likely to represent the consensus motif used as a transcription regulatory sequence (TRS). A sequence upstream of ORF4 possessed limited homology to the predicted consensus TRS but A&gt;G/U substitutions (genotypes 2, 3, 4 and 5) or a point deletion (genotype 1) occurred at the central critical adenosine residue. It is possible that these mutations explain why a sgmRNA is not transcribed in abundance to allow translation of an ORF4 protein, and why the apparently redundant ORF4 gene has accumulated nucleotide deletions or insertions interrupting its reading in all genotypes except genotype 2. The 3&#8217;-terminal genome sequence of genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 downstream of the putative ORF4 gene region was extremely highly conserved and was predicted to form a stable hairpin-loop RNA secondary structure with four bulges. Where nucleotide variations occurred in a genotype, other compensatory changes maintained base-pairing and stability of the structure, suggesting that this region is likely to be important for polymerase recognition of the (+) genomic RNA for transcription of (-) genomic RNA. Conventional and real-time PCR tests for the detection of all genotypes in the YH complex were developed by identifying highly conserved sequences amongst the 57 virus isolates at which primers could be targeted. In the consensus RT-nested PCR, PCR (358 bp) and nested PCR (147 bp) amplicon lengths were kept short to accommodate degraded RNA and pools of two primers were used rather than a single degenerate primer to accommodate all genotypes whist minimizing levels of degeneracy. The consensus real-time PCR used SYBR-Green chemistry and amplified a 147 bp product using single degenerate primers targeted to the same sites as the nested PCR primer pools. Each PCR method detected the RNA of representatives of all six genotypes. The RT-nested PCR was extremely sensitive, detecting down to a single copy of a GAV synthetic RNA. Phylogenetic analysis using the 95 nt sequence bounded by the nested PCR primers generated genotype associations similar to those generated using the 671 nt sequence, allowing the assignment of genotypes from the amplified products. The consensus RT-nested PCR test has been included in the 5th Edition of the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animals (2006). The consensus real-time PCR was slightly less sensitive than the RT-nested PCR, detecting down to ~125 copies of the GAV synthetic RNA. However, the test generated products with the expected Tm (77.5&#186;C) with isolates of the six genotypes and showed a linear relationship between input RNA and Ct value up to 109 RNA copies. Thus, due to its ability to accurately quantify and compare viral RNA loads in clinical samples, the test could be used to define the infection status of shrimp in relation to threshold levels associated with disease.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yellow head virus</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">prawn farms</field><field name="subject">shrimp farming</field><field name="subject">Penaeus monodon</field><field name="subject">pathogens</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132213</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical Activity, Sedentary Time and Blood Glucose in Australian Adults</field><field name="creator">Healy, Genevieve</field><field name="description">Background: Chronically elevated blood glucose concentrations are both a characteristic and a precursor of type 2 diabetes. Elevated blood glucose has also been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and premature mortality. This risk is progressive, and extends both below and above established cut-points of risk. Physical activity and sedentary (sitting) time are modifiable behaviours that are independently associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality. However, there is limited information on the associations of physical activity and sedentary time with continuous measures of fasting plasma glucose and 2-hr postload plasma glucose. Aim: Using both self-report and objective measures, the set of studies reported in this Thesis examined the independent and joint associations of physical activity and sedentary time with continuous blood glucose measures in a cross-sectional sample of Australian adults without known diabetes. Methods: The population-based Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study was initially conducted in 1999-2000, and repeated in 2004-2005. The associations of self-reported moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity and sedentary (television viewing) time utilise the 1999- 2000 AusDiab data (n=9,214). Additionally, an accelerometer was used to objectively measure physical activity and sedentary time in a sub-sample (n=204) of 2004-2005 AusDiab participants. Fasting plasma glucose and 2-hr plasma glucose were measured by an oral glucose tolerance test at both time points. Results: Across the four studies reported, increased time spent in moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity was significantly associated with lower 2-hr plasma glucose; increased sedentary time was significantly associated with higher 2-hr plasma glucose. These findings were observed for both the self-report and the objective data, and were independent of each other. No significant associations were observed with fasting plasma glucose for either the self-report or the objective-measures. Even in those who met the National Physical Activity Guidelines (30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity on most days of the week), increased television viewing time was associated with significantly elevated 2-hr plasma glucose. Importantly, the objective data showed that lightintensity activity, independent of moderate-to-vigorous intensity time, was significantly beneficially associated with 2-hr plasma glucose. Additionally, the objective data provided preliminary evidence that regularly breaking up sedentary time, independent of total sedentary time, was beneficially associated with 2-hr plasma glucose. Conclusions: These set of findings highlight the importance, particularly for 2-hr plasma glucose, of increasing time spent in physical activity and decreasing time spent in sedentary behaviours. The findings also suggest that substituting light-intensity activities for television time, or other sedentary behaviours, may be a practical and achievable preventive strategy to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Prospective data analyses, as well as experimental studies are required to investigate the possible causal nature of these observations and the mechanisms that may underlie them.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132230</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimation of Analog Layout Parasitics with Parameterized Polygons</field><field name="creator">Tseng, I-Lun</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290902 Integrated Circuits</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132232</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic Analysis Of The Australian Nursing Home Industry</field><field name="creator">Gargett, Susan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132233</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of Change in Cognitive-Behavioural Group Therapy: The Role of Cognitive Change and Group Processes</field><field name="creator">Dwyer, Lynndall</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132234</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the mechanism involved in regulating ultraviolet radiation induced p16 expression</field><field name="creator">Giles, Nichole</field><field name="description">Exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and the familial melanoma susceptibility gene p16INK4A are among the major risk factors which have been identified to contribute to the development of melanoma. UVR can act as a mitogen to stimulate cell proliferation and as a genotoxin by causing DNA damage in skin. UVR is also known to activate the MAP kinase signaling pathways, including the c-JNK kinase, p38 MAP kinase and ERK signaling pathways. These MAP kinase pathways have been reported to regulate a number of downstream effectors involved in controlling transcription, translation, transcript stability, and protein activity and stability. These in turn determine the UVR induced cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis. The gene locus p16INK4A encodes the protein p16 which functions as a negative regulator of cell cycle progression and as a tumor suppressor is found deleted or mutated in 10-30% of primary melanomas and &gt; 80% of melanoma cell lines. Previous work has shown that a suberythemal dose of UVR induces the expression of p16 in both the A2058 melanoma cell line and human skin. The regulatory mechanism controlling the expression of p16 in response to UVR is currently unclear. This study aims to define the mechanism involved in UVR induced p16 expression. A cell line model was established using serum starved quiescent A2058 cells to mimic the quiescent cells at the basal layer of the epidermis. The physiological relevance of this in vitro model was then verified in vivo in the human skin model. Data from this study has shown that UVR induced ERK signaling regulates p16 expression at both the transcriptional and translational level. Transcriptional control of p16 expression was observed in irradiated quiescent A2058 cells, where an increase in p16 mRNA corresponded to the increase in p16 protein. This observation was validated in human skin. Two transcription factors known to regulate expression of p16INK4A, MiTF and JunB, are potential downstream targets of UVR induced ERK signaling. Data also suggested the possible involvement of other components contributing to the UVR induced p16 expression observed in through ERK signaling, as MiTF is only expressed by the melanocytes, and the staining pattern of JunB did not correlate with the patchy p16 protein staining observed in human skin. Evidence indicating translational control of p16 expression was noted in the irradiated non serum starved A2058 cells, where an increase in p16 protein was detected despite the lack of elevated p16 mRNA. Additional evidence for translational contol was observed in irradiated human skin, where the uniform p16 mRNA expression in the skin did not correspond to the patchy p16 protein staining. Data from this study suggests a biological connection between melanoma risk factors, UVR and p16 with other melanoma genes, BRAF, MC1R and MiTF. BRAF plays a vital role in the ERK signaling pathway. ERK can regulate MiTF activity and stability, and BMSH (a ligand for MC1R receptor) has been shown to potentiate the increase of p16 expression irradiated skin, indicating p16 expression could be regulated via MC1R signaling. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the suberythemal UVR induced p16 expression is regulated by the ERK signaling pathway at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Further work is required to provide a better understanding of the mechanism by which UVR activated ERK regulates p16 expression.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321015 Oncology and Carcinogenesis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132284</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Death and destruction: A novel - Accompanying thesis: Parable Prophecy and Atropaic Magic</field><field name="creator">Gough, Sue</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420000 Language and Culture</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132286</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Method For The Design Of Longwall Gateroad Roof Support</field><field name="creator">Lawrence, William John Charles</field><field name="description">The design of longwall gateroad roof support for roadway development and panel extraction has typically relied on past panel experience. If strata conditions and depth of cover are reasonably uniform, this approach has merit. However, as geological or geotechnical conditions vary the need for a more rigorous design is required to provide safe working conditions and the calculations and justification for compliance and statutory purposes. Current roadway roof support design approaches have limitations, which have restricted their applicability. Analytical methods are available and are certainly applicable for more massive sedimentary rock-masses, but may not be appropriate when rock-mass yield occurs due to high mininginduced stresses. The application of complex post-yield numerical modelling in a periodic and routine design process for excavation support is currently a contentious issue, which requires better justification and industry understanding of its limitations. Complex post-yield numerical modelling is challenging, time-consuming and expensive, and typically outside the capability and resources of mine site geotechnical engineers. It does, however, have its place and will continue to make important contributions. A design method has been developed incorporating the major geometrical, geological and geotechnical parameters required to specify roof support. It is a hybrid numerical and empirical method called Gateroad Roof Support Model (GRSM), where specification of roof support comes from charts or equations. Empirical design techniques are currently used in Bowen Basin mines and should be used to provide a complementary design. They do not explicitly consider all the parameters and mining situations that GRSM does. In some aspects, GRSM may be considered as a progression of these current empirical methods. GRSM defines suggested roof support densities by linking a rock-mass classification with an index of mining-induced stress, using a large empirical database of Bowen Basin mining experience. Inherent in the development of GRSM is a rock-mass classification scheme applicable to coal measure strata. From numerous schemes assessed, two were considered appropriate. Coal Mine Roof Rating (CMRR) is an established and robust coal industry standard, and Geological Strength Index (GSI), as it provides rock-mass geomechanical properties. GSI would only be required if additional numerical modelling was conducted. An approximate correlation between GSI global rock-mass strength and CMRR has been presented. An elastic three-dimensional numerical model has been established to calculate an index of mining induced stress, for both roadway development and longwall retreat. The model anticipates height of strata caving and fracturing and the process of goaf reconsolidation. To effectively use GRSM it is important to be able to quickly and accurately calculate a stress index, without having to resort to a numerical model. Equations to calculate stress index have been developed for two situations; roadway development and longwall retreat. Installed roof support must be characterised and quantified, both to establish the empirical database and to specify suggested support densities and patterns for a design. An industry standard method of quantifying roof support was adopted as a base template (GRSUP). General design charts, utilising all data points and long-tendon support were also constructed for roadway development and longwall retreat. The logistic regression analyses considered three independent variables; roof classification, stress index, and various modifications to GRSUP. The logistic regression analyses indicate that an improved quantification of installed support can be gained by simple modifications to the standard formulation of GRSUP. Initial stable-failure boundaries were determined mathematically using an optimal statistical solution from the logistic regression. The position of the stable/failed boundary can be changed depending on design criteria and specified risk. Considering the probability of a stable outcome more appropriate and conservative stable/failure boundary can be defined. This initial version of GRSM provides suitable estimates of required roof support for both roadway development and longwall retreat in the maingate belt-road. It appears to be suitable for a range of immediate roof conditions, including coal. The design method is uncomplicated to apply when using the supplied equations, and can be readily set-up in spreadsheet form. Calculated GRSUP is only a first-pass assessment, and this is all it was ever intended to be. Design optimisation always needs to occur, based on local conditions and experience.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290804 Construction Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132289</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal Experience in Physical Activity: Examining the Multidimensionality of Flow Across Cultures</field><field name="creator">Kawabata, Masato</field><field name="description">Applying the lens of experience, a good life is deemed to be characterized by full absorption in what one does (Nakamura &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2002). In addition, experiencing flow is linked with personal growth (Seligman &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). Therefore, it is not surprising that understanding the optimal experience of flow is considered important. Nonetheless, it is never easy to clearly explain this complex but positive subjective experience. Thus, the present investigation was conducted to provide a clearer conceptualization of flow based on theoretical and empirical grounds to foster understanding of this optimal experience. In order to pursue this primary purpose, the following 3 studies were conducted. The purpose of Study 1 was to develop multidimensional measurement instruments for use with Japanese adults to assess flow experience in physical activity. To this end, the Flow State Scale-2 and Dispositional Flow Scale-2 (FSS-2 and DFS-2) were adapted (translated) from English to Japanese, following the guidelines for test adaptation proposed by Duda and Hayashi (1998) and Tanzer and Sim (1999). Employing a 9-factor 1st-order model, the factorial validity of the Japanese versions of the FSS-2 and DFS-2 (JFSS-2 and JDFS-2) was tested and cross-validated with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Through a multi-staged approach, a series of CFAs were conducted on data from large Japanese samples (preliminary samples: n = 578; calibration samples: n = 975; validation samples: n = 970). In addition to internal consistency reliability for both scales, stability was assessed over a 4- week time period for the JDFS-2. Furthermore, measurement equivalence was examined across Japanese independent samples as well as 2 cultural samples. The findings from this study provided strong support for the validity and reliability of the JFSS-2 and JDFS-2 in assessing flow experiences in physical activity for Japanese adults, and indicated that the Japanese versions of the flow scales are useful instruments for cross-cultural research. The purpose of Study 2 was to examine the internal structure of flow as part of an ongoing process of construct validation of flow responses. A total of 4,175 respondents (Japanese: n = 2,041; English-speaking: n = 2,134) completed one of the Japanese and English versions of the FSS-2 or DFS-2. For the Japanese respondents, data from calibration and validation samples in Study 1 were used. Alternative representations of flow responses were cross-culturally examined by testing 11 alternative 1st- and higher-order CFA models. The CFA findings cross-culturally supported and extended Marsh and Jackson&#8217;s (1999) argument that the situational and dispositional flow responses were best represented by the multidimensional 1st-order representation rather than the higher-order representation. Confirming clear support for the 1st-order representation of flow, structural equation models (i.e., a priori and post hoc models) were tested to examine the hypothesis that flow experience is an attentional process of absorption in the task at hand, which generates intrinsically rewarding feelings. Results of both models clearly supported the hypothesis across the 2 large cultural samples. The purposes of Study 3 were to examine the utility of multi-group comparisons with the JFSS-2 and JDFS-2 and to further examine the construct validity of the Japanese flow responses. Data used in Study 3 were identical to the Japanese samples in Study 2 (N = 2,041). Factorial invariance in a 9-factor measurement model was tested for both flow scales for 5 key variables: the quality of physical activity experience, participation level, types of physical activity, gender, and age. Given an adequate level of measurement invariance, factor means were compared across groups for each variable. Furthermore, correlations between a continuous measure of the complexity of flow and the JFSS-2 factors were examined. Invariance of factor loadings and intercepts was achieved for all the key variables. Through factor mean comparisons for the quality of physical activity experience and participation level, the flow group consistently showed higher scores on most situational factors compared with the other groups (i.e., non-flow conditions), and the competitive groups had higher scores on most factors than the recreational groups for both the JFSS-2 and JDFS-2. Moreover, the continuous flow measure was most highly correlated with the situational Challenge-Skill Balance factor, and the pattern of the size of correlations between this continuous flow measure and other situational factors were similar to those between the Challenge-Skill Balance and other JFSS-2 factors. The findings from this study provided evidence that meaningful multi-group comparisons can be made for the key variables examined with the Japanese flow scales, and also further support for the construct validity of the Japanese flow responses. In conclusion, the general conceptualization of flow as an attentional process of absorption in the task at hand, which generates intrinsically rewarding feelings, fosters further understanding of flow experience in physical activity. Furthermore, systematic cross-cultural studies with different adapted versions of the flow scales aid understanding of cultural similarities and differences in flow experience and contribute to further development of flow theory and its application.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321499 Human Movement and Sports Science not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">380101 Sensory Processes, Perception and Performance</field><field name="subject">380104 Personality, Abilities and Assessment</field><field name="subject">flow</field><field name="subject">peak experience</field><field name="subject">optimal experience</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132290</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cryptogonimidae Ward, 1917 (Platyhelminthes: Digenea), With Emphasis On Taxa Infecting Indo-West Pacific Lutjanidae And Haemulidae (Perciformes)</field><field name="creator">Miller, Terrence</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132291</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australians at the Kod&#225;ly Institute: Reflections on the journey</field><field name="creator">King, Aleta</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to reflect upon the experiences of Australian music educators who are past students of the Kod&#225;ly Institute, Hungary. Through comparison and contrast of the author&#8217;s autobiographical experience with that of other Australians this thesis reflects upon the nature of these unique journeys. This qualitative study seeks to examine the three stages (before, during and after) of the journey through analysis of selected participant&#8217;s responses to a questionnaire. Selected participants were asked to reflect upon their own experience in relation to the reasons why they were drawn to Hungary, the nature of their experience whilst a student at the Kod&#225;ly Institute and how this unique experience may have affected them upon their return to Australia. The idea that both the author and participants&#8217; journey could in fact be considered a musical pilgrimage has emerged through the course of this study. Seen in this context, the before, during and after stages of the journey can in fact be considered preliminal, liminal and postliminal stages of a pilgrimage according to anthropologist van Gennep in his well known treatise The Rights of Passage. In relation to the discussion of pilgrimage, reflections upon the various contexts the well-known Hungarian folk song Esti Dal can be found illustrates the symbolic nature of Esti Dal&#8217;s function as a token of dispensation for this author&#8217;s pilgrimage. This notion of pilgrimage is discussed in connection to implications from the research findings as follows: The idea of going back to the &#8216;source&#8217; which functions as a sacred musical centre, the token of dispensation, the transformed identity of one who has completed the journey, the uniqueness of each journey and the role of personal relationships in securing tokens of dispensation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132293</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diversity, Biology and Utilization of Chondrichthyans in West Central Indonesian Fisheries</field><field name="creator">Fahmi</field><field name="description">A study was undertaken at twelve fish landing sites in Java and Kalimantan Islands, west central Indonesia, from June 2005 to October 2006 to overcome the lack of knowledge on chondrichthyan species in Indonesia. Data were collected for seven consecutive days at each site from fish landings, including species diversity, fisheries, utilizations, and biological data of chondrichthyan species. A total of 23,454 individuals of chondrichthyans, 104 species and 28 families were recorded from 12 landing sites during the study, with an estimated total biomass of more than 70,000 kg. This total consisted of 65 species of shark representing 16 families and 58 species of rays representing 11 families and a single species of holocephalan. Dasyatidae and Carcharhinidae were the most common families recorded. Dasyatis kuhlii (Dasyatidae) was the most abundant chondrichthyan species in this study, while Himantura gerrardi contributed most to the total biomass. Ordination of abundance values showed a segregation between the sites that had fishing grounds in shallow waters (the Java Sea, Karimata Strait) and sites that fished the deeper waters (the Indian Ocean, Makassar and a part of Sunda Strait). The shallower areas were typified by some common dasyatids and inshore sharks, and the deeper areas by large, oceanic and deep water chondrichthyans. The present study also identified which types of fishing gear contributed most to the total biomass and size of elasmobranch landings. A total of fifteen types of fishing gear are used from fishing vessels operating in the Java Sea and adjacent area (including Karimata Strait, Sunda Strait, Makassar Strait) and off south Java (the Indian Ocean) to catch chondrichthyan fishes, either as bycatch or as target of fishing. Set gillnet was the most common gear that caught chondrichthyan fishes, but Danish seine nets contributed most to both the total number and total biomass of chondrichthyan fishes captured in the observed area during the study. The Danish seine net (cantrang) was the least selective gear that caught elasmobranchs in Java and Kalimantan during the study, following by bottom lampara nets and set gillnets that were operated in inshore waters. Danish seine nets were also considered to contribute most to overall fishing pressure in the Java Sea. H. gerrardi contributed most to the total biomass of batoids captured in the Danish seine fishery from Batang landing site which is the largest contributor to the total catch of elasmobranchs in west central Indonesia. H. gerrardi is categorized as the &#8220;first class&#8221; and one of the most sought after rays in the skin industry at Batang due to the quality of its skin. Most elasmobranch products are utilized and marketed locally and some others are sold to large cities or other countries due to their high values, such as fins, gill rakers, skins and cartilage. The present study of chondrichthyan diversity in west central Indonesia also provides detailed data on the size composition and reproductive biology of some common elasmobranchs in the region. Size composition of each species varies among regions and fishing areas. Species that were caught in large numbers from heavily fished areas matured earlier than those from the lower fishing pressure areas. Precocious maturity of some dominant species may also indicate the high level of fishing pressure in the area where they are occurred. Diets of some common dasyatids caught from the Danish seine fishery operating in the Java Sea were also investigated to find out the contribution of stomach fullness to the size and weight relationships variation. More than 90% of the diet of H. gerrardi was crustaceans, represented by carid shrimps, mantis shrimps and penaeids. Conversely, teleosts made significant contributions to the diet of H. jenkinsii and large size classes of H. uarnak and H. undulata.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132730</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Background Oriented Schlieren Technique for Flow Visualisation in Shock Tunnels</field><field name="creator">Ramanah, Dwishen</field><field name="description">The Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS) technique is a method that has been developed recently for easily and inexpensively visualizing density gradient variations in compressible flows. In this thesis, the applications of this technique in the Drummond tunnel and the T4 free-piston reflected shock tunnel are presented. The BOS technique was first tested in the Drummond tunnel then used during four test campaigns to qualitatively visualize the flow over scramjet models and components of scramjets in the T4 shock tunnel. The results demonstrate that a simple optical arrangement, that does not need high quality windows in the test section and model, can be used to detect the locations of shock waves, expansion fans and shear layers. At present, the resolution and quality of the images is not as high as can be achieved using conventional Schlieren techniques.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="subject">240599 Classical Physics not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132731</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantum coherence in degenerate Bose gases</field><field name="creator">Vaughan, Timothy</field><field name="description">The central theme of this thesis is that of coherence in bosonic matter-wave fields. Analogous to optical coherence; the measure of the capacity of a photonic beam to produce fringes upon interference; matter-wave coherence is in many ways the defining characteristic of the BEC phase of identical massive bosons. Its study therefore plays a critical role in the quest to better understand the physics of ultra-cold quantum gases, which has been the goal of this research. This work approaches coherence from a number of different angles and is for this reason presented in two parts. The first of these delves into the physics of perfectly coherent matterwave fields which are adequately described by &#8216;mean field&#8217; equations, while the second is devoted to origins and repercussions of the diminished coherence evident in actual atom laser experiments. The presentation of the original work of this project begins with a detailed study of the interaction between an atomic and a molecular condensate, coherently coupled at zero temperature via one of several possible mechanisms (a Feshbach resonance, for example) in three spatial dimensions. Despite the presence of repulsive scattering interaction between the atoms, the mean-field equations of motion are known to support bright solitary waves &#8212; time-independent solutions which remain localised even in the absence of a trapping potential. (These solutions are the matter-wave analogue of spatio-temporal solitons in quadratic nonlinear media, but can also represent stationary states of the Schr&#168;odinger-Newton equations describing bosons interacting via a gravitational field.) Ignoring all interactions save the repulsive inter-atomic scattering mentioned, a variational ansatz approach is employed to analytically approximate these stationary solutions using Gaussian density distributions of the atomic and molecular clouds. By evolving these approximate solutions numerically, a comprehensive map of the accessible parameter space is constructed, showing primarily stable localised propagation. Parameter space regions where the approximate Gaussian solutions display strong &#8216;breathing&#8217; oscillations are identified, and a modified ansatz having exponentially decaying tails is found to dramatically reduce the amplitude of these oscillations. Finally, by seeding a numerical relaxation algorithm with our Gaussian solutions, we find that the only parameter space region in which the approximate solutions diffuse under propagation is also devoid of exact localised stationary solutions. The discussion then proceeds beyond the scope of mean field theory, and turns to a detailed treatment of the quantum mechanical observable corresponding to the centre of mass of systems of identical particles. Firstly, careful consideration is given to its operational definition in the presence of fluctuating particle numbers. Possible pitfalls due to naive approximations when the number fluctuations are large are also addressed. Attention is then given to the fundamental quantum noise associated with this variable, which provides a physical mechanism for diminished first order coherence in degenerate Bose gases, even at zero temperature. Characteristic lower bounds (standard quantum limits) to the resulting mean position uncertainty are identified both for systems of identical bosons and identical fermions with comparable density profiles. Interestingly, fermions are found to have an intrinsically lower mean-position uncertainty than bosons, a fact which is attributed to the action of Pauli repulsion between atoms confined to a fixed density distribution. The results of numerical simulations of the exact quantum evolution of mean position variance are then presented. These demonstrate firstly the quantum diffusion of the mean position of one dimensional matter-wave solitons and secondly the evolution of variance in the centre of mass of a Bose gas undergoing forced evaporative cooling. Finally, attention is paid to the fact that the Penrose-Onsager criterion, which essentially equates Bose condensation with perfect first-order matter-wave coherence, fails to correctly detect the presence of BEC when a priori knowledge of the exact condensate mode is imperfect or unavailable. Insight is gained by drawing analogies between this criterion and entropic measures of entanglement between particular system subspaces. This motivates employment of the concept of entanglement of formation as a means to providing a more accurate measure of condensation in the general case of mixed system states. Unfortunately, this new measure remains adversely sensitive to superpositions of condensate modes. For this reason, alternative criteria based on higher order particle number correlation functions are also proposed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240400 Optical Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132735</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Media And Political Change In Southeast Asia: Karaoke Culture And The Evolution Of Personality Politics</field><field name="creator">Woodier, Jonathan</field><field name="description">As media and entertainment products flood across porous national borders around Southeast Asia, wary local elites have been able to sustain their legitimacy, despite rumblings to the contrary. Global industry trends like conglomeration, commodification and celebrification, mean few real challenges to the existing political and economic status quo. Whilst modernization theory assumes that the globalizing communication media would spread liberal, open societies, as this thesis will show, this is not the case in Southeast Asia. Despite the fact that the Asian Financial Crisis undermined the developmental state championed by many of the Region&#8217;s illiberal governments, it did not give rise to a liberal alternative, but to something more hybrid and complex which this thesis will reveal. The development of the communication media has had important implications for the nature of politics and political process in the region. However, rather than inspiring democratic ideals in an informed and educated public, it is commercial concerns which have come to dominate its agenda since the Asian Financial Crisis. This results in a churn of generic, even pasteurized media offerings, as media owners seek to woo concerned governments, and further their own business interests. The local media is not immune to these general trends, and tends to be locked in its own battle of competing interests, only very occasionally reflecting the political aspirations of its audience and their somewhat muted call for political change, rarely laying the seed. As a result, although there are interesting local responses to the growth of the media and entertainment industry and the changes being wrought by the Internet and other new technologies, the mass media has developed an ambiguous relationship with the political process. More significantly, local elites have proved resilient in the face of the challenge of the globalized media and, acting against the background of the &#8220;war on terror&#8221;, have been able to accelerate illiberal media options, maintaining their control strategies albeit, at times, around newly formed coalitions of support. In fact, this thesis demonstrates that the traditional elites have regrouped since the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, and are restoring their control over the media, where possible by ownership or legal means or, alternatively, where that has proved difficult, they have increasingly taken the sophisticated approach of using the techniques espoused by the perception industries and by public relations consultants to ensure they communicate effectively in an increasingly complex media environment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">400104 Communication and Media Studies</field><field name="subject">430102 History - Asian</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">mass media</field><field name="subject">entertainment industry</field><field name="subject">government control</field><field name="subject">globalised media</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132740</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pharmacological Modulation Of New Word Learning In Young Healthy Adults And Naming Therapy In Aphasia</field><field name="creator">Whiting, Emma</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132746</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exile and Derangement: Representations of Feminine Madness in Australian Women's Writing</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Majella J.</field><field name="description">My thesis is concerned with representations of madness and femininity in Australian writing, investigating gendered constructions of derangement and excess as they pertain to the confinement or exile of female protagonists in literary works by women. This thesis will, in its exploration of feminine subjectivity and socially mediated meanings of mental illness and female sexuality, as well as in its consideration of Aboriginality, establish new ways of reading madness in terms of gender, Indigeneity, and ethnicity. The primary texts that form the focus of my thesis include Dymphna Cusack&#8217;s A Bough in Hell (1971), Carmel Bird&#8217;s The White Garden (1995), Drusilla Modjeska&#8217;s Poppy (1996), Kate Grenville&#8217;s Lilian&#8217;s Story (1997), Alexis Wright&#8217;s Plains of Promise (1997), and Vivienne Cleven&#8217;s Her Sister&#8217;s Eye (2002), along with short stories by Olga Masters, Lynette Russell and Dorothy Hewett. These texts challenge images of deranged or mentally ill protagonists in ways that question the social practices binding meanings of madness and the female body. They respond, too, to changes in the manner in which mental illness can be seen to frame, and be framed by, the politics of gender. My research takes advantage of those paradigms in which resistance to culturally defined notions of gender and madness have been investigated and analysed. In doing so I further develop these orientations in order to identify the textual spaces in Australian women&#8217;s writing in which experiences of mental illness have been re-evaluated. My research is organised into five chapters that deal in turn with the silencing of femininity; female sex and desire; notions of matrilineal madness; the place of the Gothic in narratives featuring madness; and finally the effects of masculine madness in producing its feminine counterpart. The first, in exploring the silencing of the feminine voice, establishes links between madness and repression. In order to better understand the function of silencing and its social implications I examine institutionalisation of female protagonists; the domestic confinement of purportedly mad women; and, most contentiously, the deliberate self-silencing of female protagonists. My second chapter investigates female sexuality and desire as contributing factors of madness&#8217;s symptoms: the female body and female sexual appetite defining feminine derangement. This chapter, like the first, emphasises the effects of repression and denial in those narratives that feature the internment of protagonists deemed too overtly sexual, or in more sinister stories, those who become the focus of male sexual desire. My third chapter is given to the exploration of matrilineal madness, the daughters of purportedly mad women becoming central figures in narratives featuring threats of crossgenerational derangements. The preoccupation of inheritance as a feature of feminine madness leads to my fourth chapter, which deals with the effect of the Gothic in magnifying the features of madness in uncanny moments and architectural anomalies. My final chapter draws together each of the former four, exploring masculine madness, not simply as a counterpart to feminine derangement but rather as a cause of feminine derangement.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:133065</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantification of economic risk in mineral exploration: A case study on exploration in the Yarrol region, Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Hedger, Darren Charles</field><field name="description">Mineral exploration is a risky business due to the inherent geological and economic uncertainties that accompany the discovery and exploitation of mineral deposits. Consequently, the ability to quantify the risk in terms of the economic consequences of exploration can lead to improved decision-making and more profitable exploration. Quantifying economic risk in exploration requires an understanding of the economic value of exploration. This in turn requires information about possible numbers and sizes of undiscovered deposits, in addition to the economics associated with the discovery, delineation and mining of these undiscovered deposits. A method for quantifying exploration risk based on these requirements is detailed here and demonstrated via a four part case study, which examines the economic risk associated with exploration for undiscovered porphyry Cu and VHMS deposits in the Yarrol region (SE Queensland) and their contained copper and gold resources. The first part of the case study outlines the study rationale and background, and presents descriptive geological models for eastern Australian porphyry Cu and VHMS deposits. The deposit models were then used to delineate permissive tracts for each deposit type. In the second part, prospectivity modelling was carried out on a sub-block basis using a multivariate Bayesian weighted probabilistic neural network (PNN). The PNN was used to integrate geological data and estimate the conditional probability that a sub-block belonged to one of twelve classes, defined by a set of mineral deposit types. Prior to modelling, the geological data used in the PNN underwent preparation that involved quality control and conversion to a set of geological themes which accentuate characteristics associated with mineralisation in the Yarrol region. To compensate for inherent imprecision in the data, fuzzy set algorithms were used to sample the themes prior to PNN modelling. The algorithms were designed to handle the line, polygon and raster data using fuzzy membership functions and fuzzy entropy. The final PNN input vector contained 50 fuzzy variables, describing lithology, structure and geophysics. Because the PNN is an intrinsic classifier, which uses the training samples as nodes in the network, independent validation with classified samples not used in training is required to appropriately gauge performance. To overcome the issue of excluding classified samples from training, multiple PNN tests were carried out using randomly selected 70:30, training to validation, splits of the classified samples. In the case study 100 PNN tests were carried out and independent validation recorded a mean of 84 % correct classifications, with 4 % standard deviation. After each PNN test, unclassified subblocks covering the case study region were classified by the trained PNN and the results used to map the prospectivity of the region. The prospectivity maps highlighted both geological features and areas prospective for the different mineral classes. A total of 26 areas were modelled as being prospective for porphyry Cu and VHMS deposits of which 6 corresponded to the deposits used in training. In the third part of the case study, estimates of the undiscovered mineral resources in the Yarrol region were modelled using a Monte Carlo simulation. Simulation involved generating grade and tonnage models for eastern Australian porphyry Cu and VHMS deposits, and estimating the numbers of undiscovered deposits in the region using the probabilities generated by prospectivity modelling. Models and estimates were converted to cumulative distribution functions using histogram smoothing and normal score transformation. This approach differs from the documented proportional method and the benefits of using the new approach, such as better fitting and more representative grade and tonnage models, are shown. Results of the mineral resource simulation found that the simulated Cu resources in undiscovered VHMS deposits were much smaller than those estimated in undiscovered porphyry Cu deposits (i.e. Kt rather than Mt) while the probabilities for VMHS resources were an order of magnitude higher. For example, there was a 30 % chance of 100 Kt or more Cu in a VHMS deposit compared to a 2 % chance of 1 Mt or more Cu in an undiscovered porphyry Cu deposit. However, in the case of undiscovered Au resources the VHMS deposits had similar resource sizes to the porphyry Cu deposits but the probabilities were much higher for VHMS deposits (e.g. there was a 2 % chance of 5 Moz of Au, or more, in a porphyry Cu deposit and a 15 % chance of 5 Moz of Au, or more, in a VHMS deposit). These results reflected the high probability (i.e. 92 % chance) for zero undiscovered porphyry deposits and much higher Au grades in the VHMS deposits. In the final part of the case study the mid-term value (mine value) and the long-term value of exploration were estimated in terms of NPV and RoR. The mid-term values were calculated using mining cost models based on mining capacity calculated via Taylor&#8217;s rule. A new approach using variable mine capacity and scheduled development costs is presented and demonstrated. Results for the mid-term values indicate that economic risk was lower for resources in VHMS deposits. For example, the expected NPV1 for an undiscovered porphyry Cu deposit was $ 27 million compared to $ 53 million for a VHMS deposit and the probabilities of these occurring were 0.03 (a 3 % chance) and 0.2 (a 20 % chance), respectively. However, a risk assessment using utilities for the mid-term NPV indicated that a risk taker would favour porphyry Cu exploration because of the possibility for extremely large porphyry deposits. The long term value of exploration was estimated using an exploration model that randomly sampled both a discovery cost model (which mapped the cost of exploration to the probability of a discovery) and the simulated undiscovered resources (which act as possible targets for exploration). A range of exploration budgets were examined for both deposit types. Results demonstrated that smaller budgets had higher risk because they resulted in longer discovery times which reduce profits and increased the chance of missed economic opportunities due to Gambler&#8217;s Ruin (e.g. a budget of $ 2 million/year had a 50 % of Gambler&#8217;s Ruin after 6 years, whereas a $ 6 million/year budget had only a 3 % chance). It was also shown that economic returns levelled out as the budget increased because the increased chance of making a discovery is balanced out by higher exploration costs and lower discounted returns for the discovered deposit. Small and large exploration budgets were examined in detail and it was shown that in both cases exploration for VHMS deposits has less risk. For example1, a $ 2 million/year exploration budget targeting VHMS deposits had a 13 % chance of returning a NPV of $ 50 million, or greater, whereas the same budget targeting porphyry Cu deposits had only a 3 % chance of returning the same NPV, or greater. The RoR results displayed a similar outcome. The case study concluded with a sensitivity study examining the effects that variation in Cu price, Au price, exchange rate, mean exploration cost, development costs and operating costs has on the long-term economic values for both deposits types. In the case of porphyry Cu deposits both the NPV and RoR were highly sensitive to variations in Cu price and to a lesser extent operating and development costs. The long-term value of VHMS exploration was highly sensitive to the Cu price, Au price and the exchange rate. (the latter related to commodity prices and mining costs). It is recommended that future prospectivity studies could include geochemical and alteration data to assist in modelling the location of an undiscovered deposit. The use of historical exploration data (e.g. drill hole density maps) in the prospectivity modelling process would also help to identify areas that either lack detailed exploration or have been extensively explored. The use of more localised mining costs models, incorporating real Australian mine development and production costs is also recommended. Probably the most important recommendation deals with improvements to the exploration model such as the use of more accurate exploration costs and staged exploration processes. It is also suggested that other economic risk analysis techniques (i.e. portfolio analyses, capital asset fixing etc.) could be used to model the exploration process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260000 Earth Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:133070</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays on Analysts' Long-term Earnings Growth Forecasts</field><field name="creator">Andreas Simon</field><field name="description">Prior research documents a large dispersion in long-term earnings growth forecasts among financial analysts covering the same stock. This suggests that while analysts believe long-term earnings growth is predictable, they face significant uncertainty when estimating it. This thesis examines the effect long-term earnings growth forecast dispersion has on the firm that receives long-term earnings growth forecasts, and investors who follow analysts&#8217; stock recommendations based on valuations that incorporate long-term earnings growth. The first essay examines determinants of voluntary earnings growth guidance by management, and investigates analysts&#8217; reactions to the guidance. The second essay examines trading strategies based on superior analysts&#8217; long-term earnings growth forecasts. The results of the first essay indicate that there is pervasive upward bias in managers&#8217; earnings growth guidance. As a result of this bias, managers are more likely to issue earnings growth forecasts in years of negative short-term earnings surprises and when analysts have low initial long-term earnings growth forecasts. The finding that managements&#8217; earnings growth forecasts primarily convey good news is in contrast to the generally negative nature of management short-term earnings guidance, and suggests that different incentives drive firms&#8217; disclosure of different financial information. Moreover, analysts respond to managements&#8217; earnings growth guidance by increasing their long-term earnings growth forecasts. This finding sheds new light on the over-optimism hypothesis in analysts&#8217; long-term earnings growth forecasts, suggesting the bias could be management induced. However, with regard to analysts&#8217; response, the findings suggest that analysts sacrifice precision in long-term earnings growth forecasts for deliberate upward bias. This bias is not subject to ex post scrutiny and is designed to maintain or increase analysts&#8217; target prices, even though short-term earnings may warrant a lower target price. Results in the second essay show a contemporaneous association between long-term earnings growth forecast accuracy, one-year ahead earnings forecast accuracy, and stock recommendation profitability. Despite these results, a model that predicts the profitability of future stock recommendations based on the analyst&#8217;s historical one-yea ahead earnings forecast accuracy and long-term earnings growth forecast accuracy, is not found.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:133072</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Techniques for Improving Phytophthora Resistance in Waxflower (Chamelaucium spp.)</field><field name="creator">O'Sullivan, Gregory J.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270402 Plant Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:133085</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Wounding The Soul": The Lived Experience Of Spiritual Abuse</field><field name="creator">Ward, David John</field><field name="description">This study investigates the experiences of six individuals who identified themselves as victims of spiritual abuse. The academic community has an awareness of the more spectacular &#8216;cults&#8217; that have imploded in recent years, however the more grey, less well defined phenomenon of &#8216;spiritual abuse&#8217; is under-researched. This study acknowledges and builds on previous research completed on religious cults. In this regard, that body of knowledge has been most valuable in its exploration of a multitude of mental health and social-psychological variables. However, there is a noticeable gap when material is sought that explores the internal, meaning-making experience. This qualitative research aims to narrow that gap. Six participants via a snowball sampling volunteered for the study. Two participants were married and came from the same group. The other respondents exited different groups, leaving a total of six participants who have left five different religious groups that were essentially Judeo-Christian in their orientation. As the study aimed to examine human experience, a qualitative methodology with a phenomenological core was chosen. A hermeneutical, or interpretivist approach was taken, thereby freely using current literature to help make sense of the participants&#8217; narratives. In keeping with this methodology, in-depth, unstructured interviews were used, and transcripts coded for significant themes. Parallel themes were noted in all six respondent transcripts, which were then compared and contrasted with each other. The themes included Leadership representing God (powerful symbolic authority), Spiritual bullying (manipulative behaviour), Acceptance via performance (approval through obedience), Spiritual neglect (detrimental acts of omission), Expanding external/internal tension (dissonance between one&#8217;s inner and outer worlds) and Manifestation of internal states (the somatic and psychological repercussions of the abuse). Each of these themes were interrelated and the experience affected the bio/psycho/social/spiritual domains of the individual&#8217;s life. The study revealed that spiritual abuse is a multifaceted and multilayered phenomenon that can affect an individual and the immediate family deeply. The strength of the research is demonstrated by the depth of experience that surfaced. The rich spiritual journey of the participants was evident in the study and offers a compelling representation of the lived experience of spiritual abuse. These emerging themes were also examined via the wider literature to provide further elucidation of the experience of spiritual abuse. Subsequently, it is argued that the research is a valuable contribution to understanding other phenomena in the social and behavioural sciences. Secondly, elements of spiritual abuse were also located in a range of other social and behavioural realities. The study also highlighted areas for future research. This includes other relationallybased domains where mistreatment is possible, the interface between psychology and spiritual belief, and how the notion of God is internalised during one&#8217;s spiritual journey across the lifecycle. Finally, the insights from this study are offered as a foundation from which to help therapists and counsellors be more informed about the phenomenon as well as to develop a deeper appreciation for the subjective experience.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:133094</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Justice, Order and Peace: Transitional Justice and Peacebuilding in Timor-Leste</field><field name="creator">Laakso, Jennifer</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:133342</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social construction of abilities and conduct of assessment in Senior PE</field><field name="creator">Hay, Peter J.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:133344</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Copyright Law in the Digital Era: A Comparative Study of Sri Lanka, Australia and the United States</field><field name="creator">Rodrigo, Wedage Dantha</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">copyright</field><field name="subject">Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">intellectual property</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="subject">fair use</field><field name="subject">reform</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:133345</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping susceptibility genes for schizophrenia</field><field name="creator">Holliday, Elizabeth G.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">schizophrenia incidence</field><field name="subject">mental illness</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:133347</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using models to explore copper bioaccumulation in the Sydney Rock Oyster (Saccostrea glomerata) in a large coastal embayment</field><field name="creator">Russell Geoffrey Richards</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270500 Zoology</field><field name="subject">300704 Ecosystem Studies and Stock Assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:133348</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating genetic and molecular aspects of growth of the tropical abalone Haliotis asinina</field><field name="creator">Lucas, Timothy</field><field name="description">The tropical abalone Haliotis asinina is a wild-caught and cultured species that is found throughout the Indo-Pacific. It is also an emerging model species for the study of growth, reproduction and development of haliotids and other vetigastropods. H. asinina has the fastest recorded natural growth rate of any abalone and reaches sexual maturity within one year. As such, it is a suitable abalone species for studying genetic and molecular aspects of commercially important traits such as growth. This thesis reports the analysis of growth and other traits in a single cohort of H. asinina that consisted of 84 families that were generated via a full-factorial mating design consisting of 14 sires and six dams. Progeny were measured and then tested for parentage and RNA expression to explain the differences in size. During this study a shell disease was discovered and investigated. Estimating the amount of variation in size that is attributable to heritable genetic differences can assist the development of a selective breeding program. In Chapter 2, I estimated heritability for growth-related traits at 12 months of age in these 84 H. asinina families. Of 500 progeny sampled, 465 were successfully assigned to their parents based on shared alleles at five polymorphic microsatellite loci. Using an animal model, heritability estimates were 0.48 &#177; 0.15 for shell length, 0.38 &#177; 0.13 for shell width 0.36 &#177; 0.13 for weight. Genetic correlations were &gt; 0.98 between shell parameters and weight, indicating that breeding for weight gains could be successfully achieved by selecting for shell length. A novel method for analysis of shell colour revealed that the proportion of blue in the shell was a very good indicator of shell length in this study. In Chapter 3, large and small abalone from the aforementioned experiment were compared for differences in RNA expression levels, using microarray gene expression profiling. Big and small abalone were each represented by three pools of RNA, which each contained RNA from four individuals from that size class. Comparison of these RNA pools identified 14 genes that were significantly differentially regulated between fast and slow growers (P &lt;0.05). From this list and another list generated by the disease study (Chapter 5), seven genes were selected for further interrogation using qRT-PCR in Chapter 4. This experiment aimed to compare gene expression for these seven genes in fast and slow growing individuals. In order to accurately evaluate relative transcription, it is important to have reference genes which are expressed stably and do not vary with growth rate. The transcription factors POU-3, POU-4, Pax-258 and Pax-6 were tested and deemed to be more suitable reference genes than other genes that were derived from microarray experiments. Expression levels in different individuals revealed high levels of variation in expression levels between individuals, and that several of these genes have potential for use as markers for fast growth in aquaculture. These include the genes ferritin, metallothionein and ribosomal protein L22. A shell and mantle disease that affected a large proportion of abalone was the focus of Chapter 5. Examination of mantle tissue showed necrosis and encapsulation in areas of abnormal shell growth. Whilst the cause of the disease is unknown, spherical virus-like particles were observed in the mantle tissue of both diseased and apparently healthy individuals. Analysis of parentage revealed that dams appeared to have a substantial effect on the extent of disease in their progeny, with progeny from one dam being almost unaffected by disease. Comparison of gene expression failed to reveal any genes associated with the disease, however, the 'growth markers' from Chapter 4 were stable across diseased and unaffected abalone, indicating that the disease symptoms were not associated with changes in metabolism. This thesis demonstrates heritable genetic differences in growth rate between individuals, provides molecular tools to assist in identification of fast growers, and describes a previously unknown shell disease in H. asinina. This information will assist in the development of a profitable aquaculture industry based on this species, and some of the findings may also be applicable to other abalone species.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:133351</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aetiology of Obesity in Australian Families</field><field name="creator">Belinda Cornes</field><field name="description">Excessive weight can have a severe impact on health as well as creating a significant economic burden. Obesity is reaching epidemic proportions, but the mode of inheritance of obesity and its underlying complexity remains largely unresolved. Thus, the aim of this research project was to provide a further understanding of this condition in an Australian adolescent and adult population. Qualitative and quantitative differences in genetic and environmental influences affecting body mass index (BMI) in males and females, during development were examined. Structural equation models were fitted to longitudinal data collected at ages twelve, fourteen and sixteen from 470 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and 673 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. In addition, it is generally known that some genetic differences are only exposed in the presence of certain environmental stressors, such as the effects of parity and age on post-partum obesity. Therefore, models were fitted to data from 11, 915 female twins and their sisters from whom reproductive history was available in order to assess the changes in magnitude of genetic and environmental variation in female BMI due to these variables. To detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) influencing adolescent BMI, up to 1133 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers were typed across the genome in a sub-sample of adolescent twins, their parents and siblings. Because gene mutations for some genetic disorders affecting body weight may manifest during childhood, univariate linkage analysis were applied to test for linkage between marker loci and BMI at twelve, fourteen and sixteen across the genome. Additionally, genes involved in pathways regulating body weight may operate differently in men and women. Therefore, a genome-wide linkage analysis allowing for sex difference in linkage patterns was performed in order to identify QTLs influencing BMI which may differ between adult males and females. Genetic factors contributed strongly to BMI in adolescent twins, accounting for approximately ninety percent of phenotypic variation at twelve, fourteen and sixteen years of age. In addition, the majority of this genetic variance was transmitted from age twelve to ages fourteen and sixteen. Sex differences in the size of genetic innovations at ages fourteen and sixteen suggest that the genetic variation in weight regulation is different in males and females. The presence of environmental influences in males and females may reflect the effects of lifestyle activities during adolescents such as severe exercise and diet regimes. Structural equation models exploring the effects of parity and age on female BMI revealed that genes become more important in the variation in BMI as parity increases. The ability to retain weight for lactation and support for foetal growth possibly reflects an evolutionary advantage in times when it was a necessary condition of survival. Unique environmental influences were also important in the variation female BMI across parity and age, possibly reflecting lifestyle factors and individual responses to social attitudes towards weight gain. Genome-wide linkage analysis in adolescent twins revealed strong evidence for linkage on chromosome 14q12-q13 at age fourteen (logarithm of odds (LOD) = 3.71, p = 0.000018) and suggestive linkage in the same region in sixteen year old twins (LOD = 2.46, p = 0.00038) which has been previously implicated in adiponectin in Northern Europeans. Chromosome 6p12 yielded a suggestive LOD = 2.95 (p = 0.00012) which harboured a known gene responsible for rebound weight gain. Evidence for replication (LOD = 1) at other areas of the genome was also observed, including 1, 4, 10, 11, 13 and 20, which have been previously associated with obesity in other studies, being LEPR, UCP1, OB10P, BMIQ3 and BMIQ6, respectively, although we did not have time to genotype these to test for association in our samples. The use of a genome-wide linkage analysis allowing for sex difference in linkage patterns identified areas on chromosome 8 and 20, providing us with evidence that some of the genes responsible for BMI may have different effects in adult men and women. Results revealed a suggestive linkage peak (-log10p = 3.13; equivalent to LOD = 2.19, p = 0.000741) at 12q24 (-log10p = 3.02; equivalent to LOD = 2.08, p = 0.000955), that has been implicated in weight in a wide range of populations and where non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, a consequence of obesity, has also been mapped. We also identified many peaks near the threshold for replicating an existing finding (-log10p = 2; equivalent to LOD = 1.18, p = 0.01) in many areas across the genome that are within regions previously identified by other studies, as well as in locations that harbour genes known to influence weight regulation. Finally, the significances of these results are discussed and future directions are considered including association analysis on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across six candidate genes: LEPR, GN&#946;3, UCP2, UCP3, FTO and INSIG2 which have previously been associated with obesity or BMI. We typed seventeen SNPs and performed analyses in a sample of 4494 MZ and DZ twins. Significant association was found for rs9939609 (A/T polymorphism) of the FTO gene. In our data, each additional copy of the rs9939609 A allele increased mean BMI by approximately 0.14kg/m2 in an apparent additive manner, comparable with recent published results from population-based studies in white European children and adults.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321206 Preventive Medicine</field><field name="subject">321208 Primary Health Care</field><field name="subject">321202 Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">aetiology</field><field name="subject">obesity</field><field name="subject">overweight</field><field name="subject">weight problems</field><field name="subject">inheritance</field><field name="subject">genetic influence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:133599</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Branching in Pea: Molecular Physiology and Computational Analysis</field><field name="creator">Elizabeth Dun</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270602 Animal Physiology - Cell</field><field name="subject">280404 Numerical Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:134173</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamental Studies of Anodic and Cathodic Processes in Microbial Fuel Cells</field><field name="creator">Stefano Freguia</field><field name="description">Microbial fuel cells have emerged in the last ten years as a sustainable technology for simultaneous wastewater treatment and electrical power generation. The global need of renewable energy sources and clean water has motivated intensive research in these systems, which are potentially capable of achieving self sustained wastewater treatment. Microbial fuel cells rely on electrochemically active bacteria to catalyse the oxidation of organic molecules to carbon dioxide while performing extracellular electron transfer towards electrodes (anodes). In a fuel cell setup, the electrons are directed through an electrical circuit, where electrical power is harvested. Many limitations and bottlenecks still need to be overcome before this technology is implemented outside of the lab. Moreover, fundamental knowledge of the biological processes is still lacking. The aims of this work are to fill in some of these knowledge gaps and to solve some of the technical bottlenecks of microbial fuel cells. In particular, the goals of this work are: (i) to identify and specifically quantify the major Coulombic (electron) losses at microbial fuel cell anodes by closing electron and carbon balances through the measurements of electron sources and sinks; (ii) to determine the effect of operating parameters such as the anodic potential and the organic loading rate on the Coulombic efficiency; (iii) to unravel the complex interactions between functionally diverse populations in microbial fuel cell anodic biofilms; (iv) to find a sustainable alternative to transition metals as catalyst for cathodic oxygen reduction; (v) to engineer a solution to the bottleneck of limited proton migration from anode to cathode. All the experiments included in this work were carried out using two microbial fuel cells in double chambered rectangular geometry. The anodes were enriched in electrochemically active bacteria after an initial inoculation with aerobic and anoxic sludge. The reactors were routinely fed in continuous mode with acetate and/or glucose. The identified sinks of electrons at the anode were electrical current, biomass growth, polymer storage and products of fermentation and methanogenesis. The production of gases at the anode was measured online with the Titration and Off-gas Analysis (TOGA) sensor, which combined with electrochemical monitoring and liquid phase sampling enabled electron and carbon balances to be closed based on these measurements. This work was the first to provide a complete breakdown of the electron and carbon balances in microbial fuel cell anodes. Biomass growth was the only electron loss when acetate was the electron donor, with growth yields increasing from 0 to 0.304 C-mol biomass/C-mol substrate as the anodic potential increased from -229 to -20 mV versus Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE). When glucose was the electron donor fermentations increased the electron losses, with generation of methane being the main loss and accounting for 15-50% of the glucose-electrons supplied. The anodic potential did not prove effective to control fermentations, which were instead significantly affected by the (fermentable) organic loading rate, with Coulombic efficiencies dropping from 70% to less than 20% as the loading rate was increased from 1 to 6 kgCODm-3d-1. The detailed study of the interactions between populations in anodic biofilms revealed that glucose is mostly first taken up by fermenters to produce acetate and hydrogen, which are subsequently used by electrochemically active bacteria to generate electricity, with hydrogen accounting for up to 20% of the current produced. This study proved for the first time that biological hydrogen oxidation is an important pathway of electricity generation from glucose in mixed culture anodic biofilms. A first valid alternative to the use of transition metals as catalysts for cathodic oxygen reduction is the use of high surface area non-catalysed graphite. The large surface area of graphite granules (measured at 6 x 106 m&#178;/m&#179; by mercury porosimetry) enables sufficient cathodic rates to drive a microbial fuel cell at a (removed) loading rate of 1.46 kgCODm-3d-1 . Inoculation of the cathode with bacteria present in the anode effluent enabled the development of a cathodic biocatalysis, which caused a four-fold increase in the current production, with power outputs up to 110 W per cubic meter of cathode liquid volume. A new microbial fuel cell configuration was implemented, with the effluent of an acetate-fed anode entirely used as continuous feed for the cathode. The outcomes were (i) chemical oxygen demand (COD) polishing with effluent COD consistently less than 30 mg/L and (ii) convective transfer of protons from anode to cathode, with consequent achievement of a stable catholyte pH. With the findings of this thesis, the day when microbial fuel cells find full scale implementations is getting closer. However, some work remains to be done, in particular to improve and to identify the mechanisms of the cathodic biocatalysis, which despite the improvements is still responsible for the largest fraction of energy loss. Also, more research is demanded to fully tackle the problem of methane generation at MFC anodes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:134174</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computer Aided Design of Climate Responsive Dwelling (Roof) in the Climatic and Technological Context of India and Australia</field><field name="creator">Kabre, Chitrarekha</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the form, development and application of generation and optimization concepts as a new CAD model for the design of the dwelling roofs in the warm-humid tropics. Generation is utilized to produce a range of feasible design solutions and optimization is utilized to offer prescriptive quantitative information, the optimum performance achievable in any given climate. The climatic and technological context of the research is presented. The performance standards for dwelling and roof design are reviewed. The process used to define the acceptable limits of ceiling surface temperature based on comfort is described. A method to predict thermal performance of roof is described. This identifies a set of variables which influence the performance of roof. From this theoretical study a new thermal performance index (TPI*) is developed to give a scientific rating to thermal behaviour of the roof system. Computer design aids presently available to the architects for energy efficient dwelling design are critically reviewed in relation to the scope and limitations of the information they provide. The new concepts of generation and optimization are then developed. The CAD model introduces the application of generation method in place of the traditional simulation. Its structure includes, the decomposition of the roof system into elements or components and the definition of their relationships based on topology, geometry and materials. The concept of design template is introduced to encode aesthetic or practical rules about the form of acceptable design solutions. Alternative design solutions are generated by paramterizing the templates using the design preferences of the architect. A material matrix form is introduced to present the alternative solutions. The CAD model includes an optimization procedure which is based on multi-criteria Pareto optimization. The use of this model is illustrated for a number of widely differing roof designs. The resulting thermal performances and optimum solutions are demonstrated for four locations from India and Australia. The value of this form of information in practice, education and research is discussed and possibilities for future development are outlined.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:134427</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiology of Microorganisms Enriched in Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal</field><field name="creator">Luke Burow</field><field name="description">Since the isolation of bacteria in pure culture, investigations of microbial physiology have focussed on model microorganisms grown in pure culture. However, in order to understand complex environmental processes, there is a need to investigate mixed microbial communities. This is true for enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR), a wastewater treatment process that results in the enrichment of polyphosphateaccumulating organisms (PAOs) and glycogen non-polyphosphate accumulating organisms (GAOs). PAOs and GAOs are key groups of physiologically distinct microorganisms that can proliferate in EBPR processes. PAOs drive the EBPR process, removing Pi from the wastewater, whereas GAOs negatively impact the process. In situ studies of Defluviicoccus in full-scale plants. Putative GAOs from the Alphaproteobacteria, Defluviicoccus (including Defluviicoccus vanus) were studied in full-scale EBPR plants to determine their distribution, abundance and ecological physiology (ecophysiology). Quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated that Defluviicoccus were generally in low abundance, however in one plant surveyed, Cluster 2 Defluviicoccus comprised 9% of Bacteria. FISH combined with microautoradiography (MAR) revealed that both Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 Defluviicoccus were capable of taking up a narrow range of substrates including acetate, propionate, and pyruvate under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Formate, butyrate, ethanol and several other organic carbon substrates were not taken up. Cluster 2 Defluviicoccus demonstrated a phenotype consistent with the current metabolic model for GAOs - anaerobic assimilation of acetate as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) with concomitant glycogen catabolism and aerobic consumption of PHA. Evidence was provided that these GAOs are likely to be unable to denitrify. The PAO, Accumulibacter and other GAOs (Competibacter) co-existed in two full-scale plants with Cluster 2 Defluviicoccus, but in both plants, the latter organisms were more abundant. Thus Cluster 2 Defluviicoccus can be relatively abundant and could be carbon (C) competitors with PAOs and other GAOs in EBPR plants. Bioenergetic models for Accumulibacter and Defluviicoccus. Investigations of acetate and inorganic phosphate (Pi) uptake in enrichments of Accumulibacter and acetate uptake in enrichments of Defluviicoccus were carried on lab-scale enrichment cultures and bioenergetic models were proposed. For both enrichments anaerobic acetate uptake assays in the presence of the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone or the electrical potential () uncoupler valinomycin, indicated that acetate is likely to be taken up by a permease driven by the component of the proton motive force (pmf). Further investigation with the sodium ionophore monensin, suggested that anaerobic acetate uptake by Defluviicoccus may in part be sodium-dependent. Results of this study suggest that Accumulibacter generate a pmf for anaerobic acetate uptake by efflux of protons in symport with Pi through an inorganic phosphate transport system. In contrast, this study suggests that the anaerobic pmf in Defluviicoccus is generated by an efflux of protons across the cell membrane by the fumarate respiratory system, or by extrusion of sodium ions via decarboxylation of methylmalonyl-CoA. Aerobic Pi uptake by the Accumulibacter enrichment was strongly inhibited in the presence of an ATPase inhibitor (N, N&#8217;-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide), suggesting that the phosphate specific transport (Pst) system is important even under relatively high concentrations of Pi. Acetate permease activity in Accumulibacter and Defluviicoccus may play an important role in the competition for acetate in the often acetate limited EBPR process. Activity of a highvelocity Pst system in Accumulibacter may further explain its ability to compete strongly in EBPR. Anaerobic central metabolism in Accumulibacter. This study integrated in situ structure-function techniques, community biochemical measurements, metagenomic and transcriptomic analysis to study the physiology of Accumulibacter enriched in EBPR sludge communities. Anaerobic acetate uptake and assimilation as PHA in Accumulibacter was confirmed using FISH-MAR and post-FISH chemical staining. The effect of inhibitors on acetate uptake and storage polymer metabolism in the Accumulibacter enrichment was consistent with C flux through the glycolytic pathway and the glyoxylate cycle. Bioinformatic analysis of sequenced strains of Accumulibacter suggested that this PAO may interconvert intermediates of glycolysis and the glyoxylate cycle via malate-pyruvate and oxaloacetate-phosphenolpyruvate cycling. Investigation of gene expression in Accumulibacter demonstrated anaerobic activity of aconitase, isocitrate lyase, succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome b/b6. A fusion protein including a novel cytochrome b/b6 complex likely facilitates energetically unfavourable anaerobic C flux through succinate dehydrogenase in Accumulibacter by pushing electrons uphill to more electronegative electron carriers. Physiological data from this study is interpreted in light of previous metagenomic information from enriched EBPR sludge communities and integrated with previous metabolic models for PAOs to develop a model for anaerobic central metabolism in Accumulibacter. Anaerobic central metabolism in Defluviicoccus. A lab-scale GAO enrichment culture dominated by Defluviicoccus was investigated to determine central metabolic pathways involved in anaerobic formation of PHA, a key carbon storage polymer essential for survival and proliferation of microorganisms in EBPR systems. Glycogen levels decreased under anaerobic conditions in the enrichment culture. However, no decrease in glycogen was observed in the presence of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor iodoacetate, inferring that glycogen is catabolized anaerobically in Defluviicoccus. FISH-MAR and post-FISH chemical staining supported the idea that acetate is converted to PHA in Defluviicoccus under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic acetate uptake rates and PHA formation in the presence of metabolic inhibitors of central metabolic pathways in the Defluviicoccus enrichment culture was determined. Inhibition of isocitrate lyase by 3-nitropropionate and itaconate, indicated that C is likely to be channelled through the glyoxylate cycle in Defluviicoccus. Inhibitors of aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase suggested that aconitase but not succinate dehydrogenase was active, providing further support for the role of the glyoxylate cycle in these GAOs. The observed fumarate reductase inhibitor effect on PHA production indicated reduction of fumarate to succinate and the operation of the reductive branch of the TCA cycle. Intracellular polyhydroxyvalerate was measured in the Defluviicoccus enrichment and was likely produced by degradation of succinate generated by the glyoxylate cycle or fumarate reduction to propionyl-CoA followed by condensation with acetyl-CoA via a methylmalonyl-CoA intermediate.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:134428</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of Politics, Systems and Culture on the Success of a Clinical Education Partnership</field><field name="creator">Gonda, Judith W.</field><field name="description">In order to improve educational outcomes for undergraduates and improve retention rates of registered nurses within the health workforce, it is clear that there is a need for improvement in the way clinical education in undergraduate nursing programs takes place in Australia. In keeping with current western socio-political trends, clinical education partnerships between education and health service providers have been suggested as a way to achieve this. Partnerships in clinical education however, are not clearly understood as each is unique and exists within a specific cultural, organisational and socio-political context. The purpose of the research presented in this thesis was to explore the experiences of members of a partnership between a university and a state health care system in the development of an innovative undergraduate Bachelor of Nursing program, specifically the clinical education component of the partnership. This research included examination of the perception of significant individuals who participated in the partnership collaboration. In particular this concentrated on their perception of the vision, goals, barriers and outcomes to the maintenance of the clinical education partnership. The context was provided by the stakeholders of the partnership, however, the exploration focussed on the experiences of nurses, clinical academics and students involved in the clinical education component of the program. The principle research question focused on the effect of cultural and systemic factors on the maintenance of this clinical education partnership. Data collection and analysis was undertaken using a critical ethnographic approach guided by the framework developed by Carspecken (1996). The data comprised of focus groups, individual interviews, participant observation and a reflexive journal. Findings were then interpreted within a systems analysis framework. The data indicated that in the case of this clinical education partnership, systemic and cultural influences had a significant influence on the partnership and the clinical learning environment. They also indicated that partnership aspects of this clinical education partnership were not optimal at the time the data were collected. Consequently this shaped the quality of the clinical learning environment within the clinical education partnership. Outcomes from the analysis of the data indicated that there were four distinct factors that negatively affected the efficacy of this partnership at this time. These factors included the motivation of nurses in the clinical education partnership to teach students, sufficient resources for clinical academics and nurses to optimally teach students, communication between and within the university and the hospital, and inclusion of nurses in decision making about the clinical education partnership. Recommendations originating from the findings highlighted the need for the above factors to be considered when implementing future clinical education partnerships, to facilitate more positive experiences for all involved. This could correspondingly improve the learning outcomes for students and ultimately have a positive influence on registered nurse retention rates. Suggestions for further research included replication of this research in a number of other clinical education partnerships and examination of the relationships and interactions that promote effective clinical education partnership function between key participants. In addition it is proposed that evaluation of the quality of the &#8220;product&#8221; of clinical education partnerships in terms of graduates being prepared for the realities of contemporary and future nursing practice be implemented in the future. The thesis concluded by proposing that the contemporary challenges facing clinical education in nursing can be viewed as a transformational opportunity for the profession. However, it also cautions that if this transformation does not occur this study indicates that clinical education partnerships and the quality outcomes that these provided are seriously at risk.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:134430</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unravelling the Relationship Between Leader Behavioural Flexibility and Positive Employee Attitudes</field><field name="creator">Sumner-Armstrong, Crissa</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:134431</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consumer-Focused Commercial Sponsorship: An Item and Relational Information Framework</field><field name="creator">Clinton Sidney Weeks</field><field name="description">In recent years there has been considerable growth in research concerned with commercial sponsorship and its effects. A range of conceptual and theory-guided models have been proposed, established psychological theories applied, and several construct level phenomena described, in an effort to explain the way sponsorship works and how it might impact audiences. The current research consolidates and adds to this literature by outlining how an item and relational information framework (Einstein &amp; Hunt, 1980; Hunt &amp; Einstein, 1981) can be used to explain the cognitive processes involved when consumer audiences encounter commercial sponsorship communications. Item information can be described as that which is processed in an individual&#8217;s mind when seemingly unrelated entities are encountered, while relational information is that which is processed when seemingly related entities are encountered. These cognitive processes are assumed to be relatively automatic, and hence not under the conscious control of the individual. Item information is useful in that it promotes item salience and distinctiveness, and assists memory retrieval by enhancing item discriminability. Relational information is useful in that it promotes associative relationships between items, and assists memory retrieval by enabling one item to serve as a cue for other related items. Any given set of items will initially be encoded predominantly as either item or relational information based on apparent similarities or dissimilarities, but optimal memory performance occurs when additional encoding is encouraged by also orienting people toward the processing of the alternative form of information. In the context of sponsorship, it is proposed that brand-event relationships which are perceived as incongruent (e.g., an electronics brands sponsoring an equestrian event) will be processed most naturally in people&#8217;s minds as item information, while those which are perceived as congruent (e.g., a swimwear brand sponsoring a swimming event) will be processed most naturally as relational information. Accordingly, memory for incongruent sponsorships should be facilitated if people are encouraged to process additional brand-event relational information, and memory for congruent sponsorships should be facilitated if people are encouraged to process additional brand-specific item information. Conceptualising sponsorship within an item and relational information framework provides an explanation for a range of findings from previous sponsorship research, such as that congruent sponsorships are better remembered than incongruent sponsorships (see Cornwell, Weeks, &amp; Roy, 2005), that the provision of information linking unrelated sponsors and events together can enhance subsequent memory for the pairing (Cornwell, Humphreys, Maguire, Weeks, &amp; Tellegen, 2006; Simmons &amp; Becker-Olsen, 2006), and that people often tend to be biased toward attributing sponsorships to those brands that most obviously relate to an event, and to those brands that are prominent in the marketplace (Johar &amp; Pham, 1999; Pham &amp; Johar, 2001). Two sets of experiments are reported. Experimental Set One is composed of five cued recall experiments and assesses the applicability of using an item and relational information framework with respect to awareness related sponsorship outcomes. In addition to manipulating brand-event congruence and type of supplementary sponsor information within each experiment, direction of cueing (event cue with brand target, brand cue with event target), competitor brand presence, and type of competitor brand information are manipulated across experiments. This set of experiments demonstrates general support for using an item and relational information framework in sponsorship; congruence effects are consistently found, relational information is shown to facilitate both brand recall and event recall, and item information is shown to facilitate brand recall when competitor brands are not present in the sponsorship context. An unintended item information manipulation also demonstrates the value of providing event-contextualised brand-specific item information. Relational information is shown to increase erroneous recall (in the form of incorrect intrusions from other brands, and recall of events to competitor brands) while item information appears to help limit erroneous recall. The findings fall short of fitting entirely within an item and relational information framework in that differential sponsor information effects for each level of brand-event congruence are not observed in every experiment, and in that the intended item information manipulation does not consistently facilitate cued recall performance. These shortcomings however, provide insight into basic item and relational information ideas when elaborate stimuli are employed, and when cued recall is used as the dependent measure. The results additionally demonstrate that cueing direction is an important influence which should be considered when evaluating sponsorship awareness effects. Further, it is shown that competitor presence in the sponsorship environment may not impact overall levels of correct recall for sponsors and events, although competitor presence may increase incorrect recall of non-sponsor brands to event cues, and recall of events to non-sponsor brand cues. Experimental Set Two is composed of two experiments and was designed to determine if and how the item and relational information framework might generalise to non-awareness related sponsorship outcomes (namely attitude toward the brand and brand purchase intent). Here again, brand-event congruence and type of supplementary sponsor information are manipulated within each experiment, and competitor brand presence is manipulated across experiments. Results show that the item and relational information framework is not directly generalisable to predicting non-awareness related sponsorship outcomes, but that it does provide value by highlighting the need to consider differences in the types of communications sponsors employ (especially when seeking to promote the brand-event relationship using relational information). The experiments demonstrate that sponsors tend to fare better than competitors regardless of whether the competitor is named in the context of the sponsorship, and that brand-event congruence makes no overall difference to attitudinal and purchase intent ratings (in contrast to what is often reported in the literature). Additionally, the results suggest that attitudinal and purchase intent sponsorship outcomes may potentially be moderated by inferred sponsor motives and mediated by perceptions of sponsorship exploitation (derived from the presence of competitors in the sponsorship environment). These suggestions are however more speculative. The research adds to the sponsorship literature by providing an explanation of the possible cognitive processes involved when people encounter commercial sponsorship communications, most specifically with respect to awareness related sponsorship outcomes. It additionally demonstrates that sponsorship can be a useful applied context in which theoretical memory ideas can be tested and refined. That is, sponsorship offers an alternative to using single word and word pair stimuli in memory research, where manipulation of important variables is nonetheless possible, and where presentation of stimuli can be both incidental and intentional. Future research directions for an item and relational information framework as applied to sponsorship are suggested, together with research aimed at further testing basic item and relational information ideas.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350204 Marketing and Market Research</field><field name="subject">380108 Industrial and Organisational Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:134433</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bronchoscopy and Airway Disorders in Children</field><field name="creator">Masters, Ian Brent</field><field name="description">Tracheobronchial structural lesions present a considerable diagnostic challenge and workload to tertiary paediatrics. Bronchoscopy is the definitive way of confirming these diagnoses. Quantification of the size of lesions is important to the decision-making processes for management, yet this aspect of assessment has been left to subjective visual estimates of the size as there has not been a method developed that enabled quantitative measurement. The clinical profiles of children with these disorders have long been suspected to be worse than respiratory illnesses in normal children however this aspect has never been studied using objective criteria. The major hypothesis of this thesis is that structural lesions such as malacia disorders of the tracheobronchial tree result in significant respiratory morbidity that is a result of dose dependent crossectional area losses in lesions which improve with increasing age and management strategies. The aims of this thesis were i. to develop a methodology for objectively quantifing airway lesions using a paediatric bronchoscope ii. establish a cohort of children with airway lesions and quantitatively define the airway lesions and then longitudinally study these lesions and the respiratory illness profiles using validated scales of illness over a 2 year period.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="subject">321018 Otorhinolaryngology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:134437</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Happy Together: The Family in Australian Drama since 1975</field><field name="creator">Gunn, Ian Campbell</field><field name="description">This study analyses the role of the family as a metaphorical, thematic and structural device within the field of recent Australian drama. The family, as presented by Australian dramatists, is fragmented and incoherent. The impossibility to forge coherence is linked directly to the circumstances of contemporary Australia&#8217;s genesis as a colonial and postcolonial society, and the subsequent encouragement of a monolithic national culture through the conscious and unconscious suppression of alternative voices and histories. As a site of hierarchical power, the family supplies a convenient trope for the justification of particular paradigms of cultural dominance. At the same time, however, family is also a potent source of identity, and therefore becomes an important site of cultural recuperation as well. Consequently, it is a central assumption of this thesis that the familial context, as deployed by Australian dramatists, is both ambivalent and politically freighted. Performance plays a critical role in &#8216;liberating&#8217; occluded and pathologised subjectivities from ideological exile and challenging embedded power structures. By its very nature, performance resists conscription into the totalising project that aims to validate the dominant culture&#8217;s hegemonic position. By embodying and reclaiming experience, all performance becomes political to some extent, and therefore intrinsically subversive; the resultant enactment of alternative histories not only serves to interrogate the hegemonic culture, but also empowers those &#8216;communities of silence&#8217; rendered powerless under its discursive weight. The notion of family carries with it numerous attendant images including those of &#8216;home&#8217; and &#8216;the child&#8217;. The fragmentary nature of the Australian dramatic family both complicates, and is complicated by, notions of home. So too do issues of familial succession and national capital surface to problematise concepts of childhood and establish it as a site of deep social and cultural anxiety. While this study is primarily concerned with the broader topic of family in recent Australian drama, it is the recurring figure of the child as the focus of the family, along with connected concepts of home and nation &#8211; family&#8217;s discursive parallel &#8211; that ultimately provides this study&#8217;s unifying thrust. This study covers the approximate period from 1975 to 2005, from the commencement of what is often termed the &#8216;New Wave&#8217; of Australian drama, when smaller local companies and emerging dramatists began to gain an artistic credibility and popularity that would influence the conception and reception of subsequent drama. Some twenty-three works are considered in depth in this study, spread across four specific foci that contextualise the family thematic: &#8216;big house&#8217; drama, which encompasses plays by Alex Buzo, Louis Nowra, Stephen Sewell and Beatrix Christian; Aboriginal theatre, which includes works by Robert Merritt, Jack Davis, Jane Harrison, Wesley Enoch and Deborah Mailman, and Scott Rankin and Leah Purcell; the drama of abject and appropriated youth, which examines selected works by Matt Cameron, Alison Lyssa, Michael Gow and Nick Enright; and the theatre of the displaced, which focuses on plays by Tes Lyssiotis, Ben Ellis and Christine Evans, as well as &#8216;autobiographical&#8217; stories written and performed by Dina Panozzo and Anna Yen and &#8216;verbatim&#8217; pieces dramatised by the activist theatre companies Sidetrack and version 1.0. The works considered in this study therefore represent a range of performance styles, forms and methodologies, in keeping with the overall dramatic tenor of the period.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410102 Drama, Theatre and Performance Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:134439</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cardiovascular Risk and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Indigenous Australians</field><field name="creator">Chan, Lionel C. K.</field><field name="description">Coronary heart disease is the single greatest contributor to mortality within developed countries in our time. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, both of which are potent risk factors for coronary heart disease, are common conditions with rapidly rising rates of prevalence both globally and in Australia. Within Australia, Indigenous Australians suffer from disproportionately high rates of diabetes, obesity and coronary heart disease, the reason for which lies, in part, with changes in dietary intake and decreased levels of physical activity over the past 200 years. These disease trends have led to a substantially reduced life expectancy from an increase in excess cardiovascular deaths in Indigenous Australians. Assessment of cardiovascular risk in Indigenous Australians is complicated by ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk factors and their prevalence. There is also evidence that Indigenous Australians are genetically predisposed to diabetes. Current cardiovascular risk stratification algorithms are suboptimal, significantly underestimating risk in Indigenous Australians. This thesis aimed to address these issues. Firstly, to evaluate the efficacy of a lifestyle intervention programme to sustainably improve markers of health outcome in a cohort of Indigenous Australians who were overweight or had type 2 diabetes mellitus by improving diet and physical activity levels. Secondly, to evaluate the utility of anthropometric markers of obesity, ultrasound markers of atherosclerotic burden and serum C-reactive protein as additional cardiovascular risk stratification tools. The Healthy Lifestyle Programme (HELP) was a two year prospective intervention study designed and implemented with substantial input from the Indigenous community. The primary intervention consisted of a series of educational workshops delivered predominantly by Indigenous health workers advocating improving diet and increasing physical activity. To complement these workshops, facilities were established within the community to support dietary improvement and increased physical activity. Sustainable changes to markers of cardiovascular outcome, including significant reductions in central obesity and blood pressure were demonstrated over time. A slowing in the deterioration of renal function as marked by albuminuria was also detected. These beneficial changes were accompanied by increased physical activity and improved dietary intake. In a substudy, individuals with the apolipoprotein E4 genotype, who were dyslipidaemic at baseline, benefited from lipid profiles that improved significantly during the course of the study. Changes in blood pressure and central obesity detected during the course of the project are likely to have significant clinical impact on health outcomes considering their sustained nature. Evaluating ultrasound imaging based markers of cardiovascular risk, carotid artery intimal medial thickness was a more reliable measure of risk based on its firm correlation with established cardiovascular risk factors compared to brachial artery flow mediated vasodilatation. Carotid artery intimal medial thickness may be the better surrogate marker to improve cardiovascular risk stratification in the Indigenous population. Examining anthropometric markers of obesity, body mass index and waist circumference but not waist hip ratio correlated well with traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, both body mass index and waist circumference predicted insulin resistance fairly well using threshold values derived from receiver operating characteristics curve analyses. Both body mass index and waist circumference were simple to perform with a high degree of reproducibility between observers and will likely be valuable additional cardiovascular risk stratification tools. Raised inflammatory stress, as marked by elevated serum C-reactive protein levels, was found in individuals with diabetes or obesity. C-reactive protein levels did not correlate with carotid artery intimal medial thickness, suggesting that C-reactive protein raises cardiovascular risk by means other than increasing atherosclerotic burden. Genotyping a small random sample of our the C-reactive protein gene promoter region. This SNP was found to independently increase serum C-reactive protein in the Framingham cohort. A genetic basis for increased inflammatory stress may contribute to coronary heart disease in Indigenous Australians. In summary, a community centred lifestyle intervention programme was efficacious in producing sustainable improvement in markers of health outcome. Examination of additional cardiovascular risk markers in the Indigenous community have provided evidence for using carotid artery intimal medial thickness, waist circumference, body mass index and serum C-reactive protein levels to improve cardiovascular risk stratification. These additional tools would allow for more specific resource allocation to target individuals at highest cardiovascular risk for preventative management. C-reactive protein gene polymorphisms, their contribution to circulating C-reactive protein levels and cardiovascular outcomes warrants further investigation in the Indigenous population. A more proactive risk management plan, which includes a lifestyle intervention component, may yield the greatest improvement in long term health outcomes if targeted at younger members of the Indigenous community.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321003 Cardiology (incl.

The overall incidence of poverty fell from 60 per cent in 1985/86 to 30 per cent in 2002/03 (Central Statistics Office Botswana 2004). Rural poverty declined from 55 per cent in 1985/86 to 40 per cent in 1992/93. However, the incidence of rural poverty rose to 45 per cent in 2002/03 (Central Statistics Office Botswana 2004). An increased record of rural poverty compared to declining records in non rural poverty during the last decade prompted the current study to investigate the factors that contribute to the contradictory results in Botswana. Theoretically, Botswana appears as a dual economy (Hirschman 1958) when in practice, it is not. The rural economy is linked to the modern economy through government spending policy, migrant remittances, and the rural development policy. Therefore, rural economy in Botswana benefits directly from sustained economic growth. The cost of basic needs method and the mean income poverty line are applied in this thesis. Two subjective measures of poverty were adopted from Firdausy and Tisdell (1992), and Pradhan and Ravallion (2000) to explore whether they might be reliable low cost rural poverty indicators. In addition, economic deprivation is measured and results provide a basis to examining how future policies of redistribution can influence poverty reduction. The results are based on the case study of Nshakazhogwe village in rural north east Botswana of September-November 2005. This village was purposively chosen as a representative cluster and a face-to-face personal interview of all heads of household data collection method was used. The results show that women are overrepresented as heads of household which is common in Botswana (Quisumbing et al. 2001; Rosenhouse 1989). Botswana has an equal opportunity policy across gender (Ministry of Labour and Home Affairs 1995) and it has been found that female heads of households are common in other countries where opportunities to education and work for women are similar to men&#8217;s (Schultz 2001). The results indicate that the village characteristics are comparable to those of the rural north east Botswana region (Central Statistics Office 2007; Central Statistics Office Botswana 2001a; Central Statistics Office Botswana 2004), which means this village is typical for the region. The incidence of poverty at Nshakazhogwe is 29 per cent, which is lower than 45 per cent for all rural areas. The Lorenz curve analysis shows that the income share of the bottom 20 per cent share of the population is 2.7 per cent whereas the income share of the top 20 per cent share of the population is 65 per cent. The income inequality measure using the Gini index is 60 per cent which is comparable to Botswana Gini index in 2002/03 but less than the Gini index for the whole of Africa or the global Gini index. The results of application of subjective question of whether household heads believe their household belongs to the bottom 20 per cent less well-off household reveal that 42 per cent households reported positively, implying they were in poverty, which is a clear overestimate. However, the result is comparable to national rural poverty of 45 per cent using the mean income method (Central Statistics Office Botswana 2004). The results using a consumption adequacy method is 37 per cent, which is comparable to the rural north east region poverty rate (Central Statistics Office 2007). Overall, subjective measures used in this study are reliable indicators in distinguishing the well-off from the less well-off. The significance of this finding is that, if applied in rural Botswana, it might contribute to quicker, relevant and appropriate responses to poverty rural problems. Further research is required to verify the results of this study. Income transfers are very important at Nshakazhogwe. More poor households than non-poor households receive private transfers, whereas the relative frequency of poor households that receive government transfers is comparable to not poor households. Livestock, natural resource harvesting and crop production are not indicated frequently as sources of household income. Future research should investigate the target efficiency of government transfers and the relative benefits of individuals from each source of income in rural areas. Potential policy implications of this study are an increase in availability and regularity of reliable poverty indicators and an improvement of targeting efficiency of government welfare.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">340201 Agricultural Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:134448</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">POPULATION STRUCTURE AND RESOURCE PARTITIONING AMONG CARCHARHINIFORM SHARKS IN MORETON BAY, SOUTHEAST QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Stephen Taylor</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:134463</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combtoothed blenny, Salarias fasciatus is a functional herbivore and possibly influences coral spat survival on coral reef substrata at Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia</field><field name="creator">Christiansen, Nicole Aline</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:134473</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moral limits of violence, war and revolution : a Sartrean analysis and response</field><field name="creator">Sze, Jennifer Ang Mei</field><field name="description">With &#8216;violence&#8217; as a dominant concept in his politics, 9/11 revived interest in Jean-Paul Sartre&#8217;s work, renewing concerns over his justifications for the use of violence and the &#8216;terrorist&#8217; nature of his writings. While I find the post-9/11 New Orleans discussion1 constructive in asking how Sartre can justify violence without disparaging humanity, I think it is equally important to ask why violence is unjustified when it can put an end to a situation that disparages humanity. This is because our post-9/11 world essentially demands a distinction be made between different projects of violence given that all perpetrators claim to carry out violence in the name of &#8216;freedom&#8217; and &#8216;justice&#8217;. From this perspective, this thesis reconstructs a &#8216;violent Sartre&#8217; as one who is concerned with the latter aspect of the debate &#8211; establishing the situations and conditions that make violence excusable, and distinguishing the types and kinds of violence that are morally tolerable according to their causes and consequences. In other words, it is a Sartre who understood the inevitability of &#8216;dirty hands&#8217;, more concerned with the pertinent issue of containing violent means within morally excusable limits than the justification of violence. I take into consideration only his published and unpublished philosophical works, leaving out literary plays and novels as I adopt an analytic approach to demonstrate the contribution from the reconstructed existential Sartre to the traditionally analytic topic of violence, war and revolution. 2 Broadly, I reconstruct a &#8216;violent Sartre&#8217; in three stages. The first stage establishes a framework that consists of a reinterpretation of Sartre&#8217;s main methodologies &#8211; phenomenology, dialectics and existential humanist ethics &#8211; based on his existential humanism. This in turn leads to a reinterpretation of some key concepts, discussed in chapters one and two. In re-reading Sartre&#8217;s ontology, politics and ethics, I reconstruct a conservative version of the &#8216;violent Sartre&#8217; as one who does not subscribe to hostility between subjects as an ontological condition but sees them as ethical and political choices made in concrete situations. In the process, I engage with the versions of a &#8216;violent Sartre&#8217; suggested by Hannah Arendt, Raymond Aron, Ronald Santoni, Thomas Anderson, and Ronald Aronson. Building on this framework, the second stage outlines Sartre&#8217;s phenomenological concept of &#8216;violence&#8217; in his ontology from Being and Nothingness and the Critique of Dialectical Reason in chapter three. It also discusses his politics of violence situated in concrete situations in namely, his preface to The Wretched of the Earth, Between Existentialism and Marxism, and Colonialism and Neo-colonialism in chapter four. I reconstruct a &#8216;violent Sartre&#8217; as one that does not consider ontological intersubjective human reality to be a hostile Hegelian &#8216;being-for-other&#8217; relation but rather, a non-hostile Heideggerian &#8216;being-with-others&#8217; relation. Further, this reconstructed &#8216;violent Sartre&#8217; is one that considers hostile concrete relations as the choice to dominate and deny the freedom of others, which is an ethical consideration rather than an ontological condition. This is supported by his ethics in Notebooks for an Ethics and the &#8220;1964 Rome Lecture Notes&#8221; which were responses to situations of violence in his politics. The discussion in these two chapters engages with the interpretations of Santoni, Aron, Anderson and Aronson as well as contemporary definitions of violence such as those presented by Charner Perry, Robert Paul Wolff and Newton Garver. The distinction between the circumstances in which the use of violence is excusable, and the types and kinds of violent means that are permissible form the concerns of the final stage of this thesis. Chapters five and six demonstrate how the reconstructed &#8216;violent Sartre&#8217; rejects terrorist tactics by firstly, clarifying his concept of &#8216;terror-fraternity&#8217; in the Critique of Dialectical Reason, and secondly, re-interpreting his preface to The Wretched of the Earth and commentary on the 1972 Munich Olympic tragedy. I also defend the reconstructed &#8216;violent Sartre&#8217; as one who advocates the moral efficacy of humanist ends in guiding violent political action in revolutions in Notebooks for an Ethics and the &#8220;1964 Rome Lecture Notes&#8221; against criticisms raised by Santoni and Aron. Lastly, I outline his ethics in his politics by firstly, interpreting Sartrean ethics as consistent throughout &#8220;Existentialism is a Humanism&#8221;, Notebooks for an Ethics and the &#8220;1964 Rome Lecture Notes&#8221; and secondly, positioning his ethics as the reasons for revolutionary political action as the appropriate response to terrorism and the &#8216;war on terror&#8217;. 1 &#8220;The New Orleans session &#8211; March 2002&#8221; in Sartre Studies International, 9.2, Dec 2003, pp. 9 &#8211; 18. This was a conference was held to evaluate the &#8220;violent Sartre&#8221; in the aftermath of 9/11. The opinions of notable Sartrean scholars, namely, Ronald Aronson, Ronald E. Santoni, and Robert Stone were recorded. 2 Although literature is one of the main modes of delivery for an existential philosopher, I am not considering them in this thesis because firstly, they function as social commentaries that aim to galvanize social movements. This may lend itself to exaggeration - to produce rhetorical effects to arouse public emotions - and may not be an accurate representation of the writer's (Sartre) philosophical position. Moreover, they are mediums that perform other functions (such as artistic presentations) that might complicate our understanding of the political argument of Sartre the philosopher. Instead, my interpretation of Sartre&#8217;s philosophy aims at situating him in his historical and political context by making references to his interviews where appropriate. Secondly, the ethical motivation behind political action for Sartre is set within the context of ontology of freedom in the human condition, and applied to his leftist politics and socialist morality. His literary works do not contain sufficient philosophical grounding.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:134997</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topics in Quasistationarity for Markov Chains</field><field name="creator">Nicholas Denman</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135044</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interpreting Residence Time Distributions in Water Treatment Systems</field><field name="creator">Jansons, Ketah</field><field name="description">This thesis establishes residence time distribution (RTD) as a key tool for the investigation of water treatment systems. RTD software for tracer data modelling and interpretation is developed and validated for problem solving purposes in water treatment systems. The technique focuses on the systematic interpretation of RTD data using a tanks-in-series based model and an indicator, flushing time (tf ). This approach removes the subjectivity often associated with RTD interpretation and is tested extensively using experimental and numerical data. The influence of design elements, intended to enhance hydraulic efficiency, is also addressed. For this purpose, both numerical modelling (Mike 21) and the proposed approach are employed. Results reveal that the interpretive provides valuable information, facilitating a greater understanding of the hydraulic effects of changes to geometry and inlet/outlet configuration than other techniques alone. The approach was shown to be particularly successful at interpreting RTD curves from stormwater treatment systems due to their susceptibility to stagnation. However, it was shown to have limited applicability in systems with complex flow characteristics (such as large bioreactor vessels) or those susceptible to extensive short-circuiting.

While the benefits of quantum information processing are well understood in theory, it remains a formidable challenge to experimentally implement even simple quantum information processing tasks. Numerous physical architectures have been proposed for preparing and coherently manipulating quantum information. Amongst these, quantum optics has been identified as a particularly promising candidate. In particular this arises from the long decoherence times of single photon states, which can be used to encode logical qubits in a variety of ways. Nonetheless, there remain formidable challenges to implementing large scale quantum information processing using optical qubits. Most notably these include: the preparation of pure indistinguishable photons; efficient number-resolving photo-detection; mode-matching; photon loss; and the non-determinism of entangling gates. Any future large scale implementation of optical quantum information processing protocols will require significant advances on most, if not all these fronts. In this thesis we aim to present a comprehensive overview of the major requirements for optical quantum information processing, understand the effects they have, and how they can be modeled. From this we aim to understand what the realistic technological requirements are to achieve scalable optical quantum information processing, and, where possible, suggest means by which to help achieve these goals.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135054</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactions between scleractinian coral morphology and light</field><field name="creator">Kaniewska, Paulina</field><field name="description">The success of scleractinian corals can be attributed to a symbiotic relationship between the coral animal and a unicellular photosynthetic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium. The ability of the coral-symbiont to form highly complex aragonite structures provides the framework for coral reefs and habitat for a diverse range of marine organisms. Due to the photosynthetic nature of this symbiosis, light is an important resource for reef-building corals. The marine light environment can be highly variable and corals similar to terrestrial plants have adopted a range of photoacclimatory mechanisms. These can range from pigment concentration and cell density manipulation to polyp behaviour, tissue retraction and expansion, as well as interaction with skeletal properties. Intra-specific phenotypic plasticity is a common trait among scleractinian corals. Biomechanical and physiological photoacclimatory mechanisms have been studied to some detail, while there is less information on photoacclimatory morphological adaptations at the colony level. This project focused on unravelling photoacclimatory mechanisms, involving changes in colony morphology for branching reef-building corals. Changes in simple morphological parameters for Acropora humilis and Stylophora pistillata across a depth gradient with ambient flow and light conditions varying, were investigated. For both branching species changes in colony morphology resulted in optimization of within-colony surface irradiances. Exploring variability in coral surface irradiances, across colonies of Acropora humilis, along a depth gradient revealed bathymetric differences. Within-colony heterogeneity of surface irradiance correlated with variability in photosynthetic activity at the coral surface. Although overall colonies at shallower depths (5 m) had greater photosynthetic performance compared to colonies in the deep (18 m), morphological variation maximised energy acquisition. Actual irradiance levels reaching the photosynthetic Symbiodinium were investigated for two coral species of varying colony growth forms, one branching Stylophora pistillata and one massive Lobophyllia corymbosa, at 5 m. High light attenuation was observed for both species and they had similar within tissue irradiances. For Stylophora pistillata high light attenuationwas observed at the colony level, as a result of branch to branch self shading, while in Lobophyllia corymbosa high light attenuation was occurring within the coral tissue. To explore environmental cues affecting branch initiation, the beginning of morphological change in branching corals, axial polyp development in Acropora pulchra was investigated. Both aquaria and field experiments revealed that light was an important factor in axial polyp differentiation. Axial polyp structures would only develop above a light intensity threshold and with the presence of light from the blue wavelength spectrum. In order to gain a further understanding into possible molecular mechanisms responsible for axial polyp development, gene expression differences were explored between axial and radial polyps. Several putative genes were isolated, and their homologies indicate that a negative feedback mechanism may be involved in axial polyp differentiation. Successful identification of genes in a genomic library provides possibilities of future work characterizing genes and promoter regions. The results of this project have revealed how phenotypic plasticity associates with branching reef-building corals acclimating to light. The present study has identified the irradiance levels reaching the photosynthetic unit as opposed to the more normally measured ambient irradiances. Molecular mechanisms for branch initiation in response to environmental cues appear to play important roles in modifying these irradiances and thereby represent another set of strategies for branching scleractinian corals to acclimate to marine light fields.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135057</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Going Organic: What factors influence the decisions of farmers and consumers to enter the organic industry and how can these be used to develop organic friendly policies?</field><field name="creator">Rahayu, Nur Hygiawati</field><field name="description">The organic industry in Australia has grown from a few farmers into an established and complex system with thousands of producers. The participants in the system include producers, processors, marketers, retailers, exporters, consumers, certifiers, researchers and government institutions. Its boundary is marked by organic standards, certification and labelling. Producers are motivated to convert to organic farming, and consumers to purchase organic food, due to a mixture of tangible and intangible factors that influence their belief regarding the benefits they will obtain. However, for individual farmers, converting from conventional to organic production is often a challenging process because it requires a change in established farming practices. The burden of change is borne by farmers alone, even though many of the benefits of organic farming (such as health and environmental benefits) are enjoyed by wider society. This research examines the complex range of social, financial and environmental factors that influence farmers&#8217; perceptions of the benefits and costs of converting to organic farming, using a probabilistic model. A similar model was also developed for illustrating consumers&#8217; perceptions of the benefits and costs of purchasing organic food. The models aim to integrate the range and variability of farmer and consumer viewpoints surrounding the decision to convert, so that policy levers most likely to support the organic industry can be identified. Workshops, interviews, surveys and the findings of previous studies were used in this research to capture the key benefit and cost criteria considered by producers and consumers when deciding to adopt organic farming or food consumption. Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) were used to integrate the criteria into Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) models for comparing organic and conventional farming, and organic and nonorganic food. These models captured a variety of opinion from organic and conventional farmers, and organic and non-organic consumers, to produce a probabilistic assessment of the benefit-cost ratio of alternative farming and food consumption options. The BBN models were used to conduct sensitivity analysis to identify where policy interventions might bring about the greatest shift in the benefitcost ratio of organic farming and food consumption for producers and consumers. The research revealed that, for the certified organic farmers surveyed, intangible health and environmental benefits were greater motivations for converting to organic farming than tangible benefits such as profitability. Sensitivity analysis revealed that a shift in cost factors such as yield and price risks, certification costs, poor information availability and undeveloped market had a relatively large influence on the benefit-cost ratio associated with organic farming. Similar results from the consumer model indicated that intangible health and environmental benefits were strong motivations for frequent organic consumers to purchase organic food. However, the inconvenience of purchasing organic food and its price are still significant costs for them. The study identified some policy interventions that could have a relatively large influence on the organic sector. These were reducing yield and price risk of organic farming; streamlining the certification process to reduce costs and complexity; better provision of information on organic farming and best management practices; assisting the organic food distribution systems to improve market development and convenience of buying organic products; and increasing public awareness of the benefits of organic food production and consumption to improve the perceived value for money of organic food consumption. The BBN models developed in this study illustrate the complex mix of benefits and costs considered by farmers and consumers when choosing to enter that organic industry and offer an objective means for policy development in the industry to maintain the existing population of organic producers and consumers or attract new entrants to the organic industry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135061</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Urban Quality of Life: Linking Objective Dimensions and Subjective Evaluations of the Urban Environment</field><field name="creator">Roderick McCrea</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135065</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Information Flows within Small World Networks and the Effect on Financial Prices</field><field name="creator">Bowden, Mark P.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">340203 Finance Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135070</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiology of bud outgrowth in sugarcane</field><field name="creator">Karno</field><field name="description">Bud outgrowth plays a major role in plant productivity. In sugarcane, where yield is determined by tillering, bud outgrowth becomes critically important. The regulation of bud outgrowth has been studied intensively using branching mutants in many plants, particularly in pea and Arabidopsis. Models illustrating the nature and control of bud outgrowth have been developed accordingly. In sugarcane, in contrast, branching mutants are not yet available and studies on the regulation of bud outgrowth are limited. This thesis evaluates the agronomic importance and possible controls of bud outgrowth in sugarcane. A limited number of Australian commercial varieties for selection of high and low tillering varieties and two segregating populations were used to provide genetic variation in sugarcane. Sugarcane genotypes that show different degrees of tillering were identified. Shoot architecture components such as stalk diameter, length and weight, as well as sucrose content were analysed in the context of tillering among these genotypes (Chapter 2). Eleven sugarcane varieties with different purported tillering behaviours were collected from different regions in Queensland and grown and evaluated under varying conditions. The results showed that tillering, as expected, is modulated by both genetic and environmental factors. Tiller number was found to negatively correlate with stalk diameter and stalk weight, but had little relationship to stalk length and sucrose content. Also, early tiller numbers were found to correlate with millable stalk numbers at harvest. High (Q207A) and low (Q127) tillering varieties were utilized for further studies. More detailed analyses of the relationships between stalk traits and sugar content were performed using two segregating populations (Chapter 3) grown in two consecutive years. Siblings in each population showed large variation in tillering capability. These siblings were also used to test if sugarcane yield can be optimized by altering plant architecture traits. Several important points are highlighted in this work. Firstly, sugar content was not affected by millable stalk number at harvest. Therefore, the modification of stalk number to an optimal number could increase cane yield without adverse effects on commercial cane sugar (CCS), thus increasing sugar production. Secondly, increasing stalk diameter could increase cane yield, but may also decrease CCS. Thirdly, because stalk length is positively correlated with CCS, increasing stalk length could increase both cane yield and CCS. Under the given experimental conditions, optimum yield could be achieved by arranging a millable stalk number of approximately 20 stalks m-1. Environmental conditions greatly affect sugarcane production. The effects of temperature, photoperiod and light intensity on tillering in sugarcane were investigated and presented in Chapter 4. The results demonstrated that bud outgrowth and tillering in sugarcane were indeed modified by environmental factors. Sugarcane grown at lower temperature required less thermal time to produce a tiller, so that tillering was increased at colder temperatures (23/18oC day/night), although the plants produced less dry mass under these conditions. Vigorous plants growing at high temperatures (33/28oC) had reduced tillering and plants grown under extended photoperiods (16 h and 24 h) produced more biomass, however, tiller production was inhibited by a 24 h photoperiod. Decreasing light intensity decreased both biomass production and tiller production. Environmental factors did not mask genetic effects as in most cases, the high tillering variety consistently produced more tillers than moderate and low tillering varieties, except under low light intensity, where all varieties did not tiller. Optimum growth conditions were achieved at 28/23oC, under full light, during a 16 h photoperiod. The regulation of bud outgrowth in sugarcane was investigated by monitoring the expression of several branching genes (SoMAX2, SoMAX3, SoMAX4-1, SoMAX4-2 and SoTB1) in selected high and low tillering varieties (Chapter 5). Decapitation and low light intensity were applied to alter bud outgrowth. The results demonstrate that SoMAX4-1 is an auxin regulated gene in sugarcane. As for the homologous gene in pea, SoMAX4-1 exhibits depleted expression following decapitation, which is restored to intact levels by exogenous auxin application to the decapitated stump. However, SoMAX4-2, which is homologous to SoMAX4-1, was not responsive to auxin, suggesting that SoMAX4-2 may have other functions. It is proposed that SoMAX4-1 and SoMAX3 work cooperatively to control branching, but through different mechanisms: SoMAX4 is regulated by auxin while SoMAX3 acts independently of auxin, but is sensitive to light intensity. Expression of SoTB1, acting inside the axillary buds, also increased under low light. The results suggest that regulatory mechanisms similar to those controlling bud outgrowth in pea and Arabidopsis also exist in sugarcane. Manipulation of the expression of these genes provides a new strategy to regulate bud outgrowth that may be used in crop improvement in sugarcane.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135076</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Targeting the myofibroblast to limit renal fibrosis: a model using cancer therapies</field><field name="creator">Tao YANG</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135532</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Occupational Structure on Economic Performance in Australia</field><field name="creator">Jerome Clayton BREDT</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135540</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MUSCLE FUNCTION AND FUNCTIONAL ABILITY IN RESISTANCE TRAINED OLDER ADULTS</field><field name="creator">Timothy Henwood</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resistance training, muscle strength, muscle power, functional performance,</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135546</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FORMATIVE COPAN THE RITUAL TRANSFORMATION OF AN EARLY MESOAMERICAN COMMUNITY</field><field name="creator">Cummins, Daniel</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts - General</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135553</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Political and the Personal: Cuba&#8217;s Health Outcomes and the Social Relations Underlying Them</field><field name="creator">Elizabeth Kath</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135558</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IN THE SYSTEM BUT OUT OF PLACE Understanding Street-Frequenting Young People in Suva, Fiji</field><field name="creator">Patrick Vakaoti</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370000 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135562</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'What's wrong with being sexy?'

Environments</field><field name="creator">Sudarsanan Nesamony</field><field name="description">Recent manifestations of messaging environments are prominently in the form of RFID tags and wireless Sensor Networks. New practical applications are envisioned and the existing ones are benefitted by flexible and comfortable execution of processes, with immediate access to real data. There is a plethora of research issues from various spheres, associated with every stage of the network, from setup until maintenance. Driven by a specific Sensor Network as the motivational application, we focus on the computational aspects of setting up such a network from an algorithmic perspective, in this dissertation. The network in consideration contains stationary sensor nodes scattered in a hostile ground and a sink node equipped with mobility which is regulated to perform desired tasks like data-collection, calibration, recharging etc. over the set of sensors. Of the many associated design problems in such a setting, we specifically concentrate on computing the optimal path of the sink node in various characterisations of the application environment. Firstly, a taxonomy of shortest path problems in their abstract form derived from the application background is constructed and the generalisation relations are specified. A particular case of having k sink nodes, where k &gt; 1, is taken for consideration where they are to visit the sensors&#8217; positions to orchestrate the desired tasks. We address the problem with the objective function being minimising the longest path travelled by the sinks, bounded by application specific constraints. The problem is formulated and thoroughly analysed for the related literature and considering its intractability, certain heuristic approaches are presented for the special case consisting of two sinks. We further examine the case where the shortest path of a single mobile sink is sought, which collects data from all the positioned sensor nodes. This problem is abstracted and formalised and is identified to be a version of the TSPN problem. A regressive method to solve the problem in the general case, is constructed based on a set of developed conjectures. Two additional problems are then attended, with one being the case of the calibrating mobile sink and the other being the conceptual generalisation of both the previous and the above TSPN problem. They both are reduced to the solved TSPN problem instances. The proposed algorithms are evaluated over randomly generated dataset to test their performance and endurance. The methods are pitted against corresponding brute force methods and different approaches within the developed procedures are also compared against each another. The traditional trade off between accuracy and execution time reverberates in the observation of our results and the compromise reached by the developed procedures is very favourable. Finally, following the discussion on the generality and specificity of the studied problems, the possible extensions are highlighted which are promising enough to take the existing research forward.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:138904</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On The Construction of Braided Pre-monoidal Nonassociative Categories</field><field name="creator">Liam Wagner</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:138905</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing Agent Chip</field><field name="creator">Insu Song</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:138907</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constraint-Based Flexible Business Process Management</field><field name="creator">Lu, Ruopeng</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:138909</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Final Violin Sonatas of Beethoven and Brahms: A Consideration of the Influence of Pierre Rode and Joseph Joachim.</field><field name="creator">Cadell, Adam Broughton</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:138910</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Testosterone secretion, aggressive behaviour and the use of a GnRH agonist in male Australian sea lions.</field><field name="creator">Atkin, Cathrine L.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:138911</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Otherwise Than Being Of J.

Mathematical Conservation</field><field name="creator">Michael Bode</field><field name="description">Global conservation efforts are hampered by two fundamental limitations. First, there are not enough resources available to halt the destruction of vulnerable ecosystems, or to repair and manage those that have already been degraded. Second, the information required to inform effective conservation decisions is generally unavailable. Uncertainty surrounds the dynamics of the ecosystems themselves, the nature of the threatening processes, and the effects of conservation interventions. If conservation is to be effective, management plans must acknowledge and address these two fundamental limitations. All of the research in this thesis addresses one, or both of these limitations. In particular, each chapter focuses on the management of a conservation system using mathematical optimization techniques from the field of decision theory. A decision theory approach acknowledges the central role played by these limitations in the decision-making process - only by formally incorporating them can managers maximise the outcomes of the conservation system. In Chapters 3 &amp; 4, techniques are developed to efficiently share limited conservation resources between sets of high priority regions. The analyses in Chapter 3 apply existing allocation techniques to the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots, and assess whether further research into the global richness distribution of relatively unknown taxa is necessary for effective conservation, or whether existing information on well-known taxa is sufficient. Chapter 4 demonstrates how optimal control theory can provide optimal solutions to the resource allocation problem, and insight into the motivations behind the best resource allocation strategy. Chapter 5 outlines methods for optimally managing cycling predator-prey systems that experience stochastic fluctuations. This stochasticity affects the dynamics of both speCies, and their response to management interventions, in an unpredictable way. Despite this uncertainty, the application of suitable mathematical methods allows the development of efficient management strategies. Chapters 6 &amp; 7 focus on ecosystems that can be described as metapopulations. In particular, these chapters concentrate on the "connectivity" between the individual populations in such systems. Through a more accurate description of this connectivity, novel analytic methods described in Chapter 6 are able to rapidly estimate the viability of species existing in fragmented populations, and to identify patches with the highest conservation priority. Marine metapopulations are the focus of Chapter 7, in particular those of a threatened coral reef fish species. While connectivity is an important determinant of species' persistence, this process is surrounded by considerable uncertainty. The research outlined in this chapter circumvents this lack of information by identifying reef characteristics that, in the right circumstances, act as surrogates that can ensure demographically important connectivity is protected. The research reported in this thesis is applied to different conservation problems, and uses a range of mathematical techniques. Nonetheless, the objective in each chapter is to overcome the two fundamental limitations of conservation situations - resources and knowledge - by identifying and incorporating them into the decision-making process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:151286</field><field

majority acculturation attitudes towards Muslim Immigrants to Australia</field><field name="creator">White, Campbell John</field><field name="description">Recent geopolitical events have focused debate about immigration in Western nations on Muslim immigrants and the role of Islamic culture in these societies. Several commentators have noted that Muslims have become increasingly &#8216;othered&#8217; by the mass-media, and that Muslim culture has been portrayed as incompatible with, and a potential threat to, the dominant Western culture (Manning, 2006). In Australia, which officially adopted a policy of multiculturalism more than 40 years ago, public opinion polls suggest that while support for the policy remains strong, many believe that certain cultural groups are not compatible with Australian society (Dunn, Forrest, Burnley, &amp; McDonald, 2004). This has important implications, as recent research into acculturation preferences of dominant groups in other Western nations suggests that acceptance of cultural maintenance may not extend to cultures which are regarded as incompatible or which are perceived as threatening the cultural status quo (Florack, Piontkowski, Rohman, Balzer, &amp; Perzig, 2003; Montreuil &amp; Bourhis, 2001). This research program sought to investigate the role of perceived threat in tolerance of Muslim practice in Australia, with a focus on the impact of media portrayals. Recent research suggests that media may influence the criteria which members of dominant groups use when making decisions about acculturation practices (e.g., Domke, McCoy, &amp; Torres, 1999). In a similar vein, this research pursued an information-processing perspective, seeking to demonstrate that accessible media exemplars of Muslims in conflict with others lead those who are reliant on the mass-media to take symbolic threat into consideration when making decisions about tolerance of Muslim cultural practice. Five studies were conducted, the first three using survey methodology, and the latter two using experimental designs. Study 1 demonstrated that Australians who were more reliant on television as a source of information considered issues such as terrorism and interethnic tension more important than those who were less reliant on television and that television reliance was more strongly associated with concern about both issues than either general or genre-specific levels of television viewing, (Ball-Rokeach &amp; DeFleur, 1976; Rubin, Perse, &amp; Taylor, 1988). Study 2 demonstrated that tolerance of Muslim practice in Australia was explained largely by general attitudes to multiculturalism, but that symbolic threat played an independent role in predicting tolerance for those who were reliant on the media. Study 3 replicated this finding, and demonstrated that it was symbolic threat rather than other forms of threat identified by Stephan and Stephan&#8217;s (1996) integrated threat theory which interacted with media reliance to predict tolerance of Muslim practice. Busselle and Shrum (2003) have suggested that media influences later decision making by making relevant exemplars more accessible in memory for those who use media frequently. In Study 4 participants read a transcript of a fictitious television interview describing a conflict between Muslims and Christians in Belarus, and then recalled examples of similar events. Results indicated that media reliance was positively associated with greater recall of events involving Muslims, and negatively associated with perceived difficulty of recall, providing support for the notion that the media reliant have more accessible exemplars of Muslim conflict. Study 5 aimed to demonstrate that the accessibility of such exemplars among the media reliant is the key factor explaining the interplay between media reliance and perceived threat on tolerance of Muslim practice observed in Studies 2 and 3. It sought to do so by comparing the responses of participants who first recalled an example of either a natural disaster (the control condition) or an act of terrorism (the experimental condition designed to make salient stereotypes about Muslims). As expected, among participants for whom terrorism was not made salient, symbolic threat predicted tolerance only for those high in media reliance (who ostensibly have accessible exemplars) &#8211; consistent with the results of Studies 2 and 3. However, among participants for whom terrorism was made salient, threat predicted tolerance even among those low in media reliance. Taken together, the research provides insight into an important real-world issue, tolerance of Muslim cultural practice in Australia. It demonstrates the role of both multicultural ideology and symbolic threat and makes a unique theoretical contribution to acculturation research regarding the mechanism by which the media may influence tolerance of minorities in multicultural societies. Implications for theoretical perspectives on prejudice and discrimination and for applied concerns about promotion of community harmony are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:152710</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functionalized Mesoporous Silica for Trichoderma reesei Cellulase Immobilization</field><field name="creator">Budihartono, Sandy</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:152711</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of host factors in liver injury and non-response to antiviral therapy in patients with chronic HCV</field><field name="creator">Meagan Walsh</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:152712</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lipreading skills in children with hearing impairment</field><field name="creator">Woodhouse, Lynn Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:152713</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurement of Biomass Concentrations in Anaerobic Reactors and the Effect on Cellulose Solubilisation Rates</field><field name="creator">Jensen, Paul Douglas</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:152714</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the Epidemiology of Schizophrenia</field><field name="creator">Saha, Sukanta</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:152715</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asperger Syndrome and High Functioning Autism: Same, Different, or a Spectrum?

hippocampus</field><field name="creator">Al-Menhali, Noura Musaed</field><field name="description">Mulitpotential neural progenitor cells that can differentiate into neurons and glia underlie adult neurogenesis in the mammalian central nervous system. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate neuronal generation and survival in the adult animal. Recently, the Coulson laboratory reported that a small population of progenitor cells within a neurogenic region of the adult brain, the subventricular zone (SVZ), expresses the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). This subpopulation of cells appears to be responsible for neuronal production in both newborn and adult animals, since only p75NTR-positive, but not p75NTR-negative, progenitors produce daughter neurons in vitro, and mice lacking the p75NTR gene have reduced SVZ neurogenesis in vivo. Furthermore, only p75NTR-positive progenitor cells produce increased numbers of daughter neurons in response to the p75NTR ligand brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which has an increasing profile as a neurogenic stimulus. Building on these results, the present study aimed to determine whether p75NTR is a molecular regulator of neuronal generation and/or survival in the adult hippocampus, the other brain region where adult neurogenesis is well characterised. A role of p75NTR in neurogenesis was investigated by comparing the rates of adult hippocampal progenitor cell proliferation, neuronal differentiation and survival in p75NTR-deficient and wild-type mice. The results presented in this thesis demonstrate that basally occurring and antidepressant-stimulated hippocampal neurogenesis is impaired in mice lacking the p75NTR gene, and that this is due to the death of neuroblasts. Although the reason for reduced neuroblast survival was not resolved, evidence is presented that, by regulating cholinergic innervation from the basal forebrain to the hippocampus, p75NTR may act indirectly to influence the survival of newly born neurons. Together these results demonstrate that p75NTR is an import regulator of hippocampal neurogenesis, and that p75NTR may mediate the neurogenic effects of BDNF and/or that provided by cholinergic neurotransmission.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:154972</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing Musical Emotion through Score and Performance with a Computational Rule System</field><field name="creator">Steven R.

The impact of change on the socio-spatial structure of postmodern cities is measured, the spatial patterns are quantified and the continuing applicability of the classic models is determined. A generalised pattern of social structure in a tourist city is identified and a stage of development model of spatial patterns is proposed to promote understanding of socio-spatial structure in postmodern cities. In this analysis of social structure in the recently developed tourist city of Gold Coast, physical, economic, social and political forces were found to have created a distinctive environment, an environment that, in turn, influenced the type of social structure, the spatial patterns of social variation that emerged and how these changed over time. Principal components analysis and cluster analysis were used to identify the main dimensions of social structure and their spatial representation in this tourist city at 1991 and again in 1996. The emergence of socio-economic status and family status, albeit with a number of minor dimensions and new sub-dimensions, showed that social structure in this city was fundamentally similar to that identified earlier in modern cities. These main dimensions reflected family structure, occupational and income status, while minor dimensions were associated with ethnicity and mobility. However, some change in the dimensions was identified in this research. Socio-economic status changed most over the five-year period to reveal two new sub-dimensions of social differentiation related to employment status and employment disadvantage, while family status also split to reflect new social differences according to age. These new sub-dimensions emerged from the analysis due to their growing importance in the postmodern city. Over time, these sub-dimensions have begun to account for more of the social variation in the increasingly complex contemporary city. Together these dimensions reflect a complicated interwoven social structure in contrast to the simple patterns of social structure previously identified in modern cities. The newly identified sub-dimensions are however, able to be described in terms of the commonly recognised three main dimensions of social structure and relate to aspects of employment status, employment disadvantage and lifestyle. When comparing the spatial patterns of social structure in this city to the classic sector and zone models of the modern city, some substantial differences emerged. In modern cities, socio-economic status most commonly varied in a sectoral fashion while family status varied by zone. However, in this research, socio-economic status and family status were each found to vary in both a sectoral fashion and in a zonal pattern. In another difference to the spatial patterns of the modern city, these neat zonal patterns were further complicated by the influence of secondary nodes of activity. Three such nodes were identified. Thus, the multi-nucleated settlement pattern was seen to be exerting its own influence on socio-spatial structure resulting in a complex pattern of over-lapping zones from each node. Compared with other cities, several differences in the socio-spatial structure of Australian postmodern cities were uncovered. Ethnicity did not exert as large an influence on social structure as in American or English cities. The relatively small Australian public housing sector prevented the emergence of concentrations of this type of housing being found in this postmodern city. Similarly, edge cities and concentrations of the global elite were not identified in this setting yet are typically found in American urban areas. According to the stage of development model proposed in this research, there is a range of possibilities in the socio-spatial structure of a postmodern city. The common main dimensions of social structure are likely to be in evidence but will probably split into a number of sub-dimensions reflecting the growing complexity of social differentiation in the postmodern city, as well as each city&#8217;s particular stage of development. Other minor dimensions will reflect the characteristics of the specific city. The possibilities described in this model also extend to variations in the spatial patterns of a postmodern city. One scenario involves the expansion of an expanding urban region to gradually encompass a number of previously separated nodes. The spatial patterns uncovered in this research into a contemporary tourist city were found to revolve around a number of related, but previously separated, nodes rather than a single dominant centre. This research concluded that, in the contemporary tourist city investigated, there remained strong evidence of the social structure and spatial patterns of the modern city. However, the patterns identified appear to reflect a new level of complexity and required a combination of earlier models to effectively explain. In effect, the socio-spatial patterns are a hybrid of the old and the new. Thus, we can rightfully designate this city as postmodern.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155136</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transposon free regions in vertebrate genomes</field><field name="creator">Cas Simons</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transposons, gene regulation, chromatin, bivalent domains, TFRs, Transposon-free</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155137</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personal benefits and place attachment of visitors to four metropolitan and regional protected areas in Australia</field><field name="creator">Weber, Delene Louise</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155138</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of family factors in postpartum depression</field><field name="creator">Burns, Justin</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155139</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulators of Oxidative Stress Signalling in Plants</field><field name="creator">Nasser Sewelam</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155140</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic modelling of biological processes</field><field name="creator">Carletti, Margherita</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155141</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Angular Momentum in Optical Tweezers</field><field name="creator">Mr Simon Parkin</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155142</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Function and regulation of TLR9</field><field name="creator">Angela Trieu</field><field name="description">Macrophages, dendritic cells and B cells detect bacterial DNA containing unmethylated CpG motifs via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and respond by producing proinflammatory mediators such as IL-6, IL-12 and TNF, and upregulating cell surface expression of co-stimulatory molecules. These properties can be mimicked by synthetic oligonucleotides (ODNs) that contain an unmethylated CG dinucleotide that is flanked by appropriate 5&#8217; and 3&#8217; sequences, but other motifs in DNA can actually inhibit cellular responses to stimulatory CpG DNA. Chapter 3 aimed to characterize the inhibitory effects of different classes of inhibitory ODNs by investigating their mode of action and their specificity for TLR9 versus other TLR family members. G-rich inhibitory ODNs had the greatest specificity as TLR9 inhibitors, but these ODN also partially antagonized responses to the TLR1/2 ligand, Pam3Cys. Whilst it is well documented that TLR9 is required for anti-viral responses and is the receptor for bacterial DNA, at the commencement of this thesis no studies had assessed the function of TLR9 in bacterial infection models. Chapter 4 investigated the function of TLR9 in the macrophage response to S. typhimurium. Whilst Salmonella-induced cytokine production did not depend on TLR9, intracellular S. typhimurium bacterial loads were enhanced in TLR9-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), implying a role in the anti-microbial response. G-rich inhibitory ODN, which suppressed TLR9 signalling, also greatly enhanced intracellular bacterial loads, but intriguingly this effect was TLR9-independent. Thus, inhibitory ODNs, which have been proposed as therapeutic agents for the treatment of chronic inflammatory disease, have TLR9-independent effects that may compromise the host response to bacterial pathogens. Due to their ability to potently activate the innate immune system and direct development of the acquired response, bacterial products have therapeutic potential as vaccine adjuvants. CpG DNA has been widely pursued as a vaccine adjuvant because it activates innate immune cells, primes Th1 responses and is relatively non-toxic in vivo. The major macrophage growth factor, macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF/ CSF-1) is a potent inhibitor of TLR9 expression and CpG DNA responsiveness in mouse macrophages. Chapter 5 therefore explored the hypothesis that antagonism of CSF-1 action would enhance CpG DNA efficacy. AFS98, a monoclonal antibody against the CSF-1R, amplified TLR9 expression in CSF-1-replete BMM and amplified expression of CSF-1-repressed genes in vivo. AFS98 also amplified CpG DNA responses in vivo, although this effect was highly variable between experiments. To examine if antagonizing CSF-1 action in human cells mimics the effects that were apparent in the mouse, the regulation of TLR9 expression by CSF-1 in human monocytes and macrophages was also assessed. The effects were variable, but at least in some donors, TLR9 mRNA expression was inhibited by CSF-1 in human monocytes and during monocyte to macrophage differentiation. In summary, this thesis explored the hypotheses that TLR9 function could be manipulated for therapeutic applications and that TLR9 plays a role in the host response to bacterial pathogens.

species exposed to different salinity regimes</field><field name="creator">Amanda Twomey</field><field name="description">Plants experiencing salinity stress show reduced growth, reduced water uptake, altered plant water status and increased foliar Na+ and Cl- concentrations; however these effects vary greatly between species and genotypes. This study examined the response of four Melaleuca species, M. alternifolia Maiden &amp; Betche ex Cheel, M. bracteata F. Muell., M. cuticularis Labill. and M. uncinata R.Br., which were chosen based on the type and combination of proline and proline analogue (MP, MHP and DHP) accumulated, under varying salinity regimes. It was hypothesised that species that accumulate proline analogues (M. bracteata, M. cuticularis and M. uncinata) would be more tolerant to salinity than species that accumulate only proline (M. alternifolia), and that species with two proline analogues (M. uncinata) would be more tolerant to salinity than species that accumulate only one proline analogue (M. bracteata and M. cuticularis). Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. was included in this study as a reference species against which Melaleuca species were assessed for tolerance to salinity. Several glasshouse experiments were conducted to examine the response of plant water use, water relations, growth (Chapters 3 and 4), Na+ and Cl- concentrations (Chapter 5) and proline and proline analogue concentrations (Chapter 6) in the four Melaleuca species. During these experiments, M. cuticularis was observed to secrete salts from the stem and a further experiment was conducted to elucidate on the findings (Chapter 7). When soil salt concentrations were low and plants had an alternate less-saline water source, plant growth, plant water use and plant water status was not affected by salinity (Chapter 3). Plants continued to grow and their rate of water use was maintained, relative to the control. On the other hand, when soil salinity levels were high and plants did not have an alternate less-saline water source, the effects ofsalinity were great (Chapter 4). The rates of water use, growth and water status decreased significantly with increased salinity. Water use was most affected in M. alternifolia, M. bracteata and E. camaldulensis by salinity while M. cuticularis and M. uncinata were least affected. Plant growth was less affected by salinity than water use; M. alternifolia and E. camaldulensis were the most affected, and M. uncinata was least affected. Melaleuca alternifolia and M. cuticularis were able to maintain higher foliar relative water content (RWC) and achieved higher osmotic adjustment (1.85 and 1.25 MPa, respectively) compared to all other species. It appeared that M. alternifolia may be more conservative than M. cuticularis whereby it was able to substantially reduce its rate of water use and growth while adjusting osmotically to maintain a high RWC. On the other hand, RWC of M. bracteata, M. uncinata and E. camaldulensis decreased with increased salinity, with lower osmotic adjustment, which would most likely be the result of external salt concentrations causing an osmotic stress and plant cellular dehydration. The most tolerant species, M. cuticularis and M. uncinata, with the least reduction in water use and growth, were found to have high Na+ and Cl- content within the aerial part of the plant (at least 50% of total plant ion content) compared to other species (Chapter 5). These species appeared to preferentially accumulate salts in the leaves and stem at amounts in excess of all other species suggesting that these species can cope with high internal Na+ and Cl- concentrations. Salt secretion from the stem of M. cuticularis, which was observed to occur in all experiments, may be another mechanism by which this species is able to tolerate salinity. Melaleuca bracteata, which was considered to be moderately tolerant to salinity, was able to retain a greater amount of Na+ within the roots (77% on a whole plant basis) than in the leaves and stem, at low soil salinity concentrations, thus being more efficient atexclusion than all other species, but when salinity stress increased in Experiment 3, the ability of the roots to retain Na+ was not as effective. Melaleuca alternifolia and E. camaldulensis, which were both considered to be salt sensitive compared to other species, due to a high level of salt toxicity, were not efficient at either Na+ or Cl- exclusion at the root or tissue tolerance within the leaves. Proline and proline analogue (MP, MHP and DHP) concentrations (Chapter 6) in all species increased with increased salinity when soil salinity concentrations were high (Chapter 4) with proline contributing more to osmotic adjustment than proline analogues. Proline accumulation was correlated with changes in osmotic potential (&#960;100), Na+ and Cl- ions and an association was found where it may act as an antioxidant protecting lipid membranes from oxidation caused by salinity. Only certain proline analogues were found to correlate with &#960;100, (MHP in M. bracteata and DHP in M. uncinata), Na+ (MHP in M. uncinata) and Cl- (DHP in M. uncinata) and MHP was only found to have an association as an antioxidant against lipid peroxidation. In conclusion, this study improved our understanding of the response of Melaleuca species to salinity and found that species accumulating proline analogues were more able to tolerate salt stress through the observed lower level of reduction in plant water use and plant growth. While all species were able to exclude salts at the root to a similar degree, the most tolerant species had the greatest amount of Na+ and Cl- within the leaves, suggesting high level of compartmentation, and secretion in M. cuticularis, rather than a high level of exclusion as a contributing factor for salt tolerance. Further investigation of the role of MP, MHP and DHP in Melaleuca species under salinity stress is required.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155202</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gametocytogenesis in Plasmodium falciparum</field><field name="creator">Mr Matthew William Alfred Dixon</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155210</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of incubation temperature on morphology and locomotor performance of loggerhead turtle hatchlings (Caretta caretta) at Mon Repos, Australia</field><field name="creator">Cuong The Chu</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155213</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the role of hepatic progenitor cells and the ductular reaction in chronic liver injury in adults, children and post-transplantation</field><field name="creator">Michelle Richardson</field><field name="description">Among subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the subgroup with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is at increased risk of developing progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis. Perisinusoidal fibrosis is well documented and is considered a feature of low stage NASH, but portal fibrosis is a feature in patients with advanced disease. In addition, the pattern of fibrosis in paediatric NASH is predominately portal, and often observed in the absence of perisinusoidal fibrosis. Isolated portal fibrosis has also been observed in rare cases of adult NASH. A correlation between severity of fibrosis and grade of steatosis has been documented in patients with chronic hepatitis C. These observations suggest that steatosis or factors associated with increased body mass index (BMI) may contribute to development of portal fibrosis in some chronic liver diseases, however the mechanisms remain uncertain. Hepatic progenitor cells (HPC) play an important role in regenerating the liver when mature hepatocytes are incapable of self-renewal. We hypothesised that proliferative blockade in steatotic hepatocytes stimulates a second regenerative pathway, causing the expansion of HPC capable of differentiating into both hepatocytes and bile ductules, and that the resultant ductular reaction (DR) promotes portal fibrosis. We recently showed strong correlations supporting this hypothesis in hepatitis C and this thesis aims to explore the hypothesis in adult and paediatric NASH. The transplanted liver is exposed to a variety of insults that could potentially impair hepatocyte-mediated regeneration and stimulate expansion of HPC. The role of progenitor cell expansion in the post-transplant setting remains relatively unexplored. A second aim of this thesis was to examine progenitor cell expansion and the DR in a cohort of adult and paediatric liver transplant recipients, and analyse these variables with respect to transplant outcome. (i) Biopsies from 107 subjects with NAFLD and 11 controls were immunostained for cytokeratin-7 (CK7) to quantify the DR and HPC, and for p21 to assess hepatocyte replicative arrest. x Patients with NAFLD had expansion of HPC, with a strong association between HPC and the DR (rs=0.582, p&lt;0.0001). In those with NASH (n=69) there was an increased DR compared with simple steatosis, which correlated with the stage of fibrosis (rs=0.510, p&lt;0.0001). The DR increased with the grade of NASH activity (rs=0.478 p&lt;0.0001), grade of portal inflammation (rs=0.445, p&lt;0.0001) and extent of hepatocyte replicative arrest (rs=0.446, p&lt;0.0001). Replicative arrest was in turn associated with insulin resistance (rs=0.450, p&lt;0.0001) and NASH activity (rs=0.452, p&lt;0.0001). By multivariate analysis, extent of DR (OR=17.9, p=0.016), hepatocyte ballooning (OR=8.1, p&lt;0.0001) and portal inflammation (OR=3.3, p=0.005) were independently associated with fibrosis. (ii) Liver biopsies before and after treatment of NAFLD with rosiglitazone or bariatric surgery were studied to determine changes in the DR and HPC, and changes in histological parameters including fibrosis. There was no change in the DR or HPC for the treated cohort as a whole. However in the group of patients with portal fibrosis (NASH stage 2 or greater), there was a significant reduction in both the DR (p=0.036) and HPC (p=0.008). This was accompanied by a reduction in grade of steatosis (p&lt;0.0001), activity (p&lt;0.0001), portal and lobular inflammation (p=0.012 and p&lt;0.001 respectively) and stage of fibrosis (p&lt;0.001). (iii) Biopsies from 48 paediatric subjects with NAFLD were immunostained for CK7 and p21. There was a strong association between HPC and the DR (rs=0.788, p&lt;0.0001). Both the DR and HPC numbers were significantly increased in subjects with portal fibrosis (p&lt;0.001 for each). By multivariate analysis, portal and lobular inflammation (OR=17.8, p=0.002 and OR=10.2, p=0.003 respectively) and HPC numbers (OR=1.3, p=0.012) were independently xi associated with stage of fibrosis. There was minimal hepatocyte replicative arrest in paediatric subjects with NAFLD, however when present, replicative arrest was positively associated with grade of DR (rs=0.421, p=0.051), BMI z-score (rs=0.482, p=0.043), and histological indices of disease severity including stage of fibrosis (rs=0.567, p=0.006). (iv) Biopsies from subjects with NAFLD (n=17) and HCV (n=6) were immunostained for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), transforming growth factor-H1 (TGF-H1), plateletderived growth factor B (PDGFB), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) and osteopontin to examine protein expression within the bile duct epithelium. Biopsies from subjects with HCV were also examined by in situ hybridisation for mRNA expression of MCP-1, TGF-H1 and PDGFB. All proteins were localised to the biliary epithelium, although localisation was not always exclusive to this site. In situ hybridisation for MCP-1, TGF-H1 and PDGFB was unable to confirm mRNA expression in the biliary epithelium. In addition, for most of these factors, protein expression was observed in equal or greater abundance within hepatocytes. Similar levels of hepatocyte expression were often observed in non-diseased liver also, suggesting that the ductular reaction is not a uniquely important source of these proteins in patients with HCV and NAFLD. (v) Multiple biopsies from 42 paediatric liver transplant recipients (n=195) and 15 adult liver transplant recipients (n=68) were immunostained for CK7. Intermediate hepatobiliary cells (IHBCs) were significantly over-represented in grafts from subjects that had or later developed chronic allograft rejection (CR, p&lt;0.0001, 45.5% versus 13.7%). The presence of IHBCs in biopsies without CR was associated with pathologies that typically exhibit features of ischemia. In subjects with CR, xii there was no association between the DR and IHBCs, or the DR and grade of fibrosis. Grafts with CR had significantly reduced grade of DR (median=1 and 1.5 respectively, p&lt;0.0001), supporting previous observations of reduced progenitor cell expansion in subjects with CR. (vi) Development of a 2-step model for studying chronic injury and regeneration in NASH was initiated. The effects of a single intraperitoneal injection of J-galactosylceramide in combination with either a high-fructose (60%) or control diet was examined in C57/Bl6J mice (n=48). Alpha-galactosylceramide was administered at a dose of either 1.00, 0.25 or 0.05 Lg per mouse. Saline was administered as a control. The optimal dose for producing a moderate hepatitis that persisted over the 1 week follow-up period was 0.25 Lg. Additional experiments to evaluate the efficacy of a high fructose diet for inducing steatosis were prematurely terminated because of a faulty batch of animal diet. Preliminary data collected prior to administration of the faulty diet indicated that the high fructose diet did not reliably induce steatosis within a 14 week period. These results suggest that in NASH an altered replication pathway promotes a periportal DR. The DR and HPC may in turn provoke progressive periportal fibrogenesis. The ductular reaction does not appear to be the primary source of MCP-1, TGF-H1, PDGFB, CTGF, TNF- and osteopontin in patients with HCV and NAFLD, and further investigation into potential mechanisms whereby the DR or HPC promote fibrogenesis are warranted. These results also highlight possible pathways of injury and repair following liver transplant and provide a basis for future studies to develop an animal model of NASH.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155216</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alcohol consumption in Muslim Arab and Asian samples: a test of the cognitive model</field><field name="creator">Mrs Tayyiba AlMarri</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155219</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining Newborn EEG and HRV for Automatic Seizure Detection</field><field name="creator">Malarvili Bala Krishnan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155234</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the formation of the neurosphere</field><field name="creator">Kristin Hatherley</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155235</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wheat defence responses induced by the fungal pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum</field><field name="creator">Olivia Desmond</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155236</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactions among Control Beliefs, Illness Severity, Biological Factors and a Psychological Preparation for Heart Surgery: Predictors of Health Outcomes.

The expansion tube is the only facility currently that can offer full flight property duplication at the total pressures and total enthalpies required, while maintaining correct chemical composition. Due to difficulties with short test times and unsteady flow phenomena, scramjet testing in these facilities has not been thoroughly investigated. This study examines these issues, in order to explore the practicality of testing a full &#8217;tip to tail&#8217; scramjet engine at a true flight replication condition in an expansion tube facility. An investigation was initially undertaken on the large X3 expansion tunnel facility to maximise test time and core flow, aimed at producing a 30 km altitude, Mach 10 flow condition. This was identified as the limitation point of the T4 reflected shock tunnel, which has generally been accepted to produce reliable scramjet data for propulsion tests. Using a condition that is also able to be produced in the T4 facility, will permit direct comparison of data between the two facilities in the future, providing confidence in results from expansion tube facilities. Both experimental measurements and numerical calculations showed that the limitation of the test time was due to large boundary layer growth after transition, which engulfed the entire core flow 200 &#956;s into the test time. This phenomenon is likely to affect all scramjet duplication conditions in expansion tubes, as the flow properties are conducive to boundary layer transition occurring. Two solutions where proposed and investigated in order to overcome the flow disruption caused by boundary layer transition; the use of a steady expansion nozzle at the acceleration tube exit; the use of hydrogen as an accelerator gas. Since the smaller X2 facility had a Mach 10 steady expansion nozzle and X3 was decommissioned for the free piston driver to be upgraded, the investigation was shifted to X2. Due to a restricted test time of 550 &#956;s, the static pressure of the flow condition was increased to allow a reduction in the length of the scramjet (pressure-length scaling). A combination of experimental and numerical calculations of the facility was used to define the flow properties. With the confidence of overcoming the phenomenon associated with boundary transition in the X2 facility, numerical modelling of the X3 facility with a steady expansion nozzle was then undertaken to show a 1 ms condition could be produced. Although initially promising, the hydrogen accelerator gas solution requires further investigation. A two dimensional scramjet was designed with upstream injection for testing in X2. This was a three shock inlet with a constant area combustor and a planar thrust surface. Since the flow condition involved changes in flow properties during the test time, aninvestigation of the appropriateness of a quasi steady analysis was undertaken. Using a fuel off simulation of the scramjet duct with the transient inflow properties from the X2 facility nozzle exit, the convective terms for pressure were shown to be two orders of magnitude larger than local terms indicating the dominance of the convective terms change in flow properties at any location allowing quasi-steady flow to be assumed. A normalisation procedure was developed to deal with the transient nature of the data and to accurately represent the axial progression of the gas through the duct. The numerical simulations were also used to show that both flow establishment was achieved and that impulsive starting of the intake would occur. Experimentation with the scramjet using static pressure measurements throughout the body side of the engine provided verification of supersonic combustion. This was verified by the doubling of the static pressure from the start to the end of the combustor for an air test gas, whereas with a nitrogen test gas no significant change in pressure occurred. Effects of fuel equivalence ratio, injector size and cowl position were also investigated. A net inviscid thrust was predicted, using the quasi-steady flow analysis, indicating a specific impulse of 183 s. This work provides evidence to validate the use of expansion tube facilities for experimental testing of scramjets at flight duplication conditions. Limitations due to boundary layer transition flow effects has been shown to be avoidable. Numerical simulations of the facilities showed good agreement with experimental measurements, allowing definition of freestream properties and can now be applied to further scramjet conditions with confidence. Stable, supersonic combustion was shown to be produced for these expansion tube conditions. Coupling the transient simulation of the flow condition with a numerical calculation of the fuel off experimental scramjet has been useful in both verification of the design and performance predictions. Appropriate techniques have been presented to analyse scramjet pressure and thrust measurements where transient effects are present in the freestream.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">expansion tube, scramjet, numerical simulation, experimental, transient flow, boundary</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155369</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radar Target Recognition based on Ultra Wideband Transient Electromagnetic Scattering</field><field name="creator">Antony Lui</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155370</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Use of a Self-definition Methodology for Product Development and Evolution</field><field name="creator">Mr Barry Wilks</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155372</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ultraconserved Elements and Non-coding RNAs in Mammals</field><field name="creator">Mr Stuart Stephen</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155382</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Palliative care knowledge system : a case study of Cicely Saunders' pioneering role</field><field name="creator">Whan, Peter John</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155384</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Turbulence in the Management of Health Services: Change, Inertia, Power and the Professions</field><field name="creator">Greenhill, Jennene Ann</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155387</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interrelationships between metabolic status and the onset of ovulation a puberty and postpartum in beef cattle</field><field name="creator">Dr Firooz Samadi</field><field name="description">Nutrition is known to have an important bearing on reproductive function in female cattle. Major reproductive events that are influenced by nutrition include the onset of ovulation at puberty and the resumption of ovulation postpartum. Although the impact of nutrition on reproduction in female cattle is generally recognised, information is lacking on details of the interrelationships between nutrition, metabolic homeostasis and ovarian function. This applies in particular to beef cattle maintained on subtropical pastures. The primary aim in the present thesis was to characterise the interrelationships between nutrition, metabolic homeostasis and ovarian function in Zebu (Brahman, Bos indicus) and Zebu crossbred (Droughtmaster, Brahman x Shorthorn (Bos taurs)) beef cattle in relation to the onset of ovulation at puberty (Brahman) and resumption of ovulation postpartum (Droughtmaster). In the first major study, pre-pubertal Brahman heifers were assigned to either moderate nutrition (MN, n = 11)) or improved nutrition (IN, n = 11). Supplementation with cottonseed meal and steamed flaked barley was used to ensure differences in live weight gain and body condition score (BCS) between heifers on MN and IN. Heifers were monitored at 2-week intervals for body weight, BCS and circulating concentrations of GH, IGF-1, leptin, insulin and glucose. Ovarian follicular status was recorded by ultrasonography at the same time. Liver biopsies were obtained at 8-10 weeks intervals. Faecal samples were collected at the time of liver biopsies to ascertain dietary crud protein (CP) and dry matter digestibility (DMD). Pastures were sampled on six occasions at approximately 8-10 weeks intervals to determine trace mineral content. The trace minerals of particular interest were copper (Cu), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn). Heifers on IN had greater (P &lt; 0.01) dietary CP and DMD than heifers on MN. Pasture analyses showed no differences (P &gt; 0.05) between the IN and MN for trace minerals. The analysis of liver concentrations of Cu, Mn and Zn indicated that there was no difference (P &gt; 0.5) between heifers on MN and IN. Heifers on IN had greater (P &lt; 0.01) circulating concentrations of metabolic regulators (IGF-1, insulin, leptin) than heifers on MN for the period 11 months to 23 months of age. However, there were no outstanding differences in metabolic regulators between heifers on MN and IN at single time points from 11 to 23 months. The diameter of the largest follicles did not differ (P &gt; 0.05) between the heifers on IN and heifers on MN. All heifers on IN had attained puberty by 23 months of age whilst only one heifer on MN had reached puberty at the same time. Puberty in heifers on IN appeared to be influenced, in part, by increasing day length as the majority of heifers attained puberty over a 3-month period between 21 and 23 months of age which coincided with the winter-to-spring transition. It was concluded from the findings that heifers on IN had a generally improved metabolic homeostasis which was linked with greater body weight and body condition, and this induced an earlier attainment of puberty. In the second major study, Droughtmaster cows were assigned to moderate pasture (MP, n = 7) or improved pasture (IP, n = 7) from 6 to 7 months of gestation until 6 months after calving. Starting at 1 week after calving, cows were monitored for body weight and body condition at 2-week intervals. Circulating concentrations of metabolic regulators (GH, IGF-1, leptin, insulin and glucose) were monitored weekly and ovarian follicular function was recorded at the same time by rectal ultrasonography. Faecal samples were collected at 3-week intervals to determined dietary CP and DMD. Pastures were sampled on four occasions at 5-weeks intervals to ascertain trace mineral status. Cows underwent liver biopsies at 3-week intervals during the postpartum period to determine the liver concentrations of trace elements (Cu, Mn and Zn) and to evaluate gene expression. Cows on IP had greater (P &lt;0.01) dietary CP and DMD than cows on MP. There were no differences (P &gt; 0.05) for liver concentrations of Mn and Zn between cows on MP and IP, but the latter cows had greater (P &lt; 0.01) liver concentrations of Cu at 1 week after calving and throughout postpartum. Cows on IP were heavier (P &lt; 0.01) and had a greater (P &lt; 0.01) body condition at 1 week after calving and throughout postpartum than cows on MP. Cows on IP had greater (P &lt; 0.01) circulating concentrations of IGF-1, insulin, leptin and glucose than cows on MP. The size of the largest follicles did not differ (P &gt; 0.05) between the cows on IP compared with cows on MP. All cows on IP had resumed ovulation by Week 16 postpartum whereas only 1 of 7 cows on MP had shown ovulation by Week 19 (P &lt; 0.01). It was concluded from the findings that cows on IP had a significantly improved metabolic homeostasis than cows on MP and that this induced an earlier resumption of ovulation postpartum. This is the first study to demonstrate long- term differences in metabolic homeostasis achieved by pasture-based nutritional management in postpartum beef cows. The most notable feature of liver gene expression was an apparent greater expression of genes linked with fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism and IGF-1 at Week 6 postpartum for cows on IP compared with cows on MP. It is not known how an apparent increase in expression of these genes at Week 6 postpartum might be temporally related to the resumption of ovulation between Weeks 11 and 16 for cows on IP. The above reseach has provided important new information on the interrelationships between nutrition, metabolic homeostasis and reproductive function in Zebu and Zebu crossbred pubertal heifers and postpartum cows. Lont-term nutritional management can be used to achieve differences in metabolic homeostasis that are related to the initiation of ovulation at puberty and resumption of ovulation postpartum. Differences in circulating concentrations of IGf-1, leptin, insulin and glucose that are linked to the initiation (puberty) and resumption (postpartum) of ovulation could be interpreted to suggest that these metabolic indicators act at both the brain and somatic tissues to influence reproduction in female cattle. Potential actions of metabolic indicators at the brain to influence reproduction are particularly intriguing given the presence of specific receptors for IGF-1 on GnRH neurons and leptin on KISS-1 neurons within the hypothalamus.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155388</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactions between tree species composition and nutrient relations in tropical and subtropical forest recovery</field><field name="creator">Siddique, Ilyas</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155391</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Size, Book to Market and Momentum Effects in the Australian Stock Market</field><field name="creator">Michael O'Brien</field><field name="description">International research indicates that portfolios formed on various stock characteristics produce different returns. These stock characteristics under which portfolios are formed include; past stock returns, size, earnings yield, leverage, and book to market ratios. The differences in returns cannot be explained using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), suggesting that the CAPM may not be an appropriate asset pricing model. In Australia a number of market anomalies have been reported, although there is limited research on the book to market effect and conflicting results using price momentum. Thus the First objective of this thesis is to study whether size, book to market ratios and price momentum are related to returns in Australia over the time period 1982 to 2006. Evidence that the CAPM cannot explain asset returns has led to the development of empirically derived asset pricing models, which are based on the Intertemporal CAPM (ICAPM) or the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT). These models include the market risk premium and either two or three additional factors, which capture the size (SMB), book to market (HML) and momentum (UMD) effects. In the United States of America (USA) these empirically derived models explain a significant proportion of the difference in returns between portfolios formed on various stock characteristics. In Australia there have been few studies that have investigated whether these empirically derived asset pricing models can explain the cross-section of portfolio returns. Therefore, the second objective of this thesis is to study whether the CAPM or a three- or four-factor model can explain the cross-section of portfolio returns. In this thesis portfolios are formed based on size, book to market ratios and price momentum. Results indicate three effects: First, portfolios made up of stocks whose market capitalisation is less than $3 million out-perform portfolios formed on larger stocks. This result would indicate that the size anomaly is not economically exploitable in Australia. Second, portfolios formed on past price momentum indicate that past winners continue to outperform past losers. However, past winners do not outperform the majority of portfolios formed on momentum. This suggests that to exploit the momentum effect would require continual short positions of the loser portfolio, which may be unsustainable in Australia. Finally, portfolios formed on stocks with high book to market ratios outperform portfolios formed on stocks with low book to market ratios. This result is consistent across all size groupings, suggesting that it may be possible to exploit the book to market effect. Results in Chapter 5 show that the negative relationship between market capitalisation and returns, and positive relationship between book to market ratios and price momentum and returns, are present even after exposure to market risk is taken into account. These results indicate a strong positive return during the months of January and July which are not fully captured by market risk, market capitalisation, book to market ratios or price momentum. These results present compelling evidence that these three characteristics are important determinants in explaining differences in portfolio returns. Such results lead to testing whether the CAPM or a three- or four-factor model can better explain the time-series and cross-sectional variation of portfolio returns. These results indicate that both the three- and four-factor models provide increased explanatory power over the CAPM. In particular, there is a strong relationship between size and the SMB factor. In contrast to previous Australian studies, there is strong evidence that the HML factor plays a significant role in explaining the time-series and cross-sectional variation in portfolio returns. Results indicate a strong monotonic relationship between book to market portfolios and the HML factor. Finally, these results indicate that a number of portfolios have significant exposure to the UMD factor. Overall, results indicate that a four-factor model explains the greatest proportion of portfolio returns. Even though the four-factor model has increased explanatory power over the CAPM, it has a number of limitations. That is, results indicate that the model cannot fully explain the size, value and momentum effects in Australia. This would suggest that future research is required in this area, in particular research should focus on applications of the conditional CAPM, consumption CAPM, and the intertemporal CAPM.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155437</field><field

regulon of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: its role in redox balance and nitrosative stress defence</field><field name="creator">Mr Adam Potter</field><field name="description">Neisseria gonorrhoeae is an obligate human pathogen that primarily colonises the urogenital tract. Infection with N. gonorrhoeae typically results in a localized inflammatory response involving infiltration of innate immune cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These cells produce reactive oxygen and nitrogen species as part of their bactericidal mechanism. These species are also unavoidable by-products of the bacterium&#8217;s own metabolic processes. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) are diverse, each exhibiting unique reactivity within a cell. Many different mechanisms to sense and respond to these species have been characterized in bacteria. This thesis represents the work done to characterize a novel transcription factor that appears to respond to ROS and/or RNS. The Neisseria MerRlike regulator (NmlR) represents a sub-family of the MerR family of transcription factors and has previously been shown to regulate 4 genes (including itself) in response to the redox state within the cell. NmlR both represses as well as activates adhC (glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase), trxB (thioredoxin reductase), and copA (P-type ATPase), with activation occurring in the presence of the thiol-specific oxidant diamide. The function of each member of the NmlR regulon in N. gonorrhoeae was determined. adhC was found to exist as a pseudogene in N. gonorrhoeae through a comparative study with the closely related organism Neisseria meningitidis. Meningococcal AdhC is able to successfully catalyse the NADH-dependent reduction of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), the adduct between nitric oxide and the thiolcontaining tripeptide glutathione. The gene adjacent to adhC on the N. gonorrhoeae chromosome, estD (carboxylic ester hydrolase), was found to be co-transcribed with adhC. Growth of an N. gonorrhoeae estD mutant strain was inhibited in the presence of GSNO, indicating that this gene is active and has a role in GSNO metabolism. The specific substrate for EstD remains to be identified as EstD was found to be unable to catalyse the hydrolysis of the in vitro product of GSNO reduction by AdhC, glutathione sulfinamide. trxB was found to encode a thioredoxin reductase with similar properties to E. coli TrxB. Inactivation of trxB in N. gonorrhoeae resulted in a severe phenotype, including sensitivity to a variety of oxidative stress potentiators, as well as to nitric oxide. Evidence for CopA existing as a specific copper-efflux pump was generated. However, the regulation of copA expression was found to be independent of copper availability, which indicates that the primary role of CopA may not be in copper homeostasis. The NmlR subfamily of MerR-like regulators is known to display conservation of two cysteine residues. The current study reveals that one of these residues is susceptible to forming a mixed disulfide with glutathione, that is, it is S-glutathionylated. It is proposed that this modification may contribute to the switch of NmlR from a repressor to an activator of transcription. All functional members of the NmlR regulon; EstD, TrxB and CopA, were found to be essential for gonococcal survival within cervical epithelial cells, while EstD and TrxB were required for biofilm formation on these cells. A model for the role of the NmlR regulon in controlling the metabolism of GSNO within the cytoplasm is proposed. It is suggested that this may allow the gonococcus to utilise the biological activity of NO, while also acting to defend the cell against nitrosative stress.</field><field

name="description">This thesis argues that examining the career of nineteenth-century actress and author Eliza Winstanley (1818-1882) increases understanding of the operation and reception of mid-Victorian penny weeklies. Winstanley&#8217;s works&#8212;drawing structurally and thematically on her lengthy stage career&#8212;show how a working woman constructed female ambition in a period when women were barred from many professions. Simultaneously, her uniquely visible career&#8212;when most authors who wrote exclusively for penny weeklies are obscure figures&#8212;makes her methodologically valuable, as a means of better understanding the editing processes and economies of penny weeklies. First, I outline the way in which Winstanley became involved with penny-weekly publishing, through an examination of her early correspondence with editor G. W. M. Reynolds, and examine the texts that show her emergence as an independent writer, developing concerns that stemmed from her own experience and professional life: her earliest actress-heroines grapple with commodified bodies and lives, with the difficulties of being a professional woman, with disrupted ambition. Second, I examine her role as editor of the short-lived Fiction for Family Reading, in which she develops complex notions of the way in which religion, gender, and socio-economic distinctions operate in mid-Victorian society, rewriting existing texts to remove God and foreground sexual threats and economic hardships. Running through this fiction is the idea that middle-class domesticity&#8212; superior to aristocratic decadence&#8212;is preferable to working-class life only in the absence of grinding, unremunerative work and the disruptions to comfort that this entails. Third, I outline the nature of Bow Bells, the journal for which Winstanley produced the majority of her confirmed fiction, showing how it constructed authorship, relied heavily on female writers, and recognised the significance of women readers. Winstanley&#8217;s fiction for this journal shows an experimental approach to genre and narrative, and an interest in successful and professional women. Finally, I look at adaptations of Winstanley&#8217;s serials for suburban theatres, demonstrating how the playwrights negotiated the inherent theatricality of her writing. These adaptations show a tension between broad changes to the narratives and a conflicting desire for verisimilitude, manifested in the way in which the playwrights structured their works around the serials&#8217; original illustrations. Eliza Winstanley&#8217;s career illuminates the intersection between forms of popular entertainment in the mid-Victorian period and the processes by which such material was produced.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:156728</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling Environmental and Genetic Control of Tillering in Sorghum</field><field name="creator">Hae Koo Kim</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:156731</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineered Antibodies.

field robot applications, cause drastic changes in the visual information captured by camera images, resulting in major difficulties for mobile robots attempting to localise visually. Most current solutions to the problem rely on extracting visual information from images that is decoupled from the effects of lighting. This is not possible in many situations. Chrominance information is often cited as having some invariance to lighting changes, which is confirmed by experiments in this thesis. However, in the bland application environments investigated,chrominance is not a pertinent metric, indicating that chrominance is not the complete solution to the lighting problem. Descriptions of the intensity gradient are also cited as having robustness to lighting changes. Many descriptions of image-point features are based on the intensity gradient and are commonly used as a basis for visual localisation. However, the non-uniform effects of lighting &#8211; shadows and shading &#8211; are tangled into the intensity gradient, making these descriptions sensitive to non-uniform lighting changes. Experiments are presented which reveal that image-point features recorded at one time of the day cannot be reliably matched with images captured only one or two hours later, after typical changes in sunlight. It appears that autonomously building visual maps which permit geometric localisation in many lighting conditions remains an unsolved problem. Therefore, this thesis develops systems based on manually generated maps which are created a priori and ensure that only permanent, invariant, information is included within the map and allows reliable localisation to be achieved in many conditions. The first proposed visual localisation system is for autonomous ground vehicles operating at outdoor industrial sites. The system avoids the problem of mapping from fluctuating visual information by using a professionally-surveyed 3D-edge map of the permanent buildings. The vehicles are fitted with fish-eye cameras that often have direct sunlight in the field of view, causing an issue of camera exposure &#8211; dealt with by using an intelligent exposure control algorithm. Results from the system show accurate localisation during the full range of lighting conditions experienced over a day. The second visual localisation framework discussed is for submarines navigating underwater structures, where the only light source is a spotlight mounted on the vehicle. The moving vehicle and hence changing incident angle of the light source cause major variations in the appearance of the structure. This makes it difficult to employ traditional tracking techniques. The proposed localisation system uses the novel idea of incorporating a light source model. The light model is used to render synthetic images of scene &#8211; which accurately recreate the non-uniform lighting effects. The synthetic images are compared with the real camera image to localise the vehicle. The idea of using a light model is partly motivated by the human visual system&#8217;s understanding of the light source within a scene and is also motivated by the limitations of the traditional approaches to factor-out lighting. Using a light model within a visual localisation system enables a more natural link between the internal environment representation and the image and is demonstrated to allow successful localisation in this difficult visual scenario. The results of the two proposed localisation systems are encouraging, given the extremely challenging dynamic non-uniform lighting in each environment. Both systems have attracted the interest of industry partners and the projects will continue to be developed into the future, with the goal of progressing them into fully functioning robotic systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">09 Engineering</field><field

Systems</field><field name="creator">Sho Nariai</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we look at how the Cross-Entropy (CE) method can be used to solve various optimisation and estimation problems in telecommunication systems and network planning, especially in the presence of noise. In Chapter 2, we mention what comprises optimisation problems. Various optimisation problems, such as constrained optimization and convex optimisation, are discussed. We also address noisy optimisation and how dealing effectively with noise plays a crucial role in locating a global optimal solution. A brief overview of three algorithms that have successfully been applied to noisy optimisation problems is also given. Chapter 3 explores a short overview of the methodology behind the CE method. We discuss how the CE method requires two simple iterative stages to locate an optimal "degenerate" sampling distribution, and hence an optimal solution to the optimisation problem. We also show how a simple modification of the algorithm can tackle noisy optimisation problems. Numerical experiments for solving both non-noisy and noisy multi-extremal continuous optimisation problems are conducted. Three test functions are used to investigate the performance of the CE algorithm on both non-noisy and noisy cases. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm can locate a global optimal solution accurately. Also, we show that the performance of the CE algorithm can be improved using the injection method. Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 discuss two types of the Network Planning Problem (NPP): single-type NPP and multi-type NPP. The aim is to determine which links in the system should be purchased in order to provide the highest possible service to the consumers, subject to a constraint on the total budget. We introduce various CE-based algorithms to tackle such non-linear combinatorial optimisation problem. Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed algorithms perform effectively and reliably in all test cases. Chapter 6 is concerned with estimating the blocking probabilities in circuit switched networks. We look at how Importance Sampling and Sequential Importance Sampling can be used to estimate the blocking probabilities. Here, the CE method is used to find optimal sampling parameters to be used in Importance Sampling and Sequential Importance Sampling. Numerical experiments suggest that Sequential Importance Sampling achieves a variance reduction over Importance Sampling in almost all cases at a cost of increased simulation time. Using CE further increases the efficiency of both.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158988</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ligands for C3a and C5a Receptors</field><field name="creator">Ms Jade Blakeney</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159059</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Competitive Interactions in a Tropical Marine Epifaunal Community</field><field name="creator">Erin O'Leary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">interspecific competition, overgrowth, ascidians, sponges, bryozoans, One Tree Reef</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159079</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Sox18 in Blood Vessel Development</field><field name="creator">Meredith Downes</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sox, Ragged, blood vessel development, vessel maturation, mouse mutants.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159084</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wireless Sensor Systems for Localised and Intuitive Interaction Applications</field><field name="creator">Mr Matthew D'Souza</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159086</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and Architectures for Bang-bang Phase Locked Loops</field><field name="creator">Mr Michael Chan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159101</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trauma, Emotion and the Construction of Community in World Politics</field><field name="creator">Ms Emma Hutchison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="subject">Trauma, emotion/s, political community, representation, Boxing Day tsunami, media, aid,</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159102</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of International Backpackers on the Host Society: A Case Study of Backpackers in Pai, North Thailand</field><field name="creator">Ms Ketwadee Buddhabhumbhitak</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Backpacker, Socio-cultural immersion, Backpacker ideologies, Backpacker actions,</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159103</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cost Accounting System Design: The Impact of Competition on Cost Allocation and Cost Management</field><field name="creator">Ms Sandra-lee Wallace</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">Costing Systems, Cost Management, Cost Measurement, Contingency Theory,</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159109</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Krylov and Finite State Projection methods for simulating stochastic biochemical kinetics via the Chemical Master Equation</field><field name="creator">Shevarl MacNamara</field><field name="description">Computational and mathematical models of cellular processes promise great benets in important elds such as molecular biology and medicine. Increasingly, researchers are incorporating the fundamentally discrete and stochastic nature of biochemical processes into the mathematical models that are intended to represent them. This has led to the formulation of models for genetic networks as continuous-time, discrete state, Markov processes, giving rise to the so-called Chemical Master Equation (CME), which is a discrete, partial dierential equation, that governs the evolution of the associated probability distribution function (PDF). While promising many insights, the CME is computationally challenging, especially as the dimension of the model grows. In this thesis, novel methods are developed for computing the PDF of the Master Equation. The problems associated with the high-dimensional nature of the Chemical Master Equation are addressed by adapting Krylov methods, in combination with Finite State Projection methods, to derive algorithms well-suited to the Master Equation. Variations of the approach that incorporate the Strang splitting and a stochastic analogue of the total quasi-steady-state approximation are also derived for chemical systems with disparate rates. Monte Carlo approaches, such as the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, that simulate trajectories of the process governed by the CME have been a very popular approach and we compare these with the PDF approaches developed in this thesis. The thesis concludes with a discussion of various implementation issues along with numerical results for important applications in systems biology, including the gene toggle, the Goldbeter-Koshland switch and the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Cascade.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Krylov Methods, Chemical Master Equations, Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Cascade</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159110</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution Kinetics in the Perfused Rat Pancreas</field><field name="creator">Mr Kent Fanning</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159124</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Health and Physical Education Teachers' Constructions of Teamwork: A Discursive Analysis</field><field name="creator">Mr Dean Barker</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teamwork, health and physical education, discourse analysis, social construction,</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159127</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speech-Language Pathology Support to Adolescents in Queensland, Australia Who Are Experiencing Oral Language Difficulties</field><field name="creator">Ms Karen Hollands</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Speech-language pathology, speech therapy, adolescents, language impairment, secondary school, support teachers, language intervention</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159128</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a Parallel Adaptive Cartesian Cell Code to Simulate Blast in Complex Geometries</field><field name="creator">Mr Joseph Tang</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blast, numerical simulation, Cartesian cell, virtual cell embedding, complex geometry</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159132</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Cultural Landscape Engineers: Humans and Environment in the Maroochy District, 1850 &#8211;

Audiation is the ability by which one hears with the eyes (and, by extension, sees with the ears), and the reciprocal nature of listening and reading has long been recognised (Karpinski,2000). According to Allvin (1970), sound-to-sight and sight-to-sound skills can be developed through CAI with an effectiveness equal to face-to-face instruction. It appears that some aural skills assist naturally in the development of other aural skills; Carlsen (1969), for example,suggested that the effect of aural training by instruction generalised to sightsinging ability, while Baggaley (1974) writes in contrast that the ability to discriminate does not necessarily guarantee the ability to recognise and identify. Porter (1977) asserts what is now a generally known fact that one must teach for transfer, rather than to expect transfer to be automatic. A six-semester distance-mode prototype aural training programme was developed at the University of Southern Queensland and delivered to tertiary music students in all states of Australia as well as other countries including New Zealand, Singapore, south-east Asia and the United Kingdom. A pre-test/post-test model assessing three groups (internal, external and control) was applied at the beginning and end of the first semester of the six semester programme. The internal group received face-to-face teaching during the first semester; the external group received tuition via CD-ROM; the control group received no tuition in ear training. The study sought to compare results within and between the three groups in the areas of rhythmic perception, melodic perception, scale/mode recognition and interval recognition during this first semester of the study, and to find correlations between demographic data and test performance. External students achieved higher levels of improvement for all aural acuities than internal students and control group students. The findings indicate that students learning multiple instruments and students learning piano perform aural tasks better than students learning only a vii melody line instrument (including voice) or no instrument. In addition, internal students&#8217; results showed a greater ceiling effect than the externals&#8217;, suggesting that the aural perception curriculum itself may need to take into account different individual levels of achievement. Tertiary music schools experiencing funding constraints may be able to re-organise aural tuition practice either to replace or to augment face-to-face classes with external aural training materials,without sacrificing the quality of their instruction.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aural training, melody,

J.</field><field name="description">The past twenty years have seen a paradigm shift in the management of government owned and leased office accommodation. This research project examines the economic changes that led to a market based approach to the provision of public services and the introduction of competitive tendering to most non-core public sector services. While government reforms focused on a market based approach, the underlying democratic principles that the delivery of public services should be transparent, accountable, efficient and effective, while acting in the best interest of the community, remain as a measure of their success. The enabling services that support the delivery of government initiatives have become one of the primary areas of reform. This reform is clearly illustrated in the changes that have occurred in the delivery of commercial office space by State, Territory and Federal Governments to accommodate their departments of state. This changing nature of property provision leads to the formulation of the research question, namely to determine whether there can exist a theoretical best practice model for the delivery of commercial office accommodation to government, which meets the objectives of efficiency and effectiveness while maintaining transparency and accountability. The theoretical model should then, through empirical data collection, be evaluated against current State, Territory and Federal Government procurement and management practices to determine to what extent the Australian public sector is achieving best practice. The project develops such a model of procurement based on an exhaustive literature review of both public and private sector best practice from around the world. The model is then developed to extract five key issues, which indicate the extent to which each State and Territory Government is approaching the suggested best practice. The issues are analysed in terms of a series of questions and measures of performance and are addressed through a qualitative case study of each State and Territory. Data in respect of each jurisdiction are gathered from a variety of sources, including archive materials, survey questionnaires and a series of structured interviews. The result is an evaluation of each government body, its past and current strategic management systems and a measure of its performance against the best practice model. Considerable work has been undertaken by each government jurisdiction in an attempt to provide quality workplaces at lowest cost to the public. Also apparent is a wide divergence in practice from fully contracted to the largely internal provision and management of services. The authorities investigated exhibit the full spectrum of procurement opportunities from freehold ownership to leasing strategies and private public partnerships in the decision processes which inform procurement decisions. In applying a best practice model to evaluate each government jurisdiction the extent of active strategic management is assessed. The results indicate that positive progress has been made and that most of the case studies show not only an understanding of the need to further develop strategic property plans, but also reveal the limited extent to which most jurisdictions have been able successfully to apply these best practice principles. They highlight the need for a strong Intelligent Client role to link the property procurement skills with whole-of-government policy, to inform government on property procurement options and to integrate departmental strategic planning into a holistic asset strategy. The findings also point out areas where strategies have been revised and provide insight into the probable future for public sector asset management in Australia. The thesis is thus put as follows: a theoretical best practice model can be developed to answer the research question in terms of efficient and effective delivery of commercial office accommodation to the public sector. It can further be applied to evaluate the seven administrations at State, Territory and Federal Government level and show a diversity of approaches and development toward procurement and property management practices. There remains a substantial gap between the best practice model and the procurement behaviour of most governments, with few exhibiting more than a basic level of strategic asset and portfolio planning. Queensland and New South Wales, while adopting differing procurement methodologies have developed furthest in strategically managing their assets and are currently leading in their ability to deliver whole-of-government strategies to ensure the efficient and effective use of public funds in the provision of the office workplace of the future.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1205 Urban and Regional Planning</field><field name="subject">Facilities Management</field><field name="subject">Outsourcing</field><field name="subject">Real Property</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Government</field><field name="subject">Workplace Performance.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158051</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Closing Watering Points on Populations of Large Macropods and Landscape Rehabilitation in a Semi-arid National Park</field><field name="creator">Fukuda, Yuki</field><field name="description">Many national parks in Australian rangelands were formerly grazing properties. Even after domestic stock has been removed, the landscapes, especially those near artificial watering points, remained degraded with little or no regeneration of native plants. Congregating large macropods have often been blamed for impeding regeneration of plant communities and rehabilitation of these degraded landscapes. Following a severe drought which reduced densities of large macropods very significantly in Idalia National Park, central-western Queensland, I investigated whether closure of watering points would hamper their recolonisation and influence their grazing distribution and forage selection in the park. I also determined the spatial and temporal pattern of degradation around the watering points, using a suite of indicators. A BACI (Before After Control Impact) type experiment was conducted using two replicate watering points each for impact (fenced) and control (unfenced) treatments. Two watering points were fenced off behind a kangaroo-proof fence in August and December 2002, respectively, in the deepening drought. Walked 4 km line transects were used to estimate densities of red kangaroos (Macropus rufus) and wallaroos (M. robustus) in areas within a 4 km radius of each watering point. The accumulation of dung pellets was used to estimate the grazing distribution of large macropods around water. Abundance and composition of vegetation were monitored on fixed transects using a 0.5 * 0.5 m quadrat 0.5 to 4 km from each watering point. Herbivore offtake was monitored using a movable cage technique. Measures of landscape function (stability, infiltration and nutrient rating) and ant composition were monitored at various distances from each watering point. Monitoring was commenced two to six months before the closure of watering points and completed 21 and 25 months following the closure, every two to five monthly to follow changes in large macropod densities and vegetation communities. Prior to the drought, densities up to 130 large macropods km-2 were recorded in the park. The average density of wallaroos declined by 97.7% during the drought whereas that of red kangaroos declined by 83.8%. The first substantial rain fell in January 2003, but rainfall throughout the study period continued to be much lower than the long-term median, except for January 2004 when more than half the average annual rainfall fell, causing major flooding. Closure of watering points coincident with the drought inhibited red kangaroo recolonisation by 40% in the areas surrounding fenced watering points for up to 21 months following the closure, with distances to alternative watering points being 3.8-6.6 km. Red kangaroos in an area surrounding one of the unfenced watering point recovered to the pre-drought average density. The grazing distribution of large macropods within 4 km from the watering points, however, was determined primarily by where plentiful food resources were, not by the location of water. Large macropods in the areas without access to water did not select forage with higher water contents, compared to those in the areas with water access. Differences in their forage preference between the two areas appeared to reflect the difference in vegetation composition between the areas. Sida filiformis, Cynodon dactylon and Tragus australianus, were identified as grazing sensitive plant species. In some cases, closing watering points helped these plants to increase their abundance following the drought. Most indicators (the percentage of bare soil, biomasses of perennial grasses and round-leaved chenopods, ant functional groups and the measures of landscape function) showed that the exclusion of mammalian grazing for more than a decade from long-term exclosures had facilitated regeneration of perennial grasses and landscape rehabilitation at least at some sites. At one long-term exclosure, where topsoil and seed bank had presumably been lost already, no regeneration occurred. When several indicators were used to determine land conditions around watering points, their responses were not always consistent. Nevertheless, the overall spatial patterns of degradation did not match the spatial pattern of grazing distribution by large macropods around water. Therefore, the current degradation appears to be a legacy of the livestock overgrazing that had continued for more than 100 years prior to the park establishment. The large drought-induced reduction in the large macropod densities did not result in any conspicuous reversal of the patterns of degradation around the watering points.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">restoration</field><field name="subject">kangaroo</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="subject">watering point</field><field name="subject">drought</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158052</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practising self-determination: Participation in planning and local governance in discrete indigenous settlements</field><field name="creator">Moran, Mark F.</field><field name="description">The principle and policy of self-determination holds that Aboriginal people should have the right to pursue a lifestyle of their choosing and to have control over their interactions with the wider society. Self-determination policy has been in place at a federal level since the 1970&#146;s, yet after thirty years of implementation, there is considerable disarray and disagreement over its merits. This study investigated the transactions of decision-makers as they practised two of the main policy instruments of self-determination: participatory planning and self-governance. The research settings were Mapoon and Kowanyama, two discrete Indigenous settlements on the West Coast of Cape York Peninsula, in the state of Queensland, northern Australia. Three typologies for settlements, planning, and organisations were established, which gave the context for the study, as well as a basis from which to generalise findings. From the types of planning in practice, a participatory plan at Mapoon was singled out for further study since it specifically recreated the language of self-determination. The Mapoon Plan was found to be successful technically, but it fell short of its stated social development goals. Planning proved to be a highly politicised and idealised activity, brokered by external consultants. The complex interplay among knowledge, ideology and politics, as observed, could not be described in terms of two separate domains, but rather in terms of intercultural production across an interethnic field. The anthropological literature tended to treat Aboriginal polities as cultural isolates, situated within administrative vacuums. To progress the study, it became necessary to apply a functional and administrative rationality to what needed to be done in practice. Twenty case studies of decision-making forums were analysed in the main research setting of Kowanyama. Each involved the contemporary practice of self-determination, as local decision-makers engaged with the wider society. In the majority of cases, all six proposed factors were found to be necessary, but not sufficient, for success: (1) participation, (2) technical expertise, (3) negotiation, (4) institutional capacity, (5) focal driver, and (6) jurisdictional devolution. A typology of actors was established to define the different decision-makers involved. Of the 600 adults in Kowanyama, only 30 were found to be actively involved in decision-making. This was unexpectedly low given the quantity of government activity purporting to further Kowanyama&#146;s self-determination. Six determinants were found to influence the level of participation: efficacy in practice, jurisdictional devolution, representativeness, function, informality, language and motivation. In particular, form followed function, whereby the function of a decision-making forum decided the level of participation that was appropriate. Contrary to accounts in the anthropological literature, the study found a fledgling system of representation in Kowanyama, complete with informal &#145;extra-constitutional&#146; checks and balances. Factions were a powerful aspect of Kowanyama society, but they did not monopolise politics. The local polity was better conceptualised in terms of its political pluralism, encompassing a complex array of balancing and competing interests. Significantly, constituents were beginning to exert local political influence over their leaders. The analysis found that notions of &#145;community control,&#146; as promulgated in the community development literature, were not adequate to explain the intercultural production underway. The full spectrum of participation was relevant to the actors of governance, from political activism to ambivalent apathy. Community control was found in the absence of government interventions, imbedded within informal institutions and cultural norms. Yet, introduced political structures, including Councils, were no less a part of the local political arena. The notion of governance better encapsulated the array of decision-making activities and actors occurring across a broad range of institutional positions. The study documented multiple dilemmas and indeterminacies as actors practised self-determination in the interethnic field, especially the interplay between local and external ideologies and knowledge. All of the examples of political innovation in the contemporary history of governance in Kowanyama involved productive social contexts developing locally between leaders and trusted outsiders. The complexity of problems and their solutions were only revealed through practice, one step at a time. Successful initiatives in Kowanyama were to a degree inadvertent; it was not until the end that actors understood what they had done right or wrong. Significantly, political innovation occurred in practice, often without any active intervention by government. Ironically, one of the greatest obstacles limiting local capacity was the size of the task of administering the programs of self-determination. An accepted role for leaders and employees was radical action to manipulate the system and to create the institutional space to permit the subjects of self-determination to participate. The analysis suggested that the importance assigned to government policy, legislation, and structure has fallen out of balance with their actual practice. Rather than fixating on policy solutions to self-determination, policy-makers should be focusing more on creating an enabling framework for practice. The six success factors proven in the study give the basis for such a framework.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310101 Architecture</field><field name="subject">780107 Studies in human society</field><field name="subject">governance</field><field name="subject">participatory planning</field><field name="subject">indigenous settlements</field><field name="subject">community development</field><field name="subject">Mapoon</field><field name="subject">Kowanyama</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158053</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface fitting for the modelling of plant leaves</field><field name="creator">Loch, Birgit Ilka</field><field name="description">Leaves play a vital role in the development of a plant, as they are major resource collectors. Adequate models of leaves are therefore required for the modelling of plants. Such models may be used for visualisation purposes only, or they may incorporate leaf function such as photosynthesis. While the modelling of plant architecture has been researched extensively over the last decades, models of leaf surfaces have mostly not been generated with great accuracy or level of detail, and have often been handcrafted. This thesis aims to provide techniques for the creation of detailed, accurate models of leaf surfaces for the plant modelling community; models that may be used as parts of virtual plants for applications in fields as diverse as the arts, agriculture or computer games. These techniques are mathematical methods of surface fitting based on data that has been sampled from real leaves. First, leaf data needs to be collected. The digitising of leaf surfaces is described in detail in this thesis, and issues arising for three data collection techniques are discussed. The laser scanner is selected to sample data from leaf surfaces of four example leaf types. The two surface fitting methods which are applied to the data are finite element interpolation approaches. Since the size of a laser scanned data set can be enormous, an incremental algorithm is used to identify significant points that result in a surface fit that approximates all remaining data points to a specified accuracy. Interpretation of the positions of these points leads to the formulation of guidelines that describe the locations of significant points on a leaf surface. These are the points that should be digitised with a single-point device such as a sonic or magnetic digitiser, possibly the only digitising technique available to a plant scientist. Triangle-based finite element methods lead to surface models with piecewise linear viii boundaries in the triangulation reference plane. This may not be an issue for applications where the boundary of a model is not important. Leaf surfaces, however, possess a specific boundary. To generate a visually realistic model of a leaf surface the boundary needs to be captured; a method is introduced that improves the boundary of a triangle-based interpolant. A new boundary curve is specified that passes through all boundary points, and the surface is extended so that it matches the new curve. Visual criteria are listed for the acceptance or rejection of the boundary, and a preliminary discussion is made of numerical criteria. The research presented in this thesis is the first to model detailed and accurate leaf surfaces based on data points. It delivers a basis for further research both into the application of detailed models as well as into extensions of the presented model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Leaves</field><field name="subject">plant</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">digitising</field><field name="subject">data points</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158054</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The coverage of death in the foreign news of German and Australian quality newspapers</field><field name="creator">Hanusch, Folker</field><field name="description">This study investigates the values that the print media place on human lives in an international context. This was conducted by examining the coverage of death in international news. Although the research literature shows a number of studies that examined the coverage of death, this particular study differs from previous studies because all such previous research has had either a narrow focus or shortcomings in their research methods. In this context, this study is a comprehensive evaluation of how newspapers cover death in foreign news. By focussing on quality newspapers in Germany and Australia, namely the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the S&#252;ddeutsche, The Australian and the Sydney Morning Herald, the study identified the differences in the coverage of death in these newspapers. In particular the study examined whether these newspapers gave preference in any form to reports of death from countries that were culturally similar as opposed to countries that were culturally dissimilar countries. The study further examined and highlighted the basis on which journalists in Germany and Australia made news decisions about whether or not to cover foreign events that included death and what criteria informed their news decisions. By applying a cultural framework developed especially for the purpose of examining international news, the study found clear evidence that journalists primarily look for a cultural connection to their own country in making news judgments in regard to foreign news coverage. The framework used in this study was based on the following four cultural dimensions: world views, value systems, systems of social organisation and systems of symbolic representation. In this regard, an event in which a large number of people have died, but which is located in a country that does not have many links along these dimensions with the newspaper&#146;s home country will not necessarily rate very highly. In contrast, an event involving a few dead people would rate highly if the event occurred in a country with which the newspaper&#146;s home country has many links along the four dimensions. In this regard, issues such as news fatigue, also called compassion fatigue, can be overcome by a cultural connection to another country. Differences in how German and Australian quality newspapers treated stories about foreign death, both in the use of language and the use of photographs, were also examined in detail. In this regard, Australian newspapers were found to display relatively more tabloid characteristics than German newspapers, with clear differences in the language used when describing death. Differences in the use of graphic photographs were not as clear, though distinctions could still be made to a certain degree across national lines. In general, journalists&#146; approaches to how they treated death could also be traced back to some distinct cultural differences between Germany and Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international communication</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">international news</field><field name="subject">coverage of death</field><field name="subject">death</field><field name="subject">death in the news</field><field name="subject">newspapers</field><field name="subject">media studies</field><field name="subject">death and foreign news</field><field name="subject">representation of death</field><field name="subject">inter-cultural communication</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural communication</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158055</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Occupational Therapists' decisions about the management of upper limb hypertonicity in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy</field><field name="creator">Rassafiani, Mehdi</field><field name="description">It has been postulated that occupational therapists when choosing an appropriate intervention method, use theoretical and practical knowledge (factors), based upon identifying client's goals to guide their clinical reasoning. The overall aim of this study was to identify factors and their relative contributions to the decisions occupational therapists make in the management of upper limb (UL) hypertonicity of children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP). Studies about general factors which influence occupational therapists' decision making have been addressed widely in the literature. However, studying influential factors in specific areas such as in the management of UL hypertonicity of clients with CP is limited. The information obtained from studies of decision making with other client groups can not readily be generalised as it has been demonstrated that specific task characteristics induce different types of cognitive thinking. For example, working with clients with orthopaedic problems may induce logical thinking, while practicing with clients with neurological problems promotes intuitive thinking. The management of UL hypertonicity of clients with CP was chosen as the focus of this study for two main reasons. First, the incidence of CP is high, manifesting in between 1.4 and 2.4 of 1000 live births. Second, people with CP are one of the major client groups referred to occupational therapy (OT) clinics as outpatients. The literature reviewed highlighted a lack of evidence about what therapists attend to when making decisions about the management of UL hypertonicity for clients with CP. To identify and evaluate these factors, the current research employed Social Judgment Theory (SJT). This methodology was selected because it had the capacity to V access intuitive thought or tacit knowledge that is very difficult for experienced therapists to explain. Furthermore, SJT is most relevant in situations where there is no optimal decision. The current study proceeded in five phases. Phases One to Three were conducted to identify the most relevant factors to be used in the case vignettes necessary for the application of SJT. This process involved a review of the literature, consultation with clinical experts and then involved twelve experienced therapists in a process of identifying, refining, and ranking the relevant factors in order of priority. As a result of the processes in Phases One to Three 37 factors and their ranked importance were identified. The identified factors were reduced from 37 to 12 on the basis of ranking, cluster analysis and consultation with experts and appropriate scales identified for their measurement. These factors formed the basis of Phase Four of this study. In Phase Four 10 sample case vignettes as well as an administration manual were developed and four therapists were asked to make decisions for these cases. On the basis of therapists&#146; comments, some changes were made in case vignettes and administration manual. Finally, 110 case vignettes were generated randomly (20 were repeated to examine consistency) for Phase Five of the study. In Phase Five, eighteen occupational therapists (16 females and 2 males), mean age of 36.7 years (SD = 7.6 years) who had worked with people with CP for a mean of 10.4 years (SD = 6.0 years) made decisions for the generated case vignettes. The findings of Phase Five revealed that therapists used three factors mainly in their decisions including severity of spasticity, wrist and finger posture, and client and family background. They had poor insight into their decision making (r = 0.36) and demonstrated only moderate consistency (r = 0.46). When therapists were divided into two groups based on their level of performance in respect to therapists&#146; consistency and their ability to discriminate between cases, both groups used severity of spasticity and wrist and finger posture in their decision making. However, the higher performing group used limitation in passive range of movement and previous intervention in their decision making, and the low performing group used client and family background. To conclude, factors identified as most important (specifically by therapists who performed consistently) could be considered to be the most critical when confronted by a large amount of information. These factors can be used to assist occupational therapy students and new practitioners to focus on relevant information to help support their clinical decisions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Occupational Therapy</field><field name="subject">Cerebral Palsy</field><field name="subject">Decision Making</field><field name="subject">Upper limb</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158056</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representing the Bible : discourses in the press news</field><field name="creator">Matson, John</field><field name="description">While there have been a number of studies about the Bible in the media they have tended to look only at the use of Bible stories in the entertainment area and in the tabloid press. These studies do not consider how the news media covers the Bible. This study, however, presents the findings of a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the representation of the Bible in the press news. The primary aim of the research was to understand how the press news constructs the Bible with its discourse. To develop this awareness, the study employed the method of discourse analysis. This included both quantitative and interpretative analysis of the language of the news texts. The corpus came from news reports of the Bible in association with the controversy surrounding the Dead Sea Scrolls. From the point of view of this study, I collected the reports on the Dead Sea Scrolls as they occurred, thus reducing any possible bias from the selection process; the reports were simply a means to an end &#151; a thread to follow, as it were. The study period was from 1947, when Bedouins found the Dead Sea Scrolls, to 2003 just after the publication of nearly all the ancient texts. The media selected from which to draw the reports were: The Australian (Aust.), The Sydney Morning Herald (SMH), The New York Times (NYT), and The Times (London). I chose these papers because they are among the principal agenda-setters for the rest of their respective nation's media, and as such, they reflect the views of the opinion leaders in their communities at large. Results from the analysis revealed that while there were negative representations of the Bible, there were also press news reports that provided positive accounts. At first, news reports were more or less a matter of a factual accounting of the events. Later, the reports contained assertions on the need to rewrite the Bible &#151; iii something that was clearly abhorrent to conventional Christians. Moreover, there was a press discourse portraying the Bible as a document that was culturally irrelevant and with an uncertain status. Opposed to this however, there was discourse representing the Bible as a resource book (a document to which one could turn with one&#146;s problems). In addition, there was also evidence of a journalistic frame in operation that was organizing the world around the Bible, subtly managing audience interpretation. This framed the Bible as a sacred document safeguarded as much by religion as by tradition. This sacredness is rooted deep in Western culture. Such a frame, of course, was largely unspoken or unacknowledged. It provided a sense that the Bible enjoys a degree of cultural and social authority as a guide to life based on an interpretation of past events in faith. On the other hand, the nature of some reporting would suggest that the Bible is a 'cultural icon', a somewhat elitist object, now distant from the popular culture of which it was once a part. The impact of these findings lies in the apparent need for biblical scholarship to focus on the Bible&#146;s heritage in Western culture. Scholars may find this heritage in the fine arts and in the media, among other phenomena. Should they decide to take up this challenge then they would study the Bible as a cultural artefact, and not primarily as a religious text that is the property of the religious communities. This may mean completing cultural/biblical studies outside organized religion. Naturally, such a shift would represent a loss to the traditional philological/classical base of biblical scholarship. I expect that the findings of this study will contribute to both the growing body of research on media discourse; and a better understanding of the Bible in the Western way of life.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440204 Christian Theology (incl.

Studies on adoption behaviour related to innovative IS are devoting increasing attention to SMEs. Most prior studies, however, have still relied on models developed from studies of large firms. The applicability to SMEs of findings and models developed from large firm studies is not without question as SMEs are not miniature versions of large firms. SMEs face different challenges and opportunities from large firms. This thesis empirically examined issues on the adoption behaviours of innovative IS by SMEs. In line with this objective, two research questions were established. First, what are the critical determinants that allow SMEs to overcome inhibiting factors and adopt an innovative IS? Second, what are the critical determinants that ultimately activate and stimulate them to become enabled and actively utilise an innovative IS? The conceptualisation of enacted capabilities, adapted from the resource-based view of the firm is introduced. This thesis postulates that appropriate enacted capabilities facilitate SMEs to become enabled and actively utilise an innovative IS. These enacted capabilities include the level of IT skills and knowledge of the enterprises&#146; members, trust in technology, trust in trading partners, external experts&#146; support, and organisational culture Models incorporating aspects of the theory underlying the technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989), the diffusion of innovation theory (Rogers, 1995), and the resource-based view of the firm (Barney, 1991) were developed to describe the causal linkages between the determinants that activate and stimulate innovative IS adoption behaviour (i.e., from adopting to enabling to utilising innovative IS). One model was developed for the adoption stage and a second for the enablement and utilisation stages. The adoption stage model contains three main hypotheses. The first two hypotheses propose that enacted capabilities have a positive direct effect on both perceived net benefits and attitude towards adoption from a competitive advantage perspective. The third hypothesis proposes that perceived net benefits have a positive effect on attitude towards adoption form a competitive advantage perspective. The enablement and utilisation stages model contains four main hypotheses. The first two hypotheses propose that enacted capabilities and attitude have positive effects on perceived net benefits. The last two hypotheses propose that perceived net benefits and attitude towards adoption from a competitive advantage perspective have positive effects on the extent of enablement and usage of innovative IS. The hypotheses are tested using data obtained via a survey and follow-up interview. Responses were received from 206 SMEs of varying industries and sizes from the survey. Out of these 206 SMEs, follow-up interviews were conducted with twenty-one SMEs. The interviews utilise a combination of both open and closed questions. The questions for the follow-up interviews were based on findings derived from the survey. The innovative IS examined was the Malaysian government&#146;s electronic procurement system, known as ePerolehan. All government suppliers must register for the system and become enabled for use before they can start utilising the system. The results indicate that enacted capabilities possessed by SMEs affect perceived net benefits at all stages of adoption behaviours of SMEs (i.e., adoption, enablement and utilisation). More significantly, two aspects of enacted capabilities, top management IS skills and knowledge and trust in trading partners dominate the effect on perceived net benefits. Support from external experts dominates the effect on attitude at the adoption stage. Top management IS skills and knowledge and trust in technology have a negative effect on attitude at the time of adoption. Enacted capabilities also contribute to the extent of enablement and usage within SMEs. Furthermore, different categories of adopters differ in the set of enacted capabilities underlying their innovative IS adoption behaviour. Results also indicate that when SMEs perceived higher net benefits in adopting innovative IS, they have a positive attitude. The positive attitude generated at the time of adoption has a direct effect on the extent of enablement and usage. The influence of perceived net benefits differs at the different stages of adoption behaviour. At the utilisation stage, usage is affected by perceived net benefits, however, perceived net benefits do not affect the extent of enablement at the enablement stage. In conclusion, this thesis found that enacted capabilities display important roles as antecedents to perceived net benefits, and that perceived net benefits act as a mediator from enacted capabilities to attitude at the adoption stage. Enacted capabilities also display important roles as stimulators of the extent of enablement and usage. Thus, apart from requiring good ideas and financial resources, SMEs also require appropriate enacted capabilities when adopting, enabling and utilising innovative IS.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350213 Electronic Commerce</field><field name="subject">700299 Information services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">medium business</field><field name="subject">technological innovation</field><field name="subject">organizational behavior</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158058</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of protective FeCO&#8323; film removal in single-phase flow-accelerated CO&#8322; corrosion of mild steel.</field><field name="creator">Ruzic, Vukan</field><field name="description">Carbon dioxide (CO2) corrosion is a major problem in the oil and gas production industry. The survival of mild steel equipment is to a large extent conditional on the formation and stamina of protective iron carbonate (FeCO3) films. Damage to protective films allegedly leads to accelerated corrosion attacks and increases the risk of failures. In single-phase flows, film removal phenomena are broadly ascribed to two intrinsic mechanisms: mechanical removal by hydrodynamic forces and/or chemical removal by dissolution. The fact that both mechanisms usually act simultaneously in practice puts their combined action in the forefront regarding its significance and relevance for the industry. Yet, virtually no information is available on the exact conjoint mechanism of protective FeCO3 film removal in single-phase environments. The obscurity is largely due to the uncertainty regarding the roles of hydrodynamic forces and mass transfer, where both are closely related to turbulence intensity levels. The aim of this dissertation was to clarify the roles of the two basic FeCO3 film removal mechanisms during the conjoint removal in undisturbed, single-phase flow in terms of their relative contribution and possible synergistic interaction. The proposed aim was accomplished by applying an innovative analytical approach, in which inherently coupled processes of film formation and removal were decoupled. Also, the two intrinsic removal mechanisms were studied separately in the initial stages, before they were combined to provide a complete picture of the conjoint mechanism. An integrated approach to studying film formation/removal mechanisms involved advanced electrochemical techniques for following film growth/removal, complemented by detailedScanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy/X-Ray Mapping characterisations of protective/residual films. A single-phase, highly turbulent flow field was attained by employing a rotating cylinder configuration. A standard corrosion experimental setup was extended to accommodate more complex film studies. A comprehensive flow characterisation around the rotating cylinder was carried out by means of flow visualisation and mass transfer measurements under turbulent flow conditions. While the former facilitated proper design of film formation experiments, the latter led to an empirical mass transfer correlation that enabled quantification of film dissolution rates. Furthermore, although some information on film growth kinetics is available, customised experimentation was necessary to identify the key parameters needed to obtain films with desired characteristics. Sound procedures for FeCO3 film growth were established, which led to the reproducible formation of realistic, protective films after a few days. The results of the pure mechanical removal of protective FeCO3 films have shown that its kinetics are rather slow even at high velocities and have caused a delayed, partial macroscopic type of damage. Yet, the findings demonstrate that the currently widely accepted view, that film removal by hydrodynamic forces in the absence of film dissolution in undisturbed, single-phase flows does not occur, is wrong. The strong correlation found between velocity and pure chemical film removal kinetics implicitly followed via corrosion rates suggests that the dissolution of protective FeCO3 films is under mass transfer control. Pure dissolution has faster removal kinetics and is far more detrimental to film integrity even at relatively high pH (just below saturation) than pure mechanical removal at the same Reynolds number. It has been found that the controlled pure dissolution mechanism led to only partial and selective film removal, where the more dissolution-resistant crystalline top film layer and the dissolution-prone inner layer were differently affected both in terms of the type of damage and its severity. A strong synergistic effect between mechanical and chemical film removal mechanisms has been identified during their simultaneous action. The quantified synergistic share in fully established conjoint film removal (during the steady, linear corrosion rate increase) expressed via corrosion rate gradients increased from 19.4% to 29.7% for the corresponding increase in the rotational speed from 7,000 rpm to 10,000 rpm. The synergism comprised two modes of mutual interactions: enhanced mechanical removal due to dissolution (M/D) and enhanced dissolution due to mechanical removal (D/M). In contrast to the independent action of integral removal mechanisms, where dissolution appears to be more destructive, the interaction between the two was primarily dominated by drastically accelerated mechanical film removal kinetics, that is, M/D rather than D/M mode, the latter of which was inferior. A fundamentally improved understanding of film removal mechanisms in single-phase flows has been reached as a result of the present project, thereby creating a solid foundation for future modelling and a more effective prevention and control of flow accelerated corrosion, not only in CO2 corrosive environments, but also in a wide range of industrial settings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Protective coatings</field><field name="subject">carbon dioxide corrosion</field><field name="subject">steel</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158059</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PRESSURISED ENTRAINED FLOW GASIFICATION OF SUGAR CANE WASTES FOR COGENERATION.</field><field name="creator">Joyce, James Alexander</field><field name="description">This work has examined the thermochemical conversion of sugar cane processing wastes (bagasse and cane harvesting trash) for use in the design of pressurised entrained flow gasification power cycles (~20 Barg, 600-900oC). The two key parameters of interest were the residual char yield from initial pyrolysis and the heterogeneous reactivity of the char with respect to carbon dioxide. Char yield and gasification rates were measured by a conventional wire mesh reactor and thermogravimetric (TGA) technique, an in-situ sample charring TGA technique and with an entrained flow reactor specifically designed for this work. The new experimental reactor concept is one of the major contributions of the work. Chars from the entrained flow experiments were characterised by optical microscope, SEM/EDS, TEM/EDS and XPS techniques, to help elucidate the processes occurring during pyrolysis and gasification. The key findings and conclusions of the work were as follows: 1. Initial (pyrolysis) char yields were consistent with the data reported in literature for similar materials. Char yields varied with reaction conditions, from 6 to 49 wt% daf for cane trash and 4 to 40 wt% daf for bagasse. Ash content also had a significant effect on char yield. The char yield for both cane trash and bagasse increased in proportion to the logarithm of system pressure. 2. A relatively simple empirical model for char yield under pressurised entrained flow conditions was formulated. This could predict char yields for both the experimental data in this work and those reported in literature for similar biomass materials. While temperature, pressure and ash content were all significant parameters in the model, the primary fitting parameter was a measure of the contribution of secondary char forming reactions and ongoing pyrolysis to char yield. The identification of this parameter is one of the contributions of this work. 3. The measured initial rate of char gasification by carbon dioxide was 0.06 to 1.2 mg per gram of initial char, over the temperature range 750 to 900oC. The rate of gasification was so low as to not contribute significantly to overall fuel conversion in the reaction residence times iv expected of a commercial gasifier. In essence almost all of the experimentally measured fuel conversion could be attributed to pyrolysis, which resulted in 85-95% fuel conversion. 4. Both the raw materials and the residual chars had low surface areas and negligible microporosity. The majority of the measured surface area may have been associated with the ash component rather than the carbonaceous component, which supported the finding of low reactivity. 5. The silica component of the chars exhibited crystalline silicate formation by migration of metal species over time periods of minutes. These silicates displayed signs of sintering, but otherwise remained physically intact; leaving a characteristic skeleton that corresponded to the original structure in the raw materials. 6. The gasification rate showed a time dependent decrease in the entrained flow experiments. This was attributed to coke formation on the char surface, followed by carbon trapping in the ash component at high levels of conversion. Both findings are significant contributions from this work, because they highlight key mechanisms that hinder fuel conversion in the proposed gasification concept. The broad coverage achieved in this work has provided an overall picture of how fuel conversion progresses during the pressurised entrained flow gasification of sugar cane wastes. It is recommended that many of the aspects highlighted in this work be examined further, to confirm the findings and to investigate the means to avoid the factors identified in this work as hindering fuel conversion.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gasification</field><field name="subject">Bagasse</field><field name="subject">Cane Trash</field><field name="subject">Combined Cycle</field><field name="subject">Entrained Flow</field><field name="subject">Pyrolysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158060</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE ROLE OF CAVEOLIN IN ENDOCYTOSIS AND CAVEOLAE BIOGENESIS</field><field name="creator">Kirkham, Matthew John</field><field name="description">Caveolae, flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane, are a striking feature of many mammalian cells. Caveolae are defined by their morphology and by the presence of integral membrane proteins, called caveolins. In this study, we have investigated the formation of caveolae and the dynamics of cell surface caveolae. Caveolae can be generated de novo by the expression of caveolin-1 (Cav1), but the precise role Cav1 plays in this process is presently unclear. The caveolin family of proteins includes splice variants Cav1[alpha] and Cav1[beta], caveolin-2 (Cav2) and the muscle specific caveolin, caveolin-3 (Cav3). Caveolins are conserved in evolution. As well as being expressed in all mammals examined, caveolin are also found in lower eukaryotes such as the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), the zebrafish, Danio rerio and the amphibian, X.laevis laevis. Though both the trafficking and the biochemical properties of Cav1 and Cav3 have been extensively studied by the creation of a large number of deletion, truncation and substitution mutants, few of these studies have assessed the formation of caveolae. We have established an electron microscopy assay through the use of Cav1-null mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) to study the biogenesis of caveolae. We found that caveolae produced by the transient expression of Cav1 and Cav3 had the same morphology and that the first 48-residues of the N-terminus and the last 31-residues of the C-terminus of human Cav1 could be individually removed without affecting the shape of the caveolae generated. More severe deletions caused the protein to be retained within the Golgi complex. Caveolae generated by a point mutation of Cav1 that has an increased association with cholesterol, and several point mutations of Cav3 shown to be involved in muscular disease, had normal morphology. The conservation between species of caveolin in caveolae formation was investigated. Interestingly, we showed that C. elegans caveolin is not functionally equivalent to mammalian Cav1 in mammalian cells, and does not cause caveolae biogenesis in Cav1- null MEFs. Furthermore, through the creation of a number of hybrid proteins between C. elegans and mammalian Cav1 we have showed that only the C-terminus of mammalian Cav1 could be exchanged with C. elegans Cav1 without affecting caveolae biogenesis. We demonstrated a fundamental role of two previously uncharacterised - vii - regions of mammalian Cav1 in caveolae formation. These regions of mammalian Cav1 are a leucine rich region in the C-terminus and an area of the N-terminus between residues 48 to 61. Through sequence analysis we have also highlighted two conserved tryptophan residues that when mutated slow caveolin exit from the Golgi complex, but do not inhibit caveolae formation. This has allowed us to propose a new model of caveolae formation. Caveolae have been described to take part in the endocytosis of certain ligands, but whether caveolae are involved in a dynamic constitutive endocytic pathway has been controversial for many years. The uptake of the bacterial toxin, cholera toxin, has been reported to be significantly inhibited in cells derived from Cav1 null mice, but other cell systems where Cav1 expression has been shown to be reduced showed no reduction in cholera toxin uptake. We therefore studied the uptake of cholera toxin in primary MEFs derived from WT and Cav1-null mice. We show that cholera toxin is internalised and transported to the Golgi complex in Cav1-null MEFs and that this occurs with the same dynamics as in WT MEFs. Through the use of a novel electron microscopy technique we have shown that cholera toxin in WT MEFs could be internalised by caveolae, although this was an infrequent process. Caveolae endocytosis could be stimulated by phosphorylation and the addition of lactosyl ceramide. Thus caveolae endocytosis is not a major dynamic constitutive pathway. In WT MEFs, cholera toxin can also be internalised by clathrin coated pits and a non-clathrin non-caveolae dependent pathway. We have shown that this pathway is present in Cav1-null MEFs and that it is sensitive to cholesterol, but not dependent on Arf6, dynamin or EPS 15. Moreover, we have described the morphology of the very first endocytic carriers of this pathway and found them to have a tubular or ring-shaped cisternal morphology with a diameter of 65nm. Finally we have shown that this non-clathrin non-caveolae pathway is a major endocytic pathway and that it is involved in both glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored proteins and fluid phase uptake.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158061</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A strategic management framework for reformed electricity generation firms in Eastern Australia.</field><field name="creator">Skoufa, Lucas A.</field><field name="description">Strategy formulation for electricity generation firms in Eastern Australia in the environment of restructuring is the focus of this thesis. The ideological basis of electricity industry restructuring around the world has been based on neo-classical economics and the specific notion that firms in competitive markets are more efficient than vertically integrated government-owned monopolies. From a strategic management perspective it is assumed that firms will attempt to create a competitive advantage and accrue above normal profits, which contrasts with the requirement of the electricity regulatory regime view that no firm will make above normal profits or exercise market power. A review of literature on the economics of electricity markets is covered in Chapter 2, and Chapter 3 discusses the key aspects of strategic management including the concepts of competitive advantage and added value; among other matters the discussion in both chapters focuses on the various generation technologies available. For a commodity such as electricity there are limited options for firms to differentiate themselves and use of appropriate technology is seen as one of the best methods to achieve this. A Governance-Strategic Choice framework is proposed in Chapter 4 from the literatures in Chapters 2 and 3 and the propositions derived in these two chapters. A background case on the restructuring and privatisation of the UKESI is included as Appendix A and provides useful material for the development of the nine propositions and this in turn has assisted in the formulation of the GSC Framework in Chapter 4. The qualitative research design of the thesis is discussed in Chapter 5. The design is based on case studies of three electricity supply industries (specifically focused on the generation sectors); Victoria, Queensland, and New South Wales in the Australian National Electricity Market. The first case study, in Chapter 6, encompasses the restructuring and privatisation of the Victorian ESI generation sector. The second case study, in Chapter 7, encompasses the restructuring and corporatisation of the Queensland ESI generation sector and the final case study, also in Chapter 7, encompasses the corporatisation of the New South Wales ESI generation sector. It is important to note that the Queensland and New South Wales governments have not yet privatised their respective electricity supply industries. A consequence of this is that some worthwhile comparisons to the privatised Victorian Lucas Skoufa - A Strategic management framework for reformed electricity generation firms in Eastern Australiaindustry have been provided with regards to the strategic behaviours and choices made by electricity generation firms in these industries. Chapter 8 provides analysis of the Governance-Strategic Choice framework (derived in Chapter 4) and the nine propositions (derived in Chapters 2 and 3) by drawing on the three case studies presented in Chapters 6 and 7. Chapter 8 concludes by presenting a section on two strategic scenarios (use of appropriate generation technologies, including environmental considerations, and bundling of products) that are based on the GSC Framework, which provides guidance for strategy formulation for use by generation firms. Chapter 9 sets out the major conclusions of the thesis. In general, generation firms have maintained a majority of coal-fired technologies since privatisation/corporatisation; this situation has changed slightly but not enough considering that in the future greenhouse gas emission limits will most likely be imposed which will disadvantage the coal-fired technologies. Furthermore, risk management has been an important managerial tool for generation firms due to the price volatility experienced in the pool based trading system; in addition, the amount of regulation and regulatory change has been excessive in some cases. The main theoretical contribution of this thesis has been to provide a framework for generation firms to make strategic choices, and highlights two scenarios emanating from this framework for creating and maintaining a competitive advantage in the restructured electricity supply industry environment. For practitioners/senior management the contribution of this thesis is that they will have a better understanding not only of their strategic choices but also the strategic choices of competitors and have the knowledge that, apart from competing on price, there are several other strategic ways through which to create and sustain a competitive advantage.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350299 Business and Management not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">660100 Energy Transformation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158062</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DOMESTIC ABUSE: COPING STRATEGIES OF CHRISTIAN WOMEN</field><field name="creator">Baker, Lynne Maree</field><field name="description">This study is an investigation of the experiences, and in particular the coping strategies, of Christian women who identify themselves as victims of domestic abuse. For the purpose of the study, Christian women are viewed as a unique group who, while remaining part of society as a whole, are not only confronted with what might be considered the usual issues surrounding domestic abuse, but also face the potential complication of these issues, as a result of their belief system. This thesis is structured in a manner which incorporates the relevant literature review, findings and discussion in each chapter, progressively building an image of the difficulties confronting Christian women who are victims of domestic abuse. This choice was made in an effort to gain maximum benefit from the information provided by the respondents, and to provide the most accurate coverage of their stories in relation to both secular and religious experiences. In conjunction with this decision, excerpts from the interview transcripts are utilised throughout the thesis to highlight the significance of particular issues in the lives of the respondents. Domestic abuse is identified as multifaceted issue which has the potential to permeate every aspect of the life of the victim, and also the members of her family. Not only has domestic abuse permeated secular society, it is also present within the Christian church, and as such can present substantial difficulty for women who desire to practice their faith, but find conflict between the teachings of their church and the need to protect themselves and their children, physically and/or emotionally from the damaging effects of domestic abuse. This thesis embraces a feminist research paradigm, which identifies power and control as key elements of domestic abuse, particularly when set within a patriarchal societal structure which fosters the subjugation of women (Chapter 1). Each of the 20 respondents who chose to take part in the study has been allocated a pseudonym, and is introduced according to her age, profession, denomination, current family, the length of her marriage, and her current marital status. Respondents are drawn from diverse backgrounds, both professional and religious, vary in age from 26 to 70 years, and report a variety of experiences within their respective denominations (Chapter 2). Semi-structured interviews form the basis of this qualitative study. This option fostered a substantial level of freedom within the interviews by permitting respondents to share their experiences with a minimum of interruption, and also allowing the interviewer to move with the respondents throughout the telling of their stories. An ethics of care and respect is identified as being paramount when interviewing victims of domestic abuse, and also when processing, analysing and reporting on subsequent data (Chapter 3). The experiences of the respondents, includes the forms of abuse they suffered, in addition to some of the obstacles with which they were forced to deal, sometimes on a daily basis. Forms of abuse experienced by the respondents include physical, verbal, emotional, sexual, social, financial, spiritual, property, and child abuse. The ongoing nature of domestic abuse, combined with the effect of the cycle of violence, often results in extreme confusion for the victim who frequently endeavours to pacify the perpetrator, and maintain an harmonious balance within the household. The image of perpetrators presented by the respondents, highlights the issues of power, domination, and control, together with the intimidating and manipulative means by which perpetrators choose to maintain their power base (Chapters 4 &amp; 5). The key theological issues pertaining to Christian women who are victims of domestic abuse are presented in a sequence of three chapters, which focus individually on the Scriptural principles of forgiveness (Chapter 6), marriage as a sacred union (Chapter 7), and female submission to male headship (Chapter 8). The foundational principles of specific Scriptures are discussed, with regard to issues of context, setting and culture, with particular consideration being given to their operation and relevance in the light of domestic abuse situations. Such Scriptures, if misused, have the potential to create extreme difficulty for Christian women who are victims of domestic abuse. It has been indicated, however, that the Scriptural principles in question, in no way support domestic abuse in any form, nor do they condemn a victim who chooses to remove herself from an abusive relationship. The primary focus of this thesis is devoted to the specific coping strategies employed by Christian women who are victims of domestic abuse. A variety of strategies emerged including religious and non-religious, in addition to a blend of both problem- and emotion-focused approaches. Their Christian faith proved to be extremely important, and also effective in the lives of the respondents. The choice of religious coping strategies included; maintaining a relationship with God, prayer, drawing encouragement from Scripture, and also Scriptural song, while non-religious strategies included; focusing on the children, turning to activities, reading as a source of learning and encouragement, and finally planning a specific course of action (Chapter 9). As a final gesture, respondents offer advice, based upon their own experiences, to both victims of domestic abuse, and also to members of the clergy who desire to support and encourage those women seeking their assistance. Victims of domestic abuse are advised to maintain their faith in God, not to accept abuse, and to constantly seek assistance, as domestic abuse is not their fault. Separation, and subsequent divorce, is presented as a viable option, with the choice of action remaining with the individual woman. Members of the clergy are advised by the respondents to listen attentively, and believe the victim, while demonstrating unconditional love and respect, and refraining from judgement. Additionally, they are encouraged to ensure they are well informed concerning matters of domestic abuse, avoid issues which can potentially inflame the situation, such as theological understandings of female submission to male headship, and exhibit a willingness to confront the perpetrator regarding his behaviour. Ultimately, it is recommended that the church as a whole, adopt a proactive approach to domestic abuse, which includes denouncing injustice, developing relevant policies, and networking with churches and professional organisations within the greater community (Chapter 10). This thesis highlights the ongoing need for the Christian church as whole to remain relevant to current society, by continuing to offer practical and meaningful assistance to those in need. While this thesis relates specifically to the requirements of Christian women and their experiences of domestic abuse, the universal maxim of listening to the voice of experience, can be aptly applied.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158063</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors associated with Treatment Response and Survival among Women with Late-Stage Ovarian Cancer</field><field name="creator">Newton, Tanya Rose</field><field name="description">Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of death from gynaecological malignancy in Australia. The majority of epithelial ovarian carcinomas are of serous subtype and most of these women present with advanced disease. Up to 70% respond to initial chemotherapy but eventually relapse. This exploratory study embraced a multidisciplinary approach, merging molecular expression profiling with epidemiological research to examine the many facets that affect a woman&#146;s prognosis once diagnosed with late-stage ovarian cancer. The hypotheses were threefold, firstly, that outcome (treatment response or survival), was associated with the molecular expression profile of the tumour. The second hypothesis was that women&#146;s epidemiological (personal, lifestyle and psychosocial) factors influenced their outcome. Lastly it was hypothesised that certain epidemiological factors influenced the molecular expression profile of the tumour and that the genes associated with those factors may also influence survival. Women who were suspected of having ovarian cancer were asked to participate in the study at diagnosis, just prior to surgery, they completed a questionnaire at diagnosis and 6-12 months later. Tumour specimens were collected from each participant at the time of surgery. The gene expression profiles of 31 tumours from women who had late-stage serous ovarian cancer were analysed with regard to the patient&#146;s response to treatment. Women who did not respond to treatment could be distinguished from those who responded (no relapse within 12 months) based on 34 gene transcripts (p=0.02). Poor survival was associated with high expression of inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (ID2) (p=0.001). Women with tumours which had high expression of decorin (DCN) and ID2 together had a significant, seven-fold increased risk of dying (95% CI 1.9-29.6; 14 months survival) compared to those with low expression (44 months). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed differences in protein localisation for ID2. Women with tumours which had greater than 50% staining in nucleus had poorer survival (HR 1.3, 95% CI 0.55-3.21) compared to women with tumour specimens which had less than 50% staining in the nucleus and greater than 50% staining in the cytoplasm. The epidemiologic approach explored the associations between personal characteristics, lifestyle and psychosocial factors (at both diagnosis and 6-12 months follow-up) and response to treatment and survival. The response to treatment analysis included the 31 women from the profiling study because they had complete treatment follow-up information. The survival analysis was expanded to include all women with late-stage ovarian cancer (n=61). Factors which were associated with survival included religion, marital status, history of alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), weight loss and feelings of hopelessness. Specifically, women with low BMI ([less than or equal to]20 kg&amp;frasl;m2) at 6-12 months follow-up were five-times more likely to die (95% CI 1.14-21.62) than women with a normal BMI (&gt;20-[less than or equal to]25 kg&amp;frasl;m2) while women with high BMI (&gt;25 kg&amp;frasl;m2) had a three-fold increased risk of death. Women with low to moderate levels of hope had a striking four-fold increased risk of death at diagnosis which increased to five-fold at 6-12 months follow-up (95% CI 2.19-12.71). The final step in this project was to explore the associations between epidemiological factors and gene expression (for the 31 late-stage serous ovarian cancers) to determine if tumours from one exposure group had a different gene expression profile compared to tumours of another exposure group. Preliminary results found significant expression differences between tumours from women with either low or high BMI compared to those with normal BMI. Some of these genes, such as ID2, were also significantly associated with survival, providing evidence that women with abnormal body weight may have different tumours to those of normal BMI. The most clinically-significant results in this thesis came from the molecular approach to prognosis where the ID2 marker predicted poorer survival amongst clinically-homogenous patients. Such markers may help determine what treatment regimen would be most effective. Preliminary results combining molecular expression profiling with the epidemiological factors allowed for novel issues to be considered. These results also provide a cell signalling framework which may be involved in tumour progression. Potentially, knowledge regarding patients&#146; personal, lifestyle and psychosocial factors may be helpful in providing advice and support to enable women to modify factors such as body size and may permit intervention for women with low social support or low levels of hope, therefore potentially improving their quality of life and modifying their outcome.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158064</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hospitality industry turnarounds: An examination of service climate and employee identification in the hotel industry</field><field name="creator">Solnet, David</field><field name="description">The hospitality industry is renowned for high rates of business failure. Increasing competition, globalisation, technology, social change and internal weaknesses are some of the many reasons that hospitality businesses fail or perform significantly below expectations. Many businesses therefore attempt to &#147;turn around&#148; performance. Because declining performance can have wide-ranging impacts not only on businesses directly in the hospitality industry, but also upon those communities where local economies rely on tourism and hospitality industry businesses, the idea of turning around declining businesses is an important concept to understand, research and study. However, there has been limited published focus on turnarounds in the hospitality industry in general, and in the hotel industry specifically. Hotels are service businesses, and, like most service organisations, rely heavily on line-level staff. This thesis utilises the &#147;linkage&#148; research model, which proposes a conceptual chain connecting employees to customers and therefore organisational performance. Surprisingly, the linkage research model has received minimal research focus in the study of hospitality businesses. The aim of this thesis is to gain understanding about turnarounds in the hotel industry, and to examine employee&#150;customer linkages during hotel industry turnaround attempts. While there are many factors involved in hotel turnarounds, the radical changes that accompany a turnaround can have a direct effect on employees. This effect is important because employee behaviour is known to be a function of the salience that situations create for a person at a particular time. Employee perceptions of change have been said to affect beliefs and assumptions and therefore affect attitudes and behaviours in the workplace. Social identity theory proposes that an individual&#146;s concept of self is built on personal identity based on unique personal characteristics, with social identity derived from membership of salient social groups. Under given conditions, social identity becomes more salient than personal identity which leads to attitudes and behaviours that are reflected by group memberships. This thesis proposes a conceptual model that incorporates service climate and employee identification as vital considerations for turnaround success in the hospitality industry. Of particular interest to this thesis are the distinct characteristics of turnarounds in the hotel industry; the way in which service climate dimensions predict employee perceptions; how these relationships change over time; and the role of employee identification in predicting employee perceptions. The project involved two studies designed to examine the following overarching research questions&#151; 1. Does turnaround from decline in the hotel industry differ from that of other industries? 2. What are the roles of service climate and employee identification in predicting employee perceptions of customer satisfaction and change during hotel industry turnaround attempts? The research design involved a multi-method investigation. In Study 1, 14 respondents who represented various perspectives of hotel industry turnarounds were interviewed. The interviews used a convergent interviewing process whereby key themes identified in each round of interviews were explored in later rounds of interviews. Five key themes (theme clusters) emerged from the interviews. Within these key themes, the importance of people-related issues emerged as significant characteristics of hotel industry turnarounds. In Study 2, a survey of employees was conducted in four hotels that were undertaking a turnaround attempt. Responses were collected from 323 staff. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to investigate the relationships between the variables cross-sectionally to ascertain the relationships between variables; and longitudinally to ascertain whether certain variables at early visits could predict outcomes at later visits. Analyses of variance were used to examine whether there were differences in the variables by either hotel and/or visit. Findings demonstrated the significant role of customer-contact aspects of service climate in predicting customer satisfaction and change perceptions. Employee identification at the company level was found to predict employee perceptions of customer satisfaction. The addition of department level identification contributed to the prediction of change perceptions. Although limited by a small sample, the longitudinal study suggested that employee perceptions of customer satisfaction and of customer-contact aspects of service climate were significant predictors of customer satisfaction perceptions four months later. Implications include the application of the linkage research model as a useful, yet rarely applied framework for study and practice in the hospitality industry. In addition, hospitality industry research has yet to incorporate social identity theory in understanding group identification and how it can affect employee attitudes and service behaviours. The use of these theoretical frameworks would be useful in the study of hospitality industry businesses, and as diagnostic tools during change.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158065</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Client preferences for food services in geriatrics, rehabilitation and aged care: Implications for service delivery for an ageing population</field><field name="creator">Wright, Olivia Renee Louise</field><field name="description">The focus of this work pertains to the development of a detailed and specific measurement instrument to study the satisfaction of elderly clients with health care food services, in the longer-stay section of hospitals (geriatric/rehabilitation) and in the residential aged care setting. The study investigated one of the major causes of malnutrition, i.e. poor client satisfaction with institutional food, and developed a measurement instrument for the regular evaluation of client satisfaction with longer-stay food services. The intended outcomes from this survey are the provision of meaningful indicators of client foodservice preferences and satisfaction to assist in the management of such services. Following thorough development and pre-testing (n=40), the pilot version of the Resident Foodservice Satisfaction Questionnaire (REFS) contained a cognitive screening task, 61 items relating to foodservice attributes, an overall satisfaction question as the outcome measure and a demographic/contextual information section to allow investigation of client characteristics previously shown to influence health care satisfaction, i.e. age, gender, ethnicity, length of stay, and self-rated health. The timing of meal choice, appetite, diet type, and the time of survey administration were also investigated. Information was obtained by using a combination of closed questions and the provision for general comments via openended questions. A total of 313 survey responses were available for analysis, reflecting an overall response rate of 76 per cent. An analysis of sample characteristics indicated it was representative of the longer-stay care population. The median age was 84 years, with 26.6 per cent males and 72.1 per cent females (1.3 per cent missing for gender). Test-retest reliability was established in approximately 25 per cent of the sample (89/313). Wilcoxon signed ranks tests for continuous variables and marginal homogeneity tests for categorical and ordinal variables indicated good test-retest reliability. Factor analysis procedures revealed foodservice satisfaction in residential aged care and in the rehabilitation/geriatric hospital sector was represented by: meal quality and enjoyment (&#945;=0.91), autonomy (&#945;=0.64), staff consideration (&#945;=0.79), and hunger and food quantity (&#945;=0.67). All constructs showed good internal consistency, as their Cronbach&#146;s alpha (&#945;) coefficients were greater than or close to 0.70. Ordered probit regression analyses indicated that foodservice satisfaction was significantly moderated by client age (p&lt;0.05). From the analysis of stratum-specific models, marginal effects on outcome probability estimates demonstrated that clients aged 75-84 years were more likely than those aged less than 65 years to rate overall foodservice satisfaction as &#147;very good&#148; (Pr = 0.23), and this positive association also occurred for clients aged 95 years or more (Pr = 0.27); however, clients aged 85-94 years were less likely to provide this overall rating (Pr = 0.19), suggesting a non-linear relationship between satisfaction and age. This is an important conclusion, as it differs from the majority of published literature, where higher levels of satisfaction with services are associated with advancing age. Furthermore, the results suggest that foodservice variables representing client autonomy and choice, appetite and perceived health status appear to exert a greater influence in the longer-stay setting than food quality per se. Therefore, the survey instrument and models of foodservice quality developed are expected to make a substantial contribution to the practical measurement and application of foodservice satisfaction results in longer-stay care. They provide evidence for modifications to current menu planning and foodservice delivery methods, particularly regarding the reduction of the time-lapse between resident meal choice and consumption, augmentation of the number of meals at which choice is offered (i.e. lunch and dinner) and the fostering of resident autonomy and ownership of food choices through consultation of resident preferences. The finding that foodservice delivery aspects appeared to be more important to clients than food or meal service quality indicates that small, simple changes to the organisation and management of the delivery of food services could markedly improve client satisfaction levels, without incurring additional costs. It is expected that this would have positive economic implications of improving food consumption, client health status, minimising the risks of malnutrition and reducing the likelihood of food wastage. In addition to these practical service delivery changes, the results may be applied to refine the food and nutrition components of the existing Aged Care Accreditation Standards to improve their applicability to clients of residential aged care facilities. Further, they may assist in the design of inaugural foodservice policies for longer-stay care in Australia, to ensure the preferences of current aged care clientele are catered for and to monitor the potential service delivery changes required as a proportion of the ageing population enters formal care.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158066</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Syntheses and reactions of iminopropadienones, sydnones and oxazinones.</field><field name="creator">Veedu, Rakesh Naduvile</field><field name="description">Iminorpropadienones (R-N=C=C=C=O) 1.2, are a new class of linear cumulenes, usually generated by Flash Vacuum Thermolysis and characterised by IR spectroscopy in low temperature matrices. New derivates of iminopropadienones viz. 3-pyridyl 1.15, 4-pyridyl 1.16, pentafluorophenyl 1.17 and [alpha]-naphthyliminopropadienone 1.18 are synthesised and characterised. Pentafluorophenyl and [alpha]-naphthyliminopropadienones are characterised both by IR and [superscript]13C NMR spectroscopy as they are found to be more stable, and [alpha]-naphthyliminopropadienones can even be isolated at room temperature. Chemical reaction of several iminopropadienones with nucleophiles such as dimethylamine (DMA), diethylamine (DEA) and trimethylamine (TMA) were studied. The analytical FVT experiments provided direct evidence for the nucleophilic attack on both the C=O and N=C moities of the iminopropadienones to give ketenes and ketenimines. Zwitterions were observed in all reactions with TMA. Preparative FVT trapping experiments of 3-pyridyl and 4-pyridyliminopropadienones with nucleophiles allowed the isolation of naphthyridones as the stable end product. Photochemistry of N-phenylsydnone 2.4, N-(3-pyridyl)sydnone 2.6 and diphenylsydnone 2.23 was investigated in Ar matrix.

A subsequent review of the literature revealed a number of anecdotal reports of disordered handwriting in this population but limited research in the area. This thesis presents a descriptive and exploratory study of the nature of handwriting in eight year old children with and without ASD. Issues of handwriting development and motor learning are canvassed followed by an examination of concepts of motor control. Next follows a review of current handwriting models. The Systems Model of Handwriting was proposed as a response to the evidence for both dynamic and motor programme aspects of handwriting. Using this model as an organizing structure, the literature on ASD and handwriting was then examined which led to the framing of three research questions: 1. Is the handwriting speed of children with ASD significantly different from that of children without ASD? 2. Is the handwriting legibility of children with ASD significantly different from that of children without ASD? 3. At what stage/s of the Sequential Handwriting Process, is the handwriting of children with ASD different from that of children without ASD? Twenty-eight eight year old children with ASD and a matched control group of twentyeight comparison children were recruited from state primary schools in Brisbane and surrounding areas. These fifty-six children were assessed on thirteen handwriting process variables and two handwriting outcome variables in order to answer the research questions. Data produced were analyzed primarily with t-tests for between group differences and by examination of correlations between process and outcome variables. Small but measurable differences were found in both speed and legibility between the two groups, with the handwriting of the children with ASD being both less legible (t=- 2.47, df=54, p=0.02) and slower (t=-2.47, df=54, p=0.02). Accuracy of letter formation was also found to be significantly worse for the children with ASD compared to children in the control group (t=3.53, df=54, p=0.001). Further, the two groups were found to differ in some aspects of the Sequential Handwriting Process. Specifically, the children with ASD showed significant correlations between legibility and Perceiving, Conceptualizing and Planning stages, while the comparison children showed significant correlations between legibility and Interpreting, Conceptualizing, Planning and Activating stages. Only one process variable (consistency of letter formation) showed a moderate correlation with handwriting speed &#150; all other variables were of only slight to fair strength. Finally, the implications of the research findings are discussed, limitations described and directions for future research canvassed. As a result of the present study, a revised Systems Model of Handwriting is proposed. Several recommendations for occupational therapy intervention in handwriting practices in the classroom are made, notably: clear and focussed initial tuition of letter formation and secondly, the development of automaticity of the handwriting skill.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158068</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment and Treatment of Emotional and Social Understanding Deficits in Children with Asperger Syndrome</field><field name="creator">Beaumont, Renae</field><field name="description">The aim of this research project was to develop and examine new assessment and treatment programs for children with Asperger Syndrome (AS). Specifically, the aim for the first study was to design and evaluate a new computerised, advanced theory of mind measure that could be used to evaluate treatment outcome in Phase 2 of the project. Vignettes for this measure, termed the 'Animated Theory of Mind Inventory for Children (ATOMIC)', were written by the chief investigator, and animated by a team of computer programmers. Following pilot testing and refinement, the final measure consisted of 18 cartoons and accompanying theory of mind, central coherence and memory control questions. Results showed that relative to the control participants (n = 25), children with AS matched on IQ, verbal comprehension, age, and gender (n = 25) performed equivalently on the ATOMIC central coherence questions, but more poorly on the theory of mind questions. However, there was significant overlap between the theory of mind scores obtained by children with AS and typically developing controls, suggesting that either not all children with AS are impaired at attributing mental states to others, or that the ATOMIC theory of mind scale requires further refinement to enhance its sensitivity in detecting subtle mentalising deficits . A significant relationship was found between participants' performance on the ATOMIC theory of mind questions and the accuracy of the mental state explanations that they provided on Happk's (1994) Strange Stories Task, supporting the validity of the ATOMIC theory of mind scale. These findings suggest that theory of mind deficits may not characterize all individuals with AS, and in cases where they are evident, they cannot be solely attributed to generalised problems in integrating information. Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are discussed. The second study for this research program involved the design and evaluation of a new social skills intervention for children with Asperger Syndrome: the Junior Detective Training Program. The development of this intervention is discussed in detail, with the final 7-week program consisting of a computer game, small group therapy sessions, parent training sessions and teacher information handouts. Results showed that relative to children in a wait-list control group (n=23), children who participated in the therapy program (n=26) showed greater improvements in social skills over the course of the intervention, as indicated by parent-report measures. Teacher-report data also suggested that children involved in the therapy program made significant improvements in social functioning from pre- to post-treatment. Child-based competency measures indicated that children in the treatment group were better able to suggest appropriate emotion-management strategies for story characters post-intervention than at pre-intervention, whereas children in the control group were not. However, children who participated in the therapy program did not appear to make greater improvements on theory of mind measures over the course of the treatment than matched controls. Follow-up data suggested that treatment gains in social functioning were maintained by children at 5-months post-intervention. When control participants were offered the treatment program, they demonstrated similar gains in social and emotional understanding over the course of therapy as the initial treatment recipients, providing further support for the efficacy of the intervention.

Change and evolution are manifestations of time, while time contributes to the wickedness of many socio-technical problems. Socio-technical system design, then, must necessarily contend with time. Until now, however, our efforts to understand time have tended to focus on classifying time: we can describe an objective &#145;clock time&#146; that exists separate from the system; an &#145;event time&#146;, which is bound within the system; and a &#145;subjective&#146; time, dependent on the cognitive experience of the human actors in the system. We have descriptions of time, but few insights into how time affects systems. As such in design we tend to ignore time, leading to an &#145;extended present&#146;, in which we assume the present extends indefinitely into the future. Or we focus on the immediate, the real-time instant, exacerbating the phenomena of &#145;shattered time&#146;. Last, we control time in an environment separated from the messiness of the real world, creating &#145;laboratory time&#146;. Because we fail to adequately account for the nature and complexity of time&#151;time, as one researcher puts it, is hard&#151;we contribute to the construction of unresponsive, illfitting, and brittle systems. We need an understanding of time that breaks out of the extended present, reunites the shards of shattered time, and breaks the shackles of laboratory time. In this thesis, we use complex adaptive systems theory to derive an understanding of time and temporal behaviour. Complex adaptive systems include socio-technical systems which evince wickedness; as such, it offers insights into the deep systems dynamics of which time is but one. In particular, we need to account for temporal behaviours stemming from differential rates of change, temporal non-linearities, and synchronisation and entrainment. Employing the rationale that such systems manifest behaviour at the system level that emerges from the character and interactions of the component parts, we outline a description of Emergent Temporal Behaviour. The smallest temporal component of the system is an instance, comprising duration and temporal placement. Repeated instances form a temporal pattern. Interacting patterns generate temporal knots. The overall temporal structures we call, for want of another term, a temporal weave. Having scaffolded Emergent Temporal Behaviour, we generate from it a framework, the Temporal Analysis Framework, for use in understanding a system&#146;s temporal behaviour. A system&#146;s temporal behaviour may be analysed through triangulating temporal trajectories through the Framework, choosing different instances or understandings of instances, patterns, knots and weaves. We also consider design outcomes that arise as consequence of our temporal analysis. The final section of the thesis concerns three case studies, illustrating the application of Emergent Temporal Behaviour and its insights. The cases chosen are different from each other in both content and scale, illustrating both the portability and scalability of our model. The first concerns a simulation of a simple supply chain, the MIT Beer Game. In the second, we analyse the development and implementation of a university time-tabling system. In the last, we assess a macro-scale societal phenomenon, modern warfare. Our thesis provides an abstraction of time in systems for the purpose of analysis and design. By re-forging the link between time and acts, we used complex adaptive systems theory to shape a representation of Emergent Temporal Behaviour in systems. It does not negate other understandings of time&#151;clock, event and subjective time&#151;but helps designers to negotiate the pitfalls inherent in the extended present, shattered time and laboratory time. As such we see Emergent Temporal Behaviour as a useful complement to existing approaches to systems analysis and design. This thesis, through our model and framework, provides a new basis of understanding of time and temporal behaviour in systems, and a means to assess the same in particular systems. While our suggested model of Emergent Temporal Behaviour is not the best possible solution to an inherently wicked problem, it is, we feel, a good start.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158070</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic loading of peripherals on reconfigurable System-on-Chip</field><field name="creator">Lu, Yi</field><field name="description">This project investigates a self-reconfiguring rSoC (reconfigurable System on Chip) system which automatically and dynamically loads peripheral controllers, based on the peripherals connected to the system. The Xilinx Virtex-II FGPA, which supports dynamic partial reconfiguration, is used as the experimental target. To implement the system, three main areas are investigated: the peripheral auto detection, the dynamic partial reconfiguration mechanism on the FPGA, and the supporting software. The system core is designed as two defined areas on a single FPGA chip. A fixed area is used for the constant logic circuits (such as soft-core CPU) and partial reconfiguration (PR) slots are used for changeable peripheral controllers. The autoconfiguration process involves three different steps: peripheral auto detection, loading of a peripheral hardware interface configuration, and loading of a peripheral software driver. In our system, we successfully implement the mechanism of peripheral dynamic loading on the rSoC system. Four novel features are provided in the system: 1) Peripheral auto detection. Peripheral boards are automatically detected by the system when connected to the system. 2) Peripheral controller hardware bitstream and software driver dynamic loading. The required peripheral controller hardware bitstream for the connected peripheral board is automatically searched for and loaded by the operating system, as well as the required software driver. Manual operations on these processes are also supported. 3) Individual interface to external environment. Each PR slot provides individual interface to peripheral boards. It is configured by each peripheral controller for board-specific connection. 4) The existing system is extensible. The partial reconfiguration mechanism provided in this project supports at least two PR slots. On higher capacity FPGAs, the number of PR slots could be increased. In our existing system, the time used for the dynamic partial reconfiguration process, including the hardware bitstream loading and the software driver loading, is in the order of 10-20ms, which is an insignificant fraction of the Linux boot time.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Auto detection</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="subject">rSoC</field><field name="subject">dynamic-partial-reconfiguration</field><field name="subject">uClinux</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158071</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Image Processing On Reconfigurable System-on-Chip</field><field name="creator">Han, Jie</field><field name="description">Real-time image processing requires not only sophisticated heuristic algorithms customized for a particular application, but also needs substantial computational power to handle a massive quantity of input image data. Reconfigurable System-on- Chip (rSoC), a powerful method to harness the power of FPGA technology, is well suited to real-time image processing. It balances the design cost and performance via a combination of hardware and software. However, hardware/software co-design requires specialized design skills, and designs are complex. This thesis investigates how best to use FPGA-based reconfigurable computing to provide efficient speed-up of real-time image processing algorithms. Existing rSoC systems, face detection and recognition algorithms, hardware/software co-design methods are first reviewed and analyzed. The advantages and disadvantages of existing research results are also presented. However, these existing approaches all have shortcomings. A new rSoC system without a separate host machine is presented for standalone embedded platforms. A new hardware/software co-design method including hardware/software communication and partitioning is also explained. This rSoC system is a highly modular system, it runs without a host machine and it supports the Linux operating systems. Hardware and software designs can be rapidly implemented on this new platform. A new method for hardware/software communication in rSoC design is presented, which is based on shared memory and semaphores, and makes hardware coprocessors appear like software processes. Individual processes in hardware-software systems can communicate without knowing whether other co-operating processes are hardware or software. This approach enables re-useable hardware components to be readily accessed by designers, without specialist hardware knowledge. Processes also can be easily swapped between hardware and software. The partitioning method handles the software/hardware partition iteratively during the implementation. The partition is based on experimental profiling, so it is easier to realize and may achieve a more optimal result than a fixed a priori partition. An example face recognition system has been implemented to test the new design method. It is a four-stage pipeline architecture which contains image capture, face detection, image enhancement, and face recognition. Firstly, a software-only solution using semaphores and shared memory method is implemented on a Linux PC. Results of 5.5 frames per second indicate that the speed may not be fast enough for real-time image processing. Secondly, that software-only solution is moved to the new rSoC platform. The performance of 0.1 frames per second is worse than PC platform since the PC&#146;s CPU is much more powerful than the rSoC&#146;s. Finally the new design method is used to move some bottleneck modules to hardware. The new hardware/software communication method is used, so software modules remain unchanged and unaware of the movement of other modules to hardware. Results show that moving only one module to hardware was not helpful. However when both the bottleneck modules were moved to hardware, the system speedup was approximately 200 with a final system speed of 19 frames per second.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reconfigurable computing</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="subject">image processing</field><field name="subject">System-on-Chip</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158072</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Microphthalmia Transcription Factor (Mitf) in Osteoclast Gene Regulation</field><field name="creator">Meadows, Nicholas Axel</field><field name="description">Microphthalmia transcription factor (Mitf) has been shown to be a key regulator of osteoclast function by activating genes like TRAP and cathepsin K. Mitf is a member of the helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family of transcription factors and regulates its target genes by binding as a homo- or heterodimer to an E-box consensus sequence termed the M-Box (T/CANNTG/A). In order to identify the suite of genes that are regulated by Mitf in macrophages and osteoclasts, the level of Mitf activity has been modulated in the pre-osteoclastic macrophage cell line, RAW/C4. Stable transfectant cell lines expressing the Mitf-A isoform (RAW/C4-Mitf-A/pEF6) and the dominant negative isoform, mi (RAW/C4-mi/pEF6), under the control of the EF1a promoter, were prepared. Both the expression and function of the exogenous genes were validated using western blotting, immunocytochemical staining, Q-PCR and promoter-reporter transfection analysis. The genes differentially regulated by the alteration of the level of Mitf in these cells were expression profiled by microarray analysis. The 22 000 element murine Compugen array was hybridized with RNA prepared from the RAW/C4-Mitf/pEF6 and RAW/C4-mi/pEF6 cell lines before and after induction of osteoclast differentiation with RANKL. Genes identified include those either up- or down-regulated during osteoclast differentiation, as well as genes with differential expression as a result of overexpression of Mitf protein. A bioinformatic analysis was undertaken in parallel to identify candidate M-box-containing genes that may be Mitf targets. A large-scale Blast technique was developed to download 2 kb of DNA sequence 5&#146; of the translation start site for all the genes on the Compugen array. These promoter regions were searched for the presence of M-boxes and a subset of potential Mitf target genes was compiled and compared with targets generated from the microarray analysis. This approach identified eight genes that were indicated to be Mitf regulated based on their expression profile and the presence of a M-box within their proximal promoter region. The expression of these genes was validated using Q-PCR and following a literature review of their functional biology, five genes remained. Ccl9, Clcn7, Eos, Fra1 and Ostm1 all met the stringent criteria necessary for selection for further investigation. A bioinformatic analysis of the promoter regions for these genes was undertaken to determine mouse-human evolutionary conservation and establish a common mechanism for transcriptional regulation of each gene. Common conserved transcription factor binding sites were identified and candidate M-boxes within their promoter regions were assayed for Mitf binding and transcription activation using a series of in vitro techniques on the cell lines. Electrophoretic mobility shift and promoter-reporter luciferase assays were performed on RAW/C4 cells to demonstrate binding site specificity and promoter activation by Mitf. Consequently osteopetrosis associated protein 1, Ostm1 and chloride channel 7, Clcn7 were identified as specific targets for Mitf transcriptional regulation. Primary cells were also used for Q-PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, which confirmed Mitf regulation of Clcn7. Both Ostm1 and Clcn7 have known mutations that can cause a failure of osteoclast activity and severe osteopetrosis, a phenotype characteristic of particular Mitf mutations. These findings validate the combined bioinformatic and microarray approach used to identify novel Mitf targets during osteoclastogenesis. The identification of two genes, whose expression appears to be regulated by Mitf, that are directly involved with osteoclast resorption suggests the role of Mitf in controlling bone resorption might be more significant than previously perceived. These results indicate that Mitf may be a master regulator of osteoclast bone resorption and genes regulated by Mitf during osteoclast activation may be considered therapeutic targets for the treatment of bone resorption disorders.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158073</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the epidemiology and molecular biology of Koala retrovirus (KoRV)</field><field name="creator">Tarlinton, R. E.</field><field name="description">Gammaretroviruses are known to cause leukaemia, lymphoma and immunosuppression in many species and the original isolation of KoRV (koala retrovirus) (Hanger et al 2000) was made as part of a study into the cause of the high rate of leukaemia and lymphoma in koalas. The virus however displayed some unusual features. While classified as an endogenous (inherited) gammaretrovirus it was unusually active. While endogenous viruses are very common with up to 8% of the human genome consisting of retroviral material they are usually mutated and inactive (Gifford and Tristem 2002). KoRV possessed a full length replication competent genome, was actively transcribed and produced viral particles. KoRV was also very closely related to the exogenous (horizontally transmitted) retrovirus of Gibbons (Gibbon ape leukaemia virus or GaLV). Normally closely related viruses are found in closely related species. This unusual similarity between KoRV and GaLV raised the possibility of a recent host species jump (Hanger et al 2000). This thesis makes a case for the recent introduction of KoRV into the koala genome and ongoing endogenisation into the koala genome. KoRV is demonstrated definitively as an endogenous virus but present at a mixed prevalence within the Australian koala population. The thesis also further characterizes KoRV&#146;s activity and establishes an association between KoRV and disease in koalas. It is difficult to prove that a virus present in all animals in a population (as is the case for most endogenous viruses) is the cause of a particular disease syndrome. Here real time PCR was used to quantify the level of viraemia and proviral DNA load in the blood of individuals. A significant association between high viral load and leukaemia and lymphoma was demonstrated. This was further confirmed in a follow up study of a group of animals where those with a high viral RNA level were at a greater risk of dying from neoplasia. The real time PCR study also indicated that animals suffering from clinical chlamydiosis had higher viral RNA levels than their healthy counterparts though this was not significant. This disease association was further strengthened when KoRV free populations were identified and were shown to have lower incidences of these diseases. The real time PCR studies demonstrated a considerable variation in the proviral copy number in individual animals. With most endogenous retroviruses the proviral copy number is fixed within the species or population (Boeke and Stoye 1997). Southern blotting was used to confirm this variation in copy number and also demonstrated variation in the pattern of these proviral inserts between unrelated animals. The random insertion pattern of KoRV provirus loci was further confirmed using cytogenetics. Sequencing of the KoRV envelope gene revealed marked variation in sequence within individual animals. These sequences despite considerable mutation in some cases were all potentially functional and indicate positive selection pressure for active virus within the individual animals. Inverse PCR was used to identify the koala genomic sequence interrupted by the proviral loci. While koala genomic sequence was successfully amplified no potential oncogenes were found. This study did however demonstrate the presence of truncated KoRV sequences missing a large part of the gagpro- pol gene. Electron microscopy also demonstrated KoRV viral particles in the bone marrow of a leukaemic animal. KoRV had originally been classified as an endogenous virus based on the fact that it was present in all animals tested and in all tissues of individual animals. However the accepted definition of an endogenous virus is one that is present in the germ line DNA and is inherited over several generations (Boeke and Stoye 1997). Single cell PCR of koala sperm was used to demonstrate that KoRV is present in germ line DNA. This was confirmed using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques. Southern blotting of blood obtained from a group of related captive animals showed the inheritance of proviral loci over several generations. To determine whether all koalas carried KoRV loci, samples from geographically diverse populations were obtained. As expected all animals in Queensland were positive for KoRV using PCR techniques. Unexpectedly animals from Kangaroo Island in South Australia were free of KoRV. Samples obtained from Victorian animals demonstrated a mixed KoRV status. The animals on Kangaroo Island have been isolated from other populations since the 1920&#146;s and this raises the possibility that KoRV has integrated into the mainland koala population during the last 100 years. This is unprecedented for an endogenous virus with the most recent estimate for integration in other species being the type C viruses of pigs 5000 years ago (Mang et al 2001). The mixed prevalence of KoRV and its high activity indicate that this virus is still undergoing the process of endogenisation and provides a unique opportunity to study this process in a wild animal population.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270303 Virology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158074</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of Novel Downstream Targets of Sonic, Indian and Desert Hedgehog</field><field name="creator">McCue, Karen Isobel</field><field name="description">The hedgehog signalling pathway is one of the key developmental pathways that plays a critical role in embryonic development, tissue organisation, spatial patterning and tumourigenesis. The importance of this pathway is evidenced by the high degree of conservation of the overall structure of this cell-cell signalling pathway across species. However it is becoming more apparent that specific and important differences in hedgehog signalling do exist in various species. One of the most intriguing of these is the advent of multiple hedgehog ligands in vertebrates, Sonic, Indian and Desert hedgehog, compared to the single hedgehog gene in Drosophila. Hedgehog signalling is essential for normal embryonic development, with disruption of this signalling cascade leading to a variety of developmental disorders and a number of human cancers. Dysregulation of hedgehog signalling is a major factor in the formation of basal cell carcinoma and other solid tumours. The identification of downstream target genes is vital for understanding how perturbation of this pathway so alters the cellular and genetic environment, to allow oncogenic transformation. Historically Sonic hedgehog has been the best characterised of the three hedgehog ligands, and very few downstream targets of Indian and Desert hedgehog have been identified. Whilst Sonic hedgehog is widely expressed in a variety of organs and tissues, Indian and Desert hedgehog have exclusive and more spatially restricted expression patterns. As for many molecules, the increase in the number of hedgehog ligands has been proposed to account for the increase in complexity from Drosophila to vertebrates, allowing more precise control over developmental processes. The three vertebrate ligands display a high degree of sequence homology, however until now no studies had been conducted to compare the suite of downstream target genes controlled by each of the three hedgehog ligands. Using a microarray approach, a direct comparison was made between RNA isolated from a hedgehog responsive embryonic mouse cell line treated with either Sonic, Indian or Desert hedgehog proteins or with a control. A number of known Sonic hedgehog targets were identified and evidence for regulation of some of these genes by Indian and Desert hedgehog obtained. I identified 19 novel validated targets of hedgehog signalling and 4 potential targets. All targets were validated by northern blotting using RNA produced by pathway activation achieved by an alternate mechanism, than that used for the microarray analysis. These novel target genes encode molecules involved in a diverse array of functions including transcriptional regulation, enzymatic catalysis, cell cycle control, intracellular trafficking and organisation of the cytoskeletal architecture. A large number of the novel hedgehog target genes identified are implicated in tumourigenesis and many different types of human cancers. Understanding how aberrant hedgehog signalling regulates these novel target genes may improve our understanding of the process of tumour initiation. I have determined that in the same cell type, under the same conditions, Sonic, Indian and Desert hedgehog do not elicit an identical suite of target genes. Multiple genes were identified as targets of all three hedgehog ligands, however, genes were also identified that were targets of one hedgehog ligand, but not of all three. The work in this thesis has expanded the known targets of hedgehog signalling, in particular elucidating downstream targets of Indian and Desert hedgehog that may expand our understanding of their role in development and tumourigenesis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158075</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Plasma Membrane Calcium-ATPase in Mammary Gland Epithelial Cell Lines and Consequences of its Inhibition in a Model of Breast Cancer</field><field name="creator">Lee, Won Jae</field><field name="description">Ionized calcium (Ca2+), acting as an intracellular messenger, controls numerous biological processes that are essential for life. However, it is also able to convey signals that result in cell death. The fidelity of Ca2+ as a universal second messenger therefore depends on mechanisms that specifically and dynamically regulate its levels within a cell, as well as maintain resting intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) very low. One such mechanism for Ca2+ signaling and homeostasis is the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA), which is a primary active Ca2+ transporter that translocates Ca2+ from a low intracellular Ca2+ environment to a high extracellular environment. There are four mammalian PMCA isoforms (PMCA1&#8722;4), which are differentially expressed depending on tissue or cell type. PMCA isoforms possess different sensitivities to biochemical regulation of Ca2+ efflux activity and are also able to subtly alter the dynamics of Ca2+ signals. These properties suggest that the PMCA is not merely a trivial mechanism for Ca2+ extrusion but is influential in contributing to the Ca2+ signaling requirements and unique physiology of different cells. The indispensable nature of Ca2+ signaling in organs such as the brain, heart and skeletal muscle has been the studied extensively but little is known about the roles and regulation of Ca2+ in the mammary gland. This is despite the fact that the mammary gland is a site of extensive Ca2+ flux during lactation. However, cumulating evidence indicates that upregulation of PMCA2 expression in the mammary gland is a major mechanism for milk Ca2+ enrichment. Therefore, the PMCA is likely to be an important mediator of bulk Ca2+ homeostasis in the mammary gland. Studies in other model systems also suggest that PMCAs may regulate other cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis that are required for normal mammary gland physiology. These basic cellular processes are also disturbed in breast cancer and hence deregulation of PMCA expression in the mammary gland may have pathophysiological consequences. Previous studies show that PMCA1 expression is greater in tumorigenic MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells compared to non-tumorigenic MCF-10A human breast epithelial cells. Furthermore, the expression of PMCA1b and PMCA4b is lower in human skin and lung fibroblasts neoplastically transformed by simian virus 40, compared to non-transformed counterparts. It is therefore hypothesized that regulation of PMCA isoform expression is disrupted in breast cancer and that inhibition of PMCA expression in an in vitro model of breast cancer has important effects in modulating intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. This thesis describes the use of real time RT-PCR to compare PMCA isoform mRNA expression in tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic mammary gland epithelial cells. It demonstrates that particular breast cancer cell lines overexpress PMCA2, an isoform with restricted tissue distribution and which is present in abundant amounts in the lactating rat mammary gland. Thus, some breast cancers may be characterized by the overexpression of Ca2+ transporters that are normally upregulated during the physiological course of lactation. The pathophysiological significance of PMCA2 overexpression in breast cancer is uncertain and future investigations should look at whether levels of PMCA isoform expression correlate with malignancy, prognosis or survival. To address the second hypothesis of this thesis, a stable MCF-7 Tet-off human breast cancer cell line able to conditionally express PMCA antisense was generated. This strategy was necessary due to the current lack of specific pharmacological inhibitors of the PMCA. This thesis shows that PMCA antisense expression significantly inhibits PMCA protein expression, while subtly affecting PMCA-mediated Ca2+ efflux without causing cell death. However, it also reveals that inhibition of PMCA expression has major effects in mediating cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Moderate changes in PMCA expression and PMCA-mediated Ca2+ transport result in dramatic consequences in MCF-7 cell proliferation. These studies not only support the supposition that modulation of Ca2+ signaling is a viable therapeutic approach for breast cancer but also suggest that PMCAs are possible drug targets. Alternatively, inhibitors of the PMCA may act as adjuvants to augment the efficacy of other anti-neoplastic agents like tamoxifen that have been shown to modulate Ca2+ signaling. Since the discovery of a new family of primary active Ca2+ transporters, which are related to PMCAs, the opportunities in this field of research are very promising.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320504 Toxicology (incl.

Macrophage activation contributes to tissue damage in a number of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. Macrophage phenotype and function requires the coordinated expression of specific gene sets in response to extracellular signals. This study used a microarray approach to identify molecules exhibiting macrophage-restricted expression. The expression profile of two mouse macrophage populations (bone marrow-derived macrophages, BMM; and thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages, TEPM) was compared to both immuneand non-immune-related cell types (non-adherent spleen cells and fibroblasts, respectively). The expression of more than 100 genes was found to be restricted to the macrophage lineage. These included genes with known functions in macrophage biology, and also many novel genes. Mpeg1 and gpnmb, two novel macrophage markers were selected for functional studies. The transcriptional regulation of these two genes in in vitro mouse macrophages was characterised. The expression of mpeg1 and gpnmb was found to be highly restricted to macrophages, myelomonocytic cell lines and macrophage-related tissues. Mpeg1 and gpnmb mRNA was repressed by the macrophage growth and differentiation factor, CSF-1, and significantly induced by bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharide. The expression of these genes was also found to be associated with the progression of inflammatory processes in mouse disease models. This thesis is the first report implicating mpeg1 and gpnmb in macrophage inflammatory responses. To further characterise the function of mpeg1 and gpnmb in macrophages, these genes were over-expressed in the macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7 to investigate protein subcellular localisation and determine over-expression-associated phenotypes. In resting macrophages, GPNMB exhibited a perinuclear distribution and co-localised with the Golgi marker &#946;-COP. Upon activation of macrophages with IFN&#947; and LPS, GPNMB appeared to translocate from the Golgi apparatus to vesicular compartments scattered toward the periphery. Gpnmb over-expression in RAW 264.7 cells resulted in 2-fold reduction in the production of LPS-dependent cytokines TNF&#945;, IL-6 and the inflammatory mediator NO. Additional studies were initiated to characterise the in vivo biology of gpnmb in macrophages. The macrophage phenotype of a line of DBA mice with a natural mutation in gpnmb was investigated. Gpnmb mutant mice exhibited reduced numbers of myeloid cells. Additionally, gpnmb mutant mice developed elevated numbers of TEPM and higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to LPS. The data suggests that GPNMB acts as a negative regulator of macrophage inflammatory responses. Like GPNMB, MPEG1 was over-expressed in RAW264.7 cells. Unlike GPNMB, MPEG1 over-expression did not reveal an overt macrophage phenotype. However, MPEG1 co-localised with transferrin, suggesting its association with receptor-mediated pathways. A transgenic mice line expressing mpeg1 in macrophage-specific fashion was generated to enable further studies of the in vivo function of mpeg1 in macrophages, but characterisation of the transgenic line was beyond the scope of this thesis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158077</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE LOYALTY OF THE PRAETORIAN GUARD IN 68 - 69 CE</field><field name="creator">Whiting, Claire</field><field name="description">The loyalty of the Praetorians was of paramount importance to every emperor during 68-69 CE but has unduly suffered because of the gross and unfair misrepresentation of them in the ancient sources.

These features include budding reproduction, the planctomycetecharacteristic crateriform structures on their cell surface, a cell wall that lacks peptidoglycan, internal compartmentalisation and unique molecular features of their rRNA genes. This study chose to investigate a number of aspects of planctomycete cell biology and diversity to further our knowledge of this unique group. In a study of the diversity of ribonuclease P (RNase P) RNA, one molecule of relevance to cell biology and compartmentalisation in planctomycetes, RNase P RNA genes were sequenced for species from all genera of planctomycetes for which a pure culture exists. Secondary structures for RNase P RNA of these strains were deduced, taking to 26 the number of planctomycete RNase P RNA structures. Nucleotide positions were identified in which some planctomycetes possess a less common form, including one thought to be otherwise conserved within all Bacteria and Archaea. Phylogenetic analysis of RNase P RNA genes was relatively consistent with that of 16S rRNA genes with the exception that clustering of Gemmata and anammox sequences occurred, possibly due to either long-branch attraction or lateral gene transfer. Analysis of RNase P RNA secondary structures revealed unusual features of planctomycetes relative to all other bacteria, including an additional helix within the P13 helix of &#145;Candidatus Brocadia anammoxidans&#146;, &#145;Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis&#146; and all Gemmata sequences. The longest P12 helix of any bacteria type A RNase P RNA was found in a Gemmatalike isolate. The short tandem repeats in P12 helices of two Gemmata-like isolates are possibly analogous to short tandem repetitive repeat sequences of some cyanobacteria RNase P RNA. In experiments using Gemmata obscuriglobus as a model for planctomycete cell biology and compartmentalisation functions, electron microscope-level in situ hybridisation (EMISH), and subsequent statistical analysis, was developed to localise 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA and RNase P RNA to particular regions within Gemmata obscuriglobus, the first instance of EMISH being applied in this way to bacteria. Statistical analysis localised 16S rRNA to both nuclear body and to riboplasm outside this region but it was absent from paryphoplasm. While co-localisation of both 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA molecules, which might indicate assembled ribosomes, was rarely observed, 23S rRNA, like 16S rRNA, was distributed in both riboplasm-containing areas of the cell. While statistical analysis revealed minor DNA within riboplasm outside the nuclear body, the majority was localised to that body. These results suggest at least some uncoupling of translation from transcription involving ribosomes in the riboplasm. RNase P RNA was localised both to the nuclear body and to the riboplasm outside this region, suggesting that pre-tRNA processing occurs both within nuclear body, where RNA transcripts are presumably generated, and outside nuclear body, separated from the origin of these transcripts. This is also consistent with the hypothesis that processed tRNA is required in the riboplasm outside the nuclear body, due to occurrence of some uncoupled translation. In research on planctomycetes not yet examined with respect to cell plan or structure, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of isolate ATCC 35122 confirmed its very close relationship to the type strain of Pirellula staleyi and its membership of the phylum Planctomycetes. Morphological characteristics, including polar crateriform structures and the occurrence of a unique internal, single membrane-bounded compartment enclosing nucleoid and ribosome-like particles, the pirellulosome, and a polar cap region, are also consistent with its membership of the planctomycetes and of genus Pirellula. Cells often displayed pointed, hump-like protrusions opposite each other on the cell, constituting prosthecae. Also re-examined using a number of methods were uncultured species Planctomyces bekefii and Pl. guttaeformis. Samples could be enriched for Pl. bekefii via either addition of ferric citrate or ampicillin. An application of a novel approach, laser microdissection and pressure catapulting, was also used physically to enrich P. bekefii rosettes. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation provided the first molecular evidence of Pl. bekefii and Pl. guttaeformis as Planctomycetes. Also confirming Planctomycetes membership of Pl. bekefii was the presence of a cytoplasm divided into two regions by an intracytoplasmic membrane, consistent with membership to the genus Planctomyces. Two new planctomycete-like organisms, MBLW1 and MBLW2, were isolated in this study and possessed a Gemmata-like cell plan. 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed these isolates belonged to the Gemmata clade within phylum Planctomycetes, though they may comprise a separate but closely related genus. Via EMISH, both ATCC 35122 and MBLW1 were hybridised with a planctomycete-specific probe, consistent with membership to the planctomycetes. Statistical analysis showed that 16S rRNA was present in both regions of the riboplasm of MBLW1, identical to the distribution observed G. obscuriglobus. This is another example of possible uncoupled translation within a member of the planctomycetes and within organisms in the Gemmata clade of planctomycetes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270399 Microbiology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158079</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Invisible Displacement Understanding in Dogs (Canis familiaris), Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and Other Primates</field><field name="creator">Collier-Baker, Emma</field><field name="description">The Piagetian invisible displacement task has been used extensively in the field of comparative cognition to measure representational capacity. In the task a desirable object is hidden beneath one of several hiding boxes via a displacement device, such as a small opaque container. Success on the task is deemed to require that the invisible trajectory of the object be mentally represented and its current location inferred. That is, the task is supposed to measure the ability to &#8221;think&#8221; of something that is occurring outside of direct perception. However, simple associative strategies may also lead to success in the absence of stringent control conditions. Among mammals, only great apes and domestic dogs have consistently performed above chance on the invisible displacement task. There is much converging evidence from other tasks to suggest that great apes have a capacity for representational thought. However, dogs have shown few signs of possessing the representational abilities generally thought necessary to pass the task. Thus, in Chapter 2, four experiments investigated how dogs (n = 35) find an object that has been invisibly displaced behind one of three opaque boxes under four control conditions devised to separate associative search strategies from performance based on mental representation. Strategies involving experimenter cue-use, search at the last or first box visited by the displacement device, and search at boxes adjacent to the displacement device were systematically controlled for. Dogs passed invisible displacements, but only if the device used to displace the object was adjacent to the target box following displacements. These results suggest that the search behaviour of dogs was guided by simple associative rules rather than mental representation of the past trajectory of the object. In contrast, Experiment 5 found that, on the same task, 18- and 24-month-old children (n = 21) showed no disparity between trials in which the displacement device was adjacent or non-adjacent to the target box. In Chapter 3, two chimpanzees were tested on single invisible displacements under the same four control conditions that were administered to dogs. In contrast to dogs, chimpanzees showed no indications of utilizing these simple strategies, suggesting that their capacity to mentally represent single invisible displacements is comparable to that of 18- to 24-month-old children. Chapter 4 followed up reports of children and apes' difficulty with double invisible displacements in which an object is hidden at two non-adjacent boxes in a linear array. Experiment 1 eliminated the possibility that chimpanzees' previous poor performance was due to the hiding direction of the displacement device. Subjects failed double non-adjacent displacements, showing a tendency to select adjacent boxes. In Experiments 2 and 3, chimpanzees and 24-month-old children were tested on a new adaptation of the task involving four hiding boxes presented in a diamondshaped array on a vertical plane. Both species performed above chance on double invisible displacements using this format, suggesting that previous poor performance was due to a response bias or inhibition problem rather than a fundamental limitation in representational capacity. In Chapter 5, I conducted a pilot study examining the performance of siamangs and a spider monkey on single and double invisible displacements. Performance was mixed but provides some promising evidence that invisible displacements are within the capacity of siamangs. In contrast to siamangs and chimpanzees, but like dogs, the spider monkey showed a significant tendency to search at a box adjacent to the displacement device on single invisible displacements. However, the spider monkey performed above chance on an impromptu test of single invisible displacements presented in the vertical format. Further study is needed to eliminate alternative associative strategies in these two species. In Chapter 6, I discuss the findings of the studies with dogs, chimpanzees, 2- year-old children, siamangs, and a spider monkey on invisible displacement understanding. The results highlight the importance of associative strategies and inhibition problems. The thesis presents strong evidence for stage 6 invisible displacement understanding, and thus representational thought, in chimpanzees and 2- year-old children, but suggests that dogs are capable of only stage 5 object permanence understanding.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380306 Planning and Problem Solving</field><field name="subject">Piagetian invisible displacement</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158080</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Service recovery: A re-conceptualisation</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Doan Thuy Thi</field><field name="description">Despite considerable effort by organisations to provide excellent service, service failures occur. Increasingly, as the business environment becomes more dynamic and complex, it is unrealistic to expect service delivery to be completely error free (Bansal and Taylor 1999; Keaveney 1995a). When service failure occurs, firms are advised to put in effort to recover customers, because lost customers typically result in substantial financial and reputational loss (Hogan, Lemon and Libai 2003). Moreover, building relationships with customers is always considered as an ideal approach to avoid customers&#146; dissatisfaction with the recovery attempt. However, it appears that the majority (81%) of customers who complain are not happy with the complaint handling process (TARP 2001). The high percentage of dissatisfied customers suggests that current approaches to recovery are largely ineffective (Davidow 2003). In searching for explanations for the ineffectiveness of service recovery strategies, a programmatic research study was conducted. Study 1 is a qualitative study, including Study 1A and Study 1B. Study 1A was conducted on 199 consumer complaint letters, and Study 1B was conducted using 22 in-depth interviews. Study 2 is a quantitative study conducted on a consumer sample of 431 respondents. Study 2A is a scale development study and Study 2B is a structural equation modelling study. The research program is reported in seven chapters. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the thesis. Chapter 2 reviews service recovery literature. Chapter 3 outlines the methodology. Chapter 4 reports the results of Study 1. Chapters 5 and 6 report results of Study 2. Finally, Chapter 7 presents the conclusions, key theoretical and managerial implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research. In sum, the thesis proposes a conceptualisation of service recovery by providing a model that highlights the different aspects of the relationships between the following constructs: (1) Customer Recovery Expectations; (2) Purchase Deliberation Recollection; (3) Customer Emotional Attachment; and (4) customer&#146;s Recovery Expectation Disconfirmation. Customer Recovery Expectations concept reflects the customer&#146;s perception of an appropriate recovery attempt that they prefer in a particular service recovery context. Purchase Deliberation Recollection reflects the customer&#146;s recalled time and effort invested in the purchase deliberation process. Customer Emotional Attachment captures the emotional connection between the customer and the service provider that motivates the customer to act in the provider&#146;s interest. Lastly, the customer&#146;s Recovery Expectation Disconfirmation describes the customer&#146;s comparison between their preferred recovery solution and their received recovery solution. The relationships between these constructs significantly influence the two dependent variables: the customer&#146;s satisfaction with recovery and their repurchase intention. The findings highlight that, in service recovery, creating a customer&#146;s positive perception of recovery expectation matching attempt is the key. To affect this, employees should understand that the customer has a recovery expectation which the organisation should attempt to match. In addition, customers with a good and long term relationship with the organisation tend to have more sympathy when service failure occurs. However, long term customers may also be more demanding and have higher expectations than short term customers. When the organisation fails to recover the service failure for a long term customer, the negative effect of not appropriately recovering may outweigh the positive benefits of having a relationship. Therefore, once a good relationship has been built, organisations should be prepared to invest more resources to maintain it through time. That is, a relationship should be maintained in normal as well as in service failure situations. The findings thus have significant theoretical and managerial implications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350204 Marketing and Market Research</field><field name="subject">720401 Marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158081</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Genetic Studies in Familial Hypercalcaemic Syndromes.</field><field name="creator">Warner, Janet Victoria</field><field name="description">Calcium is an essential component of a multitude of physiological processes in complex organisms. Calcium homeostasis in mammals is achieved via the calcium-parathyroid hormone (PTH)-vitamin D axis, a negative feedback mechanism. Parathyroid hormone is produced by the parathyroid glands. Intrinsic parathyroid overactivity in humans causes primary hyperparathyroidism, a state of hypercalcaemia with non-suppression of PTH secretion. Primary hyperparathyroidism usually occurs sporadically but may be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Inherited primary hyperparathyroidism may present in isolation, as Familial Isolated Hyperparathyroidism (FIHP) or Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcaemia (FHH). It may also be a feature of the tumour syndromes Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Types 1 and 2A (MEN1 and MEN2A) and Hyperparathyroidism Jaw-Tumour Syndrome (HPT-JT). The FIHP phenotype (increased serum calcium concentration, elevated PTH and increased urinary calcium excretion) may be caused by sequence variations in one of several genes. These genes are MEN1, variations in which usually give rise to MEN1, CASR, which usually causes the FHH phenotype and HRPT2, from which affected families usually get HPT-JT. The genetic cause of most of cases of FIHP, however, is unknown. In this study, 23 individuals with the FIHP phenotype were investigated to determine the proportion of cases due to variations in MEN1, CASR or HRPT2. Altogether, 5 cases (22%) were caused by MEN1 mutations, 4 (17%) by CASR mutations and none through mutation of HRPT2. These results suggested that MEN1 and CASR, but not HRPT2, should be routinely sequenced in all pedigrees with FIHP. As the clinical course of individuals with MEN1 and CASR variations tends to differ from those with FIHP of unknown genetic cause, screening has significant management implications for patients and their kindred. The 14 remaining cases of FIHP without variations in MEN1, CASR and HRPT2 confirmed that the genetic basis of most cases of FIHP is unknown. Ten of these individuals and their families were ascertained for a study using a genome-wide scan of microsatellite markers, genetic linkage analysis and fine mapping of DNA to attempt to identify the genetic basis for their disorder. Linkage analysis of genotyping data from the genome-wide scan and fine mapping revealed a 1.7 Mb interval of significant genetic linkage (LOD score 3.43) for FIHP on chromosome 2. A region of suggestive linkage (LOD score 1.83) in close proximity on chromosome 2 was also found. Fine mapping of the 1.7Mb interval using SNPs reduced its length to 1.2Mb. This region, between nucleotides 67,125,363 and 68,319,577, contains 4 known, 11 predicted and 5 putative genes. It is likely that further fine mapping by SNP genotyping and sequencing of candidate genes will divulge the location of a gene which, when pathologically altered, gives rise to FIHP. The central role of the parathyroid glands in calcium homeostasis makes identification of this gene highly desirable. Analysis of its function is predicted to improve understanding and management of parathyroid disease and enhance general understanding of calcium metabolism. CASR encodes the cell surface calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). CaSR is expressed in many tissues and has multiple proven and possible roles. FIHP is an atypical manifestation of CASR mutation. Some of the individuals with CASR mutations and FIHP in this study had additional unusual features such as urate nephrolithiasis and psoriasis. To explain why some CASR mutations appear to exert unique physiological effects, it was hypothesised that particular mutations induce specific abnormalities in post-receptor signaling. Preliminary work to establish an in vitro system to test post-receptor signaling by mutant CaSRs was undertaken. Wildtype and HA-tagged CASR constructs were generated and shown to be expressed by transiently transfected CHO cells. An antibody-based CaSR detection assay was established for Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. It is anticipated that the constructs will be used to establish stably transfected CaSR-expressing cell lines that can be used to test post-receptor signaling. Subcellular localization of mutant receptor constructs will be assessable using the validated antibodies. This work has clarified the use of genetic testing in FIHP and narrowed the gap to finding a gene which, when pathologically altered, causes FIHP. The preliminary CaSR work paves the way for further investigation of wildtype and mutant CaSR signalling in various cell types under different physiological conditions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158082</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On Interactive Document Classification</field><field name="creator">Chen, Ding-Yi</field><field name="description">Interactive Document Classification (IDC) is designed to accomplish document classification through interaction with user. Most users are not capable of explicitly defining rules to express their preferences for classification results. However, it is relatively easy for users to express their opinions by dragging misclassified documents to a correct place without describing the technical details of what is being done. IDC systems act like human secretaries &#150; they interpret and classify incoming documents, whenever the user points out some mistakes, they modify their knowledge of classification and use the newly obtained knowledge to review previous work and find out mistakes which have not yet been pointed out. This approach seems plausible, however, we observe that there are three problems which may cause the classification ineffective and inefficient. The first problem is the scarceness of training instances. In IDC, the user tends to point out only the misclassified documents, not the correct ones. Moreover, it is unlikely that a user would be diligent enough to identify all the misclassified documents. This causes the learning of the IDC systems immature. The second problem is that users may only comment on a small number of misclassified documents. Uncommented misclassified documents can lower the overall classification effectiveness if they are not identified and corrected. The third problem concerns the unfitness of a document model. The model might lack important features and contain a glut of trivial features. Conflict instances are unavoidable if some important features are not included in the document model, while over-fitting is resulted from the trivial features of the model. In this thesis, we propose a framework of IDC &#150; Prediction-Learning-Distillation (PLD) &#150; to address above problems. Firstly, PLD framework overcomes immature learning by augmenting the training set. Whenever user points out misclassified documents, PLD learns from these mistakes and identifies the same mistakes among all other classified documents. PLD then enforces its learning for future classifications. The learning happens whenever user points out misclassified documents and corrects them. If the classifier fails to accept relevant documents or reject irrelevant documents on certain categories, PLD will assign those documents as new positive/negative training instances. The classifier can then patch its weakness by learning from these new training instances. The results of our experiments have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can learn from user identified misclassified documents and then distil the rest successfully. Secondly, PLD also provides the necessary functionality for detecting uncommented misclassified documents. After learning from new training instances, PLD distils the uncommented misclassified documents from uncommented documents. The experiments have illustrated that the distiller algorithm can successfully detect uncommented misclassified documents. In addition, we propose an objective measurement method for evaluating the fitness of document models for a specific classification task. The fitness of a document model is measured by two aspects: sufficiency and compactness. The sufficiency of document model indicates whether the model is sufficient to represent the documents and the compactness indicates whether the document can be represented by fewer features. After the computation of sufficiency and compactness, an overall fitness score can be obtained using sufficiency-compactness break-even. Our experiments show that the proposed approaches improve the effectiveness and efficiency of interactive document classification, particularly for on-line and streaming applications. The main contributions of this thesis include: providing a highly effective and efficient IDC framework so that classification algorithms and document modelling techniques can be easily &#147;plugged-in&#148; as modules of the framework, demonstrating an effective method for discovering the uncommented mistakes using previous user feedback and providing a method for objective measurement of the fitness of document models.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158083</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A STRUCTURAL USE OF RENEWABLE LIGHTWEIGHT MATERIAL</field><field name="creator">Goh, Gim Yau</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the structural adequacy of using a renewable lightweight material, bamboo, to construct a commonly used lattice structure, double layer grid, in a dimension of 2.6m x 2.6m x 0.9m. The structural potential of two Australian grown bamboo species, Phyllostachy Pubesecens and Phyllostachy Bambusoides, were conducted through compression, bending and buckling tests. A structurally stronger bamboo specie was then chosen to build the grid and subjected to a total load of 10kN testing. Material elastic geometry non-linear analysis using high order beam-column elements were performed to predict the deformation characteristics of the grid for comparison with test data. An important feature of this project was the development of a lightweight PVC (polyvinyl chloride) joint system, consisted of hub and connector, to connect bamboo members. The designed joint system was simple, efficient in fabrication and assembly, and was economical. Finite element method (FEM) was adopted to establish the detailed configuration of the joint and to perform both material and geometry linear structural analysis. A total of 8 joint prototypes were tested under load cases of tension, compression and bending, and the results were validated with FEM. This thesis proved that Mao Jue was mechanically strong for structural application, and the proposed new joint system worked well with bamboo in the grid.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158084</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Child sexual abuse occurrence and outcome: Investigation of prospective longitudinal data for a birth cohort</field><field name="creator">Blakemore, Tamara-Jane</field><field name="description">Child sexual abuse is a widespread social problem found to be associated with detrimental outcomes in both the short and long term. Efforts by researchers to develop comprehensive understandings of the factors and processes associated with abuse occurrence and outcome have been hampered by a lack of consensus across theory and epistemology. The complexity of the problem has also meant that few studies have attempted to examine risk factors for the occurrence of child sexual abuse simultaneously with outcomes. Attending to this observed gap in the literature, this thesis examined the relationship between factors specific to children, their families and social environments, and the occurrence and outcomes of child sexual abuse for participants in an Australian prospective longitudinal cohort study. Guided by a conceptual framework based on concepts from developmental psychopathology, ecological theory and the &#145;Integrated Risk-Sequelae&#146; model of child maltreatment (Higgins &amp; McCabe, 1994), the thesis investigated the hypothesis that sexually abused and non-abused children differ significantly across child, family and environmental factors, and that these differences in context synergistically influence both the occurrence and outcome of child sexual abuse. To clarify these relationships, the study assessed the relative influence of sexual abuse and contextual factors upon child outcomes by exploring the potential of sexual abuse to affect outcomes through both direct and indirect pathways. The data source for the study (de-identified survey data with linked child protection information) provided a unique life course perspective on the experiences of sexually abused children, and in contrast to other studies, enabled a wide range of contextual factors to be investigated as potential risk factors for the occurrence of child sexual abuse and its outcome or sequelae over time. The study finds that when compared to their non-abused counterparts, sexually abused children experience greater vulnerability and disadvantage across multiple aspects and phases of their life. While mothers of sexually abused children report significantly higher rates of child problems when compared to mothers of non-abused children, no significant differences exist between sexually abused and non-abused children&#146;s self report of social, emotional and behavioural outcomes. Examination of the relationship between contextual factors and sexual abuse confirm the hypothesis that observed differences between the contextual domains of sexually abused and non-abused children are associated with increased risk for both the occurrence and outcome of child sexual abuse. Assessment of the relative influence of sexual abuse and contextual factors upon maternal and child self-reported outcomes for all children, finds that when the effect of contextual factors is taken into account, sexual abuse does not make a significant contribution to report of child health outcomes. Exploration of the potential for sexual abuse to affect outcomes through indirect pathways finds little support for the presence or operation of moderation or confounding effects, but does find considerable support for the proposition that contextual factors mediate the relation between sexual abuse maternal reports of child outcome. This thesis also finds that factors specific to the sexual abuse experience are significantly associated with sexually abused children&#146;s self-reported outcomes even when the effects of contextual factors are considered. This effect does not hold for maternal report of child outcomes, suggesting that while contextual factors exert a strong influence on maternal-reported outcomes, characteristics of the sexual abuse experience, rather than the sexual abuse itself, may be an important influence on sexually abused children&#146;s self reported outcomes. Collectively, the findings of this thesis suggest that the occurrence and outcomes of child sexual abuse exist as a function of multiple factors that operate via dynamic processes or mechanisms over time. The study is unique in the Australian context and makes several important findings that add to the knowledge base for child sexual abuse.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370200 Social Work</field><field name="subject">750312 Youth/child development and welfare</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158085</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GABAergic Inhibition In The Basal Amygdala</field><field name="creator">Woodruff, Alan Robert</field><field name="description">The amygdala is a temporal lobe structure that is a crucial component of the neural processes underlying emotion. The basolateral complex (BLA) of the amygdala comprises the lateral (LA) and basal nuclei (BL), and is considered the input side of the amygdala. Although its role in emotional processing is well accepted, little characterisation of the intrinsic circuitry of the BLA has taken place. Furthermore, despite the powerful inhibitory control that the amygdala is under for the vast majority of time, the inhibitory circuitry of the BLA is particularly poorly understood. We have addressed this shortcoming by making dual whole-cell recordings from the neurochemically defined subpopulation of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons in the basal nucleus of the amygdala, allowing a detailed characterisation of BL GABAergic circuitry. Using transgenic mice engineered to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the PV promoter, we demonstrate considerable heterogeneity amongst the PV+ interneuron population. On the basis of their firing properties, PV+ interneurons were separated into four classes. We show that PV+ interneurons are electrically coupled to each other, and further demonstrate that such coupling is restricted to interneurons of the same class. Thus four distinct networks of chemically and electrically connected PV+ interneurons are present in the BL. By making paired recordings from synaptically connected principal neurons and PV+ interneurons, we demonstrate subtype-specific heterogeneities in the properties of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. Furthermore, we show that the patterns of connectivity are also subtype-specific. The combination of these findings suggests different functional roles for different interneuron classes. We therefore conclude that in the mouse BL, four distinct networks of chemically and electrically connected PV+ interneurons are present, each of which is suited to perform a specialised role in intra-amygdaloid processing.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158086</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structuring &amp; Visualising Risk Management</field><field name="creator">Ho, Wei Seng Alan</field><field name="description">The dictionary defines risk as the potential harm that may arise from some present process or from some future event while vulnerability is the state of being vulnerable or exposed. Risk management helps to boost security by analysing current vulnerabilities in the organisation and assessing their likelihood in relation to the materialisation of a risk. In this project&#146;s context, a relationship between risk and vulnerability can be defined as a particular vulnerability that is contributing to the materialisation of a risk. However, such relationships between risks and vulnerabilities are often complex and poses a challenge for human understanding. It is necessary to provide visualisation to easily see the relationships between risks and vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities that are contributing to the materialisation of a risk. In this project, the development of a causal network was proposed to visualise the relationships between risks and vulnerabilities. Through using deduction to reason about the likelihood of the risk under conditions of the presence or absence of vulnerabilities, the proposed causal network can help to structure the vulnerabilities into categories with relation to the risks that they are contributing to. Then, with visualisation included to present the categorisation, it allows the user to have a structured way in seeing a top-level view of risks that are high, medium or low in severity as well as a drill-down view of individual vulnerabilities that are contributing to a risk. In addition, a belief calculus called Subjective Logic (SL) was introduced to aid risk experts in expressing their opinion about vulnerabilities and risks in a more realistic approach, which is enabling them to differentiate between their gut feeling and past experiences. Instead of representing opinion in a one-dimensional (1D) scalar format, SL is adapted to represent conditional and joint probability calculations, as well as combining two joint probabilities in a three-dimensional (3D) format (belief, disbelief and uncertainty). This provides a richer input for risk assessment because SL is suitable for such situation where there is more or less uncertainty about whether a given proposition is true or false. The visualisation strategy is also adapted to exploit the richer risk assessment so that it provides the user a richer risk picture that enables them to make value&#150;added risk assessment and mitigation strategies. This project believes the causal network together with SL can help organisation allocate valuable resources to derive mitigation strategies to resolve risks.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158087</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE ROLE OF EPHS AND EPHRINS IN MELANOMA METASTASIS AND AS POTENTIAL TARGETS FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY</field><field name="creator">Stylianou, Con</field><field name="description">During development, Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands are expressed in a temporally and spatially restricted manner, governing the migration and positioning of cells, performing critical developmental roles including the formation of the vascular system. Ephs are expressed at far lower levels in adult tissues, and are ectopically overexpressed in a variety of malignancies where they consistently correlate with increased tumourigenesis. In this context, they are proposed to mediate metastasis, the most insidious aspect of cancer. Cytokines within the tumour microenvironment may facilitate tumourigenesis. The ability of cytokines to regulate the expression of Ephs and ephrins suggests there may be an underlying pathway linking these three factors. Further, the aberrant expression of Eph and ephrins in neoplastic tissues, coupled to their absence in adult tissues, makes them ideal candidates for targeted immunotherapy. Real Time PCR was used to determine if cytokines could regulate the expression of Eph and ephrin genes in three melanoma cell lines. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) decreased EphA3 expression and Interferon-g (IFN-g) increased the expression of ephrin A4, and decreased the expression of ephrin A1 and EphB3. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF) increased the expression of EphA3, EphA4, EphB1, ephrin A3 and ephrin B1. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) increased the expression of EphB2 whereas transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) did not affect the expression of any Eph or ephrins. The potential role of EphA3, ephrins A1, A5, B2 and B3 in melanoma metastasis was examined in vivo following ectopic over-expression of these proteins in a nonmetastatic melanoma cell line (A02-JLO). The ectopic over-expression of these proteins did not confer to A02-JLO cells the ability to form metastases following subcutaneous or intravenous inoculation into nude mice. However, significant differences were noted in subcutaneous growth. EphA3, ephrin A1, ephrin B2 or ephrin B3 expression significantly attenuated, whereas ephrin A5 expression significantly increased tumour growth relative to parental or vector control cells. In vitro proliferation assays indicated all lines proliferated equally and CD31 immunostaining identified increased vessel density in EphA3, ephrin A1, ephrin B2 or ephrin B3 expressing tumours, suggesting the presence of functionally impaired vessels. The more rapidly growing ephrin A5 expressing tumours displayed similar blood vessel density to parental and vector control cells, however examination of H&amp;E sections identified the presence of &#147;patterned networks&#148; indicative of a more aggressive tumour phenotype. Further, the lack of correlation between CD31 immunoreactivity and the number of vessel-like structures observed in H&amp;E sections suggests the occurrence of &#147;vasculogenic mimicry&#148;. Finally, the therapeutic potential of an anti-EphA3 monoclonal antibody (monomeric or dimeric IIIA4) was determined both in vitro and in vivo. Real time-PCR (Q-PCR) of nude mouse tissues and an in vivo tissue distribution study of radiolabeled IIIA4 in an EphA3 positive melanoma xenograft model, confirmed the absence of EphA3 in adult nude mouse tissues, and the ability of IIIA4 to selectively target EphA3 positive melanoma xenografts. Prevention studies identified that IIIA4 dimer, but not IIIA4 monomer, was able to significantly attenuate EphA3 positive melanoma xenograft growth, which coincided with a significant increase in vessel number. In a model of disseminated leukaemia, monomeric IIIA4 and dimeric IIIA4 significantly attenuated leukaemic cell engraftment in the peripheral blood and infiltration into splenic tissue, whereas Mabthera (Rituxan&#174;) could not attenuate either. In vitro assays determined that monomeric or dimeric IIIA4 failed to stimulate significant immune mediated lysis. Taken together, the above data suggests that Eph or ephrin expression alone is not sufficient to mediate melanoma metastasis. The present study identifies for the first time that ephrin A5 expression increases tumour aggressiveness and significantly alters tumour vascularisation. Further, manipulation of Eph or ephrin expression may lead to the formation of function-impaired blood vessels. Importantly, IIIA4 can effectively target EphA3 positive tumours and may be a powerful immunotherapeutic tool following humanisation to boost immunogenicity, or used as a vehicle to deliver cytotoxic drugs with unsurpassed avidity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158088</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development, Civil Society and Democracy in New Order Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Otter, Mark Damien</field><field name="description">This thesis examines whether economic development can deliver democracy. It specifically examines the case of one Asian country, Indonesia, in one historical period &#150; the &#145;New Order&#146; from 1966 to 1998. Indonesia during the New Order appears to contradict the conventional wisdom that economic growth triggers a transition to democracy in that it was a time when considerable economic development took place and yet the country remained under an authoritarian dictatorship. The thesis traces the rise of a number of middle class civil society organisations and movements which came about as a result of increased economic development and observes whether there was an increase in democratic activism within those organisations and movements. It finds some evidence of the expected economic developmentdemocratisation pathways, yet there was no democratic transition, at least not for many years. There is a number of interrelated reasons why this transition did not occur. First, although the middle class did grow, its size was not as great as in some comparable developing countries. Second, the middle class did not deliver the sufficient number of political activists to mobilise the wider population that the theory of democratising civil society would suggest. Third, political manipulation by the regime and its agents was sufficiently strong to deter or undermine the forces of democratisation. Finally, although there were serious divisions within the government at various stages (which is often a catalyst for regime change), they were not sufficiently strong to result in its collapse. The conclusion is that economic development is a powerful contributor to democratisation but, by itself, it is not a sufficiently strong force to result in democratic transition. Economic development is mediated by particular political, cultural and historical influences in a dynamic mix affecting the process of democratisation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158089</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ELECTRICITY MARKET PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT</field><field name="creator">Xu, Zhao</field><field name="description">In the past decade, the electric power industries have experienced a significant period of reconstruction and deregulation. The vertically integrated power utilities have been progressively deregulated into competitive electricity markets. Since ever, fundamental changes have been introduced into both system operation and planning, and traditional planning and management methods may no longer be appropriate for the new environment. Therefore, the deregulated power industries are calling for innovative planning and management methods to address those changes in the competitive environment. This thesis sets out to develop new methods and techniques for power system planning and management to meet the harsh demands of competitive electricity markets. It consist of two parts with the first being Electricity Market Operation and Management, and the second being Electricity Market Expansion Planning. Motivated by the facts that deregulated power system are facing severe security problems, the first part of the thesis focuses on the development of a management framework for system operation security. The framework developed features an integrated energy and Ancillary Service market model. Genetic Algorithms are used to coordinately dispatch both electricity and Ancillary Services in one optimization approach. In addition, a Wavelet Transform and Support Vector Machine based short-term demand and price forecasting scheme has been developed as an important supporting system to the management framework. The second part of the thesis studies the expansion planning in the market environment. A hybrid multi-objective optimization model for transmission network expansion planning, which includes stages of human knowledge based candidate line selection, multi-objective optimization and final security evaluation, has been developed to address new concerns appeared in the market environment. Since the developed planning technique considers single future scenario and utilizes human knowledge in optimization, the proposed method has been further discussed in terms of dynamic planning and planner&#146;s preference. In addition, to address the uncertainties appeared in the deregulation, probabilistic methods for system operation and planning analyses have been also studied. Probabilistic approaches for small signal stability analysis and economic constrained available transfer capability evaluation have been developed based on Monte Carlo simulation technique. These probabilistic methods consider not only new concerns but also many uncertainties and therefore provide comprehensive information for system planning and operation analyses. In summary, the thesis has made major contributions of a management framework featuring an integrated Ancillary Service and energy market, a new forecasting scheme, a multi-objective optimization approach for transmission network planning, and probabilistic approaches for small signal stability analysis and transfer capability evaluation.

Because these fuels are less reactive than hydrogen, mechanical and chemical combustion aids have become common features in the engines intended for use with hydrocarbon fuels. This investigation explores both a mechanical and chemical scheme for aiding the combustion of gaseous ethylene: the radical farming scramjet engine configuration and a premixed supplemental oxidizer. The radical farming scramjet engine was designed to allow combustion at average combustion chamber temperatures lower than those of typical scramjet engine configurations. It was theorized that a large reduction in skin friction could be achieved by this method. Hydrogen was used to fuel the engine for the previous experiments. This investigation presents results obtained from the use of gaseous ethylene as the fuel for the radical farming scramjet engine. Experiments were conducted over a nominal nozzle supply enthalpy of 3MJ/kg to 7MJ/kg. The thrust from the experiments was calculated by integrating the centerline pressure distribution over the thrust surface area. A one dimensional thrust prediction was constructed by assuming complete combustion of the fuel at all equivalence ratios. Experimental results were compared to the theoretical prediction at nozzle supply enthalpy of 7MJ/kg and 4MJ/kg. Agreement with the one dimensional thrust prediction was observed at equivalence ratios from 0 to 0.4 for a nozzle supply enthalpy of 7MJ/kg and from 0 to 0.2 for a nozzle supply enthalpy of 4MJ/kg. Above these ranges, the experimental thrust coefficients were found to be lower than the one dimensional prediction. Experimental incremental specific impulse was determined by considering the difference in thrust caused by the injection of a given amount of fuel. Values from the experiments were compared to theoretical and experimental results from previous studies. It was observed that the incremental specific impulse from experiments at Hs = 7MJ/kg was 1 4 to 1 3 of the impulse predicted in a previously performed quasi-two dimensional analysis for hydrogen. Ethylene was expected to produce approximately half that of hydrogen. Previous experiments with ethylene were cited to demonstrate that the discrepancy between experimental results of the current study and the previously performed quasi-two dimensional analysis was a result of the different flight speeds and varying nozzle expansion ratios. To mix a supplemental source of oxidizer with the fuel prior to injection, an oxygen delivery system was installed in the T4 shock tunnel. This system functioned similar to the T4 Fuel Delivery System. The injection system of the radical farming scramjet engine was modified to allow the safe mixing of fuel and oxygen before injection into the engine core. The combined fuel and oxygen injection system was tested prior to experiments using oxygen enrichment. The system was calibrated such that the amount of supplemental oxidizer was capable of stoichiometrically reacting with approximately 25% of the fuel. Experiments were conducted with oxygen enrichment over a nominal nozzle supply enthalpy of 3MJ/kg to 7MJ/kg. Enrichment results from experiments with nozzle supply enthalpy of 4MJ/kg to 7MJ/kg were examined for evidence of a decrease in the distance required for combustion, an increase in thrust, or an increase in incremental specific impulse. Average pressure distributions were used to demonstrate a decrease of up to 90mm in the distance required for the combustion of ethylene. No notable increase in thrust or incremental specific impulse was observed. A repeatable low equivalence ratio separation bubble phenomenon was observed in several enriched experiments at all test conditions. The phenomenon was determined to be a transient effect of the enrichment which consistently produced choked flow through the engine. Experiments at 3MJ/kg were examined for evidence of combustion. A similar transient bubble behavior was observed during these experiments at low equivalence ratios. Nitrogen was substituted for the oxidizer to demonstrate that the separation bubble phenomenon was the result of combustion immediately after injection.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158091</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nafion Nanocomposite Membranes for the Direct Methanol Fuel Cell</field><field name="creator">Ladewig, Bradley Paul</field><field name="description">Direct methanol fuel cells are seen as an attractive potential replacement for lithium ion batteries in small portable electronic devices. Crucial to the operation of direct methanol fuel cells is the proton exchange membrane, which conducts protons from the anode to the cathode, while acting as an insulator to electrons. The proton exchange membrane should also act as a physical barrier to the methanol and water at the anode, and the air or oxygen at the cathode, however the most commonly used proton exchange membrane, Nafion, suffers from significant methanol permeation from the anode to the cathode during operation. This results in markedly reduced performance, as the methanol reacts with oxygen at the cathode leading to a mixed potential, and the overall cell efficiency is reduced because the methanol does not react at the anode. Consequently, there is a significant effort in a number of laboratories worldwide to develop new proton exchange materials with high proton conductivity and low methanol permeability, or to modify existing materials such as Nafion to enhance these properties. This thesis examined the effect of modifying Nafion membranes through in situ sol gel synthesis of silicon oxide nanoparticles with varying surface chemistry and microstructure. Detailed structural characterisation of the composite structure was undertaken using a wide variety of techniques including small angle X-ray and neutron scattering, wide-angle X-ray scattering, thermal analysis techniques and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. Transport properties of the composite membranes were evaluated by impedance spectroscopy and pervaporation techniques. A structural model was proposed to explain the structure of the composite membranes formed using mono-, di- and tri-functional silicon alkoxide precursors. Nafion composite membranes synthesised using (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane as the silicon alkoxide precursor were found to have highly favourable transport properties. In particular, their selectivity for transport of protons over methanol molecules was found to more than three times that of Nafion 117. The performance of the composite membranes in a 5 cm2 direct methanol fuel cell was not completely consistent with the transport properties, which was attributed to factors in the preparation of the membrane electrode assemblies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158092</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Work-related Subjective Experiences, Work-related Self-efficacy and Vocational Status among Urban Residents with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder</field><field name="creator">Waghorn, Geoffrey R. M.</field><field name="description">Background: Subjective experiences perceived to impact on employment and self-efficacy for core activities required in psychiatric vocational rehabilitation, were identified as alternative sources to diagnostic information, potentially more suitable for routine use in psychiatric vocational rehabilitation. Aims: The main aim was to investigate the hypothesis that the relationship between work-related subjective experiences and vocational status is mediated by work-related self-efficacy, after controlling for the influences of other known demographic and clinical correlates of vocational status. Methods: A measure of subjective experiences perceived to impact on employment was developed in two pilot studies. This, and a second measure of work-related self-efficacy, were then used in a 12 month longitudinal investigation. The work-related self-efficacy construct consisted of self-efficacy for the core activities required throughout vocational rehabilitation. A measure of vocational status and socially-valued role functioning was also developed as a sensitive outcome variable. Baseline measures (n1 = 104) were repeated at 6 months (n2 = 94) and 12 months (n3 = 94). Results: All three measures had adequate preliminary psychometric properties and promising utility. Work-related subjective experiences and work-related self-efficacy were consistently associated with both current employment and vocational status after controlling for known correlates of vocational status. Work-related self-efficacy appeared to mediate the relationship between work-related subjective experiences and vocational status. Conclusions: Work-related subjective experiences and work-related self-efficacy have promising practical and theoretical implications for psychiatric vocational rehabilitation. Classifying socially-valued role functioning in vocational rehabilitation and community mental health care settings appears to help individuals set role priorities and personal role recovery goals, and can be used to monitor the progress of individuals or groups either within single role domains or across multiple socially-valued roles.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158093</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary Psychology, Complexity Theory and Evolution of Social and Legal Rules</field><field name="creator">Fisher, Hilary</field><field name="description">Evolutionary theories accounting for legal emergence offer important insights to add to orthodox jurisprudential debate. It is proposed that the nature of law can be more satisfactorily or comprehensively appreciated by incorporating an evolutionary perspective. This thesis uses the generic variation-selection-retention paradigm of Donald T Campbell as the conceptual framework for considering how the biological and cultural evolutionary processes add these valuable insights into the nature of the law. FA Hayek approved and adopted Campbell&#146;s model to produce the thesis on legal evolution that is the subject of his works The Constitution of Liberty and Law Legislation and Liberty. Hayek&#146;s thesis is considered to be the most sophisticated and comprehensive analysis of the application of evolutionary theory to legal development. By investigating recent advances in the scientific disciplines of complex systems theory, evolutionary psychology and theories of cultural evolution in the context of a Hayekian-Campbellian framework this thesis aims to augment, consolidate and complement these early important works. This thesis updates Hayek&#146;s examination of society as a production of self-organised and spontaneously ordering behaviour by examining the growing literature applying the non-linear sciences of complexity theory and chaos theory to legal philosophy. Rules are a product of innate rule-following behaviour or attempts by people to coerce others into rule-abiding conduct. Many of these behaviours are explicable on a biologically-derived evolutionary basis or as an interplay of genetic predispositions with the cultural evolutionary process. Evolutionary psychology as a scientific rationale for human behaviours contributes significantly to an understanding of legally relevant behaviour in terms of genetic traits that have evolved to solve the adaptive challenges of the social environment. Rules and laws are items of cultural inheritance the survival of which may be understood in terms of cultural evolution or memetic theory. Explaining both biological traits and cultural products as the product of selectors at various levels of a nested hierarchy of vicarious selectors can reveal insights into the process of legal emergence. These insights may also inform questions of the usefulness and feasibility of different laws and legal approaches as well as providing a factual basis for a discussion of normative considerations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158094</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resistance on the line: A history of Australian telephonists and their trade unions, 1880-1988</field><field name="creator">Rickertt, Jeffrey</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">180118 Labour Law</field><field name="subject">Telephone operators -- Australia -- History.</field><field name="subject">Labor unions -- Australia -- History.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158095</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Tourism Development on Local Poor People : A Case Study of Qinling Mountain Region, Shaanxi Province, China</field><field name="creator">Zeng, Benxiang</field><field name="description">Protected areas are one of the main tourist attractions and home to many poor people living in and around them in many developing countries. Tourism development in such areas requires linking nature conservation with poverty elimination. Although attracting more concern, the actual benefits accessible to the local poor is inevitably neglected or misunderstood. This work identifies the correlation between tourism and poverty alleviation by tracing the cash flows to the local poor, review the social and environmental effects of tourism on the local area and establishes a community-based sustainable tourism-eliminating poverty strategy framework. The case study was conducted in a group of protected areas in the Qinling Mountain Region in Western China. The study focuses on local poor people, but does not exclude other stakeholders. Since the case study region is a typical representation of the combination and overlapping of the multiple needs for tourism development, poverty reduction and biodiversity conservation, which are faced by many other developing countries in the world, it is expected that the findings and recommendations can be applied to other regions in China, as well as other developing countries.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cash flow; China; Economic; Local community; Model; Poverty; Protected areas; ST-EP; Strategy; Tourism.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158096</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcription factors involved in the regulation of pathogen defence in the plant Arabidopsis</field><field name="creator">McGrath, Kenneth Charles</field><field name="description">Plants are continually exposed to a vast array of pathogens, and generally succeed in defending themselves. An important part of this process is the induction of defence gene products that hinder pathogen growth and delay or prevent disease development. The way in which plants do this is multi-factorial, and includes regulatory proteins known as transcription factors (TFs) which directly regulate the expression of defence-related genes. The expression and activity of these TFs can be differentially regulated by pathogen challenge, as well as following exposure to defence-related signalling molecules such as methyl jasmonate (MeJA). To identify TFs potentially involved in MeJA signalling and plant defence, the expression of all 1,534 putative Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) TF genes identified in the genome (at the time) were screened by Real-Time Quantitative PCR (RT-Q-PCR) for altered transcript expression 6 h following either MeJA treatment or inoculation with the incompatible fungal pathogen Alternaria brassicicola. This primary screen identified 134 TF genes that showed a significant change in expression compared to mock-treated plants, and included many genes of previously unknown function belonging to APETALA2/Ethylene Response Factor (AP2/ERF), MYB, WRKY, and NAC TF gene families. Twenty-four of these TF genes were shown to be repressed or induced by MeJA, as well as repressed or induced by A. brassicicola (i.e. co-regulated). A high proportion of these co-regulated genes were members of either the AP2/ERF or WRKY TF gene families. Selected TF genes that showed significant differential regulation following MeJA exposure or A. brassicicola inoculation were profiled in a four-point timecourse over a 24 h period. It was found that the AP2/ERF TF genes identified in the primary screen were the most consistently and reproducibly regulated family of genes. The majority of these regulated TF genes belong to two distinct subclusters of AP2/ERFs in an amino acid based sequence similarity tree, implicating the B3 and B1a subclusters in MeJA signalling and A. brassicicola defence. One gene from each subcluster was chosen for further analysis, based on its consistent pattern of induction by MeJA and A. brassicicola as well as the compatible fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. These two TFs were AtERF2 (B3 cluster) and AtERF4 (B1a cluster). Transgenic Arabidopsis plants were generated that stably overexpress the AtERF2 TF gene. Analysis of these plants revealed that this TF is a positive regulator of a subset of MeJA-responsive defence genes encoding the antimicrobial proteins PDF1.2 and CHIB. Additionally, AtERF2-overexpressing lines displayed increased resistance to the fungal pathogen F. oxysporum compared to wild-type plants, as well as enhanced sensitivity to the MeJA-inhibition of root elongation. In contrast to the positive regulation displayed by AtERF2, functional analysis of AtERF4 by both stable overexpression and insertional inactivation in Arabidopsis clearly demonstrated that AtERF4 acts as a negative regulator of the MeJAresponsive expression of PDF1.2. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that AtERF4 acts as a negative regulator of resistance to F. oxysporum and antagonizes the MeJAinhibition of root elongation. Overall, the work undertaken during this PhD has identified two conserved clusters of AP2/ERF TFs with members that display contrasting roles in the regulation of defence gene expression, along with resistance to F. oxysporum and root sensitivity to MeJA. These results suggest that plants co-ordinately express multiple repressor- and activator-type AP2/ERFs during pathogen challenge to modulate defence gene expression and hence the development of disease. By identifying and characterising selected members of the AP2/ERF TF family, this work has provided a greater understanding of the mechanisms of the plant defence response leading to disease resistance. In doing so, it has provided novel tools to assist in the development of pathogen-resistant plants for use by the agricultural industry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300301 Plant Improvement (Selection, Breeding and Genetic Engineering)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158097</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of developmental temperature on muscle morphology and growth of mangrove jack Lutjanus argentimaculatus, silver perch Bidyanus bidyanus and barramundi Lates calcarifer</field><field name="creator">Carey, Geoff</field><field name="description">The early growth and development of fish muscle is highly temperature dependent. Changes in the thermal regimes of developing fish embryos can induce differences in the number and size of muscle fibres (muscle cellularity) in just hatched larvae. These differences show considerable variation, with the complex pattern of magnitude and longevity of myogenic change showing high species-specificity. Myogenic responses to early temperature in several fish species studied so far show no inter-species/genus patterns, although responses are repeatable within species/genus. In some species, a higher than normal incubation temperature increases muscle cellularity, whereas in others, a lower incubation temperature increases muscle cellularity. As early muscle cellularity can be a strong predictor of future growth patterns in fish, this response has prompted considerable scientific interest. Early muscle cellularity may also influence recruitment success, locomotor ability, and ultimately fitness, and as such it is important to improve understanding in this area. In this study, just fertilised eggs of mangrove jack Lutjanus argentimaculatus, silver perch Bidyanus bidyanus and barramundi Lates calcarifer were introduced to three different incubation temperatures, to assess the effects on early muscle growth and development. The thermal regimes applied to each species corresponded to an ambient (spawning) temperature, a &#145;warm&#146; temperature, and a &#145;cool&#146; temperature, all within the particular thermal tolerances of that species. Larvae of B. bidyanus and L. calcarifer were on-grown to assess subsequent effects of incubation temperature. Additionally, five day old larvae of L. calcarifer were transferred from the high and low temperatures back to ambient temperature to ascertain the effects on muscle parameters, growth rates and locomotory ability. These species were chosen as ideal candidates for examination in this study as they are important aquaculture species both in Australia and internationally, and all have well established hatchery protocols offering a reliable supply of fertilised eggs. Also they allow the examination of early thermal effects on both salt-water spawning (L. argentimaculatus, L. calcarifer) and fresh-water spawning (B. bidyanus) species. After retrieval from spawning tanks, fertilised eggs of L. argentimaculatus were incubated till hatch at 26&#176;C (cool), 29&#176;C (ambient) and 32&#176;C (warm); those of B. bidyanus were incubated at 22&#176;C, 25&#176;C and 28&#176;C; and those of L. calcarifer were incubated at 26&#176;C, 29&#176;C and 31&#176;C. Warmer incubation temperatures hastened hatching in all three species, whereas cooler incubation temperatures delayed hatching. Average time to 50% hatch of L. argentimaculatus incubated at 26, 29 and 32&#176;C was 19, 17.5 and 13 hours, respectively; of B. bidyanus incubated at 22, 25 and 28&#176;C was 37, 34 and 30 hours, respectively; and of L. calcarifer incubated at 26, 29 and 31&#176;C was 19, 15 and 13 hours, respectively. Incubation temperature had a significant effect on the length of just-hatched B. bidyanus, with incubation at 22&#176;C producing shorter larvae (3.49 &#177; 0.09 mm) than those incubated at 25&#176;C (4.18 &#177; 0.09 mm) or 28&#176;C (4.39 &#177; 0.09 mm). By 12 days post-hatch, however, those incubated and grown at the warm (28&#176;C) temperature were significantly longer (6.73 &#177; 0.14 mm) than those grown at 25&#176;C (5.92 &#177; 0.22 mm). The length of just hatched L. argentimaculatus or L. calcarifer was unaffected by incubation temperature, although by nine days post-hatch barramundi incubated and grown at the warm (31&#176;C) temperature were significantly longer (4.90 &#177; 0.18 mm) than those incubated and grown at 29&#176;C (4.22 &#177; 0.23 mm), 26&#176;C (3.95 &#177; 0.13 mm), or transferred from the warm (3.98 &#177; 0.25 mm) or cool (4.01 &#177; 0.21 mm) temperatures. Transverse sections of just hatched larvae from all incubation temperatures showed muscle components at an immature stage of development, revealing myotubes yet to differentiate to mature inner (white) muscle fibres. Incubation temperature had a significant effect on the number of immature inner muscle fibres in just hatched L. argentimaculatus and L. calcarifer, with incubation at the warm temperature increasing fibre number in L. argentimaculatus (315.60 &#177; 13.07 for those incubated at 32&#176;C, 275.00 &#177; 16.90 for those incubated at 29&#176;C, 253.00 &#177; 13.80 for those incubated at 26&#176;C); and incubation at the cool temperature increasing fibre number in L. calcarifer (350.00 &#177; 14.21 for those incubated at 26&#176;C, 327 &#177; 11.44 for those incubated at 29&#176;C, 292.00 &#177; 14.49 for those incubated at 31&#176;C). Conversely, inner muscle fibre area significantly increased at the warm incubation temperature in L. calcarifer (12.23 &#177; 0.66 &#181;m2 for those incubated at 31&#176;C, 9.75 &#177; 0.45 &#181;m2 for those incubated at 29&#176;C, 10.33 &#177; 0.75 &#181;m2 for those incubated at 26&#176;C), whereas incubation at the cooler incubation temperatures increased inner muscle fibre area in L. argentimaculatus, although not significantly (P = 0.09). Inner muscle fibre cellularity of just hatched B. bidyanus was unaffected by incubation temperature. The total area of superficial (red) muscle fibres and the proportion of superficial to total fibre area in just-hatched L. calcarifer were significantly affected by incubation temperature, with incubation at the cool temperature (26&#176;C) increasing both the total area (1816.23 &#177; 136.16 &#181;m2) and proportion (0.21 &#177; 0.01) of superficial muscle fibres compared with incubation at 29&#176;C (974.95 &#177; 108.42 &#181;m2 and 0.14 &#177; 0.01 for total superficial fibre area and proportion of superficial to total muscle fibre area, respectively) and 31&#176;C (1049.09 &#177; 70.60 &#181;m2 and 0.13 &#177; 8.7 x 10-3). These parameters were unaffected by incubation temperature in L. argentimaculatus and B. bidyanus. By nine days post-hatch, differences in the total superficial fibre area between non-transferred and transferred treatment groups of L. calcarifer were no longer significant, whereas differences in the proportion of superficial to total muscle fibre area still were, with those hatched and grown at the warm (31&#176;C) temperature having a significantly reduced proportion of superficial muscle area (0.05 &#177; 6.66 x 10-3) compared with those incubated and grown at 29&#176;C (0.08 &#177; 7.77 x 10-3) and 26&#176;C (0.09 &#177; 5.66 x 10-3), and those incubated at 26&#176;C and transferred to 29&#176;C (0.07 &#177; 5.31 x 10-3), and incubated at 31&#176;C and transferred to 29&#176;C (0.06 &#177; 6.91 x 10-3). Growth rates of L. calcarifer from the five treatment groups were assessed over a 12 week trial. Differences in mass and standard length increase between treatment groups were not significant (P = 0.060, P = 0.071 for mass and standard length after twelve weeks, respectively). However, differences between treatment groups increased between six and 12 weeks (P = 0.075, P = 0.100 for differences in mass and standard length after six weeks, respectively), indicating that a longer period of testing may have resulted in significant growth differences between treatment groups. Additionally, mass increased considerably more in the group incubated at the coolest temperature and transferred to the control temperature (26/29&#176;C), than in any other treatment group (37.10 % more than the 26/26&#176;C group, 23.80 % more than the 29/29&#176;C group, 21.00 % more than the 31/29&#176;C). It is proposed that the superior mass increase seen in this treatment group may have been imprinted on the myogenic program of L. calcarifer after incubation at the cool (26&#176;C) temperature, which resulted in an increase in inner muscle fibres at hatch, and a subsequently improved growth rate. There was no evidence that incubation temperature affected the burst (Umax) or sustained (Ucrit) swimming ability of L. calcarifer. However, barramundi incubated and reared at the cool (26&#176;C) temperature performed significantly better at 26&#176;C test temperature (101.76 &#177; 3.70 cm.s-1) than those of other treatment groups (83.22 &#177; 6.29 cm.s-1 for the 29/29&#176;C group, 85.40 &#177; 9.70 cm.s-1 for the 31/31&#176;C group, 87.30 &#177; 4.10 cm.s-1 for the 26/29&#176;C group, 76.42 &#177; 5.93 cm.s-1 for the 31/29&#176;C group), indicating the ability of L. calcarifer to thermally acclimate burst swimming. Additionally, swimming ability was significantly affected by the test temperature, with Umax of fish from all treatments highest at 29&#176;C test temperature, and the swim speeds of all treatment groups combined significantly lower at 26&#176;C for Umax (86.90 &#177; 2.80 cm.s-1 at 26&#176;C, 103.20 &#177; 3.40 cm.s-1 at 29&#176;C, 96.90 &#177; 3.90 cm.s-1 at 31&#176;C) and Ucrit (58.89 &#177; 8.90 cm.s-1 at 26&#176;C, 60.90 &#177; 6.50 cm.s-1 at 29&#176;C, 62.40 &#177; 6.20 cm.s-1at 31&#176;C). Lower test temperature therefore tended to depress both burst and sustained swimming ability in L. calcarifer. The positive results from this study indicate that the growth rate of L. argentimaculatus and L. calcarifer may be enhanced by the application of thermal manipulation in the hatchery phase of development. Additionally, there was a demonstrated affect of early thermal regimes on the subsequent swimming ability of L. calcarifer.

A second objective was to determine the major factors which influence the reproductive performance of these animals. Cattle were identified using ear tags or neck collars (prior to the study most animals had no identification), aged (using their teeth) into groups (1.5 &#150; 3 years of age; 3.5 &#150; 5; 5.5 &#150; 7; &gt; 7 years of age), body condition scored (BCS 1- 5; 1 &#150; emaciated, 2 &#150; lean, 3 &#150; medium, 4 &#150; fat, 5 &#150; very fat), and reproductive status assessed (lactating or not lactating, pregnant or not pregnant). The data were collected three times (March, July and October) over a 9 month period. Data were analysed using SAS. Over the period the mean pregnancy was 57 %. There were no measured seasonal effects on pregnancy rate. Cows that were over 7 years of age (n= 25) had a higher (P&lt; 0.01) pregnancy rate (74%) compared to those aged 1.2 &#150; 3 years of age (37%) (n=25). The majority of cows had BCS of either 2 (n=162) or 3 (n=128). Five cows had a BCS of 5 (very fat) and 10 cows had a BCS of 1 (emaciated).

More broadly, the media equation explores the manner in which people tend to react to computers socially and naturally. Media equation researchers have theorised that people&#146;s tendency to treat computers socially is largely an automatic and unconscious process, and predominantly agree that the cause of the media equation is mindlessness. However, to date, no empirical evidence has been found showing a link between mindless processing and media equation behaviour. This thesis builds upon existing media equation research with the aim of empirically evaluating the mindlessness explanation of media equation behaviour. Laboratory-based experimental research is used to explore the relationship between experience with computers, mindlessness, and media equation behaviour. The potential for experience with computers to covary with media equation behaviour is explored, as mindlessness has been shown to increase among those who are more familiar with a task. Four studies are conducted as part of the thesis. The first study establishes that a media equation pattern of response will be shown by an Australian sample, and that the methodologies being employed are consistent with those used in previous media equation research. Moreover, a relationship between experience with computers and media equation behaviour is found. Participants of high experience, but not low experience, react positively to flattery from a computer. This evidence of a link between experience with computers and media equation behaviour provides initial empirical support for the mindlessness explanation of the media equation. The second study provides further support for the link between experience with computers and the tendency to treat computers as though they are human. The results show that participants of high experience respond to being placed on a team with a computer, while participants of low experience do not. The first two studies empirically support the mindlessness explanation of media equation behaviour. However, they do not provide direct evidence of mindlessness as a cause. The third study was designed to gather more direct evidence of mindlessness covarying with media equation behaviour. Previous research has shown that positive mood leads to mindlessness, and negative mood to the opposing state of mind, mindfulness. The results of the third study show that participants in a positive mood are more likely to apply gender stereotypes to a computer than participants in a negative mood. This link between positive mood and media equation behaviour provides further empirical support for mindlessness as the cause of the media equation. The final study was designed to overcome some of the shortcomings of the third study, and provide more direct empirical investigation of the link between mindlessness and the media equation. By varying the cues displayed by the computer, the final study attempted to test whether reminding participants of the true nature of a computer would lead to a reduction in the tendency to react to the computer as though it were human. The results of the final study were inconclusive and more complicated than expected. The findings are discussed in detail in chapter 6. The studies conducted provide domain specific findings that have implications for software design. The thesis reveals the moderating impact of experience on the tendency to treat computers socially and, moreover, provides initial empirical support for the mindlessness explanation of the media equation. The research conducted significantly progresses knowledge of the appropriate methodologies required for further exploration of the potential causes of media equation behaviour.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158100</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk assessment for unbound granular material performance in rural Queensland pavements using semi-quantitative fault tree analysis</field><field name="creator">Creagh, Meera Sujata</field><field name="description">Unbound granular pavements form the Queensland Department of Main Roads largest geotechnical asset. The performance of these pavements is heavily dependent on the behaviour of the unbound granular material used for the paving material. Traditionally, Main Roads staff have relied on simplified mechanistic models, empirically-developed specifications and local knowledge to assess paving material performance risks. There are few options available for the formal analysis of the key failure modes that take place within the unbound granular material (rutting, cracking, potholing, and loss of skid resistance). The performance risks are increased by critical combinations of material and site properties that can be difficult to identify using standard design tools. Increasing traffic loads, the use of &#145;non-standard&#146; materials, a lack of experienced staff, material variability and the complexity of material behaviour all threaten the effectiveness of traditional tools for the assessment of material-related risks. This thesis presents a risk assessment tool for unbound granular pavement materials used in rural Queensland pavements. The model uses semi-quantitative fault tree analysis for the assessment of the pavement performance risks associated with unbound granular materials. The model supplements design tools for unbound granular pavements by allowing the structured assessment of general risk trends for key failure modes for unbound granular materials. These material-related failures include rutting in the base layer, potholes due to material deficiencies, cracking, and loss of skid resistance due sealing aggregate punching into the base. These failure modes contribute to poor road performance, safety concerns and premature maintenance costs. A fault tree was constructed to represent the complex interactions of pavement performance variables such as site, load and material properties. The fault tree maps the interaction of these pavement performance variables and their contribution to the unbound granular material&#146;s engineering properties, such as stiffness, resistance to deformation and shear strength. Deficiencies in these engineering properties manifest in the key failure modes described above. The fault tree allows these failure modes to be traced from the interaction of base causes (performance variables), to the manifestation of performance risks (failure modes). The interactions of these performance variables are modelled using Boolean logic (AND and OR gates). Risk is measured by the combination of likelihood and consequence. The Boolean logic allows the fault tree to be used for risk analysis by the addition of semi-quantitative ratings for likelihood and consequence. Semi-quantitative ratings combine the ease of use of qualitative ratings with the analytical benefits of quantitative ratings. Likelihood ratings are applied to performance variables such as site, material and load properties. Consequence ratings are applied to failure modes. The user assigns these semi-quantitative ratings based on a descriptive five-point severity scale. The model converts these descriptive ratings into numerical expressions of severity based on a five point logarithmic scale. This allows numerical analysis of likelihood and consequence ratings for the calculation of risk. The model&#146;s predictions for pavement material performance risks were compared against actual performance data. This included case studies, failure investigations, material performance testing and a limited number of field investigations of pavement segments around Roma. The results showed good agreement between general risk trends predicted by the model, and the actual performance of Queensland unbound granular pavements. The research shows that semi-quantitative fault tree analysis is a useful method of modelling pavement material performance risk for Main Roads users. Fault tree analysis allows modelling of the complex geotechnical processes and uncertainties influencing unbound granular material behaviour. Semi-quantitative inputs provide good useability. The model accuracy is sufficient for the risk assessment needs of Main Roads. The model allows Main Roads users to consider the performance risks associated with pavement materials in the context of specific project scenarios. This allows users to appreciate the interaction of significant site and material variables that influence risk trends for key failure modes. The model helps users to identify high risk combinations that can otherwise be difficult to determine using standard methods. More detailed investigation, testing and analysis should be done to gain greater certainty if risk trends indicate that the investment is justified.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158101</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Folio of Compositions and Critical Commentary</field><field name="creator">Grant, John Ward</field><field name="description">This Master of Philosophy in composition comprises a folio of seven works ranging from solo and chamber works to works for small and large orchestras, together with a critical commentary. The folio includes a piano solo, a choral anthem, a duet for cello and piano, a rhapsody for piano and orchestra, and an orchestral lament, reflection and fanfare. A recording of the duet for piano and cello is included in the submission along with midi realisations of the remaining works. Each work attempts to develop certain aspects of a compositional process with respect to musical and extra musical influences on form and structure. Various processes are employed in the use of written text, traditional forms, archetypal models, and combinatorics. These processes are applied conceptually to motives, thematic construction and entire formal organisation. Of particular note is the ordering of combinations of limited sets of musical ideas to direct the entire structure of a musical work. Used in conjunction with other processes and applied to elements of composition such as phrase structure, thematic presentation and orchestration, new opportunities for expression in a system that strives for perfect balance are created. The critical commentary discusses these procedures, their development and application to the body of works. Each work is considered with respect to its conception, philosophical aesthetic, and basic building materials and construction process. Structural guides to analysis are outlined and decisions that affect the outcome, not readily observable from an aural or traditional examination of the works, are discussed. The process developed has potential for further refinement and application in future compositions across a broad range of styles or as an aid in analysis of existing repertoire.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158102</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Electrophysiological Examination of Semantic and Syntactic Anomaly Processing in Sentences: Effects of Aging and Focal Brain Lesions</field><field name="creator">Faustmann, Anja</field><field name="description">Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) have the capacity to tap into language comprehension as it unfolds in real time. ERPs may, therefore, not only provide essential information on the temporal dynamics of language comprehension, but may also contribute to an adequate characterization of the temporal and functional locus of comprehension deficits. A prerequisite for pathological ERP studies is a comprehensive understanding of the electrophysiological correlates of the processing of different types of linguistic information (e.g., semantic and syntactic). These ERP correlates have been extensively researched in young healthy adults. Application of the functional interpretations of ERP components to a poststroke aphasic population, however, requires the consideration of the effects of normal aging, as the CVA etiology is predominantly associated with advanced age. Few studies have investigated age-related changes in language-related ERP components. Thus, one of the major objectives of this thesis was to determine whether potential nonpathological agerelated differences in auditory language comprehension were reflected in the electrophysiological response observed to semantic and syntactic anomalies, thus providing an essential foundation from which to interpret ERP findings in aphasia. The electrophysiological response to auditory sentence-embedded semantic and syntactic (phrase structure) anomalies was first established in a group of healthy young adults, who showed a small, centroparietally distributed negativity starting at around 200 ms post stimulus onset for syntactic anomalies. Semantic anomalies elicited a robust N400. A bilateral, widely distributed P600 was observed for both semantic and syntactic anomalies. The results are discussed in terms of their functional significance with a special focus on the P600, which, in the domain of language processing, may reflect processes of reanalysis and repair that are not exclusively based on syntactic information but may also include semantic aspects of the sentence. To provide a comprehensive description of age-related effects on the established ERP correlates, differences between young and elderly subjects were investigated and the effects of advancing age were examined in a larger number of senior subjects of a wider, welldefined age range. These experiments clearly demonstrated that changes in the processing of semantic and syntactic anomalies occur with normal aging. Older adults, like young adults, processed the meaning of sentences online and sentence context had a facilitating effect as indicated by larger N400s to semantically incongruous than to congruous constructions. However, the N400 (effect) was significantly smaller in elderly compared to young adults, and it was further demonstrated that the auditory N400 effect was systematically reduced with advancing age. Possible mechanisms explaining age-related N400 reductions, including less selective activation and/or less efficient predictive use of context, are discussed. Peak latencies of the N400 (effect), on the other hand, were not affected by normal aging, thus indicating that with the processing of natural connected speech, integration of a word into the higher-order meaning representation of the preceding sentence context is not delayed. Furthermore, processes of reanalysis and repair in the presence of a semantic or syntactic anomaly, as reflected in the P600, were comparable in magnitude and timing for young and elderly subjects. However, P600 effects were found to be slightly larger over more anterior recording sites in older elderly compared to middleaged adults, although this increase in effect size was not systematic with age. As temporal alterations in language processing have been identified as a possible cause of comprehension deficits observed in poststroke aphasic individuals, the potential temporal aspects of such deficits and recovery thereof were investigated in the last two studies presented in this thesis. A dissociation between syntactic and semantic ERP results was observed in a patient exhibiting a mild comprehension deficit, especially with regard to late positivities. The P600 to syntactic anomalies was reduced and clearly delayed in the patient, possibly indicating delayed or incomplete access or use of word category information necessary for the construction of phrase structure. The temporal dynamics of recovery from aphasic comprehension deficits were investigated in a longitudinal case study. The patient had recovered considerably from her initial mild-moderate comprehension deficit, as indicated by her performance on offline language tests. At the last of three consecutive assessments spanning the first eight months post stroke, she showed an electrophysiological response to semantic anomalies which was comparable to that observed in healthy elderly control subjects. In contrast, the patient&#146;s response to syntactically anomalous constructions was different at all assessments. Possible accounts for the observed discrepancy as well as methodological implications of the obtained results are discussed. The series of studies presented in this thesis served to provide a comprehensive investigation into the electrophysiological correlates of auditory language comprehension in healthy young, healthy elderly and poststroke aphasic subjects, highlighting the capacity of the ERP methodology to reveal valuable information on temporal as well as functional aspects of language processing, its impairment and recovery.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158103</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable tourism planning: An analysis of Queensland local tourism destinations</field><field name="creator">Ruhanen-Hunter, Lisa M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">150602 Tourism Forecasting</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Queensland.</field><field name="subject">Sustainable development</field><field name="subject">strategic tourism planning</field><field name="subject">stakeholder</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158104</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transformative Power in Motherwork: A Study of Mothering in the 1950s and 1960s</field><field name="creator">Porter, Marie</field><field name="description">In this thesis I explore the experiences of a group of Australian women who became first-time mothers between 1950 and 1965. I interviewed twenty-four mothers, half of whom were selected as practising Roman Catholics. The other half was AnglicanfProtestant by co-incidence rather than selection. The data in this research have been collected via in-depth, unstructured interviews with the participants. The interviews were taped and transcribed verbatim, before the data were analysed. I present a grounded theory of transformative power in motherwork that has emerged from the analysis of interviews. The mothers talked about what they did in their active mothering years. I argue that despite being constrained by the gender bias in the patriarchal context, these mothers were agents who developed skills that enabled them to resist or creatively deal with the constraints they faced. Their emphasis was on their agency and the power to nurture their children into responsible adults. Their awareness of the importance of their motherwork acted as a motivator in this development. My thesis is that the relationship between each mother and each of her children is a transformative power relationship in which both mother and child are transformedthe child into an independent adult and the mother into a skilled self-motivated agent through her mothenvork. Any threat to this process resulted in the mother doing all she could to resist or counteract the constraintls she was encountering. Transformative power expressed in motherwork can be recognised analytically by several characteristics. It empowers both parties in the motherlchild duality. Complexity, diversity, fluidity, and responsiveness to the physical, intellectual, and emotional aspects of the relationship are all evident in transformative power relationships. Through their own transformation, the mothers saw the falsity of the master narratives of motherhood, prevalent in society in the 1950s and 1960s, which they had believed as inexperienced girls. From their stories about motherwork, I reveal a counter narrative that was portrayed not only in their telling of their stories: but in their discursivelreflexive practices as mothers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370104 Urban Sociology and Community Studies</field><field name="subject">440207 Religion and Society</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158105</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relevance of Nietzsche: A Nietzschean Critique of Popular Ideals in Social Theory and Sociology</field><field name="creator">Anstee, Mark</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to establish, develop, and explore the relevance of Nietzsche&#146;s social philosophy and philosophy overall to sociology. For while Nietzsche has become a recognised and widely respected intellectual figure in many disciplines in the last two decades, there has yet to be an explicit and in depth application and consideration of his work in a context of English language sociology, in which Nietzsche&#146;s actual writings are considered at length and set down beside important contributions to the discipline. By establishing a clear picture of the continuities, and ultimately important discontinuity also between Nietzsche&#146;s perspective and some of the more fundamental contributions to sociology then, this thesis intends to redress what has hitherto been largely sporadic allusions to Nietzsche&#146;s perspective and its relevance to the discipline. And the basic vehicle for this thesis&#146; consideration of Nietzsche in a context of sociology, remains an investigative, Nietzschean critique of key popularideals in social theory, and ultimately popular ideals in sociology as a whole, invoking issues of both theory and epistemology. On the more theoretical level firstly, this thesis applies Nietzsche&#146;s social philosophy in a critical capacity to begin with, to reconsidering two key, popular ideals permeating the theory of three seminal social theorists, and encompassing what might best be considered ideas of &#145;social membership&#146;. And the two ideals of social membership this thesis establishes and considers in the respective contributions of T.H. Marshall, Durkheim, and Marx, constitute firstly an ideal of society-wide social desegregation, in terms of the removal of most or all socially engendered obstacles to social equality; and secondly, an ideal of society-wide social solidarity free similarly of socially created and/or consolidated upon divisions. On a more epistemological level in turn however, this thesis considers the implications of aspects of Nietzsche&#146;s philosophy in terms of the place, role, and significance of values and ideals in the constitution of sociological knowledge. And fundamentally, while these have long been recognised as an important part of social science, and of the extent to which its propositions and findings remain both partial and contingent, a concerted application of Nietzsche&#146;s perspective in a context of sociology holds further implications for understanding both the constitution and development of sociological knowledge. What it implies in sum is that change in prevailing values and ideals, and thus in sociological knowledge in turn, depends on more than change in the &#145;uniquely&#146; social variables sociologists study. In considering the relevance of Nietzsche to sociology then, this thesis aims firstly to contribute to the discipline in terms of the important insights, considerations, and emphases, which an in depth engagement with Nietzsche&#146;s social philosophy can bring to social theory. Ultimately however, its contribution to sociology is via the field of the philosophy of social science, in terms of a full application in this context of those seldom considered, and/or misunderstood insights of Nietzsche on issues of values and value creation, on what this means for the currency of certain ideals in social theory, and what this implies in turn for the explanatory frameworks of sociology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of immune disturbances in the pathology of heat stroke: The dual pathway model of heat stroke</field><field name="creator">Lim, Chin Leong</field><field name="description">Heat stroke has not been universally defined, but researchers agree that the clinical symptoms of heat stroke include hyperthermia, systemic inflammation, multi-organ failure and disturbance of the central nervous system. The current model of heat stroke suggests that heat stroke is triggered by heat but driven by endotoxemia. Endotoxemia refers to an increase in gram-negative bacteria endotoxin, known as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in the blood. Although the current model of heat stroke can explain the clinical presentation of heat stroke patients, the inconsistency of heat as a trigger of heat stroke, within and between individuals, remains unexplained. There is considerable overlap in the core temperature of heat stroke patients and that of healthy and conscious athletes at the end of endurance races. These observations suggest that heat stroke may not be triggered by heat, but by an intermediate pathway that can be activated under heatstressed conditions. This thesis investigated a new model of heat stroke, known as the &#147;dual pathway model,&#148; which helps explain the pathophysiology of heat stroke. This dual pathway model hypothesises that heat stroke is triggered by two separate, but sequentially connected pathways. The first pathway is triggered by endotoxemia. When endotoxemia can be tolerated or inhibited and heat exposure is prolonged, heat stroke can be triggered by a second pathway through the direct thermal effect of heat on cellular tissues. The dual pathway model postulates that heat intolerance is transient and results from a transient shift in physiological state in the form of immune disturbances that promote endotoxemia and systemic inflammation, and suppress the anti-LPS mechanisms. Prolonged intense exercise can induce these immune disturbances and cause in a state of transient heat intolerance. This thesis comprises a literature review and three studies. The review of literature discussed the characterisation, and models of heat stroke. The epidemiology of heat stroke in the civilian, athlete and military populations was also discussed. The complication of using core temperature as an indicator of the risk of heat stroke was discussed and the evidence suggests that core temperature is best used as an indicator of total heat load, and not the risk of heat stroke. Although core temperature may not trigger heat stroke consistently, core temperature appears to inhibit exercise consistently at a critical point, which may function as a protective mechanism against heat stroke. The review also discussed evidence showing immune disturbances that occur during intense exercise. These immune disturbances were similar to, but of a lower magnitude than, the symptoms observed in heat stroke patients. The evidence supports the hypothesis that exercise-induced immune disturbances exists on the same continuum as the pathway of heat stroke. An exaggeration of exercise-induced immune disturbances can trigger the pathway of heat stroke. Study I investigated leukocyte subset responses to moderate intensity exercise under heat stress. In a repeated-design study, 13 soldiers performed 3 h of moderate intensity exercise under heat stress conditions consuming either water or a carbohydrate drink. Moderate intensity exercise in the heat induced the same pattern and magnitude of leukocyte and subset responses as those observed during intense exercise in cool conditions. Prolonged exposure to these immune cell changes may lead to chronic immune suppression. Matching work intensity to physical fitness may be more important in preventing immune suppression than carbohydrate ingestion during moderate intensity exercise in the heat. Study II investigated the hypothesis that overload training compromises heat tolerance by promoting LPS translocation and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, and by suppressing the anti-LPS antibodies during exercise in the heat. Eighteen trained athletes were matched and randomly assigned to a normal training group, comprising two weeks of routine training, or to an overload training group, comprising a 20% increase in training volume during the same period. Both groups performed a heat-stress test before (Trial 1) and after (Trial 2) the two-week training intervention. Increasing training volume by two weeks was well-tolerated by the subjects. Running in the heat for 30&#150;90 min at 70% VO2max can cause the same degree of endotoxemia as in a marathon. In the absence of overtraining, overload training decreased plasma LPS response at rest and during exercise in the heat. Compared with routine training, overload training resulted in lower plasma LPS concentration at rest and during recovery, but not during exercise. A well-tolerated overload training regimen can prevent a significant increase in proinflammatory cytokine during exercise in the heat. Study III investigated the hypothesis that heat stroke can be triggered by endotoxemia or heat-induced tissue damage, and that pre-existing inflammation compromises heat tolerance, whereas blocking endotoxemia increases heat tolerance. In groups of eight, Wistar rats were treated with heat exposure only (HE), and heat exposure with one of the following treatments: turpentine (TPHE), dexamethasone (DXHE), combination of turpentine and dexamethasone (TPDXHE), and TPDXHE with polymyxin B (PMBHE). These rats were heat-stressed until the core temperature (Tc) was 42 &#186;C for 15 min. The TPHE, DXHE and TPDXHE rats were paired with equal-sized groups of rats given the same treatment, but without heat stress (TP, DX and TPDX, respectively). Inhibition of endotoxemia protected the DXHE and PMBHE rats from heat stroke, but not the TPDXHE rats. The TPDXHE rats had a higher degree of tissue damage with no increase in plasma LPS concentration.Mortality and symptoms of heat stroke occurred in the TPHE, HE and TPDXHE rats, but endotoxemia was observed only in the TPHE and HE rats. Pre-existing inflammation (TPHE) enhanced the pro-inflammatory cytokine response and tissue damage during heat stress. The results of these studies support the hypothesis of the dual pathway model of heat stroke by showing that exercise in the heat can induce immune changes that, if prolonged, can lead to chronic immune suppression, and can cause endotoxemia in humans. The data also show that a tolerable increase in training volume suppresses plasma LPS concentration and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, and increases the anti-LPS antibody response during exercise in the heat. Heat stroke can occur independently through the effects of endotoxemia or thermal effects of heat on cellular tissues. Having a pre-existing inflammation compromises heat tolerance, but the blocking of endotoxemia protects against heat stroke.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158107</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defining the Enemy: A Study of Twentieth- Century Presidential Rhetoric</field><field name="creator">Flanagan, Jason Constantine</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the nature and evolution of enemy images in twentiethcentury presidential rhetoric. It does so through five case studies, analyzing the presidential rhetoric associated with World War I, World War II, the early Cold War, the Vietnam War, and the first Gulf War. It works from three basic assumptions. First, that enemy images are an important area of study as they play a central role in the transition from peace to war, as well as in shaping the manner in which a conflict is fought and the form of the peace that follows. Second, that it is language about political events, rather than such events in any other sense, that most people experience, and political rhetoric thus constitutes political reality. And, finally, that of all the rhetoricians involved in American politics, it is the president who is the most influential architect of political reality. Although scholars, most notably Robert L. Ivie, have offered important insight into the nature of enemy images in American presidential rhetoric, the existing secondary literature is generally based upon the analysis of small samples of rhetoric. While such an approach can produce valuable results, it ignores the fluid nature of enemy images and thus excludes insight into their development and evolution. Building upon the existing secondary literature, this thesis undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the speeches, press conferences and public messages of each of the presidents examined. Combining a traditional historical methodology with one resembling an approach Sonja K. Foss has labeled &#147;generic description,&#148; this thesis examines commonalities not only in the form of enemy images in presidential rhetoric, but also in the manner in which such images developed in response to events. Exploring how certain rhetorical forms were rearticulated in response to similar events in different time periods, it identifies what John Butler has labeled &#147;rhetorical continuities.&#148;</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158108</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transitional Justice and South Africa: jus ad bellum, jus in bello and the promotion of national unity and reconciliation act (34) 1995</field><field name="creator">Castel, Heather Lorraine</field><field name="description">My thesis examines the evolution of the enabling legislation to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act (34) 1995, through the historical, legal, philosophical and ideological issues that underpinned the Act. Transitional justice is an interregnum characteristic and comprises both accountability and the establishment of a moral society. Historically, the South African government's principal adversary, the African National Congress (ANC) advocated a just, multi-racial and equitable society through leaders such as Pixley ka Isaka Seme, Professor Z.K. Matthews and Chief Albert Luthuli. ANC leaders from 191 2-1 960 were mission educated and regarded segregation as the antithesis of their strong Christian principles and in opposition to Gospel values. They advocated the reformation of South African society through passive resistance and the attainment of the franchise. After the 1960 Sharpeville massacre and the entrenchment of "grand apartheid", the ANC adopted the armed struggle while the state committed numerous gross human rights violations to maintain apartheid. While exiled, the ANC established its just war claims with a meritorious cause, its jus ad bellum. By 1990 a settlement was negotiated between the principal adversaries. The interregnum was characterised by violence, commissions of inquiry and various requests for indemnification/amnesty. The ANC's just war claims were eroded with allegations of atrocities in its military camps that severely undermined its claims to the moral high-ground. Its poor conduct of the armed struggle, its jus in bello, was confirmed in various subsequent reports. The ANC's decisive election victory of April 1994 provided the Congress with an opportunity to structure transitional justice through the enabling legislation to the TRC on its own terms and prove through the self-incriminating evidence that emerged at the TRC hearings that apartheid was a crime against humanity and that the armed struggle was a just war with a meritorious jus ad bellum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430111 History - Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158109</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FRACTAL FETISHES Essays on the Organization of the System of Information</field><field name="creator">Andoniou, Constantine</field><field name="description">Fractal Fetishes is a philosophical investigation of the nature and organization of the global system of information, which comprises our knowledge and experience of the social and which defines our individual and collective existence. This thesis contends that digital technologies have brought about the genesis of a world, where everything is, and it is not or it can be at the same time. In this world the way in which the global system of information is organized, distributed and consequently, individually or collectively incorporated, leads to unchallenged conceptual misrecognitions and logically unjustified receptions of anything as being true and real . The later add up to the body of social knowledge as critical conceptual inaccuracies and inconsistencies which make our understanding of the ways social knowledge is constructed and our actual understanding and evaluation of this knowledge, problematic. Information processing uncontrollably creates conceptual confusions and disillusions, adding to the recycling procedure of already inadequate and problematic scientific justifications and mistakenly-thought-as-obsolete conclusions. The thesis calls for fresh new thinking, accepting that there can only be variations on given issues, that there can be only theoretical approximations to the true or the real; truth and reality, and meaning themselves have become ambiguous and, in a sense, of unimportant priority. The priority is rather to set individual standards in a redefinition of the content of the available bodies of knowledge within a global context. The challenge we have to accept is to reconsider our ways of processing information, and hopefully reach an adequate degree of understanding of, how ourselves and the world around us, are constructed within our daily digital environments and informational landscapes. At the core of the analysis in this thesis is the concept of information. The thesis examines various aspects of the system of information, leading to a series of theoretical approximations regarding the structure and organization of information systems, and information processing by machines and human agents. It aims to identify patterns of power, domination and struggle within digital information channels of human/machine communication and interaction, in order to advance our understanding of the ways in which digital information processing organizes our representations and realities of the world around us, and consequently necessitates and directs decisions of social action. This thesis proposes an analytical model of the structure and organization of information, termed as Infogramic Analysis. It is suggested that, the system of information spans along multiple coexisting space-time coordinates: an Era of Romanticism (actuality), an Epoch of Ersatz (imitation), and an Age of Chimera (fantasy). Within these coordinates, the processes of Virtual Implosion and Fractal Dynamics are proposed, referring to the dynamic change of the global system of information along distinctive phase spaces towards a fractal state of meaning and value. Virtual Implosion produces irregular, contradictory and chaotic distortions of authentic informational patterns, in three trajectories of fractal mutation: Syghysis (deconstruction), Molynsis (differentiation), and Photococciasis (reconstruction). Fractal Dynamics refer to a series of five powerful structural micro-processes which power up and interlink the trajectories of virtual implosion: Catastrophe: (destruction), Orgasm (excitement), Metamorphosis (transformation), Epigenesis (rebirth), and Anomia (lawlessness). In this context, the concept of information is analyzed through what is termed here its Infotype; the infotype refers to the relation of a set of information to meaning and on the type of representational code of the specific set of information. It is suggested that the infotype of each set of information can be mapped with distinct characteristics, what is here defined as an Infogram. Infograms (composed of smaller units termed as datagrams) are packets (groups) of informational patterns of accumulated communicated information and existing cloned libraries of acquired knowledge and experience. Infograms can be distinguished according to the core theme to which the set of information is referring to, in: Authentic, Simulated, and Fractal. Infograms develop unpredictable communicational exchanges due to dynamically present or potentially existent informational associations and interactions. Informational interactions, are here defined as Endogenesis, referring to three levels of innate structural condition: Organization, Lethargy, and Disorganization. Information associations, are defined as Exogenesis, referring to three levels of external interactions: Simplicity, Apathy, and Complexity. Within the proposed framework of infogramic analysis, it is argued that bodies or segments of social knowledge may as well implode towards states of genuine fractal formations of authentic and simulated infograms. In this context then, information, hence, systems and bodies of social knowledge based on it, they all mutate to digital illusions, altered states of reality which come to dominate our so-conceived real and conceptual imaginations through a series of daily communication practices and experiences. We do live in a diverse and uncharacteristic world that moves fast at varied levels and directions locally, globally, and multi-directionally. We hardly get a glance of part or of the whole picture rather we only manage to feel the imprints of change, which nourish our insecurities for the reassurance for progress and development. In the contemporary global information society, of hyper-real landscapes and fantasy worlds, fractalized information establishes new relations of meanings and understandings of the world. What is needed are different ways of thinking on survival in an informational ocean of lived illusions and lost meanings. Human consciousness and awareness find it more and more difficult to see directions, to survive, and to sustain their existence. Whether it is a new starting point is one question, but is definitely a point of no return to an ambiguous future.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158148</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DISTRIBUTION AND FUNCTION OF GABAA RECEPTOR SUBUNITS IN THE AMYGDALA</field><field name="creator">Esmaeili, Abolghasem</field><field name="description">The amygdala has an important role in processing emotional information. Inappropriate processing within the amygdala is thought to induce anxiety disorders. Benzodiazepines, which act specifically on GABAA receptors, are commonly used as anxiolytics. This implies that GABAergic synapses within the amygdala may have an important role in inducing or compensating for these disorders. This thesis investigates the distribution and function of the GABAA receptor subunits in the amygdala. This study has made use of the real-time PCR, western blotting, and molecular cloning methods to determine expression levels of GABAA receptor subunits mRNAs and proteins and making recombinant GABAA receptors. We also used whole cell patch pipette recording to record the currents from transfected HEK 293 cells and acute brain slices containing amygdala. We examined the benzodiazepine pharmacology and subunit composition of the GABAA receptor subunits in the lateral and central amygdala. We examined the pharmacology of GABAA receptors by expressing different subunit combinations in HEK 293 cells and comparing the pharmacology with specific GABAergic inputs in the amygdala. Realtime PCR results showed that the GABAA receptor subunits are distributed differentially within the amygdalar nuclei with &#945;2, &#945;4, &#946;2, &#946;3, &#947;1 and &#947;2 abundant. In the case of the &#947; subunits, the expression level of the &#947;1 subunit was higher in the CeA whereas the expression level of &#947;2 was at high level in the LA. The &#945;1 subunit was at very low level in the CeA and &#945;2 was expressed at high level in the LA than in the CeA. The differences in the expression of &#945;1, &#945;2, &#947;1 and &#947;2 subunits in the amygdala suggest a diversity function for these subunits. Whole cell recording of HEK 293 cells showed that diazepam, zolpidem had different effects in these receptors depending on their compositions. Diazepam and zolpidem had low affinity for &#947;1-containing receptors. DMCM blocked the actions of GABA at &#945;1&#946;1&#947;2 and &#945;2&#946;1&#947;2 combinations (75 % current reduction) but had no effect at &#945;1&#946;1&#947;1 or &#945;2&#946;1&#947;1. In slice recordings DMCM blocked IPSCs by 70% in the lateral amygdala. In the central amygdala, DMCM had variable effects. Diazepam enhanced the amplitude of IPSC in the LA whereas the response in the CeA was either reduction or enhancement of currents. Similar results were obtained with zolpidem. Real-time PCR and whole cell recording from acute brain slices revealed a difference in the distribution of GABAA receptor subunits between the lateral and central amygdala. Our investigation showed there are sex differences in localisation of the GABAA receptor subunits in the rat amygdala in which the expression level of the &#945;2 and &#947;2 subunits might be higher in female rats, whereas the expression level of &#947;1 was higher in males than in females. We conclude that in the lateral amygdala all inputs have &#947;2 subunits whereas in the central amygdala some inputs contain &#947;1 subunit while others contain &#947;2 subunits.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158110</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PEM Fuel Cells: From Inorganic Proton Conducting Membranes to Process Design</field><field name="creator">Hogarth, Warren Henderson James</field><field name="description">Hydrogen fuelled Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) are being developed as next generation energy delivery devices to replace conventional combustion technology and enable the development of a hydrogen economy. The attraction of the technology is its ability to operate at higher efficiencies than traditional combustion technology, reducing overall harmful gas and particulate emissions. When hydrogen derived from renewable resources is used as the energy vector, an environmentally benign system is created. Despite the promise held by PEMFC technology, important materials design and system engineering challenges still exist, preventing commercialisation. From a materials perspective, proton exchange membranes capable of operating at or above 140oC need to be developed. This minimum operating temperature is necessary for specific applications in transportation, to reduce catalyst poisoning by carbon monoxide and to increase the system&#146;s ability to dissipate heat. System engineering challenges are due to poor understanding of the water balance in the fuel cell, the lack of design metrics for fuel cell systems and a poor understanding of dynamic operation. This thesis explores each of the aforementioned challenges as follows: &#149; A review of the latest developments in solid acid membranes for PEMFCs operating at 140oC is presented. The most promising areas for future advancements are identified, analysed and discussed and the concept of a thin film, inorganic membrane fuel cell is introduced. &#149; Sol-gel synthesised zirconium phosphate membranes are investigated as an alternative to layered zirconium phosphate proton conductors. The materials show conductivity values similar to &#945;-zirconium phosphate. The advantage of the solgel synthesis route is that the materials can be manufactured as thin film proton conducting membranes. &#149; Sol-gel titanium phosphate membranes are synthesised and their proton conduction mechanism and chemical stability are investigated. The materials show stable conductivity values up to 0.0044 S.cm&#8722;1 at 100oC and 100% relative humidity. 31P MAS NMR was used to elucidate the functional groups and develop a model for the Grotthuss proton conduction mechanism. &#149; The STR fuel cell, which can fully self humidify when operating with dry feeds, is characterised and demonstrated and design equations are developed. The STR design cedes only a small performance penalty to fully humidified designs and eases the requirement to develop PEMs capable of operating independent of water in conditions below 130oC. &#149; Dynamic operation of the STR autohumidified fuel cell is investigated. Current ignition and extinction phenomena and multiple steady states are characterised. It is shown that through careful choice of the operating parameters the dynamic response of the autohumidified fuel cell can replicate that of hydrated feed systems. &#149; A spatially resolved current density distribution and impedance analysis of a 20 cm2 autohumidified STR fuel cell system is undertaken. The analysis demonstrates that the STR fuel cell design reduces current density gradients in the fuel cell under reduced relative humidity operation and that the performance of the system is superior to a single channel serpentine system. Through its multi-scale approach, this thesis demonstrates the importance of considering the fuel cell as a system. New thermally and chemically stable fuel cell membranes which are capable of operating at temperatures above the glass transition temperature of current state of the art polymers are needed. Additionally, there is a requirement to operate fuel cells with atmospheric condition feed streams while maintaining the hydration of the membranes. Together, the sol-gel titanium phosphate membranes and autohumidified STR fuel cell developed fill this knowledge gap, leading to a closer realisation of a commercial fuel cell system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158111</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The limits of liberal justice: Normative constraints on multicultural policies and indigenous policies in Australia</field><field name="creator">Antal, Ildiko Barbara</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the question of the extent to which theories of citizenship, especially as developed in political liberalism, help to formulate an understanding of cultural diversity in relation to political stability and justice.

The principal aim is to establish that political liberalism provides appropriate political and ethical norms for adjudicating multicultural and indigenous rights claims. Thus, the exposition is twofold: first the thesis explores the concepts of justice as fairness as expounded in Rawlsian political liberalism. Second it applies the Rawlsian perspective to analyse the implications of multiculturalism and indigenous politics for the Australian liberal state.

Its methodology is informed by both the existentialist tradition of ethical phenomenology and the natural law tradition in legal theory. The main claim of the thesis is that a phenomenological analysis of ethical experience, as suggested by the writings of existentialist authors such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Emmanuel Levinas, provides important support for the natural law tradition. This claim is developed and defended through detailed engagement with the natural law theory of John Finnis. Specifically, I contend that Finnis&#8217; account of moral reasoning as applying the principles of practical reasonableness to a context of self-evident, basic values gains significant support from a phenomenological theory of ethical experience. Finnis&#8217; emphasis on the irreducible role of choice in moral deliberation also finds support in the existentialist tradition. However, I criticise some key aspects of Finnis&#8217; theory, including his emphasis on the transcendental character of the basic values and his account of legal obligation. I begin by outlining some central features of the existentialist approach to philosophy. I advance an interpretation of existentialism as ethical phenomenology. I then discuss some possible methodological connections between the existentialist and natural law traditions. This discussion provides the methodological framework for the remainder of the thesis. The thesis develops and defends a substantially original theory of the relationships between law, ethics and politics. The exposition begins with an account of the relationship between law and community that draws upon the work of Finnis and G. W. F. Hegel. I then outline a phenomenological theory of ethical experience, drawing in particular on the writings of Sartre and Levinas. I employ this phenomenological account of ethics to develop a conception of moral reasoning as reflective, good faith engagement with pre-reflective social judgements of ethical significance. This view of ethical experience and moral reasoning is then used as the basis for an examination of the concept of law and its relationship to political discourse. I turn next to the notions of legal authority and obligation. I argue that law, in the focal sense of the term, presents a generic, peremptory obligation that is necessarily moral in character. In the course of the argument, I critically discuss the conceptions of legal authority proposed by Joseph Raz, Adolf Reinach, H. L. A. Hart, John Rawls, Finnis, Jacques Derrida and Hans Kelsen. This view of legal obligation entails there are fundamental moral conditions that positive rules must satisfy to qualify as law, in the focal sense. I explore the nature of the moral framework created by these conditions through a detailed analysis of the ethical foundations of political discourse. I argue that political discourse is founded upon an ontological apprehension of the nature of humans as free, ethical beings, which finds expression in a developed notion of political freedom. I suggest that the distinction between positive and negative forms of freedom advanced by Isaiah Berlin is best understood in terms of the different types of political claims invoked by those conceptions. I develop this theory by reference to the work of Charles Taylor, Gerald C. MacCallum, Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld, W. D. Ross, Robert Nozick and F. A. Hayek. I conclude by discussing the role of ethical experience in the interpretation of legal materials. I argue that ethical judgements play an irreducible role in constructing the natural interpretive context for judicial reasoning. I engage with the work of Hart, Lon L. Fuller, Martin Heidegger, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Ferdinand de Saussure and Ronald Dworkin, among others. In the final substantive chapter of the thesis, the potential for ethical judgements to play a constructive role in judicial action is illustrated through a detailed discussion of the doctrine of government neutrality.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158113</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene expression in the human brain: adaptive changes associated with tobacco and alcohol exposure</field><field name="creator">Flatscher-Bader, Traute</field><field name="description">Alcohol and tobacco are drugs of abuse which are legal to sell and consume in most western societies. Addiction to these two substances has major social and health implications worldwide. The brain structure known to mediate addictive behaviour is the dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic system. Dopaminegic neurons arise from the ventral tegmental area, project to the nucleus accumbens and interact with the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. Chronic alcoholism elicits marked damage in the prefrontal cortex with significant loss of neurons and glia. The key components of addiction, tolerance and dependence, are thought to be the result of semipermanent adaptive changes in gene expression. Gene expression profiling of the mesocorticolimbic system from human alcoholics and alcohol-dependent animals has revealed highly region-specific alterations. How these molecular changes result in the development of alcohol dependence in humans is not fully understood. Complicating factors in human alcoholism include a high comorbidity with smoking, socioeconomic factors and the prevalence of underlying psychological pathologies. Gene expression profiling of the prefrontal cortex of six alcoholics and six controls resulted in the identification of functional gene groups sensitive to alcoholism. Mitochondrial function was found down regulated while mRNA levels of genes involved in stress response and cell protection were elevated. These results correlate with the pathology of the prefrontal cortex in chronic alcoholism. Some of the control cases used for gene expression profiling were later identified as chronic smokers, while all of the alcoholics were heavy smokers. To date the heavy co-morbidity of alcoholism with smoking has not been taken into account. Thus the expression of selected genes were investigated by realtime PCR in an extended case set of non-smoking alcoholics, smoking alcoholics, smoking non-alcoholics and non-smoking, non-alcoholics. This study revealed that alcoholism itself had a significant impact on the expression of midkine, the high affinity glial glutamate transporter, member 1 and the tissue inhibitor of the metalloproteinase 3. Heavy smoking itself led to a small but significant elevation of MDK mRNA levels as well as an increase in variation of excitatory amino acid transporter 1 and metalloproteinase inhibitor, member 3 expression. Apolipoprotein D however was induced by chronic smoking but not by alcohol dependence. These results highlight the need of careful case selection in future studies on gene expression in the human alcoholic brain. Peptide antibodies were produced to midkine and a polyclonal antibody against the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 was obtained from a collaborating laboratory. Western blots utilizing these antibodies revealed a marked increase in midkine and excitatory amino acid transporter 1 protein in alcoholics compared to non-smoking and non-drinking controls. In coronal sections of human prefrontal cortex of alcoholics and non-smoking non-drinking controls, immunofluorescence of midkine was obtained from nuclei throughout the layers of the cortex and from the cell bodies of a distinct set of astrocytes in cortical layer II. Double staining with glial fibrillary acidic protein revealed that a portion of midkine-positive nuclei were localised in glial cells. There was no difference in immunostaining of alcohol and control sections with midkine. In summary these results indicate that midkine protein is induced in the prefrontal cortex of the chronic alcoholic. However, this increase in protein may not be strong enough to be visualised by immunohistochemistry. Midkine induction may be reflective of reparative processes in the prefrontal cortex of the chronic alcoholic. Excitatory amino acid transporter 1 staining in non-alcoholic, non-smoking control cases were obtained as a confluent band in cortical layer II and sparsely in deeper cortical layers. Excitatory amino acid transporter 1 immunoreactivity overlapped partially with glial fibrillary acidic protein labelling. In chronic alcoholics, excitatory amino acid transporter 1 staining in the area between the cortical layer II and VI was significantly increased. At withdrawal, glutamate levels may reach toxic levels in the cortex. The increase in cells expressing excitatory amino acid transporter 1 throughout the cortical layers may indicate a protective measure of this brain region in the chronic alcoholic. Additionally, layer specific expression of midkine and excitatory amino acid transporter 1 in the prefrontal cortex of the healthy individual may implicate a specialised role of these astrocytes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270201 Gene Expression</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">brain chemistry</field><field name="subject">alcohol</field><field name="subject">tobacco</field><field name="subject">drug dependency</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158114</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CELL DEATH AND PROLIFERATION IN MENTAL DISORDER</field><field name="creator">Catts, Vibeke Sorensen</field><field name="description">The aetiology of two groups of psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia and the major depressive disorders, are poorly understood. Unlike neurodegenerative conditions, these two disorders have no obvious neuropathology and clues to their aetiology must be gleaned from other fields of research. The dominant models to date have been neurochemical in nature &#150; based on known actions of drugs that improve or mimic these conditions. However, the resulting monoaminergic hypotheses have been found to be over-simplistic and unable to comprehensively account for these complex psychiatric disorders. Based on epidemiological findings concerning perinatal factors and the typical adolescent age-of-onset, as well as the results of neuroimaging and neuropathological studies, research interest is now shifting to the processes involved in neurodevelopment, brain maturation and homeostasis. This thesis explores two such processes &#150; apoptosis in relation to schizophrenia, and neurogenesis in relation to depressive disorders. The negative associations between cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and schizophrenia have led to the hypothesis that patients with schizophrenia have an increased susceptibility to programmed cell death (apoptosis). A study was carried out assessing several apoptotic markers in dermal fibroblast cell lines from groups of patients with schizophrenia, patients with non-schizophrenic psychotic disorder, and healthy comparison subjects. Apoptotic nuclei, caspase-3 activity, and protein levels of Bcl-2, Bax and P53P392Ser were quantified. Apoptosis was studied under basal cell culture conditions and after induction using the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. The results suggested significant abnormalities in the regulation of apoptosis in schizophrenia that do not occur in non-schizophrenic psychotic disorder. It has been proposed that the therapeutic action of antidepressants is related to their effect on hippocampal neurogenesis mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). This hypothesis arose from the finding that blocking the action of BDNF in rodents leads to decreased neurogenesis and increased depressive behaviour. It has also been demonstrated that the neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, is required for BDNF-induced differentiation of neural precursor cells in vitro, although no in vivo data have been published confirming this. A study was conducted to investigate the effect of running and treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (both positive modulators of neurogenesis) on the pool of hippocampal progenitor cells from which new neurons are derived. The pool of hippocampal progenitor cells was found to be a dynamic population, which varies in proliferative potential with the duration of antidepressant treatment. This variation may be attributable to changes in the number of progenitor cells occurring with prolonged induction of neurogenesis. Whether p75NTR plays a role in the regulation of neurogenesis was then determined. Neurogenesis was found to be reduced in p75NTR knock-out mice, providing us with a mouse model for the study of the role of neurogenesis in depression. Future work will depend on the identification of an appropriate behavioural model of depression that responds to chronic, and not acute, administration of antidepressant medication. A third stream of work involved application of high-throughput technology to investigate gene expression in psychiatric disorders. Clues to the aetiology of psychiatric disorders have been sought from microarray analysis of post-mortem brain tissue. In preparation for a microarray study of post-mortem tissue from a large sample of patients with schizophrenia and depressive disorder, post-mortem mRNA degradation was investigated in mouse brain tissue. A subgroup of mammalian mRNA transcripts was found to be particularly susceptible to post-mortem-related degradation, and to be more likely to carry the AUUUA motif in the 3&#146; untranslated region. As transcription factors are more likely to carry this motif, this finding brings into question the suitability of post-mortem tissue for the study of apoptosis and cell proliferation. In conclusion, there is epidemiological, neuroimaging and neuropathological evidence that neurodevelopmental and brain maturational processes are involved in schizophrenia and depressive disorders. Supporting this view, the literature review identified a substantial number of laboratory studies implicating apoptosis in schizophrenia, and neurogenesis in depressive disorder. The series of studies conducted for this thesis added to this body of evidence. However, specific pathway abnormalities are yet to be determined. The complex multi-factorial nature of psychiatric disorder suggests that multiple molecular pathways will be implicated, and that future research needs to be conducted on much larger samples using multi-level assays (genotype - gene expression - protein levels - cellular function). Neurobiological studies of schizophrenia and major depression using large sample sizes, convergent experimental approaches, and employing high-throughput technologies will be required to achieve this aim.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158115</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remodelling N-glycans of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies for enhanced efficacy.</field><field name="creator">Hodoniczky, Jason David</field><field name="description">Recent improvements in antibody engineering technologies have shifted the focus of monoclonal antibody (Mab) development from drug discovery onto flexible and efficient manufacturing. Currently hundreds of Mab products are in clinical trials and due to the high dosages required and an ever increasing demand, concerns have been raised over worldwide production capacity. The large investment in capital required to increase production capacity heightens the need for the development of new technologies to streamline Mab production and ensure their continued success as therapeutics. In addition to cell line and process optimisation, the bioactivity of the Mab itself can be targeted. Improved efficacy could potentially ease pressure on production by reducing Mab dosages and therefore the amount of product required. The focus of the current project is to develop such a bioprocess to enhance Mab bioactivity. The targeting of Mab N-glycosylation provides an opportunity to enhance therapeutic efficacy. This post-translational modification involves attachment of heterogeneous carbohydrate moieties to an asparagine residue and is known to have a critical influence over bioactivity. Current reports suggest that specific alterations in the composition of the carbohydrate structures can significantly improve in vitro bioactivity, including the presence of bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). Previous studies report variations in the relative importance of bisecting GlcNAc from minimal change up to twenty fold elevated in vitro bioactivity. All prior studies have utilised cell engineering techniques which have been reported to cause concomitant glycoform changes. This is one likely contribution to varied Mab bioactivity reported for bisecting GlcNAc, and highlights the need for evaluation by alternative methods. With this in mind the current project engineered N-glycans of affinity purified IgG1 Mabs to introduce bisecting GlcNAc structures. Initial emphasis was placed on implementation of an N-glycan analytical strategy to confidently monitor glycoform changes, and was applied to model therapeutic Mabs. This enabled analytical confirmation for N-glycan remodelling, including GlcNAc transfer to Mab N-glycans following incubation with recombinant N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III). Controlled reaction conditions enabled variable transfer of bisecting GlcNAc to the therapeutic Mabs Herceptin and Rituxan, generating low, medium and high levels of modification. A conserved ten fold improvement to antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) was observed for the therapeutics at high bisecting GlcNAc levels, with no effect on antigen binding. The increase in N-acetylglucosamine content for both IgG1 Mabs also exhibited minimal effect on complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). In summary, in vitro bioactivity of therapeutic Mabs could be specifically enhanced via controlled remodelling of N-glycans to include a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine. This research provides an opportunity to reduce therapeutic Mab doses via a generic downstream bioprocess and circumvent the need to engineer current production cell lines.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158116</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploration of the Experiences of Parents with an Intellectual Disability within a Family Support Program</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Denise Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the experiences of parents with an intellectual disability who participated in a family support program over a twelve month period. It also explores the impact of this program on their ability to effectively parent and protect their children. Parents with an intellectual disability are overly represented within child protection notifications and investigations. This group of parents experience heightened surveillance, as do other marginalised groups, and having a disability becomes a form of oppression in a hostile environment (Read, 2000). Others liken their lived experiences to a form of apartheid (Goggin and Newell, 2005) where the social construction of disability produces negative perceptions and therefore responses by social institutions and systems. Limited attention has been paid to the needs and experiences of parents with an intellectual disability leaving them increasingly vulnerable in the community. Such parents are typically assumed to be 'bad' parents and children usually removed without accurate or appropriate assessment of risk and needs. Relatively few research programs have explored the issues for these parents and even fewer practice options have been available within the general field of family support. This study addresses this gap. This qualitative study explored the experiences of five families where one or both parents had an intellectual disability and where there was increased risk of notification to and or involvement of child protection authorities. All the families participated in a family support program specifically designed for parents with an intellectual disability over a twelve month period. Using in depth interviews with the parents and the practitioners who provided the interventions this study revealed important findings for future practice with this group. The thesis also discusses the implications for policy, practice and future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158117</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">KINETIC AND STOICHIOMETRIC CHARACTERISATION OF ENRICHED NITROSOMONAS AND NITROBACTER CULTURES BY DECOUPLING THE GROWTH AND ENERGY GENERATION PROCESSES</field><field name="creator">Vadivelu, Vel Murugan</field><field name="description">Biological nitrification and denitrification is the most economical and environmentally friendly technology for removing nitrogenous compounds from wastewater. Nitrification consists of two steps involving two groups of microorganisms collectively known as nitrifiers. The first step of nitrification, the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite, is carried out by ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB), while the second step, the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate is catalyzed by nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB). The understanding of the biochemistry and physiological behaviors of these organisms is highly beneficial for the design and optimization of biological nitrogen removal systems. The project aims to fill in the following knowledge gaps concerning the metabolism of both AOB and NOB: (i) the maintenance energy requirements and their dependency on the bacterial specific growth rates, (ii) the in-situ lysis rates, and (iii) the mechanism involved in the free ammonia and free nitrous acid inhibition on the metabolic processes of these microorganisms. This study uses enriched mixed cultures of ammonia and nitrite oxidizers, rather than pure cultures, to better represent the typical nitrifiers in treatment systems. Two labscale sequencing batch reactors were operated for the enrichment of AOB and NOB. Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis showed that the reactors are 82% and 73% enriched with Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter, respectively. The characteristics of Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter were determined using the information obtained from batch tests carried out using the Titration and Off-Gas Analysis (TOGA) sensor, which allowed to investigate the energy production and growth processes separately through controlling the CO2 supply to the biomass. The kinetic parameters determined include the specific maintenance energy consumption rates of both Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter, as a function of specific growth rate, the in-situ lysis rates of these bacteria, as well as their maximum specific growth rates and affinity constants with respect to the key substrates. Utilizing the same method, the inhibitory effects of free ammonia (FA) and free nitrous acid (FNA) on the catabolic and anabolic mechanisms of both Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter were evaluated separately. The main contributions of this thesis are as follows. Both Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter spend significant amount of energy (about 65% for Nitrosomonas and 20- 75% for Nitrobacter) on maintenance processes, which may be partially responsible for the low cell growth yield often observed for these organisms. Further, it was observed that the maintenance energy demand of Nitrosomonas is likely independent of its specific growth rate, while that of Nitrobacter varies considerably with the specific growth rate and the dependency appears to be well described by the Pirt maintenance energy model. The in-situ lysis rates of both the Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter cultures were determined as 0.26 d-1 (300C) and 0.07 d-1 (200C), respectively. These values appear to be lower than the aerobic lysis rates of nitrifiers (0.15-0.43 d-1 at 20-300C) commonly reported in literature using the starvation method. This is to our best knowledge the first time the in-situ lysis rates were directly determined from the activity of heterotrophic bacteria, which would not be possible with pure culture studies and/or with the starvation method. The inhibition studies conducted in this research demonstrated that FNA and FA rather than nitrite and ammonium are the actual inhibitors. FNA and FA were found to have much stronger inhibitory effect on the biosynthesis compared to the catabolic processes of nitrifiers. Further, it was revealed that Nitrobacter and Nitrosomonas possess different level of tolerance to FNA and FA. Both FA and FNA were found to have strong inhibition on the anabolic processes of Nitrobacter, but limited inhibitory effect on the catabolism of this culture. The biosynthesis of Nitrobacter was totally inhibited at an FA level of 6.0 mgNH3-N.L-1 (or above) or an FNA level of 0.02 mgHNO2-N.L-1 (or above). At the same level of FA, the energy production capability of Nitrobacter was only inhibited by 12%, whereas an FNA level of up to 0.05 mgHNO2-N.L-1 did not show any inhibition on the energy production of Nitrobacter. FA up to 16.0 mgNH3-N.L-1 was found to not have any inhibitory effect on either the catabolic or anabolic processes of the Nitrosomonas culture, but both these processes were inhibited by FNA. While an FNA level of 0.40-0.63 mgHNO2-N.L-1 inhibited the energy production capability of Nitrosomonas by 50%, the growth process of the culture was completely inhibited by an FNA concentration of 0.40 mgHNO2-N.L-1. The results obtained in this Ph.D. research demonstrated that the energy decoupling method is a useful tool to determine the kinetic parameters of Nitrobacter and Nitrosomonas, and possibly other microorganisms that use different substrates as carbon and energy sources. Further, the data gained from the inhibition studies suggest that the different level of tolerance to FNA and FA inhibition by Nitrobacter and Nitrosomonas likely contribute to the elimination of nitrite oxidizers from the systems that treat high nitrogen load wastewater through partial nitrification. Moreover, the different inhibitory effect of FNA and FA on the anabolism and catabolism of these bacteria suggest that the inhibition on catabolic and anabolic processes should be investigated separately.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158118</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models of fault-tolerant quantum computation</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Christopher Malcolm</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with certain theoretical problems that arise naturally in the context of fault-tolerant quantum computation. Fault-tolerance can be defined as the art of building reliable devices from unreliable components, and is of particular importance for quantum computers that aim to precisely control the dynamics of extremely sensitive quantum systems. A model of quantum computation is a specification of the basic building blocks by which a quantum computation is implemented. The best known model is the quantum circuit model, where computations are implemented by means of unitary quantum gates that are applied to two-level quantum systems known as qubits. In a physical implementation of a quantum circuit, the gates and qubits will inevitably be affected by noise. Fault-tolerant quantum circuits are designed to be resilient against the effects of this noise, provided that it is not too strong. Fault-tolerance in the quantum circuit model is well developed thanks to the theory of quantum error-correcting codes. These codes allow for the correction of small numbers of errors introduced by a variety of noise processes. In a fault-tolerant quantum circuit, qubits are replaced with encoded qubits, and quantum gates with encoded gates that are immediately followed by special quantum circuits for error correction. Provided the rate at which errors occur is below a constant threshold value, the accumulation of errors can be checked so that the correct output of the computation correctly determined. The threshold acts as both a measure of how good the design of a quantum circuit is, and also as a target for experimenters aiming to implement quantum circuits. Much current research in quantum computation is aimed at designing quantum circuits that increase the noise threshold, hopefully to the point where it becomes within the reach of experimenters. A fault-tolerant encoded quantum gate must limit the propagation of errors so that the code&#146;s corrective capabilities are not overwhelmed. It is not so easy to design encoded gates that satisfy this property, and to date only a finite handful of such gates are known. In a faulttolerant quantum circuit, all quantum gates must be decomposed or compiled in terms of those that may be implemented fault-tolerantly. In the first part of this thesis, we present two results that may be applied to this problem of gate compilation. The first is a generic method based on the Solovay-Kitaev theorem that may be applied to all quantum gates, but is most effective for those that act on single qubits. We present the Solovay-Kitaev theorem in its simples known form as an algorithm, together with novel constructions that can be used to implement it. Following this we give a two specialized methods for two-qubit gate decomposition, based on the Cartan decomposition of the Lie group SU(4). The cluster-state model of computation is an alternative to the quantum circuit model, and makes use of quantum measurements and highly entangled cluster-states to implement a quantum computation. The fault-tolerant techniques developed for quantum circuits are not immediately applicable in this model, so in order for it to be a realistic candidate for performing computations we prove that such techniques are possible. In the second part of the thesis we prove that constant fault-tolerance thresholds may be achieved in the cluster-state model, and in particular in an adaption to an optical implementation. Following this we design a complete error correction scheme for optical cluster-state computation, and numerically determine the threshold of this model in the face of the dominant noise models likely to affect such an implementation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">249999 Physical Sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158120</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE SILENCING OF DISSENT IN THE AUSTRALIAN JEWISH COMMUNITY</field><field name="creator">Salom, Margot F.</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the experiences of Jewish peace activists in Sydney, Australia, who actively dissent from the &#145;mainstream&#146; Jewish community by expressing criticism of the oppression of the Palestinian people by various Israeli governments. Although some literature from the United States addresses the phenomenon of the silencing of dissent in the Jewish community, to date there has been very little research interest in the subject of dissent in the Australian Jewish community. This study sought to investigate the issue of dissent in the Australian Jewish community by examining the experiences of Jewish peace activists within an ethno-religious mainstream. Respondents were drawn from two Jewish peace groups in the Sydney metropolitan area. Data was generated by means of a questionnaire, which was sent to potential respondents at the time of the initial selection process. A series of semistructured, in-depth interviews followed, based on those questions and subsequent responses. The findings reveal that peace activists included in this research feel that there exists a subtle expectation/constraint within the Jewish community that disallows criticism of the Israeli government. Indeed, the majority of respondents revealed that they have personally experienced some form of &#145;silencing&#146; of their opinions and the majority of respondents either keep silent or avoid situations that would expose their views. This research also examines how Jewish peace activists perceive their identification as Jews in view of the attempts to silence their dissenting views. A majority of those interviewed agreed that they regard their activism as an expression of their Jewish identity and that they link their political stance with Jewish ethics related to justice and human rights.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158121</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a philosophy of engineering: context, pluralism and paradox</field><field name="creator">Solomon, Fiona Louise</field><field name="description">Engineering is absolutely central to the modern technological society as a source of physical, environmental and cultural change. As a part of the worldwide technological enterprise, engineering operates within a dynamic and complex system of stakeholders and paradigms. It is surprising then, that while science and to a lesser extent technology have been the objects of philosophical exploration, engineering has received very little of such focussed attention. This thesis aims to highlight the philosophical uniqueness of the engineering endeavour and to urge serious consideration of its fundamental place in this burgeoning world. The intellectual framework of this thesis is perspectivalism, constructed from aspects of social constructivist and feminist principles. The framework facilitates a conceptual analysis of engineering to create a sense of its inter-relationships. Four main contexts are proposed: the professional, the formative, the organisational and the cultural. Using a methodology of systemic connection of ideas as a backdrop to the contextual analysis, each of the contexts is probed in depth. The history and sociology of the profession is an implicit agent in the form and actions of engineering. The identity and influence of engineering discourses work to create form. Characteristics of the occupational setting impact greatly on the engineering process. Lastly, engineering is situated within a wider cultural milieu. By exploring these contexts, the web of ideas connecting the engineering endeavour becomes apparent. Characterising engineering as contextual expresses the inherent paradoxes which naturally emerge from pluralism. Paradox has its heritage in Western thought from the philosophies of Ancient Greece. There, the struggle between the "True" of Plato and the "Good" of the Sophists is examined and shown to have had enormous impact on perceptions of engineering today. Emerging from the exploration of context, pluralism and paradox, the thesis proposes that the foundations for a philosophy of engineering really must derive from a form of relativistic good rather than from concepts of ideal truth. Engineering, so commonly perceived as applied science, is demonstrated to be an independent entity with a philosophy of its own.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158122</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of the performer-composer dynamic</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Christy J.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this critical commentary is to explore the concept of the composerperformer relationship.

While the constitution states that there is a maximum period between elections, early elections are frequently called. This right to call an early election gives the government a control to maximize its remaining life in power. The optimal control for the government is found by locating an exercise boundary that indicates whether or not a premature election should be called. This problem draws upon the body of literature on optimal stopping problems and stochastic control. Morgan Poll&#146;s two-party-preferred data are used to model the behaviour of the poll process and a mean reverting Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) is fitted to these data. Parameters of this SDE are estimated using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) Method. Analytic analysis of the SDE for the poll process is given and it will be proven that there is a unique solution to the SDE subject to some conditions. In the first layer, a discrete time model is developed by considering a binary control for the government, viz. calling an early election or not. A comparison between a three-year and a four-year maximum term is also given. A condition when the early exercise option is removed, which leads to a fixed term government such as in the USA is also considered. In the next layer, the possibility for the government to use some control tools that are termed as &#145;boosts&#146; to induce shocks to the opinion polls by making timely policy announcements or economic actions is also considered. These actions will improve the government&#146;s popularity and will have some impacts upon the early-election exercise boundary. An extension is also given by allowing the government to choose the size of its &#145;boosts&#146; to maximize its expected remaining life in power. In the next layer, a continuous time model for this election timing is developed by using a martingale approach and Ito&#146;s Lemma which leads to a problem of solving a partial differential equation (PDE) along with some boundary conditions. Another condition considered is when the government can only call an election and the opposition can apply &#145;boosts&#146; to raise its popularity or just to pull government&#146;s popularity down. The ultimate case analysed is when both the government and the opposition can use &#145;boosts&#146; and the government still has option to call an early election. In these two cases a game theory approach is employed and results are given in terms of the expected remaining life in power and the probability of calling and using &#145;boosts&#146; at every time step and at certain level of popularity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">230202 Stochastic Analysis and Modelling</field><field name="subject">780101 Mathematical sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158124</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tertiary Education Reform in Thailand: A Case Study of the Reform at a Rajabhat Institute</field><field name="creator">Kovitsomboon, Kant</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with tertiary education reform at a Rajabhat Institute. The reform has been fiamed by the National Education Act of 1999. The specific focus of this thesis is on six areas critical to the process of reform of tertiary education and to the successfid conversion of Rajabhat Institutes fiom teachers' colleges to university status. The principle of excellence has been an inherent and integral part of tertiary education. The rapid progress and changes in technology, politics and the economy have raised questions about the efficiency and effectiveness of tertiary education institutions worldwide, thus reform in tertiary education is a world wide phenomenon and Thailand is no exception, particularly in the case of Rajabhat Institutes. In the move to become a university and to remain competitive, crucial reform measures had to be initiated by the institution. This research has been undertaken to understand the developments as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the reform process in a Rajabhat Institute. Suggestions and recommendations are made to support the pursuit of further improvements at one Rajabhat Institute and possibly at other Rajabhat Institutes as well. The study is contextualized through focusing on three issues, namely: the history of educational reform in Thailand, the impact of globalization, and legislative and political reform in Thailand. Early chapters provide deep analysis of the political and educational reforms in Thailand since King Chulalongkorn's reform movement, which began in 1892, until the recent reform in 1992, which resulted in the proclamation of the Constitution in 1997 and the National Education Act in 1999. The methodology for this research is qualitative inquiry through a case study which focuses on six research questions pertaining to tertiary educational reform in one Rajabhat Institute. The fiamework is derived fiom the provisions pertaining to educational reform in the National Education Act of 1999. The case study is conducted through two specific data sets, interviews and documentary analysis, made richer by personal observation and local knowledge as an "insider" researcher. After collecting the data fiom the institute, the interview data are analyzed and managed into the form of transcripts, then composed into the narrative report while the documentary data are analyzed, managed and represented in the form of tables in many cases, before composing the final narrative report. Findings fiom the documentary analysis supported findings from the interview data in the areas of the six research questions with the feeling that in all cases a great deal more needs to be done: (1) Reform of teaching and learning, particularly the learner-centered approach, has started at RIKP; (2) Educational administration and management is beginning to change in the direction of academic freedom, institutional autonomy and accountability; (3) The institute will need to develop further their internal quality assessment methods and tools, and ensure that they are consistent with its own directions. All action should be taken in accordance with the recommendations from the Office of National Education Standard and Quality Assessment in order to improve the quality of education; (4) There is an urgent need to improve the levels of education of the faculty staff with more incentives needed to encourage faculty staff to conduct research in order that more staff may be promoted to the rank of assistant professor, associate professor and full professor; (5) The tertiary educational reform process requires that multiple sources for hding be found. This will need to include requiring students to bear greater costs for their own education while not forgoing the equity principle of ensuring access to all; (6) The leadership of RIKP promotes and supports the use of technology for education. The institute has committed major h d s to procuring computers but there are still shortfalls in this area, both where teaching and administration are concerned, and the Institute will need to work on creative ways of managing this problem. The conclusion indicates that reform in line with the 1999 National Education Act is still in the early stages. There is progress but to become an internationally competitive university RIKP still has a long way to go. It is hoped that this thesis will be useful in this journey.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158125</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of how John Wesley's theological methodology functions in pastoral practice, illustrated by his doctrine of Christian perfection</field><field name="creator">McEwan, David Bernard</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the theological methodology of John Wesley as he used it in pastoral practice. The study is situated primarily in the area of the history of Christian thought and is located in the area of modern Enlightenment Studies. Wesley&#146;s role as a pastoral theologian is established and his theological methodology uncovered from the perspective of his holistic vision of the God-human relationship being centred in love. This lays the foundation for an examination of his theological sources and tools derived from his extensive writings. Their interaction is explored through an examination of the doctrine and practice of Christian perfection as Wesley offered pastoral guidance to the people called Methodists. There is extensive debate within Methodist circles (particularly in North America) regarding the conception and utility of Wesley&#146;s theological method. Albert C. Outler was the key scholar who identified the components of the Wesleyan quadrilateral (Scripture, reason, tradition and experience) and proposed it as a unique and fruitful conception, with invaluable application for the Methodist movement today. Outler&#146;s claims have been much debated and in many quarters rejected, though his basic understanding remains well-established within influential sections of the church. This thesis is an examination of Wesley&#146;s writings in the light of the current debate to see if a more productive model can be established that will have greater resonance in a postmodern setting. After an overview of the scholarly debate on Wesley&#146;s location and theological method in the eighteenth century, the major focus is Wesley&#146;s own extensive writings over the course of his ministry. This is examined in three periods: 1725-39, 1740-69 and 1770-91. The study seeks to discover for each period his conception of the God-human relationship and what this implies for his theological method. The sources and tools Wesley utilised are then identified, before attention is turned to an examination of Christian perfection as a doctrine and its application in pastoral practice. The study has found that the common assessment of Wesley as a pastoral theologian is correct and this has implications for his approach to theologising. Wesley viewed the core characteristic of God&#146;s nature as love and the God-human relationship is to be defined by the qualities of trust and passion, rather than an intellectual comprehension of propositional truths about God. In his theological method Scripture, reason, community ethos and Christian experience are utilised in an interconnected dynamic network, energised by the presence of the Holy Spirit. God is clearly the sole theological authority and the components of the system are the means he uses for communication. This analysis emphasises the fundamental nature of Christianity as a relationship of love, based on trust rather than an intellectual comprehension of doctrine; it is essentially a matter of the heart rather than the head. Accordingly, pastoral theology is much more important than academic, systematic theology for Christian experience and spiritual formation. Theological method must be shaped by this understanding, and so personal knowledge is always to be valued over intellectual propositions; Christian belief concerns the encounter with God as a Person rather than the mastery of a comprehensive system of doctrines. Critical to this process is the ethos of the community, which is the intimate blending of all the elements under the guidance of the Spirit. This makes Christian experience, rather than merely life experience, of vital importance. Because love and relationships are not reducible to mechanical systems that are merely intellectually comprehended, there is an element of mystery that remains. There is a difference in the way that the Spirit utilises the means when working with the doctrinal substance and the experiential circumstance of Christian perfection. The Modernist approach that is focused on dissection and analysis results in the loss of this holistic, dynamic system and its reduction to either pure subjectivism or rationalism. Wesley&#146;s theological method is much closer to the pre-Modern approach that has been prevalent for most of history and more in harmony with much of the present developments in postmodern thought.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158126</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crustacean Shell Colour Formation and the White Phase of the Western Rock Lobster, Panulirus cygnus.</field><field name="creator">Wade, Nicholas Michael</field><field name="description">Juvenile western rock lobsters modify their shell colour from deep red (herein referred to as Red) to a pale pink during a mass migration off the coast of Western Australia. This colour change and subsequent migration coincides with the landing of a large proportion of the annual quota. Termed the &#145;white&#146; phase by the industry (herein referred to as the White phase), these lobsters have a decreased market value and results in a multi-million dollar loss annually. Shell colour in decapod crustaceans is primarily determined by the carotenoid astaxanthin binding to carotenoid binding protein (CBP) to form a macromolecular protein complex known as crustacyanin. This data presented here comprehensively investigates P. cygnus CBP and the relationship of this protein with the White phase of the western rock lobster. Furthermore, this research demonstrates the use of this species as a model for investigating the regulation of shell colour formation in crustaceans. Firstly, carotenoid analysis of various tissues showed, as predicted, there is significantly less astaxanthin in White western rock lobsters in comparison to Reds. More importantly however, an esterified astaxanthin derivative within the hypodermal tissue appears to be involved in the regulation of shell colour. Secondly, environmental variables such as diet and background substrate colour are known to affect crustacean shell colour. These variables were thoroughly investigated and shown not to be involved in the onset of the White phase, suggesting this phenomenon is under genetic control. Thirdly, CBP was identified within the shell of P. cygnus, and the CBP gene isolated and characterised from this species. An antibody raised against CBP detected a distinct 20 kDa band that formed a large multimeric complex similar to the crustacyanin complex identified in other lobsters. This protein was detected along the outer margin of the shell in significantly lower levels in Whites compared to Reds. Nevertheless, quantitative analysis of CBP gene expression showed no difference between these two groups, suggesting that CBP abundance in the shell was due to protein accumulation not differential gene expression. Differential protein prevalence of CBP in White lobsters further supports the proposition that this colour difference is chiefly related to genetics and not diet. Lastly, a number of nuclear receptor genes were isolated from P. cygnus and their tissue expression profiles investigated. Many of these genes have been shown to be involved in regulating gene expression during the moult cycle in arthropods and may potentially play a role in morphological colour adaptation in crustaceans. Combined, these data suggest that lobsters held in the White phase provide a model for investigating the mechanisms of crustacean shell colour formation in all crustacean species. The results provide insight into the regulation of colour production in decapod crustaceans and the ability to modify crustacean shell colour in aquaculture. This research provides further implications for the molecular basis of the bathochromic colour shift produced by CBP upon binding to astaxanthin. Finally, these findings contribute to our understanding of the evolution of the lipocalin gene family and the evolution of cryptic and adaptive colouration in crustaceans.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158127</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of bioactive compounds in selected Australian native plants and products</field><field name="creator">Sommano, Sarana</field><field name="description">The bioactive properties of food and their relationship to the maintenance of health and protection from degenerative diseases are receiving much attention from nutritionists and consumers. Eating fruits and vegetables is strongly recommended for good health and a desirable intake of antioxidants. Thus the trend in the food industry is toward producing functional foods with increased levels of bioactive compounds. One of the reasons that Australian native plants have become commercial ingredients is that they personify truly Australian cuisine. There is growing interest in value adding native food plants for local and export markets. There is also an increasing interest in the bioactive components of native plants and as a result identifying a role for native plant foods in the functional food market. However there are a number of commercial issues facing native food producers and food processors in delivering consistent quality products to commercial end users based on a food technology and nutrition platform. Some specific bioactive compounds were measured. Lycopene, &#946;-carotene and ascorbic acid were determined by HPLC. The method for determining lycopene and &#946;-carotene required optimisation. It was found that the accuracy of measurement of lycopene and &#946;-carotene was improved if the sample was finely blended to release the lycopene from the food matrix to maximise extraction. Considerable losses were found during the measurement of ascorbic acid by HPLC. An oxygen quenching agent, sodium metabisulphite, was used to delay the rate of ascorbic acid degradation. The rate of addition at 500 &#956;g/mL was found to be very effective. Moreover, since the degradation kinetics can be expressed as a first order reaction, the rate constant k was calculated for each sample. Since loss of ascorbic acid was still observed during long HPLC sequence runs, the k values were used to extrapolate back to the initial ascorbic acid concentration in the samples. Only Australian native plants currently used as commercial ingredients were selected and used through out the work. These were bush tomato, Kakadu plum, wild lime, finger lime, Davidson&#146;s plum, wattle seed and lemon myrtle. The post harvest and handling procedures of all of those above plants were documented. The information was gathered from the farmers, distributors, representatives of Aboriginal community and from the literature. The samples were also collected and tested for bioactive compounds. It was found that post harvest methods of the native plants had an effect on the survival of bioactive compounds. There are two documented post harvest and handling methods for bush tomato, sun and oven drying. Sun drying seemed to give a better appearance however there was lower survival of bioactive compounds. Most of the native plant fruits are frozen for sale commercially. It was found that for the frozen fruit, the levels of bioactive compounds fluctuated probably due to differences in size and species. Bush tomatoes are one of the most commonly used native fruits and these and other native fruits are frequently made into sauces, chutneys and jams. The stability of bioactive compounds is therefore of importance in these kinds of products. A shelf life study was carried out on bush tomato sauce and chutney. Lycopene was measured in the products together with sensory and colour measurements throughout a period of 9 months. The effect of light and temperature was studied. Lycopene was affected by all of the factors and the study also showed changes in colour and flavour in the products. The behaviour of bioactive compounds during processing was studied. Samples were collected during the production of commercial sauces. Bush tomato ketchup, chutney and Kakadu plum chilli sauce were sampled from the start, middle and the end of the processing run. The samples were tested for specific bioactive compounds; lycopene for bush tomato sauces and ascorbic acid for Kakadu plum sauce. The studies showed that lycopene content was constant through out the run for both bush tomato sauces. Similarly, for the Kakadu plum sauce, ascorbic acid content was constant. However the losses appeared to have taken place prior to the making of the final sauce. The effect of heat processing on bioactive compounds was studied on a laboratory scale product. Formulated bush tomato and Kakadu plum sauces were made in the laboratory and also were tested for specific bioactive compounds. Lycopene content increased by 48 % which can be explained by the release of the lycopene from the food matrix. In contrast, there was a large loss of ascorbic acid in Kakadu plum sauce during the heating process. There are two aspects to the food safety issues in dealing with the use of Australian native plants. First, finding ways to eliminate toxic compounds is essential. For example, it is recommended that bush tomato be collected at the ripe and dried stage when any toxins are at a minimum. Second, during the processing of the products, the critical control points need to be carefully tested in order to protect the products from any contamination. The antioxidant capacity of native plants using DPPH, TEAC and total phenol assays was determined. A positive correlation was found between the DPPH and TEAC assays but not between either of these with total phenol content. Kakadu plum was found to be the most effective antioxidant containing plant. However, the results showed relatively low antioxidant activity in Davidson&#146;s plum even though it contains a high amount of total anthocyanins (polyphenols). This could be due to the colour of the fruit extract interfering with the measurement of antioxidant activity because ABTS radical used in the TEAC assay is purple. LC-MS was used for the analysis of flavonoids and anthocyanins in a number of native plants. Davidson&#146;s plum was analysed differently due to the large amount of anthocyanin detected. A lower cone voltage was found out to give a better anthocyanin M+ molecular ion plus fragment ions for the sequential loss of sugar molecule and finally the anthocyanidin M+ ion. The results shown that 6 anthocyanins were found which are in order of decreasing concentration: delphinidin-hexosepentose, cyanidin-hexose-pentose, petunidin-hexose-pentose, pelargonidin-hexose, peonidin-hexose and malvidin-hexose.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158128</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acquisition of word order in Chinese as a foreign language: An error taxonomy</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Wenying Wendy</field><field name="description">Research in the field of Chinese second/foreign language (L2) acquisition, at present, does not match the increasing demand to learn Chinese as an L2, given that Chinese is the fastest growing foreign language (FL) in countries such as Japan, South Korea, the United States, Canada and Australia. There is a significant gap between Chinese L2 acquisition research and the large body of literature in second language acquisition (SLA), which mainly focuses on English L2. The need for more research in Chinese SLA is compelling. Particularly, research in Chinese L2 word order acquisition requires more attention because word order plays a more complex role in Chinese than in English. Chinese relies heavily on word order for information structuring of a sentence because this language lacks other means, such as verb endings indicating tense and aspect, to accomplish this function. Due to the different roles word order plays in Chinese and English, adult English-speaking learners find Chinese word order acquisition very challenging. Chinese L2 word order errors frequently occur in learners&#146; L2 production. However, Chinese L2 researchers and teachers are left with no means to adequately describe and explain these errors for instruction purposes. This dissertation develops such a means &#151; a comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese L2 word order errors. This taxonomy organizes these errors into a logical system of classification. Through the classification, explicit description of various Chinese L2 word order errors is achieved, and specific sources of these errors are traced. Data was collected from 116 native-English-speaking learners of Chinese at a large university in Australia. The Chinese L2 learners were divided into three proficiency levels based on their institutional status. Four hundred and eight word order errors were extracted by qualitatively analyzing the learners&#146; written samples. Among the 408 word order errors, 404 (99%) are successfully classified into different categories according to a new criterion proposed in this dissertation. The new taxonomy provides a principle-based description and explanation of various Chinese L2 word order errors. A word order error is deemed to constitute an error when it violates a relevant word order principle (or sub-principle). These principles not only explain why an error is an error but also provide a means for correcting the error. In a pedagogical sense, the directness and explicitness in explaining word order errors achieved by employing this taxonomy cannot be achieved by relying on any other sources of errors available in the literature. The new taxonomy overcomes the limitations of existing taxonomies in the literature that are either superficial, or unsystematic, or not empirically testable. For example, it draws on the Cognitive Functionalist Approach of L2 acquisition. Both its description and explanation of Chinese L2 word errors go beyond superficiality. The approach maintains that adult L2 learners&#146; conceptualization of the world is initially based on their L1. Their conceptualization of the world imposes constraints on the linguistic structures of their L2. Therefore, errors may occur when English learners of Chinese impose their conceptualization based on the English language onto the Chinese structures. The new taxonomy is systematic because it categorizes word order errors using one criterion. New categories emerging from the data and the existing categories from the literature are incorporated into one system. Finally, the new taxonomy is empirically testable because many new categories emerged from the data. It is an open-ended rather than a closed system. New categories can be added as necessary. The dissertation finds that violation of relevant word order principles has a high explanatory value for the various word order errors encountered in the data. This has clear pedagogical implications. Chinese L2 learners generally lack awareness of the word order principles (and sub-principles) on which the new taxonomy is based. These principles and sub-principles are seen to be of considerable importance to the acquisition of Chinese L2 word order. In order to improve learners&#146; word order performance, the results of this study indicate that it is imperative for the basic Chinese word order principles be included in a CFL curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380201 Applied Linguistics and Educational Linguistics</field><field name="subject">751000 Communication</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158129</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Outline of the Flynn-Chabauty Method for Curves of Genus 2 With an application to the Curve C : y2 = x5 &#8722; 2x</field><field name="creator">Freiberg, Tristan Munro</field><field name="description">We will outline a method, which we call the Flynn-Chabauty method, for determining the set of rational points on a genus 2 curve, of rank 0 or 1, defined over Q. The method is highly developed, and there is an extensive literature on the subject. Since there is no point in re-writing theorems and proofs that have already been presented superbly, our goals are rather modest. This thesis provides, firstly, a summary of some background theory in the arithmetic of genus 2 curves and their Jacobians. Secondly, it provides a summary of the main concepts and results that are necessary to understand and apply the Flynn-Chabauty method, and an outline of the method itself. Third, we provide some MAPLE code to facilitate the application of the Flynn-Chabauty method to specific curves. Fourth, we apply the Flynn-Chabauty method to the curve C : y2 = x5 &#8722; 2x and obtain a complete description of its set of rational points. We hope that this thesis will enable a person with little number-theoretical background to use the Flynn-Chabauty method. We hope that this thesis will also be useful as a guide for the reader who wishes to gain a deeper understanding of the Flynn-Chabauty method.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158130</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CONSTITUTIVE ALK(EN)YLRESORCINOLS AND RESISTANCE TO POSTHARVEST DISEASE IN MANGO (MANGIFERA INDICA L.)</field><field name="creator">Hassan, Md-Kamrul</field><field name="description">The present study aimed at investigating natural resistance mechanisms, especially constitutive alk(en)ylresorcinols in different mango (Mangifera indica L.) varieties in relation to postharvest anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. and Sacc. Resistance to postharvest anthracnose was studied in a range of mango varieties grown in Australia including &#145;Kensington Pride&#146;, &#145;Celebration&#146;, &#145;Nam Doc Mai&#146;, &#145;Calypso&#146;, &#145;Honey Gold&#146;, &#145;R2E2&#146;, &#145;Kent&#146;, &#145;Keitt&#146;, and &#145;Sensation&#146; by comparing anthracnose lesion growth following inoculation with C. gloeosporioides (9.5 &#215; 106 spores/mL). All fruits were obtained from commercial orchards at the mature-green stage of development. Results on fruits not subjected to preharvest chemical sprays showed significant differences among the varieties in resistance to postharvest anthracnose. Varieties &#145;Keitt&#146; and &#145;Kensington Pride&#146; were classed as resistant, whereas &#145;R2E2&#146;, &#145;Nam Doc Mai&#146;, &#145;Kent&#146;, &#145;Calypso&#146; and &#145;Honey Gold&#146; were classed as susceptible. To gain some understanding of how resistance to anthracnose was maintained, concentrations of constitutive alk(en)ylresorcinols (5-n-heptadecenylresorcinol and 5-npentadecylresorcinol) in fruit peel were investigated in a range of varieties over 2 consecutive mango seasons. The variety &#145;Kensington Pride&#146; had the highest levels of 5-nheptadecenylresorcinol (107.27-123.70 &#181;g/g) and 5-n-pentadecylresorcinol (6.32-7.99 &#181;g/g) followed by &#145;Keitt&#146; (49.90-61.44 &#181;g/g 5-n-heptadecenylresorcinol and 3.30-6.05 &#181;g/g 5-n-pentadecylresorcinol). The susceptible varieties had much lower levels of both types of resorcinols. There were significant relationships between the levels of anthracnose (anthracnose lesion area, mm2) following inoculation with C. gloeosporioides, and concentrations of alk(en)ylresorcinols, especially for 5-npentadecylresorcinol (P &lt; 0.001, r2 = 0.69). The two types of alk(en)ylresorcinols in mango peel were also positively and strongly correlated with each other (P &lt; 0.001, r2 = 0.71). Retention of a 2-3 cm long peduncle, and sap, in &#145;Kensington Pride&#146; mango fruit, resulted in significantly smaller anthracnose lesions following inoculation with C. gloeosporioides compared with those fruits &#145;destemmed&#146; and 'desapped&#146; after harvest. The natural stem-end rot infections were also greatly reduced by not-desapping. Peel obtained from &#145;not-desapped&#146; fruits, had higher concentrations of alk(en)ylresorcinols compared with those obtained from the &#145;desapped&#146; fruit. Sap from a range of varieties collected at harvest was analysed over 2 consecutive seasons in order to investigate its physical and biochemical properties. Sap weight per fruit was the highest and the lowest in &#145;Celebration&#146; and &#145;Keitt&#146;, respectively. &#145;Keitt&#146; had the most acidic sap (pH 4.36-4.46) and &#145;Honey Gold&#146; had the least acidic sap (pH 4.59- 4.67). Sap was extracted and was subsequently analysed for alk(en)ylresorcinols by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). &#145;Kensington Pride&#146; and &#145;Keitt&#146; had the highest concentrations of the predominant 5-n-heptadecenylresorcinol (12.44-14.09 mg/g and 6.33-13.04 mg/g), whereas &#145;Calypso&#146; had the highest concentration of 5-n-pentadecylresorcinol (0.61-0.84 mg/g). The lowest concentrations of both resorcinols were found in &#145;Nam Doc Mai&#146; sap. The present study demonstrated that the non-aqueous phase (upper oil layer) of mango sap contained nearly all of the alk(en)resorcinols that were measured, and maturity (as indicated by dry matter contents of fruit pulp), was observed to influence the levels of non-aqueous sap, and ultimately the concentrations of constitutive alk(en)ylresorcinols. The varieties &#145;Calypso&#146;, &#145;Keitt&#146;, &#145;Kensington Pride&#146;, and &#145;Celebration&#146; had the highest volume of non-aqueous sap (15-37% v/v), and &#145;Nam Doc Mai&#146; had the lowest (0-3% v/v). The volumes of non-aqueous phase sap were positively and significantly correlated with the concentrations of 5-n-heptadecenylresorcinol (P &lt; 0.001, r2 = 0.77) and 5-npentadecylresorcinol (P &lt; 0.001, r2 = 0.87). It would appear that the normal commercial practice of desapping mango fruit after harvest removes a large amount of the sap along with the constitutive antifungal resorcinols that confer some resistance to postharvest anthracnose.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158131</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plug-in Proof Support for Formal Development Environments</field><field name="creator">Long, Gregory David</field><field name="description">A number of industrial software development standards mandate that safetycritical software components be developed using formal methods, such as formal verification. While formal development is supported by a number of formal development environments, verification of correctness properties (proof obligations) generated by these formal development environments is still a major bottleneck. Most formal development environments, including the B-Toolkit, provide built-in facilities for discharging proof obligations. However, these built-in tools are typically less mature and sophisticated than stand-alone theorem provers. There are benefits to be gained by having the ability to use a variety of theorem provers to discharge proof obligations, where different provers can be selected for different problem domains. This would allow development environments to be more adaptable. This research will involve the development of a framework for the generalisation and translation of proof obligations (logics) from formal development environments to theorem provers. This allows a single formal development environment to interact with multiple theorem provers and multiple development environments to interact with a single prover. The goals of the research were: &#149; To produce a list of issues that describe difficulties translating between proof tools. &#149; To describe an initial version of a generic framework, for the translation of logics between formal development environments and proof tools, that deals with a selection of these issues.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158132</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Audiological Management of Children with Changing Sensorineural Hearing Thresholds</field><field name="creator">Skinner, Leanne Maree</field><field name="description">Several aetiological categories are associated with changing sensorineural thresholds (SNHL) in children. However, details about the nature of the changing pattern and the audiological management of such cases are rarely reported in the literature. The aims of the present study were, therefore, to analyse and describe the audiological patterns of children with changing SNHL, to investigate the relationship between changing audiological patterns and aetiology of SNHL, and to describe the test procedures and audiological management used for these children. Twenty-one children with changing SNHL, 12 parents of the children and five audiologists were the participants in this study. The study used a retrospective case study design with data being collected on the children from a file audit. The degree of change in hearing thresholds over time was examined for each child in terms of the frequencies that showed change and the decibel range of threshold change. In addition, details of all test procedures were recorded. Parents and audiologists were surveyed to investigate the audiological management strategies used for the children who experienced changing SNHL. Deterioration in hearing was the most common changing SNHL pattern, followed by improvement in sensorineural thresholds. For four children, the improvement was such that they no longer required their hearing aid amplification. Only the children within three aetiological groups maternal rubella, meningitis and large vestibular aqueduct syndrome displayed common changing SNHL patterns. That is, the children within each group showed similar SNHL changing patterns. However, these SNHL patterns were different between each of the aetiology groups. The results showed that regular hearing assessment together with parental interview were the best indicators of the pattern of the changing SNHL. Overall, the parents were able to predict their child&#146;s hearing changes prior to these being confirmed on behavioural or electrophysiological audiological assessment. Regardless of the aetiological category, the audiologists managed the change in hearing similarly for the children. The findings of this study have a number of clinical implications for children with changing SNHL. It is recommended that the children receive regular behavioural hearing assessments, referral for electrophysiological assessment as needed, and regular functional assessments, together with a parental interview. Information should be shared across all professionals working with the child and a written management plan should be developed for each child.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158133</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of regularized inversion in groundwater model calibration and prediction uncertainty analysis</field><field name="creator">Moore, Catherine Rylance</field><field name="description">Groundwater models have a characteristic, common to other environmental models, whereby the desirable number of parameters required to accurately describe the physical phenomenon being modelled is often greater than the number which can be estimated with the available data. This conflict between the need to represent physical detail to accurately model system behaviour, and the sparse datasets that are typically available, leads to the underdetermined nature of model calibration problems. In underdetermined groundwater problems model parameterisation is conventionally undertaken using some kind of simplifying device, to allow a unique model solution to be obtained. Such simplifying devices are either: parameter lumping using zones of constant parameter value; or the use of mathematical regularisation, which allows a multiplicity of parameters to be defined prior to calibration, but which places constraints on parameter relationships or values, such that the calibrated field is a still a simplified version of reality. Both these simplifying devices convert the underdetermined problem to an overdetermined problem that can be solved with standard parameter estimation methods. Model predictions made by these simplified models always have error, which is caused by two sources: (i) observation errors, and (ii) model structural errors, from model inadequacy including, specifically, inadequate levels of parameter detail that occur in underdetermined models. Classical predictive uncertainty analysis methods ignore the second of these sources, however this is often the most significant error source for underdetermined problems. An alternative to the overdetermined, simplifying, approaches described above, is to retain &#147;true&#148; scale parameterisation detail, to allow accurate representation of the physical process being modelled. The drawback of this method is that nonunique parameter solutions result, and so Monte Carlo methods are required; whereby the model is run with multiple parameter fields that have been generated on the basis of a prior hydraulic property variability description, and which all honour calibration constraints. The output of such methods is a full prediction cumulative density function, which encompasses the true prediction and hence defines the prediction error. Monte Carlo methods are computationally very expensive for detailed groundwater parameterisations. Consequently a method which describes the parameter and prediction uncertainty of a single calibrated groundwater model is required if reporting on model prediction uncertainty is to become standard practice, as it should, to avoid the misleading reporting of model results. Regularisation enables a mathematical definition of the relationship between &#147;true&#148;, detailed, hydraulic properties and a simplified calibrated field to be made. This relationship is embodied in the so-called Resolution matrix. This relationship forms the basis for predictive uncertainty analysis for underdetermined models, as is discussed below. This thesis employs resolution analysis to examine the effect of hydraulic property variability on the prediction uncertainty of contaminant transport in groundwater. In particular, this prior knowledge of hydraulic property variability is quantified by means of the variogram as a geostatistical descriptor. This approach provides: &#149; a mathematical description of the likely error of a prediction made by a calibrated model. This description takes account of the two sources of model prediction error, viz. observation errors, and parameter simplification; &#149; the ability to assess the predictive uncertainty of a model prior to the calibration process being undertaken; &#149; the ability to tailor the calibration process such that it can be undertaken to reduce the variance of the prediction it is required to make; &#149; the ability to infer either the nature of true hydraulic property variability, or alternatively to infer measurement error, on the basis of the structure of the calibrated parameter field; &#149; the ability to obtain solutions to the predictive error variance equation in a nonlinear context, via four alternative algorithms presented herein. These results demonstrate that there are far reaching benefits to discretising parameters at the level of detail on which a prediction depends, prior to calibration; despite being unable to uniquely parameterise this detail. Not least of these benefits is the enabling of decision makers to consider the root causes of a model&#146;s predictive uncertainty; to judge what is to be gained from a calibration exercise in terms of prediction uncertainty reduction; and to determine whether such an exercise is cost-effective; and to make better judgements on where best to concentrate future data acquisition efforts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158135</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power loss allocation methods for deregulated electricity markets</field><field name="creator">Lim, Valerie Shia Chin</field><field name="description">The deregulation of the electricity industry has introduced many opportunities as well as challenges to the once monopolised industry. This recent reform towards a competitive electricity industry advocates a need for charging energy losses to market participants through a more satisfactory and transparent mechanism. Market participants, whether they are generators or consumers, would want a loss allocation scheme that is able to reflect each market participants' contribution of generation or usage in the network. However, as electricity is an indistinguishable entity, there is no accurate method to trace the flow of electricity thus far. Hence, the issue of power loss allocation within the deregulated market still remains an unresolved setback to progress to a fully competitive electricity market. Many loss allocation methods have been introduced, however, none have been universally accepted. This thesis investigates existing power flow tracing and loss allocation methods in order to critically analyse the advantages and disadvantages of each method. They include loss allocation methods currently employed in Australia&#146;s National Electricity Market (NEM) and Great Britain Market, as well as a selection of better known loss allocation methods that are introduced in the academic research field. Understanding of these methods makes it easier to choose a method that is more suitable for each electricity market. Many researchers believe that a resolution is through a fair and equitable allocation of losses. However, the definition of &#147;fair and equitable&#148; varies from one literature to another. In general, a fair and equitable loss allocation method should meet electrical laws as well as economical laws. This is because market driven transactions have become the new independent decision variables that define the behaviour of electric power systems. This definition is then used as the basis to assess the results obtained from the implementation of each existing method analysed. It was found that a key limitation of existing methods is the lack of a method that is able to trace the usage allocation of each generator to each load in an electrically justifiable manner. Any improvement to existing loss allocation methods should address this limitation. Thus, the main objective of this thesis is to present two transaction based methods that have been developed and tested by the author of this thesis. Fundamentally, both methods hold the capability to analyse losses involved in the transfer of power from one point of the network to another point. The first investigated method is based on the network reduction method, where a system is reduced to the nodes of interest. The second method is based on the loop frame of reference. Instead of representing the network flows through the commonly accepted nodal frame of reference, power flows within the network are instead expressed as the sum of power flows around loops that links loads to active sources. This provides the loop-based method with an advantage in which it allows the power requirements of a load to be viewed as emanating from an active source and also the advantage of assessing the viability of contract agreements within a hybrid market model. The final objective of this thesis is to analytically compare selected existing loss allocation schemes with the proposed loop-based method. As there are no standard means of judging the accuracy of any loss allocation methods, the author of this thesis proposed a different way to distinguish different loss allocation methods. That is, through the type of competition that each method promotes. A wide range of results is obtained in which the loss allocations of some methods are dependent only on the real power injection at each bus. On the other hand, the loss allocations of other methods such as the loop-based method are dependent on network operation efficiency. The comprehension of the different type of competitions each method promotes aims to assist market regulators in recognising the feasibility of employing each loss allocation method.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290901 Electrical Engineering</field><field name="subject">660301 Electricity transmission</field><field name="subject">660304 Energy systems analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158136</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population genetics and dispersal of a threatened marsupial mammal, Petrogale penicillata, in southeast Queensland</field><field name="creator">Hazlitt, Stephanie Lynn</field><field name="description">Dispersal, the movement of individuals or gametes, is one of the most important life history traits affecting the dynamics and structure of populations. In particular, successful dispersal through the landscape can be critical to the maintenance of genetic variation and persistence of wild populations, especially for small, isolated populations prone to extinction. With many ecosystems now facing threats from habitat fragmentation and alteration, knowledge concerning the ability of species to adapt to these changes through dispersal is crucial for successful species conservation and management. Despite this, the movement of individuals (and genes) remains one of the least understood concepts in ecology and evolutionary biology. However, the emergence of ecological genetic techniques has provided tools to examine patterns of population structure and to infer dispersal at multiple geographic scales. Consequently, ecological genetic methods are becoming central in studies of behaviour and conservation, particularly for small populations or in declining or threatened species. Rock-wallabies (genus Petrogale), medium-sized macropodid marsupials dependent on rocky habitats, are model species for investigating the relationships among genetic diversity, population structure and gene flow in small, fragmented populations. Rock-wallaby colonies are typically &#145;small&#146; and their strong dependence on rocky terrain has resulted in series of discreet colonies distributed across suitable habitat. In addition, ecological disturbances since European settlement, such as predation by introduced predators and land clearing, have had a significant negative impact on some rock-wallaby populations. Currently many rock-wallaby species are in serious decline with rapidly diminishing distributions. Dispersal among spatially isolated colonies is very restricted, and as rock-wallaby colonies become further fragmented by habitat alteration and increased predation pressure, movement of individuals between colonies will become increasingly important to prevent colony extinction. However, baseline information on dispersal behaviour and population dynamics is limited for rock-wallabies and no studies have been conducted in areas in which colonies were embedded in a landscape of continuous rocky escarpment habitat. This thesis combines ecological genetic techniques with long-term mark-recapture records to examine the population genetics and dispersal ecology of the threatened brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata) at two geographic scales in southeastern Queensland, Australia. While contemporary populations of brush-tailed rock-wallabies in the southern part of the species&#146; range are restricted to small, isolated remnant colonies, the northern part of the species&#146; range still sustains many small colonies closely distributed across suitable habitat, providing a rare opportunity to investigate the natural processes of population structure and gene flow within and among populations of a listed threatened species. The first two chapters of the thesis focus on contemporary patterns of population structure and dispersal of brush-tailed rock-wallabies at two geographic scales, within and among colonies. Chapter two combines spatial data on home ranges of individuals and 12 polymorphic microsatellite markers to examine patterns of fine-scale spatial genetic structure within a well studied colony at Hurdle Creek Valley. Patterns of pairwise relatedness and spatial autocorrelation analyses were used to test the hypothesis that dispersal is male-biased in this species. The data demonstrate significant patterns of relatedness among females in close proximity and a female genetic neighbourhood size of only 600m, supporting a pattern of male-biased dispersal in brush-tailed rock-wallabies. This is the first robust evidence for strong female philopatry and spatial clustering of related females within the rock-wallaby taxon. Chapter three investigates genetic diversity, population structure and gene flow among brush-tailed rock-wallaby colonies within and among two valley regions with continuous habitat in southeast Queensland. Using 12 polymorphic microsatellite markers, Bayesian-modeling analyses and traditional population genetic methods (Wright&#146;s F-statistics), I demonstrate a strong and significant pattern of isolation by distance among colonies indicating restricted gene flow over a small geographic scale (&lt; 10km). I conclude that gene flow is more likely limited by intrinsic factors rather than environmental factors. In addition, this chapter provides evidence that genetic diversity is significantly lower in colonies located in a more isolated valley region compared to colonies located in a valley region surrounded by continuous habitat. I discuss the implications of restricted patterns of contemporary gene flow within and among colonies for the conservation and management of brush-tailed rock-wallaby populations in both the remaining &#145;connected&#146; brush-tailed rock-wallaby colonies in the northern parts of the species&#146; range and the remnant endangered populations in the south. Mating dispersal, the dispersal of gametes through mate choice, can also influence population structure and patterns of genetic diversity, particularly in small, isolated, or remnant populations. In chapter four of the thesis I investigate the importance of mating dispersal and breeding group structure to inbreeding avoidance within a brush-tailed rock-wallaby colony. Using 13 microsatellite markers and established likelihood-based parentage analyses, I assign paternity to pouch young sampled over 4 years in the Hurdle Creek colony. The parentage data revealed a remarkably restricted pattern of mating dispersal and strong breeding group structuring for a mid-sized mammal. I suggest that the restricted pattern of mating dispersal, with strong breeding group structuring and male-biased dispersal among groups, facilitates inbreeding avoidance within the Hurdle Creek colony. These results provide insight into the population structure and maintenance of genetic diversity within colonies of the brush-tailed rock-wallaby. Chapters three and four document strong female philopatry and restricted gene flow using nuclear DNA markers; however, the patterns observed could be influenced by landscape clearing or fragmentation. Chapter five of the thesis uses mitochondrial DNA, a maternally inherited marker which better reflects historical processes, to investigate patterns of female philopatry at both the colony and landscape scales. I test the hypotheses that female philopatry over a long time scale has led to lineage sorting among brush-tailed rock-wallaby colonies and that the brush-tailed rock-wallaby is a marsupial species that shows matrilineal genetic structuring. The results confirm that female brush-tailed rock-wallabies are exceptionally faithful to their natal colony and that females sharing mtDNA haplotypes form tight and significant spatial clusters within a single colony. This is the first unequivocal support for the presence of long-term matrilineal genetic structuring in a marsupial mammal. Rock-wallabies are intriguing species. At some time in the past rock-wallabies managed to colonize much of the Australian continent; however, this thesis documents a pattern of strong population structure and restricted dispersal at multiple geographic scales in the brush-tailed rock-wallaby. The final chapter of the thesis attempts to synthesise these findings and discusses the implications of the results for the conservation and management of brush-tailed rock-wallabies, a threatened listed species, and other rock-wallaby species in Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158138</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electromagnetic analysis and design of high frequency coils for magnetic resonance</field><field name="creator">Xu, Bin</field><field name="description">As the signal to noise ratio (SNR) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) improves with increasing static magnetic field strength, there is a strong incentive to develop technology to acquire images at higher fields. While magnet technology has made it possible to generate static magnetic fields of 10 T and more, limitations of the radio frequency (RF) hardware prevent the acquisition of high quality images over full regions of interest in clinical applications. Electromagnetic analysis and the design of high frequency RF coils for magnetic resonance are presented in this thesis to attempt to mitigate the limitations of the RF hardware. Analytical and numerical methods are used in this work to analyze the field and frequency behaviors/limits for various RF volume coils in MRI. As the coils&#146; size approach wavelength of operation dimensions, the performance of conventional lumped element design and traditional excitation strategies for these coils, encounter several problems. Field and frequency limits for the traditional RF volume coils are studied to obtain a better understanding of high frequency RF coil designs. Numerical modeling of the excised, fixed human head at the extreme field strength of 11 T is made, which helps to understand the underlying mechanisms for the severe distortions in the MR images in 11T MRI and confirms experimental observations. Results show that the rotating transverse magnetic field (B1) exhibits good homogeneity in air, but strong in-homogeneity with biological loads at 11T. The simulated signal intensity (SI) distribution within the human head confirms that distortions in the experimental images are mainly caused by the field/tissue interactions.. To rapidly simulate RF field behaviour in the human head for MRI applications, Dyadic Green&#146;s function (DGF)/Method of Moments (DGF/MOM) - based solutions of the electromagnetic field (EMFs) inside a head-sized, stratified sphere are presented. Operating profiles are studied with various RF head coils loaded with various head models/phantoms. The RF field behaviour and tissue/field interactions are also obtained by case studies at different frequencies for different coils. New methodologies and innovations on high frequency RF coil design are next investigated. An inverse method with pre-emphasized B1 field is proposed herein, and the method of pre-emphasizing the target field with the consideration of the dielectric materials proved to be encouraging in preliminary designs. The results demonstrate that inverse-method designed coils with pre-emphases of target fields can help in decreasing the notorious bright regions caused by wavelength effects in the human head images at 4T. An 8-element phased array head coil operating at 4T is designed based on a combined idea from reciprocity theorem and inverse method. Using this new method, either circularly or linearly polarized head coils can be designed. The simulation results reported herein demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of the design concept, which shows that improved B1 field homogeneity is achievable. Another new method in ameliorating image distortion at 11T (470 MHz) MR brain imaging applications uses a shielded 4-element transcieve phased array coil and involves performing 2 separate scans of the same slice with each scan using different excitations during transmission. That is, parallel transmission phase cycling. By optimizing the amplitudes and phases for each set of the scan, signal distortion that is antipodal from one another can be obtained and by combining both images together, image distortion can be alleviated several fold. The simulation results reported herein demonstrate the feasibility of the concept where transmission phase cycling of parallel imaging elements with different excitation pulse reconstruction is theoretically achievable. The strategy of improving the transmitting B1 field homogeneity through active control of source profiles is studied. This method tailors the RF amplitudes and phases applied individually to the rungs of a resonator with the use of an optimization scheme. Numerical simulations are used in an attempt to find optimal source profiles for high frequency RF coils. The simulation results demonstrate the strength of the optimal source profiles for different targets in high field RF coil or phased array designs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="subject">671402 Medical instrumentation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158139</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Emperor and the Roman Elite from Commodus to Maximinus (A.D. 180-238)</field><field name="creator">Davenport, Caillan James Roderick</field><field name="description">Rome had twelve masters between the years A.D. 180-238, eleven of whom were murdered or killed in battle.

This thesis will argue that the rapid turnover of emperors in these fifty-eight years precipitated a crisis among the Roman elite. Senators and equestrians competed with each other, and with less exalted members of society, such as freedmen, to become members of the emperor&#146;s inner circle. Dio Cassius, a senator who began his Roman History during the reign of Septimius Severus, serves as an effective contemporary witness to the upheavals taking place at court and within society at large. Contrary to the views of scholars such as Crook and Syme, who place great emphasis on the continuity of policy provided by the emperor&#146;s amici, this thesis will demonstrate that there was significant discontinuity at the imperial court. Imperial advisers were not a fixed group retained from reign to reign &#150; instead, each new emperor chose to install his own supporters in key positions in order to put his own stamp on the administration of the empire. This has given rise to a tendency to label some rulers as &#145;anti-senatorial&#146; and others as &#145;pro-senatorial&#146;. Even those emperors who executed large numbers of senators, such as Commodus and Septimius Severus, had amici from within the senate whom they trusted and relied upon. The favour bestowed on such senators who formed part of the emperors&#146; exclusive cabal was a source of continual tension among the Roman elite. The amici formed a heterogeneous group, whose only common link was that they had earned the favour of the emperor of the day.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430110 History - Classical Greek and Roman</field><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158140</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dark husk of beauty</field><field name="creator">Leggett, Andrew Alfred George</field><field name="description">In my dissertation &#8211; a collection of poems entitled Dark Husk of Beauty &#8211; I struggle with the dualities of beauty and ugliness, of creation and destruction. This Dark Husk of Beauty is what remains when I follow the exhortation of John Scott&#8217;s magician Aosman to take the ugly, or the deformed, or the old, and transcend &#8230; natural revulsion by uniting with it aesthetically &#8211; sometimes even physically. The body, subject to such a union, becomes the central metaphor of this creative work. The poems in the title section address the fierce disintegrative beauty of the body subject to the ravages of passion, disease and death. Those of the second section take up the metaphor of &#8220;Prophecy&#8221; &#8211; Ezekial&#146;s prophecy over the plain of dry bones that, gathered together, grow flesh and are restored to life. In the third section, &#8220;Wings of Desire&#8221;, the poems defiantly transcend aesthetic dualism, undeterred by the punishments inflicted on the body for the artists&#8217; heresy. The final poem, a sequence of versions of lesser known works of Rilke, attempts to negotiate the portal separating such extremes through grace. My critical essay &#8211; A Psychoanalytic Discourse on Creation, Destruction, Perversion, Reparation and Creation in the Works of John Scott &#8211; addresses the problems of such creation by means of a psychoanalytic literary discourse. The relationship between creativity and perversion is discussed in the course of comparatively examining issues of indebtedness, desire, damage, destruction and repair in the poetry and fiction of John Scott and in my Dark Husk of Beauty.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158141</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional genomics of the protein kinases and phosphatases of mouse</field><field name="creator">Forrest, Alistair Raymond Russell</field><field name="description">Protein phosphorylation is a key post-translational modification used to control the activity, stability, localization and interactions of many proteins. Within a cellular context it is used to regulate processes as diverse as development, memory, cell cycle, immune response and homeostasis. Phosphorylation state is regulated by two classes of enzymes, the protein kinases that attach phosphate groups and the protein phosphatases that remove them. This PhD defines the set of over 500 protein kinases and 150 protein phosphatases in mouse and provides two online resources detailing their sub-cellular localization, classification, expression, genomic organisation and variant transcript isoforms. To place the project within a historical context, this research was carried out in what is now referred to as the &#147;post-genomic era&#148;. In the years 2001-2005 a number of genomic sequences were published including those of human and mouse. One of the major tasks is to understand what is encoded in these genomes. How many genes are there? How is their expression controlled? And how do these genes and their genetic structures encode the instructions to build complex multi-cellular organisms such as ourselves? Annotation of these genomic structures has relied heavily upon pre-existing cDNA sequences and bioinformatic predictions. In the case of mouse, genomic annotation was greatly aided by the release of full length cDNA sequences generated for the Functional Annotation of Mouse (FANTOM) project at RIKEN Genomics Sciences Center in Yokohama Japan. Prior to commencing my PhD in 2003 I was invited to participate in the functional annotation of 60,770 full length mouse cDNA sequences as part of the FANTOM2 project. It is from this involvement that my project on the protein kinases and phosphatases of mouse came about. In the first chapter, using the full length cDNA sequences from FANTOM2 and all public mouse cDNA sequences available at the time, two bioinformatic analyses were carried out that resulted in publications. The first searched for mouse homologues of known cell cycle related genes, this identified novel cyclins and NIMA related kinases. The cell cycle set was enriched for protein kinases and protein phosphatases a number of which appeared to be novel to mouse. This led to the second publication which catalogued all mouse protein kinase and phosphatase genes, and described their domain content. This set was collectively referred to as the phosphoregulators, as together they regulate protein phosphorylation states. The second chapter provides in depth annotation of the phosphoregulators and combines experimental and bioinformatic approaches to provide sub-cellular localization, tissue specificity, classification, and interaction data for every protein kinase and phosphatase of mouse. This resulted in the third manuscript and the release of an online interface (http://phosphoreg.imb.uq.edu.au) to aid researchers in the field. The manuscript also reveals that many of the phosphoregulators display tissue specificity and can be restricted to particular cellular compartments. This information is crucial in evaluating potential enzyme-substrate associations from high throughput phosphorylation screens. The third and final chapter covers transcriptional complexity and how transcript variants of the protein kinases and phosphatases may act as extra components in protein phosphorylation systems. This final chapter is composed of three papers. Two of these are major papers of the FANTOM3 consortium. The first describes the transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome including transcript variants while the second provides a high resolution map of transcription start sites in mouse. The remaining paper describes the transcript variants of every protein kinase and phosphatase of mouse. Through the extensive use of alternative transcription start sites, termination sites and splice junctions at least 75% of these loci generate alternative transcript isoforms. Furthermore many of these transcripts are predicted to encode peptides with altered sub-cellular localization, activity and substrate affinity. The publication also includes a detailed description of secreted and tethered decoy forms of the receptor kinases and phosphatases many of which had not been previously described. To complement this publication an online interface was developed to summarise the variant sequences while displaying their genomic structure (http://variant.imb.uq.edu.au).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158142</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An architecture for ubiquitous mobile service delivery</field><field name="creator">O'Brien, Paul Francis</field><field name="description">Highly mobile people (HMPs) require flexible, reactive service delivery due to their regularly changing location and activities and the lack of a wired network connection. A mobile service delivery system should be able to detect relevant events that occur such as change of location, availability of new last-minute specials, sales opportunities and safety issues and then reactively take action in response to these events. This work describes a situation management ontology based framework for delivering such a system. Issues addressed include HMP and service states and events, context, situations and situation-action rules, and syntactically and semantically compatible XML ontologies for their specification. A generic situation management ontology is developed in OWL using the ontology development tool, Prot&#233;g&#233;. This ontology is combined with domain specific classes in the travel domain to create a travel situation management ontology that can be used as the basis for a ubiquitous mobile travel service application. Using a typical independent traveller scenario, the travel situation management ontology is instantiated to demonstrate its effectiveness. The flexibility of the generic situation management ontology is demonstrated by creating an academic situation management ontology by simply replacing a small number of domain specific classes. A framework is also proposed that is based on the situation management ontology, distributed, co-operating software agents, and context based filtering, and is suitable for mobile service delivery. The example framework uses the situation management ontologies developed in this work and action rules to link situation specification to situation detection and action. The ontologies and action rules are semantically consistent and are specified in the XML based, industry standard language, OWL, thus drawing together previous independent work in a number of diverse disciplines.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280104 Computer-Human Interaction</field><field name="subject">280201 Expert Systems</field><field name="subject">700102 Application tools and system utilities</field><field name="subject">350599 Tourism not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">710599 Tourism not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158143</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Potential effects of S18886 on atherosclerotic plaque stability</field><field name="creator">Tailford, Kristy Ann</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular diseases are responsible for over 50% of all deaths in Western society, with the underlying cause of most a single disease - atherosclerosis. Several classes of drugs have been developed to treat the clinical sequelae of atherosclerosis, such as myocardial infarction, including the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors (statins) which lower serum cholesterol and anti-platelet drugs such as aspirin and clopidogrel. These drugs are often used as combination therapy. As the activation of thromboxane prostanoid (TP) receptors by thromboxane A2 (TXA2) is implicated in secondary thrombotic events following myocardial infarction, TP receptor antagonists are a potential therapy. S18886 is a recently developed potent TP receptor antagonist under investigation. It inhibits platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction induced by the agonists of TP receptors, with no effect on the production of prostacyclin. S18886, like statins, has pleiotropic effects in addition to its demonstrated anti-thrombotic properties. Previous studies in our laboratory and others have found that treatment with S18886 prevents the development and progression of atherosclerosis in animal models by significantly decreasing the quantity of lipid-laden macrophages in fatty streaks and advanced lesions. In vitro, S18886 inhibits monocyte adherence to stimulated endothelial cells consistent with its inhibitory effects on ICAM-1 expression in vivo. Since macrophage-related proteolysis within atherosclerotic plaques contributes to the weakening of the protective fibrous cap and therefore promotes the susceptibility of those plaques to rupture, we hypothesised that S18886 may stabilise the vulnerable plaque. Thus, in this thesis the effect of S18886 on the stability of pre-formed atherosclerotic plaques was examined in the cholesterol-fed rabbit model, and its effects compared with aspirin, clopidogrel, and pravastatin alone and in combination. S18886 was shown to inhibit the atherogenic process in both uninjured and injured arteries, and provided additional, and indeed, superior benefits to those achieved with the currently available therapies. S18886 completely inhibited pre-existing fatty streaks from becoming thicker in spite of the continued presence of hyperlipidaemia. Animals treated with S18886 alone had stainable lipid in the fatty streaks no different from the control, indicating that it completely inhibited further lipid accumulation within the wall. S18886 prevented progression of lesion formation by controlling macrophage accumulation and subsequent MMP-9 expression. This was further indicated by the inhibition of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in S18886-treated Groups. Combining S18886 with aspirin, clopidogrel or pravastatin yielded some beneficial effects when compared to the comparator drugs alone, although even combined with S18886, aspirin barely improved in efficacy. S18886 in combination with clopidogrel or pravastatin prevented progression of advanced lesions. The addition of S18886 to pravastatin also resulted in a significantly smaller accumulation of macrophages in the injured femoral artery compared to pravastatin alone. S18886 combined with clopidogrel significantly reduced the macrophage accumulation and MMP-9 content when compared to clopidogrel alone. Notably, S18886 and clopidogrel proved to be more beneficial than clopidogrel and aspirin in several parameters. The mechanism by which S18886 exerts its plaque stabilisation effects is through antagonism of TP receptors. TP receptors are stimulated not only by thromboxane, but by other products of oxidative stress such as hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETES) and F2-isoprostane. HETES and F2- isoprostane are nonenzymatic peroxidation products of arachidonic acid that are not inhibited by aspirin. Antagonism of TP receptors prevents expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on endothelial cells, which in turn does not allow monocyte-derived macrophage entry into the vessel wall and thus decreases the potential for MMP production and plaque destabilisation. In summary, we suggest that S18886 may prove to be effective clinically in preventing patients &#145;at risk&#146; from further atherosclerotic plaque progression and the development of clinical sequelae such as plaque rupture, when administered either alone or when added to the regimen of lipid-lowering statins or anti-platelet therapies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158144</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Freeing a Captive Mind: Debates, Discourses and Prospects of an Indigenous Sociology in Hong Kong</field><field name="creator">Chu, Wai Chi Rodney</field><field name="description">Indigenizing knowledge of social sciences has been a major concern among sociologists in recent years. Critical scholars have been most troubled by the domination of Western, and frequently Euro-centric theoretical paradigms in non-Western academic arena and argue that as a result, the development of social sciences, especially in the field of sociology, in non-Western societies has been characterized by a lack of critical reflection that in many cases manifested by a visible &#145;academic dependency&#146; and a &#145;captive mind&#146;. The aim of this thesis is to examine the development of sociology in Hong Kong as a case study of such Western domination in the ex-British colony since the discipline was first introduced in early 1960s. It argues that the continuous emphasis of positivist tradition in sociological training and research, which was somewhat mirroring the dominance of positivistic functionalism of the time, has laid down the condition of creating a sociology that is utilitarian, uncritical, non-reflexive and a thin level of comparative perspective, and resulted in a light-hearted concern on metatheoretical pursuit. By making use of the research on Chinese families in Hong Kong since the 1960s, the high-profiled Social Indicators Research Project in the 1980s and 90s, and the Minimally-Integrative-Social-Political-System Study that runs throughout the entire period, the influence of such Western domination in Hong Kong&#146;s sociological research is exemplified at both the methodological and theoretical level. The thesis proposes that as the discipline of sociology is currently undergoing a self-reflexive phase that questions many of its assumptions of rationality, reason, truth and progress, articulated through the debates and discourses of postmodernism, post-colonialism and other &#145;-isms&#146;, it is timely to rethink the prospects of indigenizing social science knowledge, in particular, the development of a Hong Kong sociology that re-validates not only the &#145;relational self&#146; that has long been a key guiding concept in early Chinese sociology, but also reflects adequately the complex cultural forces and tensions that the society has inherited. It is in this context that the indigenization of sociology could contribute to the development of a &#145;universal&#146; sociology that does not see and interpret the world through Euro-centric or Western lenses.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158145</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The design and analysis of high frequency phased array coils for MRI</field><field name="creator">Li, Bing Keong Joe</field><field name="description">This thesis is focussed on extending the use of phased array radiofrequency (RF) coils for use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Phased arrays are very useful as receiver coils and have been used over the last 15 years or so to improve receiver coil coverage and to speed up image acquisition. These arrays have almost invariably been constructed and used at mid- to highfrequency (&amp;lt128 MHz), thus there is clearly an opportunity to increase the operating frequency of the phased array and also use these systems in transceive mode. Using phased array coils in transceive mode has the advantage of gaining better spatial specificity of excited regions. Also as the operating wavelength in high field strength is shortened by the dielectric properties of the patient and approaches the size of conventional transmitter coils, there are distinct advantages in using the smaller coils in the phased array system for transmission. In addition, with the ability to independently control the magnitudes and phases of the transmission power on each element of a transceiver phased array system, RF focussing or shimming can be performed during RF transmission. The research work presented in this thesis is therefore, primarily focussed on designing and analysing high frequency phased array coils for MRI applications with transceive and RF focussing capability and investigating the possibility of using focussing transceive phased array coils to ameliorate image distortions that appear in high field MR images. The second major area of work concerns evaluation of the performance of partial parallel imaging when used at high field strength and the compatibility with transceive phased array systems. Common to both areas are investigation into other approaches for the design of high field RF coils, exploring the possibility of new mutual decoupling techniques and the consideration of other numerical computational methods that can assist in designing future high frequency phased array coils and help evaluate the complex field-tissue interactions at high field strength.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="subject">671402 Medical instrumentation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158146</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal Monitoring and Harvesting of a Wild Population Under Uncertainty</field><field name="creator">Hauser, Cindy Emma</field><field name="description">Harvesting a population sustainably as a resource is a common problem in wildlife and fisheries management. In a typical situation population size and other state variables are monitored at fixed intervals and the resulting estimates are used to determine a quota or harvest effort. Such decisions must be made in the face of a range of uncertainties: environmental variation, an imperfect ability to observe state variables, an imperfect ability to implement management decisions and imperfect knowledge about how the population fluctuates dynamically in response to management actions. In this thesis I explore the effect of these uncertainties on the optimal management of wild populations. In chapters 2 and 3, populations with significant age or stage structure are examined. When individuals of different maturity within a population have significantly different life history traits, the structure of the population and of the harvest taken can have a large effect on the growth rate of the population. In chapter 2 a simple matrix model is used to make observations about the role of demographic structure when the objective is to maintain the population below its carrying capacity. Uncertainty in the structure of the population and the manager's ability to select the harvest structure complicate optimal harvesting. In chapter 3 plausible models are developed for the maintenance of the Atlantic population of Canada geese (Branta canadensis) within acceptable population bounds, given uncertainty about the strength of density dependent population regulation and the limited ability of managers to achieve large harvests. Stochastic dynamic programming is used to determine the optimal harvest strategy under each of the plausible models. It is found that the target long-term population size depends critically on the strength of density dependence. Under the density-independent model, limits to harvest also influence the target long-term population size. Chapter 4 explores the theory of adaptive management. In adaptive management we seek the optimal harvest decision in the presence of model uncertainty. Plausible models are weighted according to the amount of evidence currently supporting them. The optimal harvest decision is obtained by weighting the expected returns under each model. When the population is monitored subsequent to harvesting, the evidence supporting each model can be re-evaluated. In this way the model best describing the system dynamics can be learnt over time (passive adaptive management). Particular harvest decisions may accelerate learning and provide better management in the long term. However these actions are often perceived as risky and so short-term losses must be balanced by long-term benefits (active adaptive management). To test these ideas, a simple population model with an uncertain parameter is constructed. Fixed, passive adaptive and active adaptive harvest strategies are developed using stochastic dynamic programming. It is found that the passive adaptive strategy is `certainty-equivalent', meaning that the current best estimate of the uncertain parameter is used as if it were the true parameter value. Over very long time horizons, the active adaptive strategy probes for information but in the short-term it is actually more precautionary than the certainty-equivalent strategy. The passive and active adaptive strategies perform similarly well in maximising harvest, and both outperform fixed non- adaptive strategies. Two different sets of plausible models produce consistent results, leading to the conclusion that it is important to incorporate model uncertainty, but the specific approach does not critically affect the results. In chapter 5 the problem of optimal adaptive monitoring is considered. The most common approach to harvest management is to use the same monitoring effort at regular intervals to estimate state variables. This approach neglects the large costs often involved in population monitoring, assuming that the level of accuracy achieved is both necessary and sufficient to make the appropriate harvest decision. I take an alternative approach, combining the costs of monitoring and the expected benefits for management in a single framework to determine the level of monitoring accuracy required. Monitoring effort becomes a state-dependent decision at each time interval, determined by prior information about the state variables. This approach is demonstrated using data for a red kangaroo (Macropus rufus) population in South Australia. This document is not a comprehensive treatment of optimal harvesting under uncertainty. However it does indicate the ways in which uncertainty complicates the harvest of wildlife, and its potential effect on optimal harvesting and monitoring decisions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158147</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Interactional Significance of Tears: A Conversation Analytic Study</field><field name="creator">Harris, Jessica</field><field name="description">Crying is a universal human behaviour (Darwin [1872] 1965) that occurs in a range of everyday interactional settings. Research has been undertaken on the biological, psychological, literary, anthropological and philosophical aspects of crying. Very little research, however, has been performed on the social organisation of crying in talk. Past sociological and psychological research has tended to use surveystyle studies to elicit information about participants&#146; crying behaviour, which use the term &#145;crying&#146; as a &#147;unitary and self-evident category&#148; (Hepburn 2004). Similarly, most interactional studies involving crying episodes (Manzo et al. 1998; Whalen and Zimmerman 1998) have described, rather than accurately transcribed, the incidence of crying in interaction. In this way, many of these previous studies have relied upon participants&#146; and readers&#146; members&#146; understanding of what &#145;crying&#146; is, in order to answer survey questions or understand transcripts. The aim of this study is to provide detailed descriptions of how crying episodes are produced and managed in talk in a variety of settings. This research uses the methods and approach of Conversation Analysis (CA) to examine the incidence of crying in three settings: two clinical - counselling, medical training - and one nonclinical - the Australian reality television program &#147;Big Brother&#148;. From these three settings five &#145;slots&#146; of activity, associated with crying episodes, have been identified and used to structure the examinations of the sequential order in these interactions and analysis chapters of this thesis. The first of these slots builds upon Hepburn&#146;s (2004) paper on crying in talk to examine how episodes are produced. This chapter analyses the seven &#145;features of crying&#146; described by Hepburn and proposes two additional actions used in the production of crying episodes. The second analysis chapter extends the scope of previous CA research by investigating the ways that participants in these data display their orientation and respond to crying episodes. A particular focus of this examination is the differences between responses to crying in clinical and non-clinical settings. The aim of the third and fourth analyses is to show that, in these interactions, crying is treated as an &#145;accountable&#146; action. These chapters include descriptions of the solicitations and practices used by the participants to account for their crying episodes. The analyses draw on Discursive Construction and Membership Categorisation Analysis to indicate how the examination of the content of accounts may provide a rich resource for the study of how members explain their crying episodes. The last activities slot, identified as a constituent feature of crying in these interactions, concerns the way in which participants move away from talk about crying and initiate new topic sequences. Particular attention is paid to how participants in clinical settings talk about crying while keeping it &#145;outside the business&#146; of the interaction. This study offers detailed observations of the sequential orders implemented by participants to produce and manage crying in talk. Furthermore, the practical implications and applications of my research for communication in clinical settings are outlined.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158149</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hardware Acceleration of Security Application Using Reconfigurable System-on-Chip</field><field name="creator">Chen, Yi</field><field name="description">The ubiquity of Internet connectivity means there is a greater need for computer network safety and security. Cost-effective secure computing networks and broadband applications not only need a sophisticated cryptosystem to accelerate data encryption, but also need substantial computational power to handle large data streams. Reconfigurable System-on-Chip (rSoC) technology is well suited to accelerate network cryptographic applications by implementing the entire computing application on a single reconfigurable chip. Hardware-software co-design and hardware-software communication are some key questions involved in using this rSoC technology. This thesis investigates how best to accelerate a cryptographic application using rSoC technology. Some background on FPGAs, reconfigurable computing, inter-process communication methods, hardware/software co-design, cryptography in general, and 3DES in particular are firstly introduced. Some existing reconfigurable computing systems and 3DES implementations on FPGA are then reviewed and analyzed. A new general hardware-software architecture, which consists of a CPU, memories, customized peripherals and buses on a single FPGA chip, is designed to accelerate the security application. The 3DES application is divided into four functional modules: input, subkey generation, data processing, and output modules. Shared memory with semaphores is chosen for the inter-module communication. A complete inter-module communication solution is presented for hardware and software module communications. A generic component, HWCOM, is designed for those communications which involve hardware modules. Experimental results show that using two buffers as shared memories between communication modules and increasing shared memory size are good methods for transferring data between hardware/software modules more efficiently. When investigating the best hardware/software partition scheme, all 3DES modules are first executed in software on the FPGA. The experimental results of 83Kbps encryption throughput indicate that the software-only solution is not satisfactory. Through profiling, the bottleneck is shown to be the data processing module and the subkey generation module, which are then implemented in hardware. Experimental results show an improved 179Mbps throughput. This presents over 2000 times acceleration compared to software and shows that the hardware-software co-implementation can efficiently accelerate the 3DES application with good performance and flexibility.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reconfigurable computing</field><field name="subject">system-on-chip</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="subject">3DES</field><field name="subject">hardware</field><field name="subject">software</field><field name="subject">inter-module communication</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158150</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magnetic Antennas for Ground Penetrating Radar</field><field name="creator">Bellett, Patrick Thomas</field><field name="description">The concept for a novel new antenna design is presented and investigated for application to ground penetrating radar (GPR). The proposed new antenna design is called the shielded magnetic bowtie antenna (MBA). As the name suggests, it is predominately constructed from a bowtie-shaped volume of magnetic material that is fed from the centre of the structure by a small magnetic loop antenna. This thesis develops the magnetic antenna concept and investigates its potential for GPR predominately through numerical modelling. However, a significant part of the investigation concentrates on validating the numerical modelling technique developed to study the shielded MBA by comparing the results with measurements obtained from a scale model constructed to operate in the watertank antenna test facility, a controlled environment for GPR antenna research. The broadband properties required for GPR antennas are achieved uniquely with the shielded MBA design by a combination of the antenna shape being defined in terms of angles and an inherent magnetic loss mechanism within the antenna material structure. The design also affords an intrinsically placed antenna shield that has the potential for mitigating problems typically experienced with shielding electric dipole antennas. Antenna shielding is an important consideration for GPR antenna designers, especially given the recent US government (FCC) changes that restrict radiated energy emissions within the regulated spectrum used by GPR systems. In addition to providing the intended directional radiation properties, the magnetic antenna shield also provides an elegant solution for a low-loss wideband balun, allowing the antenna to be effectively fed from an unbalanced coaxial transmission line. Other important aspects of the proposed design are discussed in relation to the requirements for GPR antennas. Numerical models of the magnetic antenna concept show encouraging bandwidth results. For example, from a simple comparison with an equivalent sized electric bowtie antenna model, the effective gain bandwidth of the magnetic antenna is found to be at least 3-octaves compared to approximately 2-octaves for the electric bowtie. The shielded magnetic antenna achieves a gain of approximately 2 dB, compared to 5 dB for the unshielded electric bowtie antenna. However, it is noted that the magnetic antenna models contain significantly more loss compared to the electric bowtie model. The shielded MBA design emerged from a theoretical investigation of electrically small GPR antennas, given that the initial thesis objective was to investigate ways of improving low frequency GPR antennas. In general, GPR systems are operated with electric dipole antennas, such as the electric bowtie. Interestingly, the electrically small antenna investigation revealed that only the small magnetic loop (i.e., magnetic dipole) antenna can be constructed to approach, arbitrarily closely, the fundamental bandwidth limit for small antennas. This surprising and counter intuitive result is shown to be theoretically achievable with the use of magnetic materials. For the small loop antenna, energy stored within the antenna structure can be avoided by filling the antenna sphere with a perfect magnetic material. This theoretical argument is discussed and supported by numerically modelled results. The electrically small antenna investigation presented in this thesis extends to include the influence that proximity to a lossy dielectric half-space has, on improving the antenna impedance bandwidth. This investigation is of general interest for GPR; it is performed numerically and supported by measurements conducted on an experimental loop antenna situated at various heights above the ground. These results provide support for the hypothesis that a magnetic antenna may experience less influence from near-field changes in the dielectric properties of the ground compared to the equivalent sized electric field antenna.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ground penetrating radar</field><field name="subject">Broadband antenna</field><field name="subject">Shielded magnetic bowtie antenna</field><field name="subject">Magnetic loop antenna</field><field name="subject">Electric field antenna</field><field name="subject">Electrically small antenna</field><field name="subject">Electromagnetics modelling</field><field name="subject">Method of Moments</field><field name="subject">Antenna measurements</field><field name="subject">High frequency ferrite materials</field><field name="subject">Magnetic permeability</field><field name="subject">Dielectric permittivity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158152</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of a chromosomal segment of P. vivax with that of P. falciparum</field><field name="creator">Chavchich, Marina</field><field name="description">P. falciparum and P. vivax are two human malaria pathogens. Although these parasites share the same hosts, they are evolutionary distant species, differing in genome composition and organisation, parasite life cycle and clinical manifestations. Genome comparison of these two species is fundamental to increase our understanding of common biological processes, as well as unique properties of each pathogen, which is necessary for the development of species specific or pan-species diagnostic tools, antimalarial drugs and vaccines. To investigate the level of conservation between P. falciparum and P. vivax a continuous region of a P. vivax chromosome cloned in the YAC 1H14 was sequenced. Within this 199,866 base pair portion of P. vivax chromosome, a conserved linkage group was identified consisting of at least 41 genes homologous to P. falciparum genes located on chromosome 3. Within this conserved linkage group, the gene order and structure are identical to that of P. falciparum chromosome 3. Furthermore, this conserved linkage group may contain as many as 190 genes. Although there are large regions of similarity between the P. falciparum and P. vivax chromosomes, there were two regions where no homology with P. falciparum chromosome 3 was observed. The first region contained the P. falciparum cytoadherence-linked asexual genes clag 3.2, clag 3.1 and a var C pseudogene for which no homologues could be found on the section of P. vivax chromosome analysed. Secondly, there was no homology observed between the subtelomeric regions of the P. vivax chromosome and P. falciparum chromosome 3. In addition, the subtelomeric region of the analysed P. vivax chromosome is 90 kb longer than that of P. falciparum chromosome 3. The overall size difference of at least 900 kb between the entire homologous P. vivax chromosome and P. falciparum chromosome 3 is presumably due to a translocation from another chromosome. The region of the P. vivax chromosome homologous to P. falciparum has a much higher DNA GC-content compared to that of P. falciparum. There is a preference for amino acids using GC-rich codons in the deduced proteins of P. vivax compared to P. falciparum orthologues. Nevertheless, there is a high degree of functional conservation between the orthologous proteins identified within this locus. The degree of sequence similarity between the orthologous proteins varied from 23% to 97%. Thus, both highly conserved and diverged proteins could be readily identified by the comparative analysis. This approach is of great value for initial functional characterisation of the genes in both species. Pairwise alignments were used to search for phylogenetic footprints within noncoding sequences. In contrast to the coding sequences, the intergenic regions and introns of P. vivax have diverged substantially from those of P. falciparum. The number of footprints found within the non-coding sequences of P. vivax and P. falciparum is considerably less than that between P. falciparum and the rodent parasite P. yoelii. Only 4% of nucleotides appear to be conserved between the P. vivax and P. falciparum intergenic sequences. This is much lower than the fraction of conserved nucleotides in the coding sequences and is indicative of a different type of selection pressure acting on non-coding sequences. The effect of sequence divergence on the cross-species functionality of promoter regions was tested. The ability of several homologous P. vivax, P. falciparum and P. yoelii promoter regions to drive expression of a reporter gene was compared. The expression of the reporter gene under control of the homologous P. falciparum and P. yoelii promoter regions was detected at comparable levels, whereas expression under control of the P. vivax promoter regions was not detectable. The decrease in activity of the P. vivax promoters appears to be consistent with the lack of conservation between the non-coding sequences of P. vivax and P. falciparum. In conclusion, this thesis combines molecular biology techniques and bioinformatic analyses to characterise a P. vivax chromosomal segment. This study revealed for the first time a high degree of conservation between the genomes of the two evolutionary distant parasites P. falciparum and P. vivax, and demonstrated the power of comparative genomics for studying Plasmodium species. This work also contributed to the P. vivax genome sequencing initiative leading to the whole genome sequencing of P. vivax.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158153</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Organisational Citizenship Behaviour on Psychological Outcomes: Implications for Teachers and Students</field><field name="creator">Hannam, Rachel</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this research program was to examine whether there are psychological consequences when teachers perform organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB), both for the teachers themselves and for their students. OCB is discretionary workplace behaviour which, in the aggregate, enhances organisational effectiveness (Organ, 1988). Examples of OCB specific to the teaching profession may include organising extra-curricular activities, undertalung optional training, and spending time with students outside official teaching hours. Although the vast majority of OCB research has positioned OCB as a consequence of various individual differences and organisational practices (Chen, Hui, &amp; Sego, 1998), the current thesis positions OCB as an antecedent of important outcomes both for the individual performing them as well as for their clientele. For the purpose of the current research, the psychological outcomes for teachers hypothesised to be affected by engaging in OCB were (1) job competence, (2) job satisfaction, and (3) personal accomplishment. For students, the psychological outcome hypothesised to be affected by teacher OCB was quality of school life. Chapter 1 focuses on defining OCB and discusses related conceptualisations of these forms of workplace behaviour. The extensive literature on the individual and organisational antecedents of OCB is reviewed, followed by a discussion of the smaller body of research concerning the consequences of OCB for organisations, their clients, and their employees. Several apparent gaps in the OCB literature that are addressed by the current research program are noted. Chapter 2 draws on several theories of work motivation as well as empirical evidence to support the proposition that OCB may impact upon the teacher outcomes of job competence, job satisfaction, and a sense of personal accomplishment. These include self-determination theory (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985, 2000), job characteristics theory (Hackman &amp; Oldham, 1980), achievement motivation theory (McClelland, 1976), and self-efficacy theory (Bandura, 1986). Indirect empirical evidence for the argument that OCB affects teacher outcomes is also presented. An argument is also made that job competence is a more proximal outcome of engaging in OCB, whereas job satisfaction and personal accomplishment are more distal outcomes. In other words, job competence is said to mediate the impact of OCB on job satisfaction and personal accomplishment. Finally, given previous research showing that OCBs are often followed by social recognition from others (e.g., Schnake &amp; Dumler, 1997), an argument is made for the moderating role of non-material rewards (namely, praise and recognition) in the OCB-teacher outcomes relationship. Chapter 2 ends with an overview of the current research program as a whole. Chapter 3 presents the results of Study 1, which involved the development of a teacher OCB measure that was used throughout the remainder of the research program. The handful of studies that have specifically investigated teacher OCB are reviewed. These studies suggest that OCB in the teaching profession may be somewhat different to OCB in other occupations and may require measures specific to the profession. A pool of items was derived from various existing OCB measures and piloted during focus group discussions with primary school teachers. The final 24- item OCB questionnaire was then distributed to 538 primary school teachers employed by the State Education Department in Queensland, Australia. Teacher OCB was expected to occur at three levels: (1) OCB directed towards one's students, (2) OCB directed towards one's coworkers, and (3) OCB directed towards the organisation (i.e., school) as a whole. Results of both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses suggested that teacher OCB could be categorised according to these three levels. However, three separate organisation-directed subscales emerged. Thus, the final teacher OCB measure contained five subscales: (1) student-centred behaviour, (2) coworker-centred behaviour, (3) consideration, (4) civic virtue, and (5) professional development. Chapter 4 presents the results of Study 2a which, using cross-sectional survey data from 538 primary school teachers, aimed to test whether the five forms of teacher OCB had positive main effects on teachers' levels of job competence, job satisfaction, and personal accomplishment. A series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses provided support for these main effects. Study 2a also tested for the mediating role of job competence in the relationship between OCB and job satisfaction, and OCB and persona1 accomplishment, and found partial support for this proposition. Finally, a mediated moderation model (Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986) was tested, whereby praise and recognition was proposed to strengthen the positive relationship between OCB and job competence, which would, in turn, enhance job satisfaction and personal accomplishment. No support was found for the mediated moderation model. However, praise and recognition was found to have positive main effects on all three teacher outcomes. Chapter 5 describes Study Zb, which tested the hypotheses presented in Study 2a using a longitudinal design involving 222 teachers. Data for Study 2b was collected approximately 6 months after Study 2a data collection was complete. The focal hypotheses for this study proposed that Time 1 (TI) OCB would have a positive effect on Time 2 (T2) job competence which would, in turn, have a positive effect on teachers' job satisfaction and personal accomplishment at T2. Additionally, T1 praise and recognition was expected to strengthen the relationships between T1 OCB and T2 job competence, in the prediction of T2 job satisfaction and T2 personal accomplishment. In all analyses, the psychological outcome score from T1 was used as a control variable to assess any effects that T1 OCB had on T2 psychological outcomes over and above the T1 effects. Some evidence emerged for the longitudinal effects of OCB on job competence and job satisfaction. The mediated-moderated model involving praise and recognition was not confirmed. However, praise and recognition at T1 continued to have a positive effect on T2 psychological outcomes. Chapter 6 describes Study 3, which investigated the psychological consequences of teacher OCB on students' quality of school life (SQSL). SQSL was measured using five subscales from Ainley and Bourke (1992) which asked students to respond to questionnaire items concerning their general satisfaction, their satisfaction with student-teacher relations, their sense of achievement, opportunities for learning, and their levels of school-related psychological distress. This study involved 171 teachers and their students (N = 3018). Hierarchical linear modeling (Bryk &amp; Raudenbush, 1992) was used to assess the relationships between OCB and SQSL. Furthermore, given the findings that emerged in Studies 2a and 2b regarding the effect of OCB on teachers' sense of job competence, job competence was proposed to mediate the effects of OCB on student outcomes. Some support was found for the main effects of OCB on SQSL, as well as for the mediating effect of job competence in this relationship. It was also revealed that teachers' sense of job competence exerted strong main effects on SQSL. Finally, Study 4 is described in Chapter 7. Study 4 refined the measure of praise and recognition used in Studies 2a and 2b by specifying various sources of praise and recognition for teachers. This study aimed to test whether various sources of praise and recognition interacted differentially with OCB to predict teacher outcomes. Teacher OCB was again measured with the same instrument used in the previous studies. Job competence, job satisfaction, and personal accomplishment were also measured with the same scales as used in Studies 2a and 2b. However, four new measures of praise and recognition were developed. These new measures assessed teachers' perceptions of receiving praise and recognition from four sources; namely, (1) principals, (2) coworkers, (3) students, and (4) students' parents. In a sample of 222 teachers, moderate support was found for the prediction that the source of praise and recognition is important in moderating the relationship between OCB and teacher outcomes. Specifically, praise and recognition from principals and parents enhanced the positive relationship between some forms of OCB and teacher outcomes. No evidence was found to suggest that praise from students or coworkers had an enhancing effect on the relationship between OCB and teacher outcomes. Chapter 8 is the final chapter, which presents a general discussion of the research findings, with particular emphasis on the contributions that they make to the OCB and employee well-being literatures. Limitations of the five studies are discussed, as well as suggestions for future research examining the psychological consequences of performing OCB, both for employees and their clients. Practical implications of the findings, especially for the teaching profession, are also discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158154</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Redefining the Retromer</field><field name="creator">Kerr, Markus Charles</field><field name="description">The regulated trafficking of receptors and their associated ligands through the mammalian endosomal system is a process fundamental to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Whilst a great deal is known about the mechanisms by which receptors are internalised at the plasma membrane, the molecular machinery involved in their sorting, segregation and trafficking in the endosomal system is largely undescribed. Recently, a pentameric protein complex, called the retromer, was revealed to play a key role in the endosomal trafficking of a number of cargo molecules both from the cell surface and the trans-Golgi network (TGN). This thesis expands upon our understanding of the mammalian retromer complex by defining novel subunits and examining their role in endosomal trafficking. To begin, this study describes the identification and characterisation of a previously undescribed mammalian retromer subunit, mVps26B. Whilst able to interact directly with the core of the mammalian retromer complex, mVps35, we find that, unlike its paralogue, mVps26A, mVps26B is not recruited to early endosomes. Rather, mVps26B and other retromer subunits are recruited to actin-rich extensions of the cell surface (lamellipodia) expanding the role of the retromer from endosomal trafficking to include cellular motility. In addition to being the motile unit of the cell surface, lamellipodia or membrane ruffles are the site at which macropinocytosis occurs. Macropinocytosis is the engulfment of bulk quantities of extracellular fluid and nutrients via the dynamic invagination of membrane ruffles. This study provides the first insight of the role of the retromer in macropinocytosis. Firstly, we reveal that SNX5, another novel retromer subunit, is recruited to membrane ruffles following EGF treatment. This may reflect the unique specificity of the SNX5 PX domain for the plasma membrane-derived PI(3,4)P2. Secondly, we reveal that SNX5 is recruited to discrete patches on the cytosolic face of the nascent macropinosome almost immediately following its formation. Through the use of high-quality fluorescence video microscopy we observed that these patches are integrated into highly dynamic tubular structures that traffic membrane from the macropinosome to the archetypal early endosome. Concurrent with their departure, the macropinosome is observed to mature, becoming highly circular and acquiring the late-endosomal marker Rab7. Extension and fission of the tubules is dependent upon the microtubule network. This represents the report of the retromer in macropinocytosis and provides the means to develop a temporal model for the complex in the maturation of endocytic compartments. The last chapter attempts to dissect the molecular interactions that are likely to be occurring during these processes. I reveal that SNX5 is unable to interact directly with the retromer, but rather binds the founding member of the sorting nexins, SNX1 and that this interaction is both necessary and sufficient for the recruitment of SNX5 to the endocytic compartment. Furthermore, I reveal that siRNA mediated depletion of SNX1 results in a reduced rate of macropinocytosis. Finally, I examined the role of a novel family of hook related proteins (HkRPs) in retromer activity. Specifically, over-expression of a truncated HkRP1 mutant that lacks a microtubule-binding domain interferes with the recruitment of the retromer to endocytic organelles. Consistent with the aforementioned model, this ultimately obstructs the maturation of the macropinosome. The results in this thesis contribute significantly to our understanding of the role of the mammalian retromer complex in a variety of processes. The data and tools generated over the course of this study provide the means to gain further insight, not only into the functions of the retromer complex, but also into macropinocytosis and cell motility.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158155</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social Consequences of Rural Events: An Event Stakeholder Perspective</field><field name="creator">Reid, Sacha Louise</field><field name="description">Events have a range of impacts upon rural host communities. They have the ability to draw outside investment and financial resources into local communities, which can lead to positive economic benefits. This is particularly pertinent for rural communities undergoing difficult economic periods as a consequence of drought, reduced yield and profits, and outmigration. Events also play an important social role. An event provides the opportunity to bring people together within a social environment to celebrate their and others&#146; achievements, and thus is important for individuals as well as communities as a whole. Involvement in events can also contribute to empowering the community to begin the process of rejuvenating their rural area through community-driven development. In order to maintain and develop rural communities, particularly as a consequence of declining government funding, there is a need for these communities to foster their own development. Events may be viewed as a catalyst for facilitating community participation and skill generation and development, which may have significant implications for fostering community-driven development in the future. However, much of the event research has been predominantly focused on the economic impacts of events. It has only been in recent years that a shift in the focus of this research has occurred with greater recognition being attributed to the social consequences of events. A shortcoming of much of this research has been the focus on urban and large-scale events at the expense of smaller or rural-based events. This thesis seeks to understand the social consequences of rural events from a stakeholder perspective. In this thesis, five important issues are addressed: 1) who event stakeholders are; 2) what the social consequences of events in rural areas are; 3) what strategies would encourage community participation in organising and planning rural events; 4) whether a community participation approach to event organisation in rural areas has an influence on an event&#146;s social consequences; and 5) the implications of this for sustaining events in rural communities. In order to explore these issues, the thesis is underpinned by theories derived from the areas of community participation, stakeholders and the social consequences of tourism and events. Data was primarily collected from 54 in-depth interviews within three rural communities of the Southern Downs region of south-west Queensland, Australia. The results of the research reveal that event stakeholders are diverse and hold multiple roles within rural communities, and are differentiated by risk. A number of social consequences were identified that had not previously been recognised within the literature which were specific to rural communities, such as trust/respect, change, being affiliated with success, forgetting hard times and releasing stress and tension, awareness and utilisation of community skills and resources, costs associated with attending, expectations of government assistance and greed. Community participation is influenced by a number of factors such as size of the community, identification with the community and the existence of social trust, as well as individual, societal and organisational issues. This thesis presents a model for understanding the role of community stakeholder participation in organising and planning of rural events and the resultant social consequences of rural events.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158156</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptual Identification and Recognition of 2-Dimensional Novel Line Figures: Effects of Encoding, Left/Right Orientation, and Alzheimer&#146;s Disease.</field><field name="creator">Rawnsley, Kay Frances</field><field name="description">This dissertation examined recognition and perceptual identification of 2-dimensional novel line figures, comparing semantic and perceptual encoding as well as study to test changes in left/right orientation of the figures. The first three experiments involved testing first-year psychology students while the fourth experiment compared the performances of people with Alzheimer&#146;s disease and age-matched controls. Several hypotheses were generated based on previous results. It was predicted that semantic encoding would not improve performances for the perceptual identification tests compared to perceptual encoding. As well as this, it was predicted that left-right orientation changes from study to test would affect recognition but not perceptual identification. The patients with dementia of the Alzheimer&#146;s type (DAT) were tested on recognition and perceptual identification of semantically encoded novel figures. As the patients were in the moderate stage of the disease no prediction was made about the perceptual identification test, but it was predicted that the DAT patients would be impaired on recognition of the items, compared to the age-matched controls. The novel line figures were encoded either by attaching an appropriate verbal label (semantic condition) or by judging the left/right orientation (perceptual condition) of the figures. For the perceptual identification tests participants had to identify a degraded stimulus either by completing a fragment or judging whether a briefly flashed stimulus was the same or not. The recognition tests involved participants judging whether they had seen a presented stimulus in the encoding phase,that is, judging whether the figures were old or new. Generally, the predictions were upheld and the DAT patients demonstrated positive priming in the perceptual identification test. The results supported the hypothesis that different retrieval processes govern recognition and perceptual identification tests of memory. This dissertation has demonstrated the aforementioned findings using a new perceptual identification test. It has also been demonstrated conclusively that semantic encoding does not enhance novel, non-verbal line figures. In addition, this dissertation reports positive priming for novel figures with DAT patients in the moderate stage of the disease. To the knowledge of the author, this has not previously been demonstrated with DAT patients with this level of severity. As well as this, due to the unique nature of the figure/verbal label combination used in this dissertation, the inability of the DAT patients to use semantic information has been observed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158157</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The house in Queensland from settlement to 1985</field><field name="creator">Newell, Peter E.</field><field name="description">Before the anonymous brick-veneer suburbs proliferated throughout the periphery of Australia's major cities, an unaffected residential design idiom expressing local economic climatic and geographical influences had evolved in Queensland, which of all the Australian States, has the strongest indigineous residential architectural identity as a result. The situation which has arisen in the past decade is a revived appreciation of the qualities of the Queensland house by the public as well as by some architects, both within the State and elsewhere. This is occurring at a time when social and commercial pressures are diminishing the rational style which had evolved over a century of settlement. The influences which shaped this spacious, and relatively inexpensive house, are not generally understood, but are often the subject of erroneous conjecture, even amongst members of the construction professions. Regrettably, the influences of practical experience, improved technical training and the contributions of the building research organisations are being eroded by the diminishing involvement of the qualified architect, inflation and the merchandizing methods of some building material manufacturers, merchant builders and real estate salesmen. The Thesis concludes with an evaluation of the survival of the privately financed &#147;one-off&#148; or stock design house and examines some alternative accommodations. When doing so, it must be recognised that the present and presumably, future generations, being more aware of our relationship to physical factors, are demanding less of technology and more respect for the natural environment. It is hoped that this trend with erase much of the nostalgia, superficialty and outdated construction techniques which are destroying the character of the house in Queensland and provide the opportunity for architects and designers to revive and develop a rational climate-oriented regional identity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158158</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmentalism, sustainable development and organisational culture: tourism accommodation and the drivers of sustainable practice</field><field name="creator">Whiley, Dona-Marie</field><field name="description">The concept of sustainable development is increasingly common within international and national policy documents. Operationalising this concept has however proven to be problematic. The dissertation presents an explanatory model, which identifies that while economic factors are important within decision-making, ethical motivations are also changing the way firms operate. In response to a collective expression of environmentalism within society, government and industry, and proactive firms have begun incorporating sustainable development into decision-making. However, the organisational change necessary to implement these measures is identified as a complex process, dependant upon a strong organisational culture. Tourism agencies support the concept of sustainable development, citing a symbiotic relationship between product quality and the environment. However, with tourism numbers projected to double within the next 20 years, some question Australia&#146;s capacity to maintain enduring environmental quality and to service the infrastructure demands of residents and tourists. To date, policy preference has predominantly focused on self-regulatory mechanisms that produce cost reductions and have promoted market driven corporate responsibility. While these factors have influenced proactive firms, within tourism accommodation this is generally not the case. This is due to the perception that sustainable practice impinges upon guest satisfaction and that evidence of a green consumer is yet to be identified and quantified in this highly competitive and price sensitive sector. The multi-disciplinary, mixed method inquiry process used in this study, employing quantitative and qualitative methods, provided rich data that supports the ethical and organisational propositions within the model. The study proposes that mechanisms designed in concert with critical sector issues are more likely to result in the development of effective policy to improve environmental performance. With accommodation properties tending to be either small or large multi-nationals, it was found that drivers are not consistent over property type, given differing decision-making frameworks. In addition, there was evidence of a lack of awareness of the environmental consequences of tourism and of practices to improve environmental outcomes. It is proposed, that incorporating the concept of environmental quality into existing service quality frameworks, currently supported by strong organisational cultures, are likely to moderate knowledge and performance deficiencies identified within the study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental policy and management</field><field name="subject">business change</field><field name="subject">firms</field><field name="subject">environmental ethic</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158159</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effective information technology governance arrangements</field><field name="creator">Cheung, May-Yin Decca</field><field name="description">For many organisations Information Technology (IT) enabled business initiatives and IT infrastructure constitute major investments. If these investments are not managed properly or the technological initiatives are not integrated correctly within the business, the organisation&#146;s competitive position is impaired. Currently, both management and IT professionals are concerned with design, implementation, and assessment of IT governance strategies to ensure that technology truly serves the needs of the business. These strategies aim to align IT applications with the objectives of the business. The question addressed by this research is: How does a complex organisation devise, implement, and assess its IT governance arrangements? Devising IT governance arrangements is challenging because the success of IT strategies and procedures is contingent upon a variety of internal and external factors, such as workgroup interdependency and competitive strategy. Implementing an IT governance framework can be a complex endeavour because organisations must integrate the unique expertise of diverse stakeholders and service providers. This research explores the factors influencing the IT governance structures, processes, and outcome metrics. Using data from an in-depth case study conducted in a complex energy organisation, this research provides empirical evidence that increases our understanding of IT governance arrangements. Interview responses indicated that effective IT governance performance outcomes are characterised by a shared understanding of business and IT objectives; active involvement of IT steering committees; a balance of business and IT representatives in IT decision making; and comprehensive and wellcommunicated IT strategies and policies. IT governance plays a key role in fostering project success and delivering value. Effective IT project governance outcomes are characterised by the existence of executive leaders as project champions of IT, the use of appropriate measurement techniques during a priori and interim evaluations of IT projects, and extensive post implementation evaluation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280102 Information Systems Management</field><field name="subject">700200 Other Information Services</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158160</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tourism destination development: Beyond Butler</field><field name="creator">Breakey, Noreen Maree</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">150604 Tourism Marketing</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Queensland -- Sunshine Coast.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158161</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the means of making eHealth more relevant to low socioeconomic communities</field><field name="creator">Dart, Jared Magnus</field><field name="description">This thesis project investigated the means of making eHealth more relevant to low socioeconomic status (SES) communities. As with other information and communication technology (ICT) based initiatives, the uptake of eHealth is limited by access to technology. Online health information may be a means of providing increased access to health information. However, access to online health information and health information in general is disparate amongst sections of the populations. Middle and high SES communities, as well as the well-educated generally have high access to health information yet paradoxically they are less affected by modifiable/preventable diseases which can be influenced by effective health education. Therefore the challenge for health education and eHealth is how to reach those in low SES communities. This thesis employed three phases of research to answer this question. The first phase of the project investigated means of providing community based access to ICT in very low SES communities in India in order to provide data as to how such community based structures might deliver community oriented health information. The second phase investigated an online community portal to establish whether this would be a useful means of contextualising online health information and whether it could be the online counterpart to the community based ICT structures investigated in phase one. Phase three sought to determine what types of health information community members from various SES communities wanted and how their preferences as well as those of medical students might affect the design of a community eHealth approach. This thesis employed case study methodology to provide rich qualitative data in an area of research which is highly influenced by socioeconomic, socio-political and personal factors. The case studies which focused heavily on direct observation and key informant interviews as well as document analysis in turn informed the development of a series of community and medical student surveys which sought to provide a broader sample of opinions as well as quantitative data. The first phase investigated several community based ICT strategies &#150; a hub and spokes telecentre model, a similar but less tightly structured model which employed a community portal, and a mobile community access point - to determine how they might be utilised to facilitate eHealth uptake in low SES communities. These field studies, based in India, found that a &#145;hub and spokes&#146; model with peripheral field sites supported by a central knowledge hub would be a useful model to facilitate the delivery of appropriate health information. Information intermediaries at these peripheral sites could occupy a key role in delivering health information in an appropriate manner, as well as training individuals how to access appropriate health information independently. In addition, these studies identified a number of features necessary for a community based ICT access strategy employed for eHealth purposes. Making information relevant to the local context, as well as facilitating community access to health information, has been a challenge to the eHealth and wider health community. One means of achieving this employed by the UNITeS case study in phase one was an online community portal that delivers information relevant to a defined geographical area. The second phase of this project investigated the application of a non-health oriented community portal in a low SES community in South East Queensland, Australia, in order to determine how such a structure might be applied for eHealth purposes. This study demonstrated that there are significant problems associated with community members initiating and administering a community portal, especially regarding financial constraints and access to appropriate infrastructure. However, there are also a number of potential benefits of such a localising strategy being employed for eHealth. It is a useful means of contextualising information and providing access to practical information about local health resources; it may provide a recognisable contact point for health information seekers mediating their access to relevant and accurate online health information; and it provides greater proximity to community members and information seekers than a national health information portal. The third phase of research characterised the current health information environment in a low SES community and compared it to a mid-high socioeconomic SES community and to university students and staff. Through field work which included direct observation, key informant interviews, and surveys I explored the community demand for more health information, the current and preferred future use of health information sources, ascribed importance and trust of health information sources, the use of the local doctor as a source of health information, and the use of the internet for health information seeking. Results indicated a demand across all three communities for more health information, a remarkable concordance in the use of health information sources other than the internet, and that the local doctor is the most important and preferred source of health information. In addition, the research highlighted the importance of proxy health information seeking and the infrequent actual use of the doctor as a source of health information, despite community demand for more health information and stated preference for information from this source. The research also investigated the community&#146;s requirements for a community eHealth strategy through key informant interviews in a low SES community, as well as through the survey research described above. Results revealed that community members&#146; requirements differed between the low and mid-high socioeconomic communities as well as from university students and staff. This was in part influenced by exposure to the internet as a source of health information, but also to the information needs of the various communities. This finding, not previously demonstrated in the eHealth literature, illustrates the need for a community specific approach. The survey results, thus, offer valuable guidance for the development of such an approach. Lastly, this project investigated the attitudes of medical students &#150; the doctors of the future &#150; to the current health education environment in which they are to practise, to the priority eHealth policies, and to potential components of a community oriented eHealth strategy. I found that most medical students believed that the current health system did not allow them to educate patients about their health issues, and that the principal constraint was inadequate time. Results indicated that the majority of students supported a patient information prescription system and community health portal to facilitate health information delivery, as well as delineating their attitudes to the various types of health information which should be provided by such a system. The final chapter presents a model for a community eHealth system which incorporates the findings of this research and addresses the needs identified through stakeholder consultation, as well as identifying areas for future research, including an action research project investigating a community oriented eHealth architecture. The model identified includes components for community based and hospital based delivery of health information; a means for keeping the clinician engaged with the health information process, fulfilling their role as coordinators of health care whilst allowing auxiliary health personnel to deliver basic health information; as well as an online means of coordinating the delivery of health information identified as important by community members. Specific, complex patient oriented health information should remain the domain of clinicians. This research has several limitations largely stemming from the fact that it is highly novel and covers a broad research area. As a result, a lot of the research is exploratory and raises many more questions than it answers. Nevertheless, it is a unique contribution to an internationally neglected area of research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158162</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Traffic Signs for Roadworks Applications: Evaluation and Driver- Centred Methods of Improvement.</field><field name="creator">Cloete, Steven Russell</field><field name="description">Traffic signs are ubiquitous in the road environment, and are a crucial and cost-effective means of ensuring traffic safety. In Queensland, Australia, a class of temporary traffic signs is used for roadworks applications, and has recently been expanded to include Multiple- Message Signs; a novel, and as yet empirically untested system, which presents numerous advantages in terms of flexibility and economy. However, potential Human Factors problems surround aspects of the design of multiple message signs. In particular, the efficiency with which information is communicated may be compromised relative to singlemessage signs. This project involved a series of laboratory studies focusing on the behavioural requirements of temporary roadworks signs, beginning with the improvement of response characteristics of a sign used to communicate lane-closure. In the first empirical study, a proposed redesign of the Lane-Status sign based on principles of warning communication was found to be more effective than the original sign. The same sign was then examined in the context of multiple-message presentation, and significant costs with respect to the speed and accuracy of responses relative to singlemessage presentation were found. A subsequent study investigated multiple-message presentation of speed limit information, which is more familiar and widely encountered than lane-closure information. Similar costs for multiple-message presentation were found. However, there were data to suggest that the additional information in multiple-message signs, if used correctly, may offer drivers an additional incentive to reduce speed. The next two studies were concerned with the effects of presentation, content type (e.g., speed-limit, symbolic and text-based) and visual clutter on recognition and visual search for traffic signs. The presentation of information via multiple message signs was compared with spatially distributed single message signs, with information matched with respect to message length and sign content. Overall advantages for multiple-message presentation were found for recognition, which were particularly robust for speed limit information. The results for visual search indicated some benefits to multiple message presentation, but were less decisive than those for recognition. The final two studies investigated the possibility of improving response characteristics of single-message signs with sequential, rather than individual presentation. The role of the temporal interval between successive sign presentations was explored, which has implications for the feasibility of sequential presentation in practice. In addition, the nature of sign pairs presented in sequence - identical, or of the same meaning &#150; was found to be important. Generally, benefits to sequential presentation diminished with increases in the temporal separation interval. In terms of practical implications, the viability of introducing the proposed design changes to the Lane Status sign is discussed. The results pertaining to multiple-message signs are evaluated in the context of published design guidelines, and theoretical and practical issues surrounding sequential sign presentation are reviewed. Finally, possibilities for future research, in part based on the limitations of the current work, are expounded.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158163</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prediction of fatigue performance of welded joints on offshore and equivalent structures through characterisation of geometric and dynamic joint parameters.</field><field name="creator">Nazari, Ahmad</field><field name="description">In general, fatigue is a very common type of failure in tubular joints. The fatigue life for tubular joints is expressed in terms of the number of stress cycles they can sustain. Therefore, an accurate method of converting structural loads to local joint stresses is useful for fatigue life prediction. This is usually done by first converting the global structural loads to loads on individual structural members and then translating the loads on the members joining at each joint to local stresses around the joint. The former can be achieved in a relatively simple fashion using beam-element models. The second step is more conveniently performed by using parametric equations for stress concentration factors that convert nominal beam stresses to hot spot stresses around the joint. Many sets of stress parameter equations have been derived for tubular joint during the last two decades. Except for the present study, all these equations can be used to predict hot spot stress concentration factor for simple tubular joints without considering the effect of extra stiffness. This is partly because developing different parametric equations for every possible reinforcement geometry is impractical. In fact, in certain instances of field repair, the reinforcement may not even be visible and its exact nature unknown due to loss of past records. The present study has introduced a joint dynamic parameter that will represent the stiffening effect of the reinforcement without essentially having to know the exact nature of the reinforcement. This study has developed a new and novel method to calculate Stress Concentration Factors using parametric functions of not only the basic geometric functions but also parameter representing extra stiffening provided by various means such as doubler plate, gussets, etc. The application of this concept is demonstrated and proven through detailed finite-element analysis of a wide range of joint and reinforcement geometries. Shell element models are used to calculate the Hot Spot Stresses around the joint as the basis to derive the parametric equations. The non-dimensional dynamic joint parameter introduced in this study can be calculated in most instances by using standard techniques of experimental modal analysis without needing to know the nature and details of the reinforcement. This is especially useful in those cases where the exact nature of reinforcement is not known, for example, hidden in the interior or deteriorated through age or fabrication error.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158164</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Social Construction of Economic Man: The Genesis, Spread, Impact and Institutionalisation of Economic Ideas</field><field name="creator">MacKinnon, Lauchlan</field><field name="description">The present thesis is concerned with the genesis, diffusion, impact and institutionalisation of economic ideas. Despite Keynes&#146;s oft-cited comments to the effect that &#147;the ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood&#148; (Keynes 1936: 383), and the highly visible impact of economic ideas (for example Keynesian economics, Monetarism, or economic ideas regarding deregulation and antitrust issues) on the economic system, economists have done little to systematically explore the spread and impact of economic ideas. In fact, with only a few notable exceptions, the majority of scholarly work concerning the spread and impact of economic ideas has been developed outside of the economics literature, for example in the political institutionalist literature in the social sciences. The present thesis addresses the current lack of attention to the spread and impact of economic ideas by economists by drawing on the political institutionalist, sociological, and psychology of creativity literatures to develop a framework in which the genesis, spread, impact and institutionalisation of economic ideas may be understood. To articulate the dissemination and impact of economic ideas within economics, I consider as a case study the evolution of economists&#146; conception of the economic agent - &#145;homo oeconomicus.&#146; I argue that the intellectual milieu or paradigm of economics is &#145;socially constructed&#146; in a specific sense, namely: (i) economic ideas are created or modified by particular individuals; (ii) economic ideas are disseminated (iii) certain economic ideas are accepted by economists and (iv) economic ideas become institutionalised into the paradigm or milieu of economics. Economic ideas are, of course, disseminated not only within economics to fellow economists, but are also disseminated externally to economic policy makers and business leaders who can - and often do - take economic ideas into account when formulating policy and building economic institutions. Important economic institutions are thereby socially constructed, in the general sense proposed by Berger and Luckmann (1966). But how exactly do economic ideas enter into this process of social construction of economic institutions? Drawing from and building on structure/agency theory (e.g. Berger and Luckmann 1966; Bourdieu 1977; Bhaskar 1979/1998, 1989; Bourdieu 1990; Lawson 1997, 2003) in the wider social sciences, I provide a framework for understanding how economic ideas enter into the process of social construction of economic institutions. Finally, I take up a methodological question: if economic ideas are disseminated, and if economic ideas have a real and constitutive impact on the economic system being modelled, does &#145;economic science&#146; then accurately and objectively model an independently existing economic reality, unchanged by economic theory, or does economic theory have an interdependent and &#145;reflexive&#146; relationship with economic reality, as economic reality co-exists with, is shaped by, and also shapes economic theory? I argue the latter, and consider the implications for evaluating in what sense economic science is, in fact, a science in the classical sense. The thesis makes original contributions to understanding the genesis of economic ideas in the psychological creative work processes of economists; understanding the ontological location of economic ideas in the economic system; articulating the social construction of economic ideas; and highlighting the importance of the spread of economic ideas to economic practice and economic methodology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158165</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLEANER SHRIMP AND THEIR CLIENT FISHES ON CORAL REEFS</field><field name="creator">Becker, Justine Harriet Alice</field><field name="description">Cleaning by shrimp has been documented many times with reports being based mainly on anecdotal or descriptive reports of their associations with fish. This large number of reports suggests that cleaner shrimp may play an important role in marine ecosystems. This thesis combines observations and collections of cleaner shrimp in the wild at Lizard Island Australia and Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea with laboratory experiments that were designed to quantitatively examine the relationships between cleaner shrimp and their clients. Furthermore, biological market theory has been successfully used as a theoretical paradigm to explain the relationship between cleaner fish and their clients and is likely, therefore, to be applicable to the interactions between cleaner shrimp and fishes. The theory is based on four assumptions all of which were tested for in the interactions between cleaner shrimp and fishes. The first aim of this study was to determine whether cleaner shrimp remove and eat ectoparasites and other material from the body surface of animals that visit them. Gut content analyses of wild caught cleaner shrimp Urocaridella sp. c and Periclimenes holthuisi revealed partially digested, crustacean ectoparasites. This shows, surprisingly for the first time, that cleaner shrimp in the wild do clean. The cleaner shrimp Perclimenes holthuisi significantly reduced monogenean loads on captive surgeon fish Ctenochaetus striatus in the laboratory. Such large reductions in parasite loads are likely to benefit individual fish. To determine whether cleaner shrimp base their choice of client fish on food patch quality (i.e., client fish ectoparasite load), the yellow-beaked cleaner shrimp Urocaridella sp. c was offered a choice of parasitised and unparasitised rock cods Cephalopholis cyanostigma. To determine whether cleaner shrimp hunger levels influenced cleaning time, hunger levels in Urocaridella sp. c were manipulated and their behaviour towards parasitised rock cods was examined. Cleaner shrimp preferred parasitised to unparasitised rock cods and food-deprived cleaner shrimp cleaned parasitised rock cods for longer periods of time than satiated cleaner shrimp did. Therefore, variations in client fish ectoparasite load and cleaner shrimp hunger level are two factors that may affect the balance in the interactions between cleaner shrimp and fishes on coral reefs. These results satisfy the market assumption that partner choice is based on the value of the commodity on offer and that supply and demand control commodity value. Marine cleaners are known for stereotyped behaviours that likely serve as signals to advertise their cleaning services to clients. Cleaner shrimp are cryptic in comparison to cleaner fish, so signals are probably essential for cleaner shrimp to attract clients. Field observations revealed that the yellowbeaked cleaner shrimp Urocaridella sp. c uses a stereotypical side-to-side movement, or &#147;rocking dance&#148;, while approaching potential client fish in the water column. This dance was followed by a cleaning interaction with the client 100% of the time. In the laboratory, hungry cleaner shrimp spent more time rocking and in closer proximity to clients Cephalopholis cyanostigma than satiated ones, and when given a choice, clients preferred hungry, rocking cleaner shrimp. The rocking dance therefore influenced client behaviour, and thus appears to function as a signal to advertise the presence of cleaner shrimp to potential clients satisfying the third biological market assumption that the commodities on offer can be advertised. The fourth biological market assumption is that there is competition, via outbidding, among the more common trader for to the less common trader. Whether client fish outbid each other by being better cooperators, or physically compete to gain access to cleaner shrimp, was tested. Potential competitive behaviours were identified in the wild. In the laboratory there was no difference in the time client fish spent co-operating with cleaner shrimp when a potential competitor was present compared to when there was no potential competitor, thus there was no outbidding. Client fish, suprisingly, were significantly more aggressive towards the treatment client fish when there was no cleaner shrimp compared to when a cleaner shrimp was present. In a second experiment, dominant fish received significantly more cleaning time than subordinate individuals and there was negative relationship between aggression and cleaning time. These findings suggest that contest competition overrides market choice and this is likely to be due to the fact that cleaner shrimp, unlike cleaner fish, do not move far from their cleaning stations and thus can be monopolized by client fish. Therefore, there does not seem to be a pure biological market operating. Cleaning interactions between cleaner shrimp and fishes were compared between two distant locations: Lizard Island, Australia and Kimbe Bay, West New Britain, Papua New Guinea. Overall, six species of cleaner shrimp were observed interacting with species of fishes from 23 different families. All cleaner shrimp performed a dance which appeared to facilitate the attraction of potential clients, suggesting there may be co-evolution of signaling among cleaners. Each species of cleaner shrimp had a different client assemblage with respect to family, dietary preference and activity patterns. All cleaner shrimp, except for P. holthuisi interacted more with resident client fish than with highly mobile client fish whereas the cleaner wrasse Labroides dimiatus is known to give preference to mobile choosy clients. This difference is likely to be due to differences in mobility between cleaner shrimp and cleaner fish. The interactions between cleaner shrimp and their clients are widespread and likely to be ecologically important. Whilst there may not be a pure biological market operating in the interactions between cleaner shrimp and fishes these relationships demonstrate some of the basic properties of biological markets. Given that cleaner shrimp often reside in close proximity to cleaner fish, which do operate under pure market conditions, future research should examine whether there is partitioning of resources among these cleaners. Such a study may determine the extent of niche overlap for cleaning species living in the same area, which would also help to determine the ecological role of cleaners.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158166</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An attachment perspective on adult sibling relationships</field><field name="creator">Doherty, Nicole Alicia</field><field name="description">The present program of research investigated sibling relationships in adulthood from an attachment perspective. Although research indicates that attachment theory offers a useful perspective on the influence of early relationships with caregivers on subsequent relationship functioning, attachment principles have rarely been applied to adults&#146; family relationships. In the current studies, several broad research aims were addressed. First, the role of siblings as attachment figures in adulthood and the nature of sibling attachment were assessed. Second, associations between attachment variables and reports of relationship quality were investigated. The third aim involved assessing the mediating role of communication skill in the association between attachment and relationship quality. Fourth, the impact of attachment variables on broad aspects of sibling conversation was investigated. The final aim was to assess the mediating role of communication skill in the association between attachment and sibling conversation. The present research had several noteworthy features. These features included the recruitment of pairs of adult siblings, the use of a dual methodology to assess aspects of sibling communication, and the distinction between attachment security and attachment strength as separate predictors of sibling relationship functioning. These features represent an important contribution to the literature on sibling relationships. The first study assessed the structure of adults&#146; attachment networks, using a questionnaire measure of preferred attachment figures with a large sample of adults (N = 812) representing various ages and life situations. Overall, the results indicated that siblings were one of the six most commonly reported attachment figures in adulthood. Importantly, siblings qualified as full-blown attachments for a sizable proportion of participants and for some participants, constituted the primary attachment figure. The strength and nature of sibling attachment were affected by age and normative life events. For Studies 2 and 3, 174 pairs of siblings (N=348) were recruited. In Study 2, participants completed multiple-item self-report questionnaires concerning their sibling relationship. This study assessed the associations among attachment, communication skill and sibling relationship quality. Findings revealed the influence of both the individual&#146;s own and the sibling&#146;s attachment variables (security and strength) on evaluations of relationship quality. Further, the link between attachment variables and sibling relationship quality was largely mediated by communication skill: Siblings who were secure in attachment communicated competently, which enhanced relationship quality. Study 3 used a dual methodology to obtain a more detailed understanding of sibling conversation. Participants completed self-report questionnaires and structured diary records of actual everyday conversations to assess the influence of attachment variables on specific aspects of sibling conversations. The findings from this study pointed to the utility of attachment theory for understanding sibling conversations. Attachment security and attachment strength were related to both the individual&#146;s own and the sibling&#146;s reports of conversation. Once again, many of the links between attachment variables and specific aspects of sibling conversation were mediated by communication skill. Overall, the present research supports the utility of investigating adults&#146; sibling relationships using attachment theory as a conceptual framework. A more complete understanding of sibling relationships in adulthood was achieved by exploring the impact of attachment security and attachment strength on sibling relationship functioning. The findings extend empirical research into adult sibling relationships and adult attachment, and are discussed in terms of their theoretical and practical implications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158167</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconfigurable Computing for Real-time Applications</field><field name="creator">Waldeck, Peter John</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the suitability of reconfigurable logic devices for the implementation of real-time embedded systems. Hybrid hardware systems have been studied, differentiated according to the method of hardware integration (either intraprocessor, bus-based or coprocessor). Software support and reconfigurability were found to be important considerations for the success of the systems. Most are aimed at high performance computing. Traditionally, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have been characterised as a sea of gates. The modern trend has been found to be towards more coarse-grained architectures - with hard cores, such as multipliers and processors included within the FPGA fabric. Research systems extend this concept even further. The issues and techniques used in real-time systems and real-time operating systems (RTOSs) have been examined. Reconfigurable devices have been found in real-time systems but the interaction between computation being executed in both hardware and software components has not been studied. Some researchers have moved some RTOS components into hardware in order to improve the predictability of the resulting systems. The verification of systems through techniques such as deadline monotonic analysis (DMA) is examined, along with some practical considerations. Suitable tools for designing reconfigurable embedded systems have been analysed. System-level design tools were examined - these were found to not be suitable for modern FPGA-based embedded systems. Traditional co-design tools were also evaluated - again, these were not intended for use in reconfigurable systems. Techniques used in embedded design with modern FPGAs has been summarised. In order to evaluate the suitability of a new technology to a particular application, suitable metrics need to be chosen. For this thesis, the metrics chosen are execution time, real-time metrics (interrupt latency, worst-case execution time), power and area usage. This is followed by an overview of the experimental work conducted, including the evaluation of applications and architectures in the context of real-time embedded systems. These applications, Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering and Least Mean Squares (LMS) adaptive filtering, are examined, along with possible solutions in a general sense. A range of architectures are defined, specifically targeted at providing solutions for the applications at hand. Hardware cores designed for input and output of analogue data are presented. Cores for the measurement of execution times and interrupt latency are also shown. The specific solutions for the applications are then shown, including entirely software-based solutions, those using hardware cores for all computation and those using both software and hardware for portions of the computation. A novel configurable network is described, which allows the software to control the configuration of components in the hardware system. This network allows the hardware cores to perform processing without interference from the software. All systems employ the uClinux operating system running on the Xilinx Microblaze processor. Each of the systems has been evaluated according to the metrics described. The results of these evaluations are presented, showing that interrupt latency is unrelated to CPU utilisation. The addition of computational hardware effectively lowers CPU utilisation, although at the expense of increased idle power consumption. The hardware cores are found to be significantly more power efficient, consuming between 9% and 75% less power than equivalent software solutions. A new equation is derived for the worst-case response time of hybrid hardwaresoftware tasks, based on deadline monotonic analysis. This equation shows that hybrid tasks should offer significant real-time performance advantages, where task-level paralellism can be exploited. Real-time performance is improved through the use of Real-Time Applications Interface (RTAI) real-time extensions, reducing interrupt latency by a factor of 20. The configurable network system is found to provide superior performance, along with reduced power consumption at the expense of 0.1% additional hardware over the base system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158168</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance evaluation of advanced traffic control systems in a developing country</field><field name="creator">Sutandi, A Caroline</field><field name="description">Traffic congestion is increasingly becoming a severe problem in many large cities around the world. The problem is more complex in developing countries where cities are growing at a much faster rate than those in the developed world. Advanced Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) are one of the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) technologies that have been recommended and used as a tool to ease congestion problems in many large cities in the developing world. However, it is unknown how specific local conditions commonly observed in these cities, such as poor lane discipline and complex road user interactions, affect the performance of these systems. GETRAM (Generic Environment for Traffic Analysis and Modeling) was used in this research as a tool to develop microscopic traffic simulation models for the city of Bandung in Indonesia. The field data in this research, comprising throughputs, queue lengths and travel times, were collected during peak and off peak periods from all 90 signalised intersections connected to SCATS (Sydney Co-ordinated Adaptive Traffic System). This field data is believed to comprise one of the largest sets of &#147;real world&#148; data available for the development and validation of microscopic traffic simulation models. Two data sets were collected for this research: the first was used to develop and calibrate the simulation model and the second was used for validation. A number of statistical tests were used to determine the adequacy of the model in replicating traffic conditions. The results of statistical tests clearly showed that all of the calibrated and validated models reproduced field conditions with an acceptable degree of confidence. Therefore, the models were accepted as accurate and valid replications of the &#147;real world&#148;. The validated models were then used to evaluate the performance of SCATS which was implemented in Bandung in June 1997 as a pilot project. The results of comparative evaluation of the models under SCATS and under the Fixed Time control (without SCATS) demonstrated that SCATS did not necessarily always produce better results than the Fixed Time control. Furthermore, the performance of SCATS was strongly influenced by specific local conditions in the city. The multiple regression method was used to investigate the relationship between the traffic performance measures and significant basic variables. Based on this analysis, the main findings were: first, throughput was found to increase at intersections with higher v/c (volume to capacity) ratios. Second, throughput was found to decrease at intersections with higher numbers of phases and movements, longer widths of leg intersections, and farther distances to adjacent intersections. Third, queue length was found to increase at intersections with higher numbers of phases and movements. Based on the above findings, a number of improvements were recommended to enhance the performance of SCATS. This research also used traffic simulation to evaluate the impacts of these recommended improvements in increasing the performance of SCATS. The main findings from this evaluation were: first, restricted number of phases and movements at selected intersections substantially increased the traffic flow (78%) and decreased the queue length (by 55 to 67%) at the intersection. Second, making leg intersections wider&#151;without physically building additional road capacity but by changing the stream with higher road hierarchy and higher v/c ratio from a two-way road into a one-way road&#151;has a great impact on enhancing the performance of SCATS. Traffic flows were found to increase between 7 and 106%, and queue lengths were found to markedly decrease between 77 and 100% at all the suggested intersections. Third, the application of SCATS at intersections which are not closely spaced was not effective. Therefore, it is recommended that intersections which are not closely spaced remain under the Fixed Time control. The results and findings from this study provide road authorities in developing countries with an appreciation and enhanced understanding of the factors that influence the performance of traffic management systems in cities with similar characteristics to those in Bandung. These findings will also assist traffic engineers determine the best practices for the implementation of advanced traffic control systems in their cities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290803 Transport Engineering</field><field name="subject">690101 Road safety</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158169</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis, Structure and Activity of Disulfide-Rich Conus Peptides</field><field name="creator">Hopping, Gene Gregory</field><field name="description">There is great interest in investigating structural and activity relationships between conotoxins and their biological targets. The information obtained using these techniques has added to our knowledge of how these molecules interact with receptors, and allowed us to pursue the synthesis of more selective and/or potent analogues. Chapters 1 and 2 serve as an introduction to the field of conotoxin research, and to the diversity of biological targets for which they are selective. They also give a general introduction to solid-phase peptide synthesis, the powerful tool used for the synthesis of peptides and analogues used in this study. Chapter 3 contains the materials and methods used throughout this thesis. Common methods used throughout the thesis have been included in one chapter to help minimise repetition. A brief introduction to many of the specialised techniques encountered is also given. Chapter 4 involves the SAR study of &#225;-Ctx [A10L] PnIA through alaninescanning mutagenesis. Peptides were synthesised and their affinity for the &#225;7 nAChR evaluated in a rat brain homogenate, and potency was determined with electrophysiological studies. This provides information as to which residues are important for interacting with the &#225;7 subtype of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Preliminary structural studies were performed to determine whether structural changes accompanied any loss in affinity of the peptide to the receptor, to distinguish important interactions from structural perturbations. Chapter 5 probes the importance that the side-chain of position 10 has on affinity to the &#225;7 nAChR. A series of seventeen point mutations were synthesised, with side chains containing aromatic, aliphatic, polar and charged residues. Previous work demonstrated that the side-chain at position 10 could discriminate between two different subtypes of the nAChR, therefore a functional screen was performed to estimate the activity and selectivity of these mutated peptides at different subtypes of the receptor. Chapter 6 describes the synthesis and structural studies of &#225;-conotoxin ImII, a conotoxin that is functionally active at the &#225;7 nAChR, but does not bind to the classical conotoxin binding site. It is the only &#225;-conotoxin described to date that does not contain a proline residue at position 6, and makes an excellent candidate for structural studies. Chapter 7 investigates a novel method for the synthesis of conotoxins from the O-superfamily. These conotoxins all contain adjacent cysteine residues located between the second and third loops, making them excellent targets for synthesis by native chemical ligation of two peptide segments. This novel strategy was applied to synthesise chimeras of N-type VGCC selective CVID and P/Q-type VGCC selective MVIIC, two peptides that are pharmacologically well characterised. It is hoped that this methodology will enable synthesis of peptides that have either been difficult to synthesise or oxidise in the past. The overall aim of this thesis is to investigate the structure and activity of some disulfide-rich conus peptides, and determine the residues responsible for selectivity and affinity toward their biological target. The information obtained from this study will further our knowledge of how these peptides interact with these receptors and receptor subtypes. Subtype selective ligands can be used as pharmacological tools to dissect and characterise the roles individual subtypes play in the complex mixtures of receptors found in native tissues.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158170</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TOWARDS THE AUTOMATIC CREATION OF VECTORISED MAPS FOR URBAN AREAS FROM MEDIUM RESOLUTION AIRBORNE LASER SCAN DATA</field><field name="creator">Clode, Simon Paul</field><field name="description">This dissertation addresses the problem of automated vector extraction from Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) data in urban areas. The recent popularity of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has stimulated research on automated object extraction in order to simplify the data acquisition and update process. By automatically generating GIS inputs and updates from a single data source, the cost of data acquisition and processing will be kept to a minimum. Compared with other remote sensing techniques, extraction of objects from ALS data is in its infancy. ALS sensor technology has evolved rapidly and now allows the acquisition of very dense point clouds in a short period of time. ALS data is unique in that it explicitly contains 3D information and is acquired from an active sensor. As such, there are several benefits that can be immediately realised by using an ALS only data approach; data acquisition will not be limited to daylight hours as with other sensors and accurate height information is contained in the data. This means that registration of different data sources is not required and as only one data source is used, acquisition costs are minimised. Apart from these facts, ALS data has some other unique properties that have not been utilised to their full potential. An ALS sensor can record both height and intensity information from multiple returns in a single swath. To date, all the available information has rarely been used. For example, the intensity of a laser return has regularly been dismissed as it was considered under-sampled and noisy. This data still contains usable information and until this information is used, the optimum object recognition results will not be achieved; thus the use of as much of this information as possible is a major focus of this thesis. As ALS is an explicit 3D data source, the early stages of development were primarily focused on topographic mapping of terrain in forested areas in order to generate Digital Terrain Models (DTMs). As sensor technology has improved, so has the achievable resolution of point clouds from ALS data, and methods to extract objects from stand-alone ALS data have emerged. Attempts have been made to create city models and maps from ALS data that included buildings, roads, trees and powerlines. Each of these spatial object types has unique attributes, which means that automatic map creation is not an easy task. For example, buildings in general are easily detected in ALS data but the building outline is not easily delineated. Another difficulty with building detection is the separation of buildings and bridges as they have many of the same properties as observed by an ALS system. Bridges can usually be found in a road network but road extraction techniques typically produce poor detection rates and often require existing data and / or user interaction in semi-automatic techniques. These simple examples highlight the complexity of automatically generating vectorised maps from ALS data or in fact any data source. In this thesis, new methods are presented for the automatic creation of vectorised maps from ALS data. A two-step processing paradigm is adopted for this purpose, namely the classification of the ALS data and the vectorisation of the classification results. A classification strategy is introduced that creates a hierarchy for object detection with respect to the ALS data itself. This approach develops an ontology between the spatial object classes and the ALS data. The hierarchical framework highlights the fact that one object might not be discernable within the data without considering another. New classification algorithms are then presented within this framework. Each algorithm attempts to exploit the attributes of the data that are consistent within the spatial object class being considered as described by the classification framework. New algorithms for the classification of roads, trees and powerlines are all introduced whilst an extension to existing building classification methods is presented. Once classification is complete, a vectorisation process specific to the task at hand can be employed to yield vectorised results. These developed vectorisation processes are new and include an algorithm that has been generalised to allow the vectorisation of thick lines in images by detecting the centreline, direction and width. The primary goal of this thesis is to present a framework of new algorithms that will allow automatic spatial object detection and vectorisation whilst providing results of an acceptable quality. The algorithms presented rely solely on ALS data and require minimal operator knowledge. Each algorithm has been designed to exploit the way in which the object exhibits itself in the data. The new algorithms are integrated into a software package called JTD (Join The Dots) that will facilitate the effective automatic processing of ALS data. The results of the new algorithms have been evaluated over four 2 x 2 km areas that have been sampled with medium resolution ALS data. The results for each area are displayed and analysed to show the applicability of the whole process in an exemplary way.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerial</field><field name="subject">Airborne</field><field name="subject">ALS</field><field name="subject">Bridges</field><field name="subject">Building</field><field name="subject">Classification</field><field name="subject">Detection</field><field name="subject">Digital</field><field name="subject">DSM</field><field name="subject">DTM</field><field name="subject">Geographic</field><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="subject">Information</field><field name="subject">Laser</field><field name="subject">LIDAR</field><field name="subject">Lines</field><field name="subject">Map</field><field name="subject">Model</field><field name="subject">Photogrammetry</field><field name="subject">Polygon</field><field name="subject">Powerlines</field><field name="subject">Raster</field><field name="subject">Road</field><field name="subject">Scanning</field><field name="subject">Spatial</field><field name="subject">Surface</field><field name="subject">System</field><field name="subject">Terrain</field><field name="subject">Trees</field><field name="subject">Vector</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158171</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatic Bank Check Processing and Authentication using Signature Verification</field><field name="creator">Madasu, Vamsi-Krishna</field><field name="description">Automatic processing of bank checks is a challenging research topic in the field of document analysis and recognition. Bank check processing is the process of automatic segmentation and recognition of the different data fields present on the bank check. In this process, the user entered handwritten information is automatically extracted from the check and recognized by a computer. Authentication is performed by comparing the handwritten signatures with the reference samples provided by the user. For the purpose of check processing, we have proposed a generic method for the automatic segmentation and identification of the information fields on a bank check. The uniqueness of this approach lies in the fact that it doesn&#146;t necessitate any prior information about the layout of the check and requires minimum human intervention. The various fields are segmented on the basis of their connectivity. Recognition of the fields is achieved based on the four newly devised fuzzy features, namely, average response, entropy, energy and quotient response. In addition to the proposed fuzzy features, Zernike moments have also been explored. A simple fuzzy logic based recognition approach is used to identify the various fields. The fuzzy features are able to identify all fields with reasonable accuracy but Zernike moments are found to distinguish the written matter from the printed matter only; hence these are used for coarse classification only. Automatic verification of handwritten signatures is fundamental to the authentication of bank checks. This thesis presents two approaches for handwritten signature verification using two different sets of features. In the first approach, additive fuzzy modeling has been employed to track the intrinsic variations in signatures samples of an individual for the twin purposes of signature verification and forgery detection. Innovative normalized angle features that uniquely characterize a signature are extracted by constructing a special grid which encloses the signature and divides it into ninety six local boxes. These features are then fuzzified by an exponential membership function, which has been modified to include two structural parameters. The structural parameters are devised to deal with innumerable variations in handwriting styles and personal characteristics. The membership functions constitute weights in the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model. The optimization of the output of the TS model with respect to the structural parameters yields their estimated values. Two cases are considered. In the first case, the coefficients of the consequent part of the rule are fixed so as to yield a simple form of TS model and in the second case, the coefficients are adapted. In this formulation, each fuzzy rule is constituted by a single feature and is implemented on the signature database. In the second formulation, only one rule encompassing all the features is considered. Experimental results demonstrate that the simple form of TS model in the first formulation is better than the one with coefficients adapted. In the second approach, edge features based on direction and hinge distribution are extracted from the signatures to create the knowledge base. Signature recognition is then performed using the fuzzy model derived from the Choquet integral. The output function in this model combines the fuzzy measures from input fuzzy sets and the resulting system is called non-additive fuzzy system unlike the output function in TS model where each coefficient corresponds to its own fuzzy set. This system is meant for modelling of the input fuzzy sets that have overlapping information. However, the performance of this system is found to be inferior to that of the additive fuzzy system as it is not able to detect forgeries effectively. To improve its performance, the decision from its model is fused with the decision of the simple TS model and a neural network classifier. Experimental results illustrate that although the fusion of verification algorithms produces better performance than any of the fused methods individually, it is still worse than the first approach using the grid features. Finally, a comparative analysis of well known static signature verification schemes is made on our signature database. The results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158172</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DEVELOPING A PROGRAM OF ENGLISH PROFICIENCY, COMMUNICATIVE LANGUAGE TEACHING AND REFLECTIVE TEACHING FOR PRE-SERVICE TEACHERS IN THAILAND</field><field name="creator">Rotarwut, Prachak</field><field name="description">The purpose of this action research is to investigate three aspects of a preparation program based on the Methods and Approaches in Teaching English (MATE) course for student teachers at Rajabhat Institute Nakhon Sawan, Thailand. The study assesses the extent to which training them to use communicative language teaching (CLT) in their practice teaching a) aids student teachers in using English during their practicum; b) helps student teachers to implement CLT in their teaching; and c) assists student teachers to reflect on their teaching practice. The genesis for this study lies in the problems the researcher originally experienced in teaching this Methods and Approaches in Teaching English (MATE) course to student teachers at Rajabhat Institute Nakhon Sawan, Thailand. First, a pilot study was designed to find out specifically what problems student teachers faced in implementing CLT in their practicum. The problems found were: a) the student teachers were deficient in English fluency; and b) they lacked training or practice in using CLT. These problems caused the student teachers to lose confidence in applying CLT in the classroom and therefore to teach based on traditional grammar-centered methods that were better known to them. To address these problems, the structure of the MATE course was changed to incorporate CLT methodology, to include English language improvement, and to incorporate reflective teaching strategies to improve students' CLT-based teaching practice. The focus on communicative language teaching reflects the requirements of the 1999 Thai Education Act which promote life long learning and communicative competence for the actual meaningful use of the target language. To do this, both the learning and teaching process must include the following characteristics: a focus on learner centredness and on meaning, appropriate use of context, skills integration and use of authentic materials in order to reach the goal of communicative competence. The use of reflective teaching helps to keep student teachers focused on using English and CLT, and thus is a key focus of this study. The methodology chosen for the study focuses on the four cyclical steps to undertake action research: planning, action, observing, and reflecting. Data was collected from a variety of sources, including interviews, observation, and diaries. This data was analysed using analytic procedures which show the level of students' reflective teaching as it relates to their consistent use of English and CLT in both their teaching demonstrations and practicum. The intervention program for the MATE course produced student teachers who were able to use English as the medium of instruction. They conducted all of their lessons in English both in the demonstration teaching and in the practicum. Each lesson they taught was also based on the five characteristics of CLT; learner-centredness, meaning, appropriateness, skill integration, and authentic materials. The student teachers were able to reflect on their teaching both in the MATE course and in their practicum. The outcomes from this study suggest that reflective teaching is an effective support procedure that enables student teachers to use English and communicative language teaching procedures more consistently in their classrooms; thereby providing new insights to inform programs for pre-service and in-service practice teaching. Such innovation is needed if Thai teachers are to move from traditional grammar-based teacher-fronted classes to communicative student-centred classes that focus on developing skills for life-long learning.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158173</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Data Intensive Mediator-based Web Services Composition with Self-tuning Histogram</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Yu</field><field name="description">Effectively using heterogeneous, distributed information has attracted much research in recent years. Current web services technologies have been used suc- cessfully in some non data intensive distributed systems. However, we still need to investigate the performance of web services applied on data intensive distributed systems. To take a step further, compositing several distributed services together normally needs web service composition technique. Obviously different compo- sition plans would end up with different performances at the end. Especially in a data intensive environment, choosing an optimal plan becomes even more critical. For example, Environment Protection agency, Queensland (EPA) needs an effective and optimal solution of providing spatial information services from several organizations. The data volumes need to be transferred and processed of are extremely high. A bad composition plan may end up running for days. In the contrast, a good plan may only take a couple of minutes. Therefore, our work here is to provide EPA a system prototype that is smart enough to effectively provide spatial information services by using web services over the Internet. To make our system clever enough to know what the best plan is, we propose a cost model to predict and estimate the cost of each plan. This cost model requires data selectivity estimation as a key parameter. In another words, the more precise the selectivity estimation on underlying dataset is, the more accurate our system is to pick up an optimal plan. Therefore, to make more accurate estimation and suite web services dynamic feature, we propose a query execution feedback learn- ing based histogram and parametric technique to estimate range query selectivity. Actually histograms have been studied extensively in the context of selectivity es- timation and approximate query processing. Comparing to static histograms that require periodical histogram reconstruction to reflect changes of the underlying data distribution, workload-aware dynamic histograms can self-tune itself based on user query feedback. Without scanning or sampling the underlying datasets in a systematic and comprehensive way, dynamic histograms allocate more buckets not only for the areas with most skewed data distribution but also according to users' interests. A major limitation of such an approach, however, is that it takes long time to warm-up (i.e., a large number of queries need to be processed before the histogram can provide a satisfactory coverage and accuracy), and it is less effective to adapt to workload changes. To sum up, in this thesis, we investigate performance issues of applying web services in data intensive environment. To optimize dynamic web service com- positions strategies, we propose a cost model to measure different composition plans. And we develop a self-tuning histogram and parametric technique to esti- mate key parameters of our proposed cost model. This is the core contribution of our work as it has a direct impact on our system's performance.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158174</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors Maintaining Cannabis Use in People with and Without Psychosis</field><field name="creator">Green, Robert John</field><field name="description">Cannabis use is prevalent among people with psychotic disorders, but at the same time cannabis is associated with increased symptomatology and risk of psychosis. This perplexing relationship has been the subject of much speculation and the social and psychological factors associated with use remain poorly identified. The relatively small number of studies that have examined the contribution of cognitive factors (e.g. reasons for use and expectancies) have been primarily descriptive, cross-sectional and have not employed control groups. Understanding the contribution of cognitive factors to continued cannabis use, while addressing the limitations of the existing research is a crucial research priority. The two studies that comprise the current research examined whether cognitive factors differ between men with and without psychosis. Additionally, two systematic literature reviews were undertaken. The first review examined factors that might account for variation in prevalence estimates of cannabis use and misuse among studies of people with psychosis. This review has also provided cannabis use and misuse estimates based on larger samples than have previously been analysed. The second review examined studies on the self-reported positive effects of cannabis. The more comprehensive data on self-reported effects resulting from this review provides a context to design the studies of subjective effects reported in this thesis. Study 1 was designed to both examine the relationship between expectancies and consumption, as well as to more comprehensively compare the subjective outcomes of cannabis use by people with and without psychosis. The first study was a two-group (psychosis group N = 45 and control group N =45 matched for age) prospective design. Consumption and expectancy data collected at baseline were used to predict consumption at follow-up. Consumption data were collected weekly for four weeks. For men with psychosis, negative expectancy (valence evaluation by effect likelihood) was a significant predictor of use on fewer days. In addition, use to relieve anxiety/depression was more likely at baseline; use to relieve boredom was more likely at follow-up. Although, the expectancy variables were not significant predictors of consumption for controls, when the components of expectancy were examined, likelihood of a positive effect was found to be consistently correlated with consumption (in contrast, for the participants with psychosis negative valence was correlated with consumption). In the control group use because of habit and to relax were more likely; use for social reasons was more likely at follow-up, while those control participants were more likely to expect and report relaxation. The participants in the psychosis group also had higher Severity of Dependence scores, more problems with use and greater difficulty ceasing use than those in the control group. Study 2 extended Study 1 by examining the temporal relationship between better and worse than usual effects and consumption, examining whether cannabis use was associated with differences in Negative Affect, and comparing cannabis induced relaxation in people with and without psychosis. Study 2 was a two-group (psychosis group N = 23 and control group N = 23 matched for age) cross-sectional design. Data were collected on consumption in the previous 28 days, and participants were asked to identify whether in this period a respective better and worse cannabis effect than usual had been experienced. The amount of consumption on the respective better and worse days, the day after these respective days and the day of next use after these days were then compared to average amount of use to determine the impact of better and worse effects on use. Participants with psychosis used more cannabis on the day when effects were better than usual; they used less cannabis on the day after the day with the worse than usual effect, and used less cannabis on the next day of use after the worse than usual effect. Participants with psychosis also obtained higher lifetime Severity of Dependence scores, reported more problems with use and gave higher ratings indicating wishing they could stop use. Controls also used more cannabis on the better than usual day and less cannabis on the day following this better effect day. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups on the relaxation expectancy scales. The research conducted for the current thesis makes a number of contributions to existing research. This is the first study that has directly compared motivational factors of people with and without psychosis to use cannabis. Secondly, a more comprehensive approach has been taken to the elicitation and measurement of these motivational factors. Whereas previous research into people with psychosis has primarily been descriptive and cross-sectional, the first study utilised a prospective design and the second study examined the temporal relationship between effects and consumption. The other contribution of the research undertaken was to apply multiple methods to examine both motivational factors and cannabis consumption. The research undertaken has also highlighted the need for further research into dependence among people with psychosis; the utility of the functional analysis approach to assessment of cannabis use; support for the application of motivational approaches to treatment, and the need for attention to developing more specific strategies to assist with dependence symptoms.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158175</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Approach to Sustainability Management for Water Utilities</field><field name="creator">Uhlmann, Vikki</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to explore an approach aimed at developing water utility attitudes towards adopting sustainability management practices. In doing so a toolkit called SUST, intended to be affordable, practical and user-friendly, was developed for use by water utilities in defining, assessing and improving their sustainability. Multi-disciplinary in nature, SUST was developed from a range of best practice concepts in the literature, and designed to balance the social, environment and economic components of a &#147;triple bottom line&#148; conception of sustainability. The major contributions of this research are: 1. An improved method of sustainability assessment and reporting for water utilities, SUST, which achieved support from the majority of participating regulatory agencies. 2. A complete step by step process whereby utilities and their stakeholders can agree on a vision of sustainability, then measure and make improvements. 3. A definition of a sustainable water utility which has been refined by participating utilities and agencies. 4. An educational tool for improving understanding of sustainability. 5. Recognition that, to be practical, affordable and user-friendly, a sustainability indicator set must also meet regulatory reporting requirements and, at least in the interim, traditional indicators may need to be incorporated, in contrast to Lundin&#146;s (1999) view that they should not be used. 6. Agreement by water utilities and regulatory agencies that the water utility practice of selecting a set of sustainability indicators without first developing an agreed vision of sustainability is not effective. 7. Some evidence that a standardized sustainability indicator set could be developed using SUST and could be used by water utilities, which presents exciting prospects. 8. Evidence that many water utilities have a long way to go before they can address some of the cornerstones of water utility sustainability &#150; total water cycle management, real value pricing and public involvement. 9. The beginnings of a tool for use in achieving culture change in a water utility organisation. Five SUST modules were developed as part of the research: 1. Sustainability management steps for systematic and rigorous decision-making; 2. Definition of a sustainable water utility as a starting point for a sustainability vision; 3. Selection criteria for choosing sustainability indicators; 4. A model sustainability indicator set which could be used to measure progress against the definition; 5. Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) software for systematically and rigorously assessing sustainability and options for improvement. Three research questions were developed and addressed: 1. What is the current status of sustainability reporting by water utilities in the Australian State of Queensland and what are the barriers to its improvement? 2. What is the usefulness of SUST as an approach to developing sustainability management in Queensland? 3. Does the use of SUST by water utilities achieve regulator and public agency support? A water industry survey was conducted with a number of water utilities to address Question 1 and provide initial data in relation to Question 2. Subsequent case study trials with two utilities utilising a refined SUST obtained more in-depth data on Question 2 and also addressed Question 3. Question 1 findings identified the major barrier to improved sustainability management as a lack of understanding of the concept, with current performance reporting bearing little relationship to cornerstone sustainability issues. Initial feedback on Question 2 indicated that SUST may be able to assist in addressing these issues. Survey respondents supported the foundations of SUST and most of its modules. Module 1 decision-making steps were largely supported as was the definition of a sustainable utility in Module 2. Support was also achieved for the use of indicators as sustainability measures in Module 4, consistent with the view that indicators are a practical vehicle for coming to grips with sustainability. However, agreement on a standardized indicator set for common use by utilities was not reached. More detailed feedback established that most utility and agency participants found SUST very useful in making sustainability both meaningful and operational for a water utility, with the definition ranked the most critical of the SUST modules. More than half the participating regulatory agencies thought SUST represented a better approach to managing sustainability than current methods, and would support its use by utilities, while the remainder was unsure. Further, consistent with the literature, participants believed that, to maintain validity, an indicator set needs to be developed following agreement on the definition of sustainability, and cannot be chosen from a set such as the Global Reporting Initiative set without such a framework. SUST may be able to produce a standardized indicator set which improves existing regulator indicators as well as incorporating new contributions, avoiding duplication of reporting effort. Such an outcome could improve affordability of sustainability reporting by water utilities and merits further research. Some evidence indicates that SUST may be useful as a cultural change tool as, via a team learning effort, it caused a redefinition of the core business of a water utility to incorporate sustainability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158176</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Groundwater dynamics and the salinity structure in sandy beaches</field><field name="creator">Cartwright, Nick</field><field name="description">Groundwater dynamics in beaches have been investigated through field and laboratory experiments. The observations have been used to test the ability of currently available mathematical and numerical models to adequately account for the influence of processes such as vertical flow and capillarity. New 1D sand column experiments have been conducted to examine the influence of a truncated capillary fringe on periodic water table oscillations. As the fringe becomes increasingly truncated the aquifer storage term, the complex effective porosity n &#969;, is substantially reduced in agreement with previous findings under steady flow conditions. The findings are a useful starting point for an investigation of the dynamics of the water table exit point in beaches where the water table lies just below the sand surface. A simple 2D laboratory aquifer, influenced by finite-depth and capillarity effects, subject to simple harmonic periodic forcing has been used to investigate the dispersion of the water table waves. The performance of existing dispersion relation theories, accounting for both capillarity and finite-depth effects, deteriorates at higher oscillation frequencies suggesting that other, neglected processes have some influence. Horizontal flow in the capillary fringe is suggested as such a process. The generation of higher harmonics due to a sloping beach face is also investigated in the laboratory. The observations reveal that the generation process is strongest near the sand surface, likely to be due to vertical flows into the aquifer being strongest near the sand surface. A 2DV numerical model is applied to the data and does well in predicting the nature of the generation process, qualitatively reproducing the variation in oscillation amplitude with depth in the inter-tidal zone. Application of a modified Boussinesq equation to estimate aquifer recharge due to infiltration from wave runup is critically applied to field and laboratory measurements. Finite amounts of flux across the water table are seen at, and landward of, the runup limit where there is zero infiltration at the sand surface. This suggests that the capillary fringe and vertical flows in this region are significant and that application of the model be undertaken with care. Field observations of the salinity structure and its response to ocean forcing reveal no response to tidal forcing but a significant response to a wave-induced pulse in groundwater levels. The infiltration of salty ocean water due to infiltration from wave runup is shown to reverse the traditional &#147;salt-wedge&#148; scenario in the surficial aquifer with a thin salty layer overlying the fresh water.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">290801 Structural Engineering</field><field name="subject">680203 Civil</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158177</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling unplanned landscape change: A Colombian case study</field><field name="creator">Etter, Andres</field><field name="description">The broad aim of this study is, to contribute to a broader and more comprehensive understanding of the patterns, processes and drivers of unplanned land cover change in the tropics, using Colombia as a study case. Land cover change is an important global issue because of the expanding ecological footprint of a rapidly increasing human population and per capita level of resource consumption. This has a major impact on natural ecosystems and their function at the local (hundreds of square kilometers) and global scales. The understanding of extent and rate of land cover change is an important issue confronting biodiversity conservation, land use planning, protected area management, and global climate change analysis. Tropical deforestation is the major source of global land cover change, with the highest absolute rates occurring in South America, especially in the Brazilian Amazon, where government planning is an important driver of deforestation. However, unplanned deforestation for cropping and ranching is also occurring in Colombia. This is of international concern because Colombia&#146;s diverse ecosystems support high levels of species richness and endemism. Improving the understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns and drivers ofland cover change (both deforestation and regeneration) is an important step in developing planning and conservation strategies to address this problem. I applied a spatial and temporal statistical modelling approach to predict changes in land cover in Colombia at the local (100 km2), regional (104 km2) and national (106 km2) levels, with a timeframe spanning from decades to centuries. As dependant variable data, binary forest/non-forest data are used. Explanatory variables comprise biophysical and socioeconomic data sourced from a broad range of information sources, including remotely sensed data from aerial photographs and satellite images, secondary sources of biophysical and socioeconomic data, and historical data. At the local-level, I addressed the deforestation process over the last 60 years using six case studies of 100 km2 of humid lowland forests, by applying logistic regression and spatial analysis. At the regional-level, I studied the deforestation in the Caquet&#225; colonization front of the Colombian Amazon region from 1988-2004 by applying a forest-cover zoning method and logistic regression models to predict deforestation and forest regeneration from biophysical and socio-economic explanatory variables. At the national level, I quantified and analysed patterns and drivers of land cover change over the past 500 years for key periods of Colombian history, and identified the extent and duration of impacts on broad ecosystem types. At the national and regional-levels, I also modelled current landscape transformation patterns and predicted areas at a high risk of future deforestation using a joint logistic regression and regression tree approach. I discovered that the rate of deforestation across several lowland regions of Colombia follows a simple sigmoid pattern composed of four phases of transformation: an initial phase of gradual forest loss; an intermediate phase of rapid loss; a second intermediate phase where the rate of decline slows; and a final phase where the forest loss stabilises and is balanced by forest regeneration creating a dynamic equilibrium. At the end of this final phase, the landscape is in a highly transformed state with forest cover stabilizing at 2 to 10% of the original extent and an average forest patch size of 15.4 (&#177; 9.2) ha. As a general rule, the transformed landscape will have two forest components: a stable component of remnant mature tropical forests, and a dynamic component of secondary forests of different ages that is repeatedly cleared. A second important discovery was that unplanned deforestation in the Colombian Amazon moves as a colonisation wave, extending from population centres. The rate of movement was 0.84 km.yr-1 between 1989 and 2002. The regional average annual deforestation rate was 2.6%, but varied locally between &#150;1.8% (regeneration) and 5.3%. The parallel deforestation and regeneration processes operating within the colonization front showed consistent patterns and rates directly related to the proportion of forest in the neighbourhood, with the highest rates of deforestation occurring in the areas with intermediate (40-60%) forest cover, following an overall quadratic function, and therefore confirming the sigmoid pattern across an entire colonization front. Landscapes with intermediate forest cover also have the highest density of edge habitat, with the deforestation process mimicking the spread of disease. At the national-level, the study reveals two important outcomes. First, there are significant regional differences in the spatial and temporal patterns and drivers of land cover change. The importance of such regional differences in factors explainingland cover change is highlighted by the greatest discrimination ability shown by a regional-level classification tree model. The coefficients and significance of variables in a regional logistic regression model confirmed these differences. Overall, factors related to accessibility (distance to roads and towns) had the strongest influence on the probability of deforestation. The second national-level outcome highlights the need for a longer-term historical perspective spanning centuries to understand present-day landscapes and their level of human impact. The historical analysis reveals that the main drivers of landscape change varied in the early colonial period, with cattle grazing becoming increasingly important, and finally the high impact of economic globalization in the 1990s. The historic land cover maps show the transformed areas increasing from approximately 15 million ha in 1500 to 42 million ha in 2000. Also, during this period, the transformed areas changed from predominantly cropping land uses in 1500 to predominantly (&lt; 75%) grazing in 2000. The research outcomes collectively provide an understanding of the spatial dynamics of unplannedland cover change in tropical forest landscapes, by showing how deforestation and regeneration processes vary along a transformation gradient, and linking the amount of remnant forests is related to the rate of change. The work has implications for policy and management. For example, the method of calculating the movement speed of a colonization front provides a spatially explicit prediction of threat that can be used in conservation planning. The improved understanding of the deforestation and regeneration dynamics over an entire colonization fronts permits more accurate calculation of carbon budgeting for climate change applications. I recommend that future work test of the generalities presented here in both, countries with unplanned deforestation and countries with planned land clearing, to evaluate the effects government controlled planning has on the end result of human transformed landscapes in tropical and subtropical forest regions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270704 Landscape Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158178</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Not blind enough: Living in the borderland called legal blindness</field><field name="creator">Omansky, Beth Fay</field><field name="description">This qualitative study explored the experiences of people categorised as legally blind.

Located in disability studies, the thesis examined the experience of legal blindness in a unique way, cross-fertilising the best elements of an American cultural studies approach with a British social model of disability. The British social model, rooted in sociological materialist analysis, is often positioned by its proponents as at odds with the United States humanities-based cultural or minority model of disability. This thesis sought to discover if a bridge could be built between the two models to allow for several theoretical analyses with the higher goal of understanding both phenomenological and social aspects of borderland blindness. Another original aspect of this study is the use of the postmodern metaphor &#147;borderland&#148; to carve out a geographical space unique to legal blindness -- a territory between sightedness and blindness where residents are pressed to migrate back and forth across its borders from situation to situation. The research developed a combination of social constructionism, materialism, postmodernism, and existential phenomenology, while aiming to meet the goals of emancipatory disability research. Participants told their stories in their own words, they chose what was important for us to know about them, and they maintained control over their stories throughout the research and write-up processes. The study was interested in how society treats blind people, and was also keen to know what meaning blind people made of such treatment. Its design strayed from orthodox disability studies research in that it wanted to learn and record the embodied experience of legal blindness as well as blindness identity formation. However, to examine physical aspects of blindness did not imply approval of ocularcentric medical model practices; both the American and British social models have at their foundations critical analyses of medicine&#146;s control over the lives of disabled people. While this study utilised social constructionism as a primary method of analysis, it simultaneously challenged the binary of essentialism/social constructionism because impairment, disablement, and disability are complex and do not all fit into either stance. The experience of impairment is integral to understanding the lived experience of blindness. Further, the study rejected the blindness/sightedness binary which positions blindness as &#145;lack&#146; (Michalko, 1999), and instead, examined borderland blindness as a medically and legally constructed social category that is neither better nor worse than &#145;normal&#146; sight and vision, but is merely neutral difference. The research was conducted from an &#145;insider&#146; position because I wanted to learn how other legally blind people experience life in the borderland; and, in the tradition of disability studies and disability activism, I consider this work a political act -- &#147;a commitment to openly partisan inquiry&#148; (Barnes and Mercer, 2004). I was curious to explore the strengths, weaknesses, and complexities of conducting research as an &#147;insider&#148; &#150; as a member of the population of research interest. Another feature of this study was the application of Rogerian techniques of establishing an environment in which genuineness, trust, and unconditional positive regard would flourish; this model provided a natural marriage to emancipatory life story and insider research. The research findings conclude that there is no conflict between British and American social models of disability; and further argue that the two models enhance each other in that together they provide a more holistic examination of the everyday lived experience of disabled people. Use of both models strengthened inherent weaknesses that arise when each model stands alone. Furthermore, the findings suggest that more studies about blindness concentrate on &#147;legal&#148; or borderland blindness because this population has experiences that are vastly different from both totally blind and sighted people. These differences have significant ramifications for education, rehabilitation and other human service policy and provision.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">750305 Ability and disability</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158179</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silence and the performer in the flute works of Toru Takemitsu (1930-1996)</field><field name="creator">Kenny, Alexis Fleurina</field><field name="description">Toru Takemitsu (1930-1996) is Japan&#146;s most internationally celebrated composer to date. He possessed a unique musical voice, a hybrid of Eastern philosophy and Western technique. Takemitsu made extensive use of silence in his compositions, treating the absence of sound as an active element in the musical narrative. He was deeply and personally affected by the philosophical bases pertaining to traditional Japanese music. This had a profound influence on his worldview. The following critical commentary was instigated as a result of performance-related questions and includes the role of the performer with respect to silence. It aims to enlighten the thesis that silence in Takemitsu&#146;s works functions as an invitation to contemplation both for the listener and performer in a process which requires exploration, discovery and imagination. In outlining Takemitsu&#146;s worldview, a brief biographical account is included in order to establish context, followed by a survey of influences, primarily focusing on Eastern philosophies. Additionally, the formulation of the Japanese philosophical concept of &#147;ma&#148; and its development in relation to music as it pertains directly to the execution of silence will be discussed. Following the examination of three flute works, the role of the performer including traditional perspectives, contemporary flautists&#146; views, as well as fundamental attitudes towards performance will be explored. The present study is concerned with Takemitsu&#146;s concert music, as an investigation into his prolific film soundtrack output and popular arranging is beyond the scope of this paper.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158180</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing Tasks of Relational Reasoning to Assess the Effects of Cognitive Ageing</field><field name="creator">Zielinski, Tracey Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the effectiveness of five tasks designed to assess ability to process cognitive relations in a normally aging population. The tasks are based on the theory of relational complexity, which defines cognitive processing capacity in terms of the complexity of relations that can be processed. The literature on working memory and processing capacity is examined, including the relationship between these constructs. The assessment of processing capacity adopted in the thesis differs from some previous approaches in the emphasis on processing of information while minimizing the storage element often found in tasks deemed to assess working memory capacity. A series of tasks have been developed for the purpose of assessing cognitive processing ability by systematically varying processing load as measured by relational complexity, or the number of variables which must be processed in a single decision. Each task contains a number of items at different levels of relational complexity. In essence, this project attempted to answer two main questions: 1. Are relational complexity measures likely to be a useful way of assessing cognitive performance with age? 2. Does the ability to process cognitive relations decline with age? Chapter One reviews literature pertaining to working memory, cognitive capacity, and task demand or processing load. The chapter considers the effectiveness of both short-term and working memory constructs in explaining the human ability to process information. The chapter considers the relative effectiveness of working memory span measures of cognitive processing capacity. The final section of this chapter approaches the idea of capacity limits from a different perspective. Moving away from human capacity limits, this section instead focuses on the manipulation of task demand or processing load. The concept of relational complexity is introduced as a potential means of manipulating the processing load of a task. Chapter Two further explores the notion that both task load and the mental resources of the individual influence cognitive task performance, looking primarily at evidence from neuroimaging studies. The first section of this chapter considers what neuroscience has to tell us about working memory and cognitive capacity. Evidence from both lesion and functional brain imaging studies was considered. The second section of this chapter deals with the aging brain and working memory. Finally working memory was considered from the perspective of an influential theory of cognitive aging &#150; the processing speed theory. The roles played by both processing speed and working memory in complex cognitive tasks were considered. Chapters 3 and 4 reviewed the modification and development of two particular tasks, designed to vary in levels of relational complexity. Chapter 3 focused on the Categorical Syllogisms Task. Chapter 4 dealt with a modified version of the N-Back task. Chapters 5 to 7 outline the trial of a number of tasks designed to vary in levels of complexity or processing load with a normally aging population. Ninety older subjects, (ranging from 54 to 84 years), and thirty younger subjects (ranging from 24 to 35 years) were individually tested on five &#147;relational complexity&#148; tasks and a range of commonly used neuropsychological tasks. Prior to assessment all subjects were screened to ensure the existence of no neurological, psychiatric, or medical conditions that might impact on cognitive performance. Chapter 5 and 6, respectively, outline the method and results of the current study using a normal aging population. Chapter 7 discusses the theoretical and practical implications of the study, and considers areas for future research. Overall, the results of this project confirm that four of the five relational complexity tasks under development showed promise as tools for assessing the ability to process relations. Recommendations for further development of these tasks are made. The study also confirmed that the ability to process cognitive relations does indeed decline with age. In particular, then, the results indicated that the tasks do show promise as measures of performance in the area of cognitive aging.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158181</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EVOLUTION IN A SECONDARY CONTACT ZONE BETWEEN TWO LINEAGES OF THE GREEN-EYED TREE FROG LITORIA GENIMACULATA</field><field name="creator">Hoskin, Conrad Jules</field><field name="description">Secondary contact zones are regions where genetically distinct populations overlap and produce hybrids, and they offer the potential for significant insights into the process of speciation. The central Wet Tropics in north-east Queensland is a region where numerous species have genetic lineages in secondary contact following the expansion of rainforest from historical (Pliocene and Pleistocene) refugia in the northern and southern Wet Tropics. One of these species is the Green-eyed Tree Frog Litoria genimaculata, a medium-sized arboreal frog associated with rainforest streams. The Wet Tropics populations of this species consist of a deeply divergent (13% CO1 mtDNA) northern and southern lineage currently in contact in the central Wet Tropics. This thesis presents a thorough analysis of the outcomes of historical isolation and secondary contact in this species and aims to elucidate the evolutionary processes that have determined these outcomes. The northern (N) and southern (S) lineages of L. genimaculata overlap at two independent contact zones in close proximity &#150; one between the main ranges of N and S (contact A) and the other, 13 km to the north, where an isolated population of the southern lineage (termed iS) occurs within the northern lineage area (contact B). The iS population is currently geographically isolated from the genetically similar main range of the S lineage. Genetic analyses of the contact zones revealed that hybridization occurs between the two lineages in the field, but it occurs significantly more frequently at contact A (estimate of 3.1-6.8% hybrids) than at contact B (0-1.4%) and also over a broader area (approximately 6.0 km versus 0.6 km). Experimental crosses revealed asymmetric offspring viability between the lineages, with crosses between southern females (S/iS) and N males failing in the early larval stage while the reciprocal crosses succeeded. This is supported by the genetic analyses, which found that none of the potential hybrids carried S mtDNA. There are no morphological differences between the lineages where the main ranges meet at contact A, but there is a significant difference in male call. However, females from this contact did not show a preference for either lineage when these calls were used in laboratorybased two-choice call trials. In contrast, there is significant divergence in iS male (but not female) body size and call from N at contact B, and mate choice trials revealed highly significant premating isolation between the lineages at this contact. The genetic analyses supported these results in finding the frequency of hybridization to be significantly lower at contact B than at contact A. No differences in ecology or behaviour were detected between the lineages at either contact. The conclusion from these results is that the process of reinforcement (increase in premating isolation due to natural selection against hybridization) has resulted in speciation between the lineages at contact B but not at contact A. The larva of a Batrachomyia fly parasitise L. genimaculata and the potential impact of parasitism on contact zone dynamics was investigated. Infection prevalence was significantly higher in southern (S/iS) lineage L. genimaculata at the mixed lineage sites in both contact zones, with the magnitude of this effect being similar at both contacts despite the phenotypic divergence and reproductive isolation of iS males. No differential impact of parasitism on host body condition of either lineage, or on host body condition in general, was detected. This suggests that Batrachomyia parasitism has a limited impact on L. genimaculata contact zone dynamics. The rarity of both hybrids and Batrachomyia infection precluded testing for a differential impact of parasitism on hybrid versus pure lineage frogs. The phenotypic divergence of iS from N due to reinforcement has, as a by-product, resulted in significant divergence in iS male call and body size from the main range of S. Mate choice trials revealed that this call divergence results in highly significant premating isolation between iS and S. This strongly suggests that speciation by reinforcement between iS and N at contact B has also resulted in speciation between iS and the genetically similar main range of S. This provides the first demonstration that reinforcement between lineages can incidentally drive allopatric speciation within one of the lineages. Speciation of iS was deemed to be rapid given the estimated recency of secondary contact between the lineages, and the genetic similarity between iS and S. The iS population is described as a new species, while S and N are retained as a single species, L. genimaculata. The new species is phenotypically distinct from both S and N based on call characteristics and small male body size. This research highlights the limitations of phylogenetics in delimiting species and demonstrates the value of an approach using multiple lines of data. The biology and conservation of the new species are outlined. This research demonstrates the conservation value of contact zones in maintaining the evolutionary potential of regions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158182</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-transcriptional regulation of BRCA1: Investigation of the roles of RNA-binding proteins and cis-acting elements in the 3&#146;untranslated region</field><field name="creator">Saunus, Jodi Marie</field><field name="description">BRCA1 is a breast cancer susceptibility gene that is down-regulated in the majority of cases of sporadic breast cancer. Accordingly, there is considerable interest in the mechanisms that regulate normal expression of BRCA1, with a view to elucidating how this could be disrupted in breast cancer. In tumours with reduced BRCA1 protein expression, there can be a concomitant reduction in mRNA level to variable degrees, or no change in mRNA level, suggesting that disruption of multiple different regulatory processes may contribute to BRCA1 down-regulation. Despite this, efforts to date have chiefly focussed on transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of the gene, whilst post-transcriptional processes that regulate the dynamics of the BRCA1 transcript, such as decay, localisation and translation efficiency, are poorly understood. Post-transcriptional regulatory pathways are critical for sustaining normal cellular physiology, as evidenced by many examples where disruption of these processes results in disease, including cancer. Regulation of gene expression at this level is often mediated by RNA-binding proteins that recognise specific cis-acting sequence motifs in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of certain messenger RNAs, and recruit, or shield them from macromolecular complexes involved in RNA metabolism, such as the translation apparatus, exosome, and subcellular transport particles. This thesis is centred on investigating post-transcriptional regulation of BRCA1. Others have shown that expression of the transcript and protein is regulated throughout the mammalian cell division cycle. Results presented in this thesis suggest that changes in mRNA stability may contribute to cell cycle-dependent expression of BRCA1, and therefore that post-transcriptional regulation of BRCA1 is a biologically-relevant phenomenon. To begin to address the molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of BRCA1 mRNA decay, and possibly other post-transcriptional regulatory processes, the 3&#146;UTR of BRCA1, which had not been previously characterised, was analysed for functional regulatory motifs using a combination of bioinformatics, reporter assays and RNA-proteinbinding analysis. An evolutionarily-conserved 3&#146;UTR subsequence was identified which contains sequence elements capable of regulating reporter activity, and forming complexes with multiple proteins from human epithelial cell lines. Some of these elements have been previously characterised in the context of other genes, including a Hu-antigen R (HuR)-binding motif, adenosine-uridine (AU)- rich sequences and a differentiation control element (DICE). Experiments were also conducted to determine the identities of the RNA-binding proteins detected using an RNA probe containing the 3&#146;UTR elements. A preliminary screen of a small group of RNA-binding proteins with previously-characterised roles in 3&#146;UTR-mediated post-transcriptional gene regulation identified HuR as a negative regulator of BRCA1 protein expression. Interestingly, HuR is over-expressed in breast cancer. Evidence presented in this thesis suggests that the mechanism of HuR-mediated down-regulation of BRCA1 involves direct binding of HuR to the BRCA1 3&#146;UTR, and no changes to mRNA stability or abundance. Finally, proteomics-based analysis of protein extracts enriched with BRCA1 3&#146;UTR RNA-binding proteins yielded several interesting candidates with previously-reported RNA-binding and/or post-transcriptional regulatory activities, including Far upstream element-binding protein 1 (FBP1), Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) and Heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27). This thesis addresses a clear deficiency in the literature concerning regulation of BRCA1, and contributes to our general understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling gene expression in mammalian cells. Additionally, the finding that RNA-binding proteins that are over-expressed in breast cancer can negatively regulate BRCA1 expression constitutes important groundwork for identifying potential novel breast cancer therapeutics in the future.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270299 Genetics not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158183</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Artificial Ontogenies: A Computational Model of the Control and Evolution of Development</field><field name="creator">Geard, Nicholas Lewis</field><field name="description">Understanding the behaviour of biological systems is a challenging task. Gene regulation, development and evolution are each a product of nonlinear interactions between many individual agents: genes, cells or organisms. Moreover, these three processes are not isolated, but interact with one another in an important fashion. The development of an organism involves complex patterns of dynamic behaviour at the genetic level. The gene networks that produce this behaviour are subject to mutations that can alter the course of development, resulting in the production of novel morphologies. Evolution occurs when these novel morphologies are favoured by natural selection and survive to pass on their genes to future generations. Computational models can assist us to understand biological systems by providing a framework within which their behaviour can be explored. Many natural processes, including gene regulation and development, have a computational element to their control. Constructing formal models of these systems enables their behaviour to be simulated, observed and quantified on a scale not otherwise feasible. This thesis uses a computational simulation methodology to explore the relationship between development and evolution. An important question in evolutionary biology is how to explain the direction of evolution. Conventional explanations of evolutionary history have focused on the role of natural selection in orienting evolution. More recently, it has been argued that the nature of development, and the way it changes in response to mutation, may also be a significant factor. A network-lineage model of artificial ontogenies is described that incorporates a developmental mapping between the dynamics of a gene network and a cell lineage representation of a phenotype. Three series of simulation studies are reported, exploring: (a) the relationship between the structure of a gene network and its dynamic behaviour; (b) the characteristic distributions of ontogenies and phenotypes generated by the dynamics of gene networks; (c) the effect of these characteristic distributions on the evolution of ontogeny. The results of these studies indicate that the model networks are capable of generating a diverse range of stable behaviours, and possess a small yet significant sensitivity to perturbation. In the context of developmental control, the intrinsic dynamics of the model networks predispose the production of ontogenies with a modular, quasi-systematic structure. This predisposition is reflected in the structure of variation available for selection in an adaptive search process, resulting in the evolution of ontogenies biased towards simplicity. These results suggest a possible explanation for the levels of ontogenetic complexity observed in biological organisms: that they may be a product of the network architecture of developmental control. By quantifying complexity, variation and bias, the network-lineage model described in this thesis provides a computational method for investigating the effects of development on the direction of evolution. In doing so, it establishes a viable framework for simulating computational aspects of complex biological systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158184</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the Photo-Physiology of Symbiodinium Sub-Clades and its Relationship to Coral Bleaching</field><field name="creator">Fisher, Paul</field><field name="description">The identification of diverse genetic types of symbiotic algae within the genus Symbiodinium was established over a decade ago. Since then the resolving power of the genetic identification used has increased to the point where multiple clades and sub-clades are now distinct. Observations of differences in susceptibility within and between coral species in regard to coral bleaching has been equally well documented over the last ten years. The role that different Symbiodinium types play in controlling bleaching susceptibility has gained much focus due to recent research indicating that certain Symbiodinium sub-clades often occur in symbiosis with bleaching tolerant corals. The aim of this thesis was to determine if physiological differences existed between various sub-clades of Symbiodinium and how they may explain the disparity in bleaching susceptibility seen in the field during bleaching events. This involved several experiments on both the intact host and isolated Symbiodinium of various reef building corals under experimental conditions. These varied from increased temperature to the addition of exogenous active oxygen species. The results of these studies suggested that Symbiodinium sub-clades show various physiological differences in both their tolerance to experimental conditions and the capacity of protective measures. The Symbiodinium sub-clades C3 and C15 showed differences in chlorophyll fluorescent measurements with distinct reductions in the dynamic yield of PSII, dark-adapted yield of PSII, relative electron transport rate and non-photochemical quenching at elevated temperatures for both freshly isolated Symbiodinium and for intact corals (in-hospite). Differences were also shown in the capacity of Symbiodinium types to use non-photochemical quenching, measured by chlorophyll fluorescence, and correlated with the size of the xanthophyll pool as well as its cycling, although appearing not to relate to temperature tolerance in this instance. Considerable differences were also found in light acclimation of different isolated Symbiodinium, while light acclimation did not differ significantly in-hospite. The effect of the addition of exogenous active oxygen species correlated with results obtained from experimental heating, suggesting that temperature tolerance to some extent was related to the capacity of Symbiodinium to deal with oxidative stress. From the results presented here it is hypothesised that perhaps damage to the thylakoid membrane occurred during both temperature and oxidative stress and that the observed differences in tolerance between C3 and C15 Symbiodinium sub-clades to both of these stress events could be explained by the disparity of thylakoid damage. Differences between Symbiodinium types may therefore explain the apparent variation in bleaching tolerance in some instances. Although this thesis proposes physiological differences between some Symbiodinium types, more research is needed to determine the full extent to which this controls bleaching susceptibility on a reef-wide scale. The outcomes of this thesis also indicate the considerable involvement that host variability plays in controlling bleaching susceptibility even amongst closely related coral species. Therefore, Symbiodinium type alone can not be used as the sole indicator of bleaching tolerance within reef building corals.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158185</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A PRAGMATIC AND SEMANTIC STUDY OF THE CHINESE MODAL PARTICLE A (&#21834;)</field><field name="creator">Wang, Ying Xian</field><field name="description">This is an empirical study of the Chinese modal particle a which occurs predominantly in sentence-final positions. It is one of the most frequently used sentence/modal particles and yet pragmatic and semantic descriptions of the particle in the literature are sketchy and inadequate. In order to capture the uses and the underlying meanings of the particle, a large body of discourse data was obtained from the popular Chinese TV drama series Kewang &#145;Expectations&#146;. Out of the total of 50 episodes of the series, the first 20 (about 20 hours in length) were transcribed which yielded a data script of more than 142000 Chinese characters with a total of 1829 instances of the particle all used in meaningful conversational situations. Within these contexts of use, the particle occurrences were analysed and categorized and on this basis characterization of the particle was made in terms of its use and meaning. Following this empirical and inductive approach, it is found that the particle is encoded with three basic modal meanings which are: volitive, exclamative, and surprisive. The volitive indexes the speaker&#146;s strong wish that a situation will occur in a certain way and especially that the addressee will behave in a certain way towards what is said by the speaker. The use of the particle in the volitive adds an emphatic note to the utterance it is attached to. The particle in the exclamative conveys an intense state of the speaker&#146;s strong emotion of one kind or another. The exclamative meaning usually makes its presence in exclamative sentences and in affirmative assertions and formulaic social expressions. The surprisive meaning indicates the speaker&#146;s surprised feeling towards a given situation verbally presented or related to what is said by the speaker. The particle in the surprisive occurs with declaratives, imperatives and it helps form confirmation questions and rhetorical and reproach types of questions which take the form of a declarative sentence. Some of the utterances in the data are exclamatory also due to the presence of the particle used in its surprisive meaning. This study is an attempt at achieving a better understanding of one of the most frequently used Mandarin modal items which are known for being notoriously elusive in their pragmatic and semantic functions. It is hoped that this study will provide inspirations for studies of similar kind on other modal items in the Chinese language.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158186</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus: quantification, identification of neural subtypes, and regulation by the immune system</field><field name="creator">Colditz, Michael John</field><field name="description">Neurogenesis, the production of new neural cells, occurs normally in the healthy adult hippocampus, and has been postulated to regulate normal brain function and behaviour. Dysregulation of neurogenesis is thought to be a contributing factor in many mental health conditions, such as depression, as well as in neurodegenerative conditions, including dementia, Alzheimer&#146;s and Huntington&#146;s diseases. Generation and survival of new neurons can also be regulated by environmental conditions such as exercise, learning and memory tasks and antidepressant treatments. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling neurogenesis are poorly understood. The aim of this thesis was to characterise the modulation and potential immune regulation of running- or antidepressant-induced neurogenesis. To assist with a study of the effects of environment stimulation on neurogenesis, it was first necessary to develop and validate a BrdU-flow cytometry quantification method. By comparisons with manual counts and/or published data, the assay was shown to be accurate in determining (i) the total number of hippocampal cells, (ii) the total number of hippocampal BrdU-positive cells, (iii) the fluoxetine- and running-induced increase in number of BrdU-positive cells, (iv) that fluoxetine does not alter the survival of BrdU-positive cells and (v) the percentage of BrdU-positive cells that mature to express the mature neuron specific protein NeuN. The assay was then applied to the development of an improved BrdU administration regime. A simpler oral administration of BrdU via drinking water, was shown to label the same number of proliferating cells as administration via intra-peritoneal injection (one-way ANOVA, P=0.55). Furthermore, delivery of BrdU via drinking water for 36 hours rather than 12 or 24 hours, more consistently labelled a proliferating population of cells (F-test, P=0.03). The BrdU-flow cytometry method accurately measured a 1.67-fold increase in running-induced neural proliferation (unpaired Student t-test, P&lt;0.01), similar to the increase measured using the sphere-forming assay (1.43 times, unpaired Student t-tests, P=0.03). The BrdU-flow cytometry method developed is more rapid than conventional methods and was found suitable for examining a range of factors and interventions that may influence the rate of, and the mechanisms that control, neurogenesis. Second, to further assess how the pro-neurogenic stimulation of running alters hippocampal neurogenesis, cells positive for the endogenous migrating neuroblast marker doublecortin (DCX) were characterised. The number of hippocampal DCX-positive cells increased in running animals (unpaired Student t-test, P=0.0001). Further characterisation of the DCX-positive population revealed five phenotypically different DCX-positive cell types, only two of which were responsive to neurogenic stimulation (unpaired Student t-tests, P=0.002 and P=0.049). It was concluded that running acts selectively by potentially inducing proliferation of neuronal progenitors rather than cycling stem cells. Third, a non-neuronal cellular candidate that promotes neural proliferation was identified. The candidate, microglia, were present in both neurogenic regions, and increased in number after running (unpaired Student t-tests: hippocampus, P=0.0001, and SVZ, P=0.01). Many of the running-induced microglia were also BrdU-positive, indicating that many microglia arose de novo, accompanied by microglia migration from other neural regions in response to the stimulation. Furthermore, the running-induced microglia caused an increase in the number of SFU in both hippocampal and SVZ cultures (one-way ANOVA, P&lt;0.001 and P&lt;0.01). The major finding of this thesis is that running instructs resident microglia, by a mechanism yet to be identified, to adopt a pro-neurogeneic phenotype. These pro-neurogeneic microglia then act to increase the proliferation of hippocampal and SVZ neurogenic cells.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158817</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure-Activity Relationships in Biotechnology: Science and Business Perspectives</field><field name="creator">Ireland, David</field><field name="description">This PhD offers a new approach to addressing a fundamental gap in our knowledge on the composition and growth of the biotechnology firm and industry. Previous investigations into biotechnology have generally focused on either the scientific or business components and have ignored the inter-disciplinarity forces at play in biotechnology, particularly the overlap between the science and business agendas that lead to either complementarity or competition between these agendas. Understanding and accounting for this relationship is necessary for advancing biotechnology theory and practice, as it is within this nexus that firms derive their competitive advantage and find solutions to their technological and business challenges. Recognising the need to understand this relationship, I sought to encapsulate all the components of biotechnology by mimicking its dyadic design. A dual science-business PhD, an inter-faculty project combining the Institute for Molecular Bioscience and UQ Business School, presented an opportunity to explore the intricate networks and embedded knowledge that lie within the important science-business relationship. But devising a means to incorporate all the science and business components of biotechnology under a single PhD project posed a number of problems. The most enduring and pertinent problem was finding and maintaining a link between the two disciplines so that the thesis presented a coherent story. The solution was found in my science supervisor&#146;s startup biotechnology company Kalthera. Kalthera became the reference point for analysis in a multiple-case, longitudinal, crossnational study. The case-study research examined the development of ten biotechnology firms from Australia, USA, Canada, England and Switzerland in depth over two-years. To ensure credibility, transferability, dependability and conformability of the data generated, the companies ranged in maturity, geographical location, size and market focus. Throughout the study I sought to capture the various developmental changes and challenges these firms encountered as they progressed along their development paths. Kalthera was also the focus of the scientific research. The scientific laboratory-based research component of the thesis was aimed at developing and enhancing Kalthera&#146;s proprietary technology, cyclic cystine knots (CCK). Kalthera is using cyclotides (cyclopeptides), naturally occurring plant-derived peptides that contain this fascinating CCK motif, to develop a novel class of human therapeutics. Cyclotides offer the opportunity to combine the specificity and potency of peptides with the stability and bioavailability of traditional small molecule drugs. To develop the CCK technology, the plasticity, that is how amenable the CCK motif is to variations in the amino acid sequence, and the structure-activity relationships, that is how structure affects function, of the cyclotide framework must be understood. Chapter 2 presents a detailed analysis of Viola odorata, a plant previously shown to contain cyclotides. In this analysis, 13 novel cyclotides are characterised, contributing an additional 1/5th to the total number of cyclotides characterised prior to the study. The study also solves the structure of cycloviolacin O14, tests the haemolytic activity of four novel cyclotides, and the resistance to proteolysis of twelve novel cyclotides. This structure-activity analysis shows that some loops, such as loop 2, of cyclotides are extremely amenable to variations in amino acid sequence but that biological activity is affected by these changes. The relationship between hydrophobicity and haemolytic activity is also explored. During the analysis of V. odorata the first example of a naturally occurring linear cyclotide was discovered. Described in Chapter 3, an analysis of the linear cyclotide violacin A shows that the stability and structure of cyclotides is a consequence of the cystine knot, rather than the cyclic peptide backbone. Structure determination of violacin A reveals that the loop 2&#150;loop 5 hydrophobic patch, common to cyclotides and thought to be implicated in membrane binding, can become flexible by the presence of positive charged residues in loop 2. Given the recent interest in linear cystine knot peptides such as Ecballium elaterium trypsin inhibitor-II (EETI-II) in drug design, the discovery of a naturally occurring linear cyclotide offers exciting opportunities in drug design and development. Chapter 4 presents the results of a field trip where 14 Hawaiian plants were collected and analysed. From the field trip seven new Rubiaceae plant species were discovered to contain cyclotides, and these plants were shown to contain upwards of 38 novel cyclotides. The data suggest that the distribution of cyclotides in the Rubiaceae may not be as sparse as previously thought. Using the fundamental knowledge gathered from the work presented in the previous chapters, Chapter 5 presents two different approaches for developing commercial outcomes for the CCK technology. Firstly, a novel cyclotide-epitope grafted drug, targeting a viral oncogene implicated in activating a range of cancers, was designed and developed. The second drug design approach was aimed at improving our understanding of how cyclotides exhibit their anti-HIV activity. This work provides the foundation for future studies aimed at improving the anti-HIV therapeutic index of cyclotides. As a link between the science and business studies, Chapter 6 explores the relationship between the scientific community and society. This chapter examines the causes of the communication failings and describes the various effects on the scientific community and on society. The chapter discusses how it is not only commercial science that is affected by society&#146;s emotions, but also academic science, as much of the funding that supports academic science comes from the government, society&#146;s representative. Chapters 7 and 8 constitute the formal business component of the thesis. They report on the results of a two year multiple case study that found that the development of new biotechnology firms (NBFs) critically hinges on effective resource organisation, recognition and utilisation of core competencies, the readiness and capacity of the organisation to learn and adapt to change, the management of the science and business agendas, and the ability to refocus these over time to reflect the changing internal and external environments. From this information, and as described in Chapter 8, an ideal growth model that describes the optimal combination of an NBF&#146;s components is presented. This model can be thought of as a growth framework for biotechnology practitioners. In conclusion, this thesis is a &#147;living&#148; example of the inter-disciplinarity in biotechnology. Not only are the difficulties and opportunities associated with the inter-disciplinarity encapsulated in the content and processes that formed the foundation of the thesis, but the results constitute data that may equally impact scientific and business fields. Finally, the findings in this thesis have contributed to a better understanding of the relationship between structure and activity in biotechnology, using cyclotides and NBFs as examples of science and business perspectives respectively.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158815</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eclecticism in the Music of Ant&#244;nio Carlos Jobim: A Consideration of Stylistic Diversity</field><field name="creator">Freeman, Peter Ashley</field><field name="description">Antonio Carlos Jobim has been called the greatest of all the contemporary Brazilian songwriters&#151;the &amp;quotGershwin&amp;quot of Brazil. Like Gershwin, he wrote both popular and serious music and was a skilled piano player. His songs have made a lasting impression worldwide to the extent that many are now standards of the popular music repertoire. Jobim was also attracted to languages&#151;not only did he write the lyrics to many of his songs in his native Brazilian/Portuguese, but he showed a command and love of English, particularly its musical Anglo-Saxon sounds. Jobim's profound melodic and lyrical sensibility was enhanced and complemented by his inventive and peculiar harmonic idiom. This idiom, not the norm in either popular music or jazz, is characterised by dissonant and highly coloured chords that sound entirely natural and fit effortlessly into a personalised musical context. &amp;quotTom&amp;quot Jobim, as he was called by his friends, was trained in classical music and was well acquainted with the works of Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Debussy, Ravel, Stravinsky and the techniques of the twentieth-century serialist composers. His most important musical influence, however, was Heitor Villa-Lobos, whose works combined influences from classical, native Indian, folk and popular Brazilian styles. In the early 1960s, Jobim became the most important identity in the creation of the new, internationally recognised, popular music style called &amp;quotbossa nova.&amp;quot As well as this, Jobim's musical works reveal a wide range of stylistic influences: from French Impressionism, samba rhythms from Rio de Janeiro and Bahia, twelve-tone serialism and American Tin Pan Alley songs, to popular Brazilian music composers like Pixinguinha, Ary Barroso and Dorival Caymmi. His success as a popular music composer is so well recognised that many of his songs form the heart of the &amp;quotLatin&amp;quot jazz music repertoire and have been recorded by such celebrities as Frank Sinatra, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz and Sarah Vaughan. Jobim also composed larger-scale orchestral works such as Sinfonia do Rio de Janeiro (1954), and Brasilia: Sinfonia da Alvorada (1960), as well as film scores and other orchestral pieces, such as the tone poem Saudade do Brasil (1975). This thesis examines a selection of Jobim's most important songs and instrumental pieces and attempts to elucidate not only the many musical influences that formed his musical output, but also the stylistic peculiarities that were as much the product of a gifted composer as of the rich musical environment and heritage that were so much a part of his life.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158187</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The R&#244;le of Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2 in Alzheimer&#146;s Disease</field><field name="creator">Scott, Heather Anne</field><field name="description">Region- and cell-specific neuronal loss is a major hallmark of Alzheimer&#146;s disease (AD) brains. The pattern of damage is not distributed uniformly, so that distinct regions of the AD brain can be classified as either affected or spared. The mechanism responsible for the regional specificity of pathology has yet to be resolved. Cell loss is particularly severe in glutamatergic neurones of the hippocampus and neocortex. Glutamate is the major mediator of excitatory signals in the mammalian brain. Uptake of released transmitter by the major glial glutamate transporter, excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2), is necessary for terminating glutamate transmission, preventing excitotoxicity by over-excitation of neurones, and inhibiting cross-talk from neighbouring neurones. The focus of this project was to determine if quantitative or qualitative changes in EAAT2 might provide a basis for the regional loss of neurones in the AD brain. To this end, a targeted, discovery-based approach was utilized to determine the sequence of EAAT2 splice variants present in the adult human brain. Several known and two previously unknown transcripts were cloned and sequenced. The known variants cloned from human brain were the C-terminal variant, EAAT2b, and a variant lacking exon 7, EAAT2&#916;7. Two novel transcripts were found that lack both exon 7 and 9 with either the wild-type C-terminus, EAAT2&#916;7&#916;9, or the known alternative C-terminus, EAAT2b&#916;7&#916;9. This represents the first time exon-skipping splicing events have been demonstrated in EAAT2b. To determine the proportion of these variants in normal and disease states, a Real Time RT-PCR assay using SYBR&#174; green technology was developed. EAAT2, EAAT2b, EAAT2&#916;7, and EAAT2&#916;9 were measured in four areas of 37 human brains (15 control, 12 AD, and 10 AD with Lewy body dementia). Pilot assays of the double exon-skipping variants showed very low expression, therefore they were not included in the broader study. Four brain regions were chosen according to their pathological relevance to AD. Susceptible regions included the inferior frontal cortex and inferior temporal cortex; relatively spared regions included the posterior motor and occipital cortices. Overall, there was a significant reduction in total EAAT2 mRNA expression for both neurodegenerative disease groups compared with controls. The main finding of this study was that lower expression of EAAT2 message in AD cases occurred in both affected and spared regions. This was contrary to the hypothesis proposed. This indicates that loss of EAAT2 is not the primary cause of the regional loss of neurones in AD. However, splice variant expression displayed regional selectivity, with lower levels of exon-skipping variants in spared regions, higher expression of exon-skipping variants in affected regions, and the loss of the functional variant in the inferior temporal cortex of AD cases. Changes in the relative expression of exon-skipping EAAT2 variants indicate that the amount of functional glutamate transport may be regulated in a complex manner by the presence of alternative EAAT2 mRNAs that do not bind glutamate. Division of neurodegenerative disease cases by region based on pathological scoring demonstrated an increase in EAAT2 expression with increasing pathological severity, suggesting that the relative increase of EAAT2 mRNA in AD susceptible regions is a neuroprotective response to the dispersal of glutamate that occurs during neuronal loss. Further analysis detected variations in the pattern of exon-skipping splice variant expression according to APOE genotype and neurodegenerative disease type. This suggests that genetic susceptibility can influence glutamate transport and/or expression and may delineate a subtype of AD. Overall, the Real Time RT-PCR study indicated that alternative splicing is an endogenous mechanism of regulation, and that each variant can be individually controlled in a regional and disease-specific manner. To determine the consequences of differences in exon-skipping transcript levels, EAAT2 variants were expressed in Xenopus l&#230;vis o&#246;cytes. Two-electrode voltage clamp studies revealed a negative effect of EAAT2&#916;7, EAAT2&#916;9, and EAAT2&#916;7&#916;9 on wild-type glutamate uptake. This effect varied in strength and in the shapes of the dose-response curves. This may be due to the different functional residues that each variant lacks. The ability of mRNA splice variants to alter protein trafficking and/or function represent an emerging mechanism for regulating glutamate uptake. In contrast to EAAT2&#916;7, EAAT2&#916;9 was able to form homomultimers and insert into the plasma membrane of Xenopus l&#230;vis o&#246;cytes, indicating that the ability to form multimers is an important signal for forward trafficking from the ER. A discovery-based proteomics project was undertaken to search for the protein variants of EAAT2 that occur in human brain. This produced many proteins of interest that were EAAT2-immunoreactive and varied in size and isoelectric charge, but this could not be verified by peptide mass fingerprinting due to technical considerations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158814</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attributional style and attributions for child and parenting behaviour: assessment and intervention with parents at-risk of child maltreatment</field><field name="creator">Pidgeon, Aileen Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a program of research investigating the role of parental attributions in the management of parents with anger management problems who are atrisk of child maltreatment. Child maltreatment is a major social and health issue that is associated with significant costs for the individual child, his or her family and society. In Australia, all major indicators of child abuse have increased each year for the past six years, including child abuse notifications; substantiated abuse cases; children on care and protection orders; and the number of children in out-of-home care (AIHW, 2005). There is increasing focus on furthering our understanding of the aetiology connected with child maltreatment and on reducing risk factors associated with child maltreatment. Parental anger and parental dysfunctional attributions associated with parentchild interactions have been implicated as important risk factors for child maltreatment. These dysfunctional attributions for child behaviour and negative parenting behaviour and their affects on parental anger and parenting behaviour are the focus of this thesis. The present research aimed to (a) identify and assess the types of parental attributions that may intensify and perpetuate parental anger and anger-related behaviour; (b) examine the differences in the attributions clinically angry and at-risk of child maltreatment (CA) parents, and non-angry, not at-risk of child maltreatment (NA) parents make for parent-child interactions; and (c) evaluate the effectiveness of an enhanced behavioural family intervention, Pathways Triple P that aimed to reduce CA parents maladaptive attributions, anger and other key risk factors for child maltreatment, compared to a standard behavioural family intervention, Group Triple P. This program of research employed an attributional-behavioural model of child maltreatment to identify key risk factors involved in the precipitation, exacerbation and perpetuation of parents' anger and anger-related behaviour. This attributional-behavioural model of child maltreatment hypothesised that the types of attributions parents make during parent-child interactions intensify their anger and justify their negative parenting behaviour. Two attribution measures were developed for this research to assess parents' anger-intensifying and anger justifying attributions. Study 1 examined the differences between the attributions CA parents and NA parents make for parent-child interactions, and the differences between other key risk factors associated with child maltreatment, including parental adjustment, parenting practices, and perceptions of disruptive child behaviour problems. The 82 families with a child aged between 2-7 years who participated consisted of 41 CA mothers and 41 NA mothers. As predicted, there were significant differences between the CA and NA mothers' anger-intensifying attributional style for both negative and ambiguous negative child behaviour, with the CA mothers reporting an elevated level of anger-intensifying attributional style. In accordance with predictions CA mothers, compared to NA mothers, reported being more likely to attribute blame to their child for their own negative parenting behaviour and that the reason for their behaviour was unlikely to change. The study revealed significant group differences on all remaining key risk factors with CA mothers compared to NA mothers reporting significantly higher levels of negative affect, use of dysfunctional parenting practices, and more problem child behaviours. Study 2 examined the efficacy of an enhanced behavioural intervention, Pathways Triple P with CA mothers. Ninety-three CA parents with a child-aged 2-7 years were randomly assigned to either an enhanced group-administered behavioural family intervention program based on the Triple P - Positive Parenting Program that incorporated attributional retraining and anger management, Pathways Triple P, or a standard behavioural family intervention program, Group Triple P, that provided training in parenting skills alone. This Study revealed that both the Group Triple P program and the Pathways Triple P program were powerful tools for change in the selected population of families at-risk for child maltreatment. At post-intervention and follow-up both conditions were associated with lower levels of observed and parent-reported disruptive child behaviour, lower levels of parent-reported dysfunctional parenting, improvement in parental anger, adjustment, unrealistic expectations and potential for child abuse. Families receiving the enhanced behavioural family intervention showed significantly greater improvements on two key indicators of abuse potential both in the short and long term. Mothers who received the Pathways Triple P showed a significant reduction in their level of anger-intensifying attributional style for both negative and ambiguous negative child behaviour and significantly lower child-blame attributions for negative parenting behaviour from pre to post intervention, with evidence of maintenance to follow-up. The specific targeting of parents' attributions was successful in reducing mothers' anger-intensifying and anger-justifying attributions for parent-child interactions. Mothers in the EBFI group not only reported a significant decrease in the tendency to blame and attribute malintent to children for negative child behaviour but also reported a significant decrease in the tendency to blame children for negative parenting behaviour. This generalised shift for mothers to make more benign attributions for their children's negative and ambiguous negative behaviours and to make less child blaming attributions for negative parenting behaviour showed that the cognitive mechanism hypothesised to shift in angry parents did change in the predicted direction. Participants in both conditions reported comparably high levels of consumer satisfaction with their respective interventions. However, mothers in the EBFI group reported that the attributional retraining session as the most useful of the 12 sessions in the EBFI intervention. Contrary to prediction, only one family in the SBFI condition received contact with child protection services for notification for child maltreatment in the follow-up period. Previous research into interventions for parents at-risk of child maltreatment has indicated that standard behavioural family interventions might not sufficiently meet the complex needs of these families. The results of this present study support this assertion to some degree. As has been noted previously, the EBFI condition was associated with significantly greater improvements on key risk factor for child maltreatment, namely measures of anger-intensifying and anger-justifying attributions for parent-child interactions compared with SBFI. Although at post-intervention SBFI families had also improved significantly on many measures, the differences between conditions on the attributional measures were maintained from post-intervention to follow-up. This thesis provides important new information regarding the differences in clinically angry parents at-risk of child maltreatment (CA) and non-angry parents not atrisk of child maltreatment (NA) attributional processes for child negative behaviour and negative parenting behaviour. It represents an important contribution in the development of two attributional measures the PACBM and the PAM that discriminate between CA and NA parents. This present thesis also extends the limited empirical base of BFI as an intervention for child maltreatment (Wekerle &amp; Wolfe, 1993) and provides evidence for two variants of BFI (Group Triple P and Pathways Triple P) being associated with a range of positive changes in parental risk factors linked to child maltreatment. An important finding was that the Pathways Triple P intervention produced more changes more expeditiously and more consistently across the full spectrum of child measures, parents' cognitive, affective and parenting behaviour measures. A strength of the present study was the utilisation of a robust, standard-care comparison condition which provided not only a creditable test for the additive benefits of the enhanced intervention but also provided the CA mothers immediate intervention with a credible treatment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380105 Social and Community Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158188</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From the birdcage to the concert stage: the image transformation of the Boehm flute With reference to works by Fran&#231;ois Borne, Claude Debussy, Gabriel Faur&#233; and Jacques Ibert</field><field name="creator">Healy, Kristine Anne</field><field name="description">The transverse flute experienced an accelerated rise in prominence in the final quarter of the nineteenth century and through the twentieth century. During this period the flute &#147;evolved from imitating the birds to imitating the human voice&#148; (Toff, The Flute Book 256), and as a result of its expanded expressive capabilities, eventually attained an &#147;independent musical identity&#148; (257). While the flute was an ideal virtuoso vehicle through the Romantic era, its reputation declined markedly as the importance of the orchestra increased in the late 1800s (Powell 143). Nonetheless, by the turn of the twentieth century the silver Boehm flute sonority was being lent significant credibility by artists such as Debussy and Ravel. This kind of specialist attention played an important role in the evolution of the flute player as recitalist, concerto soloist and interpreter of works written idiomatically for the modern instrument. This critical commentary outlines the multi-faceted evolution of the Boehm flute utilising four different examples of flute solo repertoire as points of reference: Fran&#231;ois Borne's (1840-1920) Carmen: Fantaisie brillante pour fl&#251;te et piano, Fantasie by Gabriel Faur&#233; (1845-1924), Claude Debussy&#146;s (1862-1918) Syrinx for solo flute and the Concerto for Flute and Orchestra by Jacques Ibert (1890-1962). The objective of the discussion is simply to establish in the reader an understanding of the changing role of the flute in the chosen works and to illuminate some sections of the long road that the flute and its champions travelled in order to validate its status as a respected solo instrument.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158189</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE EFFECT OF INFESTATION WITH THE AUSTRALIAN PARALYSIS TICK, IXODES HOLOCYCLUS, ON THERMOREGULATION AND RESPIRATION IN THE DOG</field><field name="creator">Fearnley, Cecily</field><field name="description">Tick paralysis is a disease prevalent along the eastern seaboard of Australia affecting an estimated 20 000 domestic animals each year. The disease is caused by adult female Ixodes holocyclus secreting toxin while feeding on the host. Early investigations of the disease relied mainly on observations of affected animals with naturally acquired disease. More recently, specific investigations of experimentally induced and naturally acquired disease has elucidated the effect of the toxin on the neuromuscular and cardiovascular systems. The toxin has been demonstrated to cause temperature-dependent skeletal muscle paralysis and cardiac dysfunction. Extrapolation of these findings to the treatment of dogs with tick paralysis has lead to the active cooling of animals and the awareness that pulmonary oedema may be a feature of respiratory dysfunction. The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of the tick toxin and treatment practices on thermoregulation and to classify and investigate possible causes of the respiratory dysfunction. Thermoregulation was investigated in dogs before and after the onset of paralysis by the measurement of rectal, oesophageal and skin gradient temperatures. The technique of measuring the skin temperature gradient of the hind limb to determine the presence of vasodilation was established. Respiratory dysfunction of dogs with tick paralysis was classified into three distinct respiratory patterns based on respiratory rate and character. TI and TE, oxygen saturation, expired carbon dioxide and audible and auscultated respiratory sounds of the upper and lower respiratory tract were measured. The response of each respiratory pattern to breathing a mixture of helium and oxygen was also determined. Rectal and oesophageal temperatures decreased with the progression of paralysis with oesophageal temperature being significantly lower than rectal temperature in the later stage of the disease. Thermoregulation was compromised by the inability to conserve heat, by vasoconstriction, and the inability to generate heat, by shivering and muscle movement. Vasodilation, as measured by skin temperature gradient of the hind limb, increased as paralysis progressed, despite the presence of low oesophageal temperature to stimulate vasoconstriction. The very nature of appendicular paralysis limited limb muscle tone and movement to generate heat. The decrease in muscle tone was assessed by the ability to shiver, which was lost as paralysis progressed, though the two stimuli for shivering, low skin temperature and low oesophageal temperature, were present. With the decrease in limb movement, movement of other muscle groups in the generation of heat increased in importance. In dogs with severe respiratory dysfunction, movement of the respiratory muscles, as identified by respiratory rate, was a key factor in influencing rectal temperature. Hydration of the coat in dogs with severe paralysis and body weight and body surface area in dogs with mild paralysis appeared to also influence thermoregulation. Respiratory dysfunction in dogs with tick paralysis is well documented with a number of suggested causes. Tachypnea has recently been attributed to pulmonary oedema resulting from cardiac dysfunction, and packed cell volume percentages in dogs with rapid respiratory rates in this investigation support that hypothesis. In this study, respiratory dysfunction was classified into three patterns; slow, deep respiration, rapid, shallow respiration and rapid, deep respiration. The first two patterns were present in dogs with no inspiratory crackles, and all three respiratory patterns occurred in dogs with inspiratory crackles. Grunts and stridors, which have been previously reported as common features of tick paralysis, were either absent or uncommon, while sighs were associated with slow, deep respiration. Inspiratory time (corrected for respiratory rate) was prolonged in dogs with marked bradypnea and tachypnea signifying the imminent development of or the presence of respiratory muscle fatigue. Decreased oxygen saturation was a feature of all of the respiratory patterns while expired carbon dioxide levels were below the level signifying hypoventilation. Auscultated respiratory sounds were influenced by respiratory effort and the presence of alveolar disease. The effect of breathing a helium-oxygen mixture on the breathing patterns was assessed. Respiratory effort, inspiratory and expiratory times (corrected for respiratory rate), oxygen saturation, expired carbon dioxide, audible and auscultated respiratory sounds, rectal temperature and gait score were measured. The response to breathing a less dense gas, by assessing the change in respiratory effort, demonstrated the presence of respiratory muscle fatigue in dogs with a slow, deep respiratory pattern. The administration of Heliox to dogs with a rapid, shallow respiratory pattern was beneficial in some individuals but further study of a larger number of dogs is required to determine its importance in this respiratory presentation. Changes in audible and auscultated respiratory sounds were due to the change in the density of inspired gas. Inspiratory and expiratory times, oxygen saturation, expired carbon dioxide levels, rectal temperature and gait score were either minimally or not affected. The response to breathing the heliumoxygen mixture in dogs with inspiratory crackles, was variable and its detrimental effect in two dogs warrants caution in its use in such cases. Important clinical and therapeutic implications regarding thermoregulation and respiratory dysfunction can be drawn from this study. Clinicians need to be aware that thermoregulation may become compromised as the disease progresses. The inability to conserve heat by vasoconstriction of arteriovenous anastomoses and to generate heat by muscle movement of the limbs and shivering results in a decrease in core temperature that is not accurately reflected by rectal temperature measurement. Common nursing practices such as bathing animals and administration of vasodilator drugs can exacerbate the situation. As hypothermia mimics and compounds the clinical signs of tick paralysis, hypothermia may go undetected and contribute to mortality. The development and change in respiratory dysfunction can be easily categorised by respiratory rate and character into three distinct patterns to aid therapeutic decisions and alert the clinician to response to therapy. Respiratory muscle fatigue was demonstrated in dogs with slow, deep respiration and resting of the respiratory muscles by administrating Heliox was shown to be beneficial in these cases.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158813</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of the physical fertility of bauxite residue with different textural and structural conditions</field><field name="creator">Buchanan, Simon James</field><field name="description">Bauxite mining and alumina processing in Gove, northern Australia, produces residues that contain significant quantities of sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and sodium aluminate, making the material highly alkaline, saline, and sodic. In an untreated condition these residues are incapable of supporting plant growth, and if left exposed and unstabilised they are highly susceptible to wind and water erosion, presenting a hazard to both man and the environment. Covering these wastes, preferably with vegetation that is native to the area, is therefore considered desirable. The current method of dry stacking bauxite residue necessitates separation into fine grained red mud (RM) and coarse grained residue sand (RS). Adverse chemical properties of RM inhibit plant growth, but moderately successful plant growth has been obtained in ameliorated (seawater neutralised/freshwater leached) RS, where the limitations are largely associated with water stress during the post-monsoon dry season. The water storage capacity of RS can be improved by increasing its fines content, but this can have a detrimental impact on other physical properties of the bauxite residue that are important for vegetative growth. This project aims to determine what effect increasing the fines content of RS has on the physical properties of bauxite residues, by assessing the suitability of various mixtures of RS and RM for supporting plant growth. Two distinctly different textured bauxite residues dominated by silt (RMsilt) and clay (RMclay) particles, were separated from RM by sedimentation and then ameliorated to reduce pH 1:5 to 8.8, electrical conductivity 1:5 &lt; 412 &#181;Scm-1, and Na + &lt; 28 cmolckg-1. The RMsilt and RMclay materials were then added to RS at different ratios to create a range of clay (RS/RMclay) dominated mixtures; silt (RS/RMsilt) dominated mixtures; plus an equivalently textured RM. The effect of texture and structure on plant available water capacity (PAWC), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), and penetration resistance (Pr) was assessed. Structure of puddled mixtures was altered using both crushing (&lt; 2 mm) to simulate thorough tillage, and wetting and drying cycles for consolidation. The PAWC of bauxite residue was not significantly improved until fines content (silt + clay) was increased from 6 % in RS, to 39 % and 62 % in the RS/RMclay and RS/RMsilt mixtures respectively. Increasing the fines content of RS altered the void ratios of the mixtures, changing the pore size distribution from being dominated by large micro-pores in coarse mixtures to be dominated by smaller micro-pores in finer mixtures, which resulted in negligible change in PAWC of coarser textures. Crushing and consolidation increased water storage at potentials of -0.1 to -10 kPa, with negligible effect on PAWC and water storage at lower water potentials. The PAWC of puddled RM was not greater than that of RS, but in crushed RM the PAWC was twice that of RS. The Ksat of mixtures tended to decrease as fines content increased, but increased with level of disturbance. In puddled mixtures Ksat was lowest (mean 0.52 mmh-1) and whilst not shown to be significant, Ksat seemed to be closely associated to packing density and void characteristics of the mixtures. Subjecting puddled materials to successive weathering cycles caused the samples to expand and crack increasing the Ksat of over half the textures by more than an order of magnitude. Crushing increased Ksat of all samples as water movement was no longer restricted to smaller inter-particle voids, but instead capable of moving through larger cracks and around secondary particles and aggregates. Wetting and drying of these crushed samples caused consolidation of particles, reducing Ksat due to the increased tortuousity. A quantitative measure of Ksat after wetting and drying cycles was not able to be attained in these experiments due to insufficient sample size. In puddled mixtures the penetrability at field capacity and wilting point was affected by packing of particles, wherein Pr increased with decreasing void ratio. Increasing the fines content of RS by only a small amount (13-15 %) resulted in a more than 6 fold increase in Pr of puddled mixtures. The Pr of all puddled mixtures other than RS was much higher than the penetrability considered highly restrictive to root elongation (2.0 MPa). This was substantially lower (up to 96%) in the crushed treatments, regardless of texture, and considered favorable to root growth, which suggests that a vital criterion for successful vegetation growth in neutralised bauxite residues is the breaking up of the massive structure. This work concluded that through drying and crushing is a prerequisite for plant growth in bauxite residues and that improvements in soil water availability are only identifiable in the RS when the fines content is increased substantially. To achieve successful plant establishment and sustainable vegetation cover it is recommended that deep ripping and thorough cultivation of puddled bauxite residues be carried out initially prior to propagation in order to improve water infiltration, reduce erodability, and facilitate root elongation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158190</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Between Movements of Crisis and Movements of Affluence: An analysis of the campaign against the Jabiluka uranium mine, 1997-2000</field><field name="creator">Paasonen, Karl-Erik</field><field name="description">The dissertation examines the internal dynamics of the campaign against a uranium mine at Jabiluka in the Northern Territory of Australia, 1997-2000. That campaign was at the time the largest social movement campaign in Australia in some two decades. It was established by an alliance between an Aboriginal traditional owner group, the Mirarr, and national environmental organisations. The campaign attracted thousands of participants, both in a lengthy blockade near the minesite and also in a network of local action groups spread across the country. Even though all participants had a clear common goal &#150; opposing the mine - the internal dynamics of the campaign were beset with vociferous and often bitter conflict. In the course of this conflict, while the initial alliance was able to maintain its cohesion, the national network underwent a process of schism. I argue that the internal conflict can be explained by drawing a distinction between a &#145;movement of crisis&#146; and a &#145;movement of affluence&#146;. A &#145;movement of crisis&#146; is one shaped by imminent and direct cultural or physical threat, and where the outcome of the struggle is of great importance. In this case, the movement of crisis was the Aboriginal community involved, the Mirarr. A &#145;movement of affluence&#146; is one shaped by no such threat. In the case of Jabiluka, the vast bulk of the campaign participants &#150; members of environmental groups, blockaders, members of urban activist networks &#150; constituted the movement of affluence, in that participants had greater latitude for choice and preference, since outcomes affected them directly to a far lesser degree, if at all. The internal dynamics are examined ii through the prism of Alberto Melucci&#146;s breakdown of collective identity into three dimensions: understandings regarding ends, means, and context. The dissertation breaks new ground in two ways. Firstly, it is the first extensive examination of the Jabiluka campaign, and therefore adds to the body of knowldege of Australian social movements. Secondly, it is unique in using the distinction between crisis and affluence to describe internal dynamics, and as such it expands the set of theoretical tools available for analysis of internal dynamics and schism.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158812</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robo and Slit have an axon guidance role in the embryonic vertebrate brain.</field><field name="creator">Devine, Christine Ann</field><field name="description">During development, neurons extend axons which follow highly stereotypic pathways to form a template for the development of a functional nervous system. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms which drive navigational decisions in the growth cone, primarily through detailed analysis of commissural axon guidance at the midline. Despite this, the molecular cues which contribute to the precise formation of the early axon scaffold in the embryonic vertebrate brain remain poorly defined. The Roundabout (Robo) family of axon guidance receptors and their ligand (Slit) have been demonstrated to play important roles in the regulation of midline crossing decisions and patterning of longitudinal axon pathways in the Drosophila central nervous system. In addition, three Robo receptors are known to be expressed in the vertebrate nervous system (Robo1, Robo2 and Robo3), where they have been implicated in the guidance of axons in the spinal cord and retinal pathway. In this thesis, the highly stereotypic and well-defined development of the zebrafish brain has been utilised to understand the role of the Robo family of axon guidance receptors in the development of the early scaffold of axon tracts in the embryonic vertebrate brain. The expression of each of the Robo receptors (Robo1, Robo2 and Robo3) and two candidate ligands (Slit1a and Slit2) were initially characterised with respect to the developing axon scaffold. All were found to be expressed in the brain during the period of axon outgrowth, in both unique and overlapping domains. The specific roles of each of these receptors and ligands were assessed using a morpholino knock down approach. These analyses revealed that both Robo and Slit have important roles in the development of the major longitudinal tract in the forebrain, the tract of the post-optic commissure (TPOC), as well as in some dorsoventral tracts in zebrafish forebrain, most notably, the supra-optic tract (SOT). In subsequent chapters (Chapters 4 and 5), a combinatorial knock down approach was utilised to investigate in greater detail the function of the Robo family of receptors in both the SOT and TPOC. Importantly, these studies identified two key mechanisms by which Robo-Slit signalling can influence the accurate guidance of axons navigating in the developing brain. Firstly, Robo-Slit signalling was found to have a prominent role in shaping the normal trajectory of axons navigating in the SOT. Simultaneous knock down of all, or unique combinations of Robo receptors had a profound impact on both the normal pathfinding and fasciculation of axons in this tract. The axon guidance defects observed in the SOT were indicative of a requirement for Slit1a and Slit2 to channel SOT axons into their appropriate linear pathway; consistent with the &#145;surround repulsion model&#146; previously described with reference to the guidance of axons in the peripheral nervous system. Secondly, a novel regulatory network comprising members of the Robo family of axon guidance receptors was identified and shown to be essential for the guidance of axons navigating in the TPOC. Using a combinatorial loss-of-function approach, a requirement for Slit1a mediated Robo2 activity to split the TPOC into discrete fascicles in the ventrocaudal diencephalon was established. Importantly, this process was negatively regulated by Robo1 and Robo3, which functioned redundantly in the TPOC to attenuate Robo2 activity through interactions involving both their intracellular and extracellular domains. Taken together, this thesis demonstrates a requirement for Robo-Slit signalling to accurately guide axons navigating in key trajectories in the embryonic vertebrate brain. Furthermore, this study highlights an emerging theme in the field, that is, the importance of context-specific interactions between axon guidance molecules to direct the navigation of growing axons along complex pathways.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158191</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 1996 Olympic Games: Emotive Narrative and National Identity</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Andrea</field><field name="description">This project analyses the ways in which national representations inflect and account for discursive variations in the media texts of a specific global media event, in this instance, the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games. Watching and reading media representations of the Olympic Games is the only way most of us experience this international sporting event. Sports scholars have analysed the media&#146;s impact on the development and growth of sport worldwide and its representations of race and gender, but there has been little close analysis of sports commentary. The central questions posed by this dissertation are; what is the role of television commentators in creating the emotional tone and verbal narrative for the visual text, and how does the commentary convey information about national identity? What socio-linguistic tools are currently available to assist in such an analysis? Driven by these questions, this project extends and applies a development of Labovian theories of narrative structure, in particular the elements of orientation and evaluation. In Labov&#146;s original schema orientation covered basic information such as answers to who, when, what, and where? Orientation in this study includes these, as well as two additional types; orientation to audience clauses maintain a shared ground of communicative participation, and empathetic orientation clauses encourage an empathetic response. For Labov evaluation provides crucial points of assessment throughout a narrative and points the receiver towards a preferred reading. This study extends the concept of evaluation to include evaluations about the emotional impact of the spectacle. These elements of emotive address are included in an overall category of emotionally oriented language, as a contrast to the technically oriented language of sportscasting, the descriptive 'calling the play' clauses. This dissertation thus develops a socio-linguistic tool to analyse the interplay between technical information and emotive narrative within the commentary. This tool is then applied to texts from the Australian based Seven Network and the United Kingdom&#146;s British Broadcasting Corporation. The Opening and Closing Ceremony broadcasts are qualitatively analysed with reference to Dayan and Katz&#146;s theories about media events, but also in terms of orientation and evaluation. Acting in the Labovian sense as an abstract, the Opening Ceremony ritually creates the narrative significance of the sporting contests which follow, while the coda or Closing Ceremony enacts ritual closure and a return to everyday life. The sporting contests book-ended by these two ceremonies, the middle complicating actions and results, are imbricated in the Olympic Movement&#146;s philosophy of Olympism, enunciated during the Opening, and are represented from within specific media frames which work to create emotive identification with the nation. Two events are selected for comparative micro-analysis, the men&#146;s 1500m swimming final and the men&#146;s coxless pair rowing final, because in these events the two nations, Great Britain and Australia, battled for medals. A hypothesis that the Australian commentary was more emotional and nationalistic than the British commentary was tested, with the conclusions showing that assumptions about stereotypical British reserve were more likely to be explained by the lack of recent UK sporting success and media framing of these results, than a national disinclination for commentators to emote during live broadcasts. Within the overall analysis, however, specific modes of address, such as creating a phatic community, evaluations about the emotional impact of the spectacle, and technically oriented language did differ significantly between the two broadcast commentary teams, both in content and temporal placement. The excesses of the Australian broadcasts were in part explainable by the commercial Network context, but were also underpinned by the sustained achievements of Australian athletic-heroes on the global stage. An integral aspect of the commentary analysis is the personalisation and individualisation of the sporting hero within the event narrative. This thesis re-examines and extends notions of the sports hero within the context of national identity formation as supported by evidence collected from the texts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158811</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mediation of temperament by character in the prediction of workplace outcomes</field><field name="creator">O'Connor, Peter Joseph</field><field name="description">Dimensional models of personality have typically sought to explore personality structure principally from a descriptive perspective, and as such make for effective personality taxonomies. Fortunately, personality research is currently in transition, with researchers looking towards more complex, scientifically derived theories of personality in an attempt to learn about the biological and cognitive mechanisms underlying surface level personality dimensions. The purpose of the current research program was to test numerous structural models of the relationship between two bio-cognitive models of personality and indices of workplace behaviour. It was argued that Cloninger, Svrakic and Przybeck&#146;s (1993) scales of personality can be modelled according to an approach/avoidance framework, and that character dimensions mediate temperament in the prediction of important workplace behaviours. It was also argued that Jackson&#146;s (2005) scales of personality can be modelled according to an approach framework, and that Goal Orientation mediates Sensation Seeking in the prediction of important workplace behaviours. Chapter 1 begins with a brief introduction to the study of personality from the trait perspective. This is followed by a brief overview of well known biological models of personality (e.g., Eysenck, 1967; Gray, 1982, 1987), leading to a more in depth discussion of both Cloninger et al.&#146;s (1993) and Jackson&#146;s (2005) models of personality. Cloninger et al.&#146;s (1993) model is comprehensively reviewed and critiqued, based on clinical, genetic, psychometric and neurological research. A complex, structural model of Cloninger&#146;s et al.&#146;s (1993) scales of personality is then proposed. It is argued that Cloninger et al.&#146;s dimensions can be modelled along an approach and avoidance theme, and that character mediates temperament in the prediction of important workplace behaviours. The introduction concludes with an overview of Jackson&#146;s (2005) model, and key similarities between Jackson&#146;s model and the proposed structural model of Cloninger et al.&#146;s dimensions are highlighted. The introduction focuses on justifying the proposed mediation between temperament and character in the prediction of workplace variables. Chapter&#146;s 2, 3 and 4 provide empirical tests of the key hypotheses outlined in the introduction. In chapter 2, an initial, basic test of Cloninger et al.&#146;s model was conducted, whereby the model was compared to the Big Five (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1985) in its ability to predict leadership emergence. It was found that a substantial portion of the variance in leadership emergence was trait based, and that that the multilevel model incorporating Cloninger et al.&#146;s (1993) dimensions provided the best fit. The purpose of chapter 3 was to assess the proposed structural model of Cloninger et al.&#146;s (1993) personality dimensions, and to assess the utility of the model in the prediction of workplace outcomes. The results of the two studies presented in this chapter were generally consistent with the proposed structure of Cloninger et al.&#146;s dimensions. Cloninger et al.&#146;s model was also found to significantly predict several workplace outcomes. In chapter 4, an alternative model of temperament and character was explored. Jackson&#146;s (2005) model suggests that Goal Orientation mediates Sensation Seeking in the prediction of functional behaviours (i.e. an approach pathway). In this chapter, two central components of the model were tested across two studies. Regression analyses in both studies generally supported the proposed model and were consistent with the theme that character mediates temperament in the prediction of workplace variables. A number of conclusions are made from this research. Firstly, it is argued that biological models of personality, particularly Cloninger et al.&#146;s and Jackson&#146;s have utility in the area of Organisational Psychology. It is argued that models of personality which recognise the differential influence of temperament and character are likely to lead to a number of accurate and interesting implications. Specifically, it is suggested that dimensions of character are more open to training and intervention than are temperament dimensions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158810</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The undead : an unnatural history of vampires and troublesome corpses in Western Europe from the medieval period to the twentieth century</field><field name="creator">Keyworth, Gordon David</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I undertake a multi-disciplinary survey and descriptive analysis of vampires and other types of undead-corpse in Europe from the medieval period to the twentieth century. Broadly speaking, the first three chapters of the thesis discuss the typology and folklore of vampires and undead-corpses, and so too the burial practices associated with such revenants. The remaining chapters delve into the etiological explanations for the existence of undead-corpses, the vampire infestations of the eighteenth century, the reasons for declining belief in walking-corpses thereafter, and the increasingly popular notion of astral vampirism in the nineteenth century. In the early eighteenth century, popular belief in the existence of undead-corpses was fuelled by numerous reports of vampire outbreaks across Eastern and Central Europe. In his Treatise on Vampires and Revenants (1746), Augustin Calmet argued that although there may have been troublesome undead-corpses and &#145;vestiges of vampirism&#146; in the past, the vampires of eighteenth-century Europe were inherently unique. In the first chapter of this thesis, I investigate Calmet&#146;s assertion and compare/contrast the distinguishing features of the various types of undead-corpse that supposedly existed in Europe from the medieval period to the Enlightenment, and argue that the outstanding characteristic of eighteenth-century vampires was their implied thirst for blood, and that the vampire is indeed a unique type of undead-corpse. In the second chapter, I assess to what extent undead-corpses like the vampire acquired the characteristics formerly attributed to other folkloric beings. Subsequently, I undertake a folkloric analysis of vampires and undead-corpses in Europe from the twelfth to the eighteenth century and compare/contrast their features with that of other folkloric entities like ghosts, incubi/succubi, witches and fairies. I demonstrate that a distinction can be made between the folkloric vampire and &#145;historical&#146; vampires of the eighteenth century like Arnod Paole. And argue that although medieval revenants were very corporeal beings, subsequent undead-corpses like the spectrum of sixteenth-century Silesia, and so too the vampire of folklore, took on a more semi-corporeal nature, indulged in all manner of supernatural activity and acquired many features formerly attributed to other folkloric beings. In the third chapter, however, I delve into the various burial practices associated with vampires and revenants, the prophylactic measures used against them, and the methods employed to dispatch the undead. I argue that the main reason for impaling vampires with a wooden stake and other such practices was simply to hasten the decomposition of the deceased, given that there was no guarantee that a corpse was actually dead until the flesh had rotted from the bones. In the next chapter, I discuss eschatological notions like Purgatory and excommunication, and argue that by the end of the seventeenth century, three main theological/metaphysical notions had developed to explain the existence of undeadcorpses. Firstly, undead-corpses were inhabited and enlivened by the actual soul of the deceased individual and empowered by some sort of remnant energy or vestigium vitae, which took on a life of their own until the body had decomposed and the remnant energy had dissipated. Secondly, it was the Devil that reanimated the corpse, rather than the deceased soul, in the same manner that the Devil could possess and manipulate a living body. Furthermore, necromancers could raise the dead through sorcery, albeit with demonic help. Thirdly, the Devil could create a semi-corporeal body of congealed air and appear in the guise of someone recently deceased in order to torment the living. I argue that it was the earthbound soul of the deceased that supposedly animated the vampires of the eighteenth-century. In the fifth chapter, I outline the socio-religious topography of the vampire outbreaks in eighteenth-century Europe and discuss the reactions of the Austro-Hungarian authorities, under whose jurisdiction the outbreaks occurred. Similarly, I discuss the response of the intelligentsia and the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, the state religion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to the vampire infestations. I demonstrate that official belief in undead-corpses had waned by the Enlightenment, and that the civil authorities were keen to enlighten and re-educate the populace, and initiated official investigations into further outbreaks of vampirism, and introduced legislative measures to eradicate such beliefs. In particular, I review the various natural explanations furnished by the educated elite at the time to account for vampires. I argue that it was difficult for the authorities and educated elite to eradicate belief in undead-corpses largely because the masses and lower echelons of the Church at the time were fuelled by a pre-modern belief-system that had itself promoted belief in revenants. In the final chapters, I note that although the occasional vampire outbreak still arose in nineteenth century Europe and undead-corpses were reputedly responsible for consumption in late nineteenth-century New England (USA), popular belief in walking corpses per se had largely ceased. Nonetheless, the rise of spiritualism, theosophy and popular occultism at the time encouraged a reinterpretation of the traditional vampire and fuelled the notion of &#145;astral&#146; vampires. Finally, I elaborate upon the importance of the vampire to our own lives and note that occasional belief in flesh-and-blood vampires still occurs today, and that a contemporary Vampire subculture has arisen of &#145;living&#146; individuals who claim to be the &#145;real&#146; vampires.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440207 Religion and Society</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158192</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactions between the PCH family protein Hof1p and Vrp1p/WIP (Wiskott- Aldrich Syndrome Protein interacting protein) in regulation of cell division and membrane transport</field><field name="creator">Ren, Gang</field><field name="description">In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, endocytosis comprises bulk uptake (fluids and membranes) and receptor-mediated internalisation (membrane proteins). Both processes require efficient actin filament assembly. Key factors that nucleate the assembly of actin filaments are the Arp2/3 complex and a number of NPFs (Nucleation Promoting Factors), which are responsible for temporal and spatial regulation of Arp2/3 activity. In yeast, in addition to Las17p, the orthologue of WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein), one type I unconventional myosin (Myo5p) exhibits strong NPF activity through coordination with the WH2 (WASP Homology 2) domain containing protein Vrp1p, the yeast orthologue of WIP (WASP Interacting Protein). Here, we identified another key Vrp1p domain (Hof One Trap/HOT), which binds directly to the SH3 domain of the cytokinesis protein Hof1p, is important for Vrp1p function in vivo. The key function of the Vrp1p HOT domain is to counteract the inhibitory effect of the Hof1p SH3 domain in Myo5p-stimulated actin assembly and endocytosis. We have also revealed a novel actin monomer binding domain (VH2) in Vrp1p, which is functionally redundant with the WH2 domain. Receptormediated endocytosis requires stable interaction of Vrp1p with Las17p. However, we find that bulk uptake of fluid and membrane takes place without Vrp1p-Las17p association and requires only functional WH2 and HOT domains of Vrp1p. Finally, we identified a number of other potential Hof1p SH3 domain interactors using an affinity isolation approach and compared this interaction profile with those of several other yeast SH3 domains. The unique Vrp1p-Hof1p interaction pattern allows us to gain insight into the pathology of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vrp1p</field><field name="subject">endocytosis</field><field name="subject">cytokinesis</field><field name="subject">Hof1p</field><field name="subject">WH2</field><field name="subject">HOT</field><field name="subject">SH3</field><field name="subject">VH2</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158809</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MEAN VELOCITY AND TURBULENCE MEASUREMENT IN A PULSED JET</field><field name="creator">Pratomo, Hariyo Priambudi Setyo</field><field name="description">An extensive investigation into a fully pulsed jet has been performed with a single wire hotwire anemometer operated in a constant temperature mode to study the influences of varying mean exit velocity of the jet and pulsing frequency on the velocity field and turbulence quantities. The results of radial profile test across the jet show that the pulsed jet is axisymmetric. The test of jet centerline location demonstrates that the jet follows a straight line trajectory to propagate downstream. From the axial measurements, it is shown that the pulsed jet behaves like a steady jet after the pulsation effects have diminished towards furthest downstream locations, hence the existence of two distinct regions namely the pulsed dominated region and the high turbulence steady jet region is proved. However, the existence of the two distinct regions is strongly dependent on the mean exit velocity and pulsing frequency. At a high mean exit velocity and a low pulsing frequency, the high turbulence steady jet region can not be identified displaying no transition region. Moreover, at high mean exit velocities with a constant pulsing frequency, the aggregate turbulence intensity decreases more slowly along the downstream positions. Amplifications of the root-mean-square level of centerline-aggregate turbulence associated with an increasing mean exit velocity contribute to this case. At higher pulsing frequencies with a constant mean exit velocity, the aggregate turbulence intensity decreases more rapidly along the downstream positions as a result of the attenuations of the root-mean-square level of centerline-aggregate turbulence. Skewness and flatness along the downstream positions depart from the symmetry value of 0 and Gaussian value of 3, respectively as the mean exit velocity increases with a constant pulsing frequency. At higher pulsing frequencies with a constant mean exit velocity, skewness and flatness become lower in which approach the symmetry value of 0 and Gaussian value of 3, respectively. From the radial measurements, at an increasing pulsing frequency with a constant mean exit velocity the radial profile of mean axial velocity becomes narrower. As the mean exit velocity is increased at a constant pulsing frequency, narrower radial profiles result. Also, the radial distribution of aggregate turbulence intensity has smaller levels as the pulsing frequency is increased at a constant mean exit velocity. As the jet propagates downstream the levels of radial distribution of the aggregate turbulence intensity across the jet reduce gradually. At a constant pulsing frequency, amplification of the root-mean-square level of aggregate turbulence occurs as the mean exit velocity is increased which leads to the higher levels of radial distribution of aggregate turbulence intensity. Moreover, the radial profile of relative turbulence energy becomes broader as the pulsing frequency is increased at a constant mean exit velocity. However, there is some evidence demonstrating the narrower radial profiles as the pulsing frequency increases. As the mean exit velocity is increased at a constant mean exit velocity, a broader radial profile is produced. The levels of triple-products across the jet reduce as the pulsing frequency is increased at a constant mean exit velocity but the levels increase as a result of an increasing mean exit velocity at a constant pulsing frequency. Skewness and flatness in the radial direction are relatively lower at an increasing pulsing frequency with a constant mean exit velocity whereas at an increasing mean exit velocity with a constant pulsing frequency their values become higher. Furthermore, the jet volume flow rate relative to that at the jet exit significantly reduces as the Reynolds number increases. The jet growth and normalized volume flow rates are found to be higher than that of steady jets even up to further downstream position associated with the broadening radial profiles of mean axial velocity. At the low mean exit velocity of 13.7 m/s, the jet growth and jet volume flow rate at the low pulsing frequency of 10 Hz are higher than those at the high pulsing frequency of 25 Hz. However, as compared with the jet growth and volume flow rate phenomena at the low mean exit velocity of 13.7 m/s, a striking issue appears at the high mean exit velocity of 34.4 m/s demonstrating that the jet growth and jet volume flow rate at the low pulsing frequency are lower than those at the high pulsing frequency.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158193</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">STUDY OF THE INFLUENCE OF INTERACTIVE DRAW UPON DRAWPOINT SPACING IN BLOCK AND SUBLEVEL CAVING MINES</field><field name="creator">Halim, Adrianus Erwin</field><field name="description">Over the last 10 years, the trend toward the mining of deeper, higher tonnage deposits, and lower grade orebodies have made caving mining methods (Block and Sublevel) increasingly attractive to the global mining industry. This is due to their low mining cost. During this period the scale of these caving operations has increased significantly. Block caves such as Northparkes in New South Wales and Palabora in South Africa, and the Sublevel cave at Ridgeway in New South Wales are examples of this trend. However, to achieve the low cost of these methods, all aspects must work properly. Therefore, it is essential to understand all of them to make a proper mine design. One of the key aspects is the gravity flow of broken ore and waste. This controls the amount of the ore recovered in the drawpoints along with the extent to which it is diluted by broken waste rock. The economics of a caving mine depend largely on this aspect. In addition, gravity flow also determines the spacing, and thus the number, of drawpoints required. This dictates the design of extraction horizon, which has a huge impact on capital requirement of the mine. Despite numerous researches having been carried out, the mechanism of gravity flow of broken ore and waste is still not well understood. In previous studies, numerical modelling has been carried out. However, most of them remain unvalidated. This was due to the unavailability of validation data. The best validation data should come from full scale marker tests. These tests are also the best method to investigate gravity flow of broken rock. However, these tests are tedious, very expensive and only produce site-specific results. Moreover, due to the nature of the mining method these tests so far have only been able to be carried out in Sublevel caving. Conducting such a test in a block caving mine is still considered not feasible, due to the fact that markers movement will be influenced by caving process, and the cost will be millions of dollars per test. The cost of carrying out such a test in a Sublevel caving mine is approximately $25,000 per test. Therefore, the only reliable method to investigate gravity flow is physical modelling. In fact, most of the theories about gravity flow have been derived from this kind of modelling, many of which are still being used. However, these theories were derived from sand models, which are considered inappropriate due to the disparity between them and insitu conditions, such as particle size and shape, friction angle, and stress distribution. Therefore, it was decided to use gravel as the model media. Gravel has much closer resemblance to insitu conditions than sand, which makes it ideal as a model media. Even though the dynamic similitude cannot be achieved, evidence from literature suggested that this would not impact the main results of the model, which is the geometry of draw envelopes, as long as the material is cohesionless, the model is large, and geometric similitude is achieved. As a result, the largest 3D physical model was constructed. This model was able to simulate geometries of current block and sublevel caving mines. Drawpoint spacing in this model could be varied, so its effect upon the gravity flow could be investigated. Also, for the first time, the movement envelope could be measured by extensometer like probes. This has produced a significant improvement in understanding gravity flow. Results from the physical modelling indicate that current theories used to design extraction horizon may not be accurate since they are largely based on an inappropriate model, i.e. sand model. The sand model has been found to lack similarities with insitu conditions such as an inability to measure extraction zone, unrealistic method of draw, unrealistic friction angle, unrealistic scaled particle size, unrealistic particle shape, and unrealistic stress distribution within the media (i.e. arching). The results also produce new findings about the gravity flow such as the fact that extraction zones do not overlap when the drawpoints are spaced at a distance less than the width of Isolated Extraction Zone (IEZ), but just touch and form a plane boundary, reduction of combined extraction zones in the same situation compared with the superimposed isolated ones, the centroid of both extraction and movement zones are deeper than previously thought, the drawpoint widths used by industry appear not to have an effect upon the width of the extraction zone, confirmation that both extraction and movement zones expand as the draw gets higher, the particle size appears not to have a distinct effect upon the width of the extraction zone, the particle size effect appears to be negligible in Sublevel caving mines, and the fact that flow in block caving is comparable with the one in Sublevel caving providing that the material within the blast ring is fully mobilized. A quantification of scale effect between two model scales is provided. There is no scale distortion between two model scales used in this thesis, 1:30 and 1:100. This quantification is better than previous work in this area, which made incorrect conclusion due to the lack of repetition of each model scale experiment. A quantification of scale effect between physical model and limited full scale data is provided. It indicates no scale distortion. However, since the full scale test data available is just up to 50m height of draw, more comparisons between model results and full scale trials at a greater height of draw than 50m are needed to confirm scalability for block caving mines. These results have led to significant new understandings about the influence of interactive draw upon drawpoint spacing in block and sublevel caving mines. The drawpoints must be spaced less than the width of Isolated Movement Zone (IMZ) at height of draw less than the ore column height. The results also conclude that more physical model experiments, other than described in this thesis, are required. This is due to the fact that due to its size, completing an experiment in this model took a long time, and due to the time and resource limitations, not all experiments considered appropriate for a complete understanding of gravity flow of broken rock could be completed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158194</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE USE OF SIMULATED FUTURE GRADE CONTROL DRILLING TO QUANTIFY UNCERTAINTY IN RECOVERABLE ORE RESERVES</field><field name="creator">Peattie, Richard John Reid</field><field name="description">Recoverable reserves are that portion of a mineral deposit that has been delineated by a mine plan to be economically minable. At time of prediction, recoverable reserves are estimated based on limited sampling information usually of a high quality into large panels. Subsequent to this, at the time of mining, additional information usually of a poorer quality is available allowing estimation into smaller blocks which are used in ultimate block selection. As recoverable reserve estimation is interested in the prediction of tonnages and grades that will be recovered at the time of mining, the main concern of recoverable reserve estimation is the imprecise selection of ore/waste as a result of the information and support effect. For the selection of a block as ore or waste during mining, a cut-off is usually considered where a block is considered as ore if its grade is greater than the cut-off or waste, if it falls below the cut-off. For perfect selection a cut-off needs to be applied to the real block grades however, as the real block grades are never known, more typically actual selection is employed where a cut-off is applied to the estimated block grades. In this case, the misclassification of blocks as ore or waste can take place as a result of information and support effect resulting in the incorrect selection of blocks. Block selection is at its best at this stage; prior to this during recoverable reserve estimation the potential for misclassification of blocks is far worse due to the reduced data densities existing with exploration drilling and difference in data quality between grade control and exploration sampling. Both of these factors impact on the information and support effect and therefore the ability to accurately select the correct blocks are ore or waste. In reconciling a mine plan it is important to make a distinction between deviations as a result of unpredictable dilution factors caused by mining and geotechnical factors and those factors such as the support and information effect that are predictable. We therefore assume free selection of the selective mining unit (SMU) where access and mining constraints are not taken into account. The widespread use of simulation for recoverable reserve estimation within the mining industry has been limited in the past due to limitations of computational speed and efficiency. This study demonstrates successfully a practical application for the simulating of recoverable reserves directly into SMU&#146;s using a direct block simulation method to overcome these problems. In this thesis, the methodology is demonstrated on the Morila gold deposit, which consists of a geologically defined ore zone within a low grade host rock. Here, the direct block simulation methodology is demonstrated in a production environment and assessed in terms of whether the technique would find general acceptance in the mining industry. The direct block simulation results where contrasted in this thesis to a uniform conditioning estimate demonstrating firstly that the direct block simulation approach is as accurate and as efficient as existing recoverable reserve estimation techniques utilized in the industry. Secondly, that the direct block simulation is a practical alternative to traditional recoverable reserve methods. Finally, that direct block simulation added value by providing additional information not provided by traditional recoverable reserve techniques through a measure of the uncertainty in the recoverable reserves and the incorporation of the information effect. The calculation of recoverable reserves in this study, involved the calculation of an error density map which was added to the individual realisations of the direct block simulation to provide an uncertainty assessment of the recoverable reserves within the deposit, while accounting for the differences in support and information effect between the exploration and blasthole sampling information. The application of the method at Morila utilized known block selection information from mined out area to adjust the estimates to known statistical distributions. Finally, the realisations generated where shown to be comparable to the block selection determined in the mined out areas using the grade control drilling. Recognising the effect of information and support and quantifying and managing its potential impact when planning a mine operation can have a large influence in a project&#146;s feasibility and final economic outcome. This thesis demonstrates a possible methodology for accounting for the expected inaccuracies in the selection of ore and waste block by incorporating the effect of future, as yet unavailable data, into the recoverable reserve estimates. In this way, the effect of support and information effect on the final estimates of recoverable reserves can be mitigated and fully informed mining decision can be made.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158808</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The spectroscopic properties of melanin</field><field name="creator">Riesz, Jennifer Jean</field><field name="description">Melanin exhibits a broadband absorbance spectrum that appears to be unique amongst func- tional biomolecules. Explaining the origin of this spectrum is one of the primary challenges facing this field. Three main theories have been proposed: 1) The optical density is due to scattering, 2) Melanin is an amorphous semiconductor which then naturally exhibits broad- band absorbance, or 3) Melanin has a large amount of chemical heterogeneity (or disorder) which leads to a broadband absorbance spectrum through superposition of the absorbance spectra of many species (the chemical disorder model). We discuss these models and the experimental evidence for each. We report direct experimental evidence that the optical density is not a consequence of scattering processes, and is due to true absorbance. Distin- guishing between the two remaining explanations leads us to a discussion of the molecular structure of melanin, an issue which remains unresolved. We include a literature review, summarising the important structural findings for melanins, and conclude that the evidence suggests that melanin consists of a heterogeneous collection of small oligomers, which points towards the chemical disorder explanation for broadband absorbance. We caution, however, that the amount of chemical disorder obviously prevalent in this system is often neglected in discussions of the structure of melanin. We show that the oscillator strengths of melanin and its fundamental components are naturally explained by the chemical disorder model, as are their emission and excitation spectra and their radiative quantum yields. We show that the emission properties of melanin are not consistently reported in the literature, which is in part due to the strong re-absorption that occurs in this system, and we emphasise the im- portance of correcting for this effect in any measurement of the fluorescence of melanin. The emission properties of synthetic pheomelanin are reported, and are found to be different to those for eumelanin, suggesting different energy dissipation processes for these pigments. We also report a careful study of the spectroscopic properties of DHICA (5,6-dihydroxyindole-2- carboxylic acid), a key melanin monomer, and propose, based on these results, that proton transfer processes contribute to energy dissipation in this molecule. The radiative yield of melanin is measured to be extremely small (&lt; 0.1%), which is consistent with melanin&#146;s biological role as a photoprotectant, and suggests that non-radiative energy dissipation pro- cesses are very important for melanin. As a result of this finding we measure the vibronic structure of eumelanin related molecules using inelastic neutron scattering and accurately assign the vibrational modes using density functional theory calculations. This provides an important first step towards understanding the non-radiative processes in melanin energy dissipation and its biological functionality.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158807</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reliable Quantum Information Processing</field><field name="creator">Haselgrove, Henry Lincoln</field><field name="description">Quantum information processing is the coherent manipulation of a quantum state for the purpose of performing an information processing task. It is known that certain tasks can in principle be performed much more efficiently using quantum information processing rather than ordinary classical processing. Examples include factoring, secure key distribution, and the simulation of quantum systems. However, significant theoretical and technological obstacles stand in the road to achieving these promised benefits. It is exceedingly difficult to construct devices that are able to achieve an extensive level of control of a quantum state while keeping that state well isolated from the effects of noise. Although there is considerable experimental effort underway to build devices that are less noisy and more controllable, there is also a significant theoretical program aimed at finding schemes that make such physical limitations have less effect on the overall reliability of a device. The crowning achievement is the theory of fault-tolerant quantum error-correction, which shows that a noisy quantum device can be efficiently made to behave as though it were noise free, so long as the amount of noise present is below the &#147;noise threshold&#148;. A central result of this thesis is the calculation of the noise threshold for optical cluster-state quantum computing. Optical cluster-state quantum computing is one of the most promising proposals for the physical implementation of a quantum computer (i.e., a generic quantum information processing device). Previous studies of the value of the threshold, that considered other physical implementations, do not apply to optical quantum computing due to the unusual features of the optical proposal such as nondeterministic gates and photon loss. We present the first detailed analysis of the value of the noise threshold for this proposal. Our analysis involves a number of innovations, including a method for error-correction known as telecorrection, whereby repeated errorsyndrome measurements are guaranteed to agree due to the use of teleportation during the correction process. This thesis also considers how to overcome limits to the amount of physical control able to be applied to a quantum device. We ask, if a quantum device can only control limited parts of its quantum state, can that device still be used to achieve a useful information processing task? We consider simple networks of interacting quantum spins where only a few of the spins are controllable, and consider the problem of using this system for high- fidelity quantum communication (i.e., using the system as a simple &#147;quantum wire&#148;). Without control, such systems generally yield a very poor communication fidelity. We show that a very simple scheme that involves controlling a small number of the spins can be used to greatly increase the fidelity across the entire network. The scheme is designed using techniques of state encoding. The thesis also considers the problem of engineering the interactions in a quantum device so that the ground state is a quantum error-correcting code. Such a problem is an important part of the proposal for naturally fault-tolerant systems, which have the ability to resist noise whilst using little or no external control. Our results prove that a certain important class of quantum error-correcting codes, the so called nondegenerate codes, cannot be the eigenstate of any physically-plausible quantum system. This result places significant restrictions on the design of naturally fault-tolerant devices, and sheds light on why current proposals for natural fault tolerance use codes that are degenerate.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158195</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biological Activities of Plant Extracts and Essential Oils against Helicoverpa armigera</field><field name="creator">Hidayat, Yusup</field><field name="description">Hexane, benzene, chloroform and methanol extracts of Ajuga australis, Lantana camara and Tithonia diversifolia, and the essential oils of Backhousia citriodora, Melaleuca alternifolia and Melaleuca quinquenervia were investigated for their biological activities against the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera Hubner. Most noticeable was the antifeedant effect of most of the plant extracts tested on H armigera. Based on the results of the choice feeding assays, the most effective extracts of each plant were hexane for A. australis (AIso=13.5 ~g/cm2), benzene for T diversifolia (AIso=43.5 ~g/cm2) and benzene for L. camara (AIso=99.7 ~g/cm2). For the three essential oils tested, only the essential oil of B. citriodora showed an antifeedant effect (Also choice test = 282.4 ~g/cm2). Among all plant extracts and essential oils investigated in this study, the hexane extract ofA. australis was the most potent antifeedant. None of the plant extracts tested significantly affected the survival of H armigera in either feeding or contact assays. Generally, ingesting plant extracts for 12-15 hours in a no-choice feeding assay had no significant effects on the growth and development of H armigera. Exceptions were the hexane and chloroform extracts of A. australis and the chloroform extract of L. camara, which slightly lengthened the larval development time, and the hexane extract ofL. camara which slightly reduced the pupal weight. Unlike the plant extracts, or the essential oils of M alternifolia and M. quinquenervia, the essential oil of B. citriodora had an effect on the survival ofH armigera. In a contact assay at the highest dose (200 ~g/larvae), this essential oil killed 33.3 % of the larvae tested after 48 hours. In a no-choice feeding assay, also at the highest dose (500 ~g/cm2), the essential oil of B. citriodora had no significant effect on larval survival, but heavily influenced the later development stages of the insect where more abnormal pupae were formed, and not a single adult emerged. Although it is without toxic effect, the Australian native plant, A. australis is considered to have the most potential for insect control. Its strong antifeedant effect at a low dose on H armigera may have a significant potential role in the implementation of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program for this insect.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158806</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional Characterisation of the Cellular Proteome</field><field name="creator">Stansfield, Scott Hunton</field><field name="description">Engineered mammalian (CHO, NS0 and SP2/0) cells are commonly used for large-scale production of recombinant therapeutic antibodies. Increased antibody production in these commercial manufacturing systems is often achieved through systematic empirical optimisation of culture environment and improved expression vectors. To date, our a priori knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of antibody manufacture in these expression systems is very limited. As a result, genetic engineering of mammalian host cells to improve product yields have often produced &#145;mixed&#146; results, further indicating the need for a more exploratory approach to understanding glycoprotein production. Identification of coordinated changes specifically related to one particular phenotype (i.e. cell-specific productivity; qP) at a clonal level will improve our understanding of the rate limiting steps or intracellular processes related to that phenotype. Using quantitative two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, differences in the host cell proteome were assessed between murine myeloma NS0 cells producing a recombinant monoclonal antibody at varying cell-specific production rates. Furthermore the variation in synthesis and abundance of these proteins were evaluated during fed-batch culture. Conserved and coordinated changes in specific proteins known to interact with antibody folding and assembly were identified, as were changes in the intracellular abundance of recombinant heavy and light chain polypeptides. Conserved changes in the abundance of proteins as functional categories (chaperones, metabolic and mitochondrial, cytoskeletal and cell signaling) also demonstrated correlation with enhanced cell-specific productivity between clonal cell lines. However, variation in the synthesis and abundance of these proteins (individually and in categories) during a fed-batch process did not demonstrate the same coordinated changes with qP observed between clonal cell lines. In conclusion these data suggest that cell performance in production processes is de- fined primarily by the basal phenotype selected after transfection. Bioprocess manipulations modulate management of host cellular processes altering metabolism and recombinant gene transcription or translation, but only within the confines of the host cell machinery selected post-transfection. Pre-screening of cells prior to selection for coordinated changes associated with improved qP will reduce the variation in transfected cell phenotypes, reducing the time to select cells with good performance characteristics.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158196</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tiempos de trovar - Contesting and creating spaces for singersongwriters: The role of the nueva trova in Cuba</field><field name="creator">Monk, Susan Leticia</field><field name="description">During the late 1960s the Latin American New Song Movement (NSM) emerged to provide an artistic outlet for many singer-songwriters allowing them to reflect upon the issues of their times. The Cuban expression of the NSM was called the nueva trova. Although it shared a common perspective with its counterparts in the rest of Latin America, it developed in a country which saw a restructuring of society based on socialist ideas following the 1959 Cuban revolution. By the end of the 1980s the NSM struggled to maintain its momentum after the turbulent years of the previous two decades when many of its major exponents had been exiled from their country of origin. The nueva trova in Cuba, however, created a space which has proved to be enduring and with a character quite different from what is commonly known in Western countries as "protest song". The nueva trova incorporated a wide variety of musical influences, imagery and metaphor, taking Cuban song to new levels of poetry while at the same time addressing its unique situation in a developing socialist society. The history of the nueva trova is one of rich melody, unexpected cadences, verses of dissonance and passages of reflection. It bears the marks of both national preoccupations and international pressures in a country which continues to exist in a climate dominated by U.S. hostilities. The nueva trova since its beginnings has had to negotiate a public space for itself, sometimes occupying sites of friction, other times convergence, within the Cuban state. The songs of the trovadores provide an exciting example of a cultural practice based on development, mutual support between its practitioners and relevance to the cultural environment in which it has developed. In this thesis I argue that the nueva trova occupies a significant place in Cuba's musical development. I propose that Cuban trovadores occupy a position as social commentators on the changes within their country and I put forward evidence to show the role of their music as a continuing and developing critical practice. I also consider broader questions about the dynamic relationship between music-making and the Cuban socialist state within the broader global context. I show that the work of the trovadores continues to be relevant, imaginative and challenging. Their desire to push at the boundaries of an understanding of the present contrasts with the stagnant or sometimes nostalgic backward looking idea of Cuban music as a "museum piece", portrayed by some in the Western world. Where inquiry into the place and practice of popular music and its relationship to cultural identity is being debated, the nueva trova offers some unique insights. Incorporating song texts and excerpts from fieldwork interviews I conducted in 2001, I investigate the many "lines of counterpoint" that have shaped the development of the nueva trova. I also consider the work of the Pablo de la Torriente Brau Cultural Centre, including its support for many new trovadores, which provides an exciting example of a cultural practice consciously linked to the environment in which it has developed. Finally I draw connections between my own music practice and experiences and consider the implications and links between performance and research as a participant/observer.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158805</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of the Mechanics of Coal Mine Rib Deformation and Rib Support as a basis for Engineering Design.</field><field name="creator">Colwell, Mark Gerard</field><field name="description">With an increasing focus on safety in the Australian underground coal mining industry and government legislation requiring employers to provide a safe workplace, there is a clear need for today&#146;s strata control engineers to have design capabilities in relation to coal mine rib support that provide effective, reliable and consistent solutions. There has been a relatively limited amount of research undertaken with respect to the study of the mechanics of coal mine rib deformation and rib support and prior to this study no systematic rib support design technique had been developed for any country&#146;s underground coal mining industry. This is in direct contrast to other geotechnical issues, such as coal mine roof support and pillar design, which have been extensively researched resulting in numerous technical papers, conferences/workshops dedicated to these specific issues and several proposed design techniques and/or guidelines. It is assessed that the primary reasons for this disparity have been a lack of understanding concerning the failure mechanisms associated with ribline behaviour and not being able to delineate the significant factors that affect ribline behaviour. This thesis has investigated the mechanical behaviour of coal mine ribs under various loading environments and with a wide variety of rib support hardware as a basis upon which an engineered design methodology could be formulated. A program of full scale field trials were conducted at ten collieries (representing four of the five major Australian coalfields), in conjunction with a comprehensive industry wide review of ribline performance from which a database was formulated and statistically analysed. The results of the field based experimental program and statistical analyses strongly suggest that the mechanical nature of rib movement is consistent with the buckling of thin coal plates or slabs. While a precursor to buckling may be tensile failure in the form of vertical splitting along cleat, mining induced fractures (as a result of roadway development) or the formation of new cracks due to longwall abutment loading; it is clear from the extensometry that the nature and magnitude of the lateral displacement is a result of buckling. There was a significant reduction with respect to the extent of softening within the riblines that utilised areal support in the form of steel or plastic mesh. The major structural or mechanistic benefit of mesh to overall ribline performance is that it maintains the buckled coal plate to the ribline allowing it to behave (to a degree) like a spring, which in this instance not only provides resistance to the vertical stress but also provides an active lateral force to the inner coal plates. Essentially the best rib support in terms of overall roadway maintenance is potentially the rib itself. Based on the results of this study and an improved understanding of the mechanistic behaviour of coal mine ribs, a design methodology (the first of its type), known as Analysis and Design of Rib Support (ADRS), has been developed for the Australian underground coal mining industry. Since its release to the Australian collieries in February/March 2005 via ACARP technology transfer workshops, ADRS has now been registered and successfully used by most Australian collieries, the NSW Mining Inspectorate and several consultants. ADRS is an empirical technique, which recognises that several geotechnical and design factors affect ribline performance and in addition that operational and safety issues essentially dictate the level of performance required. Therefore the design recommendations associated with ADRS are specific to the Australian coal industry; however the procedure(s) for data collection and analysis could be applied to other countries&#146; underground coal industries.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blur: Gerhard Richter and the photographic in painting</field><field name="creator">Hawker, Rosemary</field><field name="description">German artist Gerhard Richter claims to paint photographs. His realist figurative works, called photopaintings, make extensive use of the blurred appearance of photographs that lack focus or show the movement of the camera or its subject. This blurring is central to understanding the dialogue that Richter enacts between photography and painting as media. It is also his means for arriving at immediate and singular works of art based in affect. This visual strategy, though seemingly inarticulate, is able to achieve such effects because of the blur&#146;s ability to disrupt traditional representational relations as found in resemblance and imitation. As a result, Richter&#146;s work exceeds the signifying power of images based on conventional mimetic schemas. Properly speaking, this blurring shows nothing yet at the same time it generates a play between what is visible and what cannot be shown, but only known through felt sensation. Georges Didi-Huberman describes this kind of relationship in terms of the power of dissemblance over resemblance. The blur makes the most direct type of meaning through this dissemblance: so direct, spontaneous and inimitable as to be the real itself. Roland Barthes also identifies an immediacy of effect in photography, describing it as the &#147;reality effect&#148;, which at its most affecting he calls &#147;punctum&#148;. Richter&#146;s paintings can be understood to operate according to these same photographic qualities, but as anterior to both the apparatus of the camera and the discipline of photography. Richter&#146;s blurring connects with complex issues from art history, but more than this he reveals the fundamental imperative of painting which can be observed across that history&#151;that painting, in pursuing sensation and affect, has always been in pursuit of the photographic. Paradoxically, the photographic as affect can only be achieved in painting through non-resemblance and what cannot be seen&#151;the very opposite conditions to those feted by photography as medium and discipline. At a time when it is argued that we have arrived at a post-medium condition for art, Richter demonstrates that medium remains vitally relevant to art today. In particular, he makes clear that media define each other and that this is central to their use and function. That is, we can only ever know painting through photography and photography through painting. The differences made visible results directly from its indexicality and allows its conflation with the real. The discussion then turns to William Mitchell&#146;s argument that the advent of digital imaging and its ease of generation and manipulation separate photography from any sense of indexical faithfulness to an external reality and its claim to the real. Martin Lister and Kevin Robins argue that Mitchell overly simplifies these issues by not putting indexicality in the context of other art disciplines. Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe&#146;s account of the transforming impact of photography upon the surface of the painting and the end of facture shows how the physical location of the blur opens the discussion to a direct consideration of contemporary mediality. Continuing in this vein, and in order to provide a foundation for the speculations around medium that are taken up in Chapter Five, Rosalind Krauss&#146;s writings on the role of photography in precipitating post-medium art are discussed. At the same time that Krauss identifies a central role for photography in this process, she argues for its obsolescence as medium. The arguments addressed in this chapter encapsulate key issues for the consideration of photography and the photographic. They provide a theoretical framework against which to consider Richter&#146;s claim to paint a photograph, and its broader implications for painting and photography as media. In this way, the first two chapters of this dissertation map the historical, disciplinary, and thematic context necessary for the consideration of Richter&#146;s use of the blur. Chapter Three argues that, despite the apparent and wellknown diversity of Richter&#146;s outcomes, his oeuvre can be understood as consistently organized around photography. The analysis undertaken in this chapter provides a broad and symptomatic map of Richter&#146;s engagement with photography across all major aspects of his practice, and in relation to the major thematic elements of the critical uptake of his oeuvre and his use of blur. In Chapter Four I return to the statement used to begin the thesis: Richter&#146;s claim to paint a photograph. We can now judge it against the historical, conceptual and critical background established in the preceding chapters, and consider how it is made possible by the apparently simple technique of the photographic blur. This sets up a complicated relationship between photography and painting in Richter&#146;s art. Close analysis of different examples from his photopaintings shows how they can be understood as photographic by way of Didi-Huberman&#146;s concept of dissemblance and Barthes&#146; concept of punctum. I argue that Richter is able to &#147;make&#148; rather than &#147;imitate&#148; a photograph. &#147;Practising photography by other means,&#148; he articulates painting as essentially photographic, as communicated by the blur and its functioning. Chapter Five considers the so-called post-medium condition of contemporary art in light of what we have learned from Richter&#146;s intense engagement with questions of medium. The work of contemporary photographers and painters is discussed as a way of understanding the issues at stake for art in relations of medium and discipline. Artists discussed include photographers Hiroshi Sugimoto, Uta Barth, Andreas Gursky, Jeff Wall, sculptor Thomas Demand, and painters Glenn Brown and Gerard Fromanger. They are drawn together through their visual strategies, their links to Richter, and the dialogues between media enacted by their work. Drawing on Krauss&#146;s and Michel Foucault&#146;s conceptions of medium, I argue that, in art today, images are produced in the spaces between media and that we can better understand these inter-medial relations and their importance through the function of idiom. Jacques Derrida&#146;s discussion of idiom in The Truth in Painting is used to present a means for understanding the role of medium in what is often claimed to be postmedium contemporary art. In this chapter, and in the Conclusion, I consider the so-called &#147;end&#148; of both painting and photography in the light of Richter&#146;s articulation of the photographic as the essence of painting. As the impossibility of the blur in the digital age confirms, the real end of painting is the end of the photographic. If painting and photography can no longer be organized according to a photographic imperative, Richter&#146;s painting of photographic blur has opened the space for consideration of a post-photographic, postmedium art. The consideration of idiom that the blur has facilitated is able to make better sense of these issues, as it opens the possibility of a post-idiomatic art. The significance of Richter&#146;s enactment of the blur is that we have arrived at a time when such questions are possible for art.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158803</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life in the suburbs: The survival of the northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus) in habitat fragments of urban Brisbane, with implications for the conservation of native ground-dwelling mammals.</field><field name="creator">FitzGibbon, Sean</field><field name="description">In Australia as around the world, human populations are migrating to the cities, causing our urban centres to expand into adjacent native habitats. Within these profoundly altered urban landscapes, habitat fragments are surrounded by a heterogeneous matrix dominated by buildlings, roads, cars, lawns, and people. In Australia, the northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus) is an inconspicuous survivor in these largely hostile urban landscapes, where ground-dwelling mammals seem to have fared poorly. This study examined the survival of the northern brown bandicoot within the urbanised city of Brisbane, Australia. Although regarded as common throughout much of its range, the species has disappeared from many areas of Brisbane and is threatened with further decline given the steady growth of the city. A detailed autecological study of populations in five habitat fragments was combined with a broad insular biogeographic examination of bandicoot distribution in 68 urban habitat fragments. Results were interpreted in light of the trends that have emerged from research into the urban ecology of similarly adaptable mammals in North America. To incorporate human dimensions into the examination of bandicoot survival in the human-dominated landscape of Brisbane, a survey of residents was conducted to assess their attitudes towards, and knowledge of, bandicoots and other local wildlife. From regular trapping and radio telemetry it was found that northern brown bandicoots can occur at relatively high densities (&gt; 2.5 individuals per ha) in urban areas and that individuals have relatively small home ranges (&lt; 1.5 ha), compared with the species in nearby rural areas. These patterns are consistent with urban ecological trends from the northern hemisphere. Bandicoots resided by day beneath dense ground cover within bushland, but occasionally ventured into the fringes of suburbia at night to forage in parks, lawns, gardens, and pet food bowls. Annual reproductive output of mature females was extremely high (11 &#150; 14 young per yr), and along with habitat and dietary flexibility, this large reproductive capacity is likely a major factor in the survival of the species in several urban habitat fragments. From an examination of 68 habitat fragments in southern Brisbane, northern brown bandicoots were detected in 33 (49%), suggesting they are still relatively widespread. Logistic regression analysis revealed that of 16 habitat and landscape variables, the functional connectivity of fragments was the only significant factor (p &lt; 0.0001) predicting the patch occupancy of bandicoots. Fragments on waterways typically had a high functional connectivity index because such areas were often linked by thin vegetated corridors lining creeks, which bandicoots were known to occasionally move along. Prospects for the long-term survival of the species are most promising in these riparian areas, because there is potential for re-colonisation if the species becomes locally extinct within a fragment. Isolated fragments were functionally disconnected, and populations in these areas are at greatest risk of permanent local extinction, especially in small patches (&lt; 10 ha). Although the landscape variable 'functional connectivity' was the main predictor of bandicoot distribution, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) analysis revealed that internal characteristics of the fragments (including area) were also important. From the distribution of 300 questionnaires to households located beside bushland fragments of Brisbane, 172 (57%) of the one-page surveys were returned. Most notably, the vast majority (&gt; 95%) of respondents indicated an appreciation for local bushland and wildlife. Many respondents demonstrated a considerable knowledge of local wildlife, and provided extremely valuable information on the historical distribution of species that have since disappeared. Several human-wildlife conflicts were identified, including the potential of bandicoots as vectors of ticks, and their penchant for digging in lawns and gardens. However, an overall tolerant attitude towards nuisance wildlife prevailed in respondents. This study has several broad implications for the conservation and management of native wildlife in Brisbane and other urban centres. The highly adaptable northern brown bandicoot, like most of the successful urban mammals in the northern hemisphere, is an omnivorous habitat generalist. Other mammals that display these characteristics are expected to cope best with urbanisation. This study confirms the importance of functional habitat connection in urban landscapes to the survival of bandicoots, and this factor is likely to be of extreme importance to all non-volant species in these environments. Also of importance to the conservation of bandicoots and other wildlife in urban areas are the attitudes of residents, particularly where there is potential for human-wildlife conflict. From the integration of the various approaches used during the study, a set of seven management recommendations have been provided for adoption by the Brisbane City Council. However, these recommendations could be applied beneficially to most urban landscapes, to enhance the conservation of ground-dwelling species.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158804</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sedimentology of the South East Bowen Basin, South East Queensland, Australia, Implications for groundwater resources in the Kalahari basin of Botswana</field><field name="creator">Lasarwe, Reneilwe</field><field name="description">Sedimentary deposits are important aquifers in many parts of the world and in order to explore, develop and manage these aquifers, it is necessary to determine the relationship between the hydrogeologic properties and sedimentary facies (aquifer characterization). Within a sedimentary hydrogeologic system, the environment of deposition and the resulting distribution of grain sizes, texture, and facies associations within different individual aquifer bodies influence variations in hydraulic properties. Successful prediction of the quality of the aquifer is dependent on the accurate mapping of both lithologic units and hydrogeologic parameters. In this project, the influence of petrophysical characteristics of the sedimentary rocks to the quality of the aquifer is investigated with a view to finding a correlation between these characteristics, the type and nature of sedimentary rocks present and their hydrogeologic properties. Investigation methods involved the use of geophysical wireline log data, lithological core logging, thin section microscopy and X-Ray Diffraction analysis. All this was done to characterize the sedimentary rocks in terms of composition, grain size and diagenesis. Porosity tests were also performed on the samples collected while permeability data was collected from the Department of Natural Resources and Mines (DNR &amp; M), Australia. The basins of interest for this project are the Bowen Basin in Australia and the Kalahari Basin in Botswana. The two basins are similar, though structurally different. The basins are similar in the sense that they have got similarity in their rock sequence. All the work done on the Bowen Basin and the results obtained are extrapolated to the similar Kalahari Basin. The units of the Bowen Basin are underlain by the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian Camboon Volcanics. The Permian units include the Buffel, Barfield, Flat Top, and Gyranda Formations and the Baralaba Coal Measures. The Triassic units are the Rewan Group, Clematis Sandstone and Moolayember Formation. Within the Bowen Basin the Permian units are generally argillaceous and therefore have generally low porosities and permeabilities and also give low resistivity (RES) base lines and high gamma ray (GR) baselines. However where fractured, the units yield some water from the shale. Boreholes drawing water from the Barfield, Flat Top and Gyranda Formations tap the fractured shales. The Triassic aquifers present a different picture. The best aquifers with high porosities and permeabilities are of the Triassic age and their distribution is influenced by their proximity to the source area. Sedimentary rocks of the Triassic age in the Bowen Basin become more argillaceous at more distal positions from the source area. The Rewan Group in particular shows this trend and hence better aquifers within the Rewan are those close to the source area. The Kalahari Basin Karoo stratigraphy commences with the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian glaciogenic sedimentary rocks of the Dwyka Group. The Dwyka Group is overlain by the argillaceous Permian to Early Triassic sedimentary rocks of The Ecca Group and the Beaufort Group. Overlying the Beaufort Group is the Lebung Group (lower Mosolotsane Formation-dominantly mudstone and siltstone sequence and upper Ntane Sandstone Formation- aeolian sandstone). Basaltic lavas of the stormberg Lava Group cap the Karoo stratigraphy. Few groundwater studies in the Karoo of the Kalahari Basin have shown that the Ecca Group does not posses good aquifer characteristics because of its argillaceous nature. However, thin arenaceous interbeds within the Ecca Group have yielded some groundwater. Non-measurable quantities of groundwater have been recorded from boreholes sunk in the Beaufort Group. Few boreholes penetrating the Mosolotsane Formation yielded very little groundwater whereas Ntane Sandstone have yielded a fair amount of groundwater. Groundwater yield from the Stormberg Lava Group is related to the presence of fractures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260501 Groundwater Hydrology</field><field name="subject">780104 Earth sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158198</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the Linkages between Tourism and Urban Poverty Reduction Using a Sustainable Livelihoods Framework</field><field name="creator">Mandke, Pallavi</field><field name="description">Tourism can have significant impact on the economic and social development in developing countries. However, it is only recently that a focus has emerged in tourism studies on the potential and capacities of tourism as a tool for poverty reduction. Similarly, the development sector has also been slow to include tourism in its poverty reduction strategies. Literature shows that the association of tourism with poverty reduction has mainly been studied in the context of rural areas but little, if anything is known about the relationship of tourism with urban poverty reduction. Although tourism in cities is an old phenomenon, as is urban poverty in developing countries, the relationship between them has not been fully understood. This limitation has inhibited the development of mechanisms and techniques to optimally utilise tourism as a tool for urban poverty reduction. Also statistics indicate that cities in developing countries are becoming important tourist destinations, as well as predominant sites of poverty, which creates an urgency to understand tourism's contribution to urban poverty reduction. This thesis aims to understand the linkages between tourism and urban poverty reduction. In order to do so, it adopts an exploratory approach to systematically develop an empirical understanding of this new area of investigation. The conceptual framework used is an adaptation of the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF), which provides a holistic and systematic approach to explore the linkages between existing tourism activities and the livelihoods of the urban poor. It provides a basis to understand the contextual factors, people's livelihood assets and the Policies, Institutions and Processes (PIPs) that constrain and/or enhance livelihood opportunities. The conceptual framework is applied to the case of Bangkok, Thailand and is limited to the urban poor who are engaged in specific types of tourism related activities. Here, Bangkok was considered appropriate because it exemplifies large cities in developing countries, especially those in Asia, in terms of its urban characteristics as they relate to urban tourism, urban poverty and urban management. The chosen tourism activities in Bangkok were 1) hotels, as they are an important tourism facility and an example of the tourism related formal sector; 2) street vending, as it is an important informal sector activity of the urban poor and 3) community tourism activities, as they are examples of urban tourism, which are developed with the poor in mind and in areas where the they live. The results indicate that the conceptual framework developed for this research provides two main findings. One is a better understanding of the linkages between tourism and livelihoods of the urban poor, generated from the analysis of the interactions between livelihoods of the urban poor and the tourism activities they engage in. And the other is the identification of interventions/entry points to effectively apply tourism as a tool for urban poverty reduction, developed based on the analysis of strengths, weakness, opportunities and threats arising from the context, assets and PIP related factors as identified in the SLF. Finally, the conceptual framework extends the SLF by adding new elements and down playing some existing elements in the framework. It provides a revised and effective framework for further investigation of existing tourism activities and their urban poverty reduction potential.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158802</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Girl Meets Girl: Lesbian Romantic Comedies and the Public Sphere</field><field name="creator">McWilliam, Kelly Ann</field><field name="description">Six decades after the romantic comedy emerged as a Hollywood genre in 1934, the first romantic comedies with a central lesbian couple, including Marita Giovanni&#146;s Bar Girls and Rose Troche&#146;s Go Fish, were released in 1994. This study argues that Bar Girls and Go Fish represent the first in a group of films whose numbers and similarities enable their consideration as a romantic comedy sub-genre, namely the &#145;lesbian romantic comedy&#146;. This study identifies and analyses this sub-genre. It contends that these films have emerged as the predominant (and perhaps only) form of mainstream lesbian feature film in the United States of America in the mid to late 1990s and early 2000s. Yet, despite their relative prominence for more than a decade, they remain vastly under-examined areas in scholarship on both film genre and lesbian culture. This project aims to contribute to these areas by producing the first full-length survey of the sub-genre and the first study of any length to focus exclusively on it. This study concentrates on ten lesbian romantic comedies: Bar Girls (1994), Go Fish (1994), Maria Maggenti&#146;s The Incredibly True Adventure of 2 Girls in Love (1995), Kelli Herd&#146;s It&#146;s in the Water (1996), Julia Dyer&#146;s Late Bloomers (1996), Emma-Kate Croghan&#146;s Love and Other Catastrophes (1996), Heidi Arnesen&#146;s Some Prefer Cake (1997), Anne Wheeler&#146;s Better than Chocolate (1999), Jamie Babbit&#146;s But I&#146;m a Cheerleader (1999), and Helen Lesnick&#146;s A Family Affair (2001). While this project employs textual analysis as its primary methodology to examine these films, these analyses take place more broadly within a public sphere framework. Consistent with a wider shift in analyses of lesbian and gay cultural products, this framework allows a consideration of the larger public stakes of lesbian romantic comedies and, in particular, their introduction of lesbian content into a heterocentric genre. Specifically, this project argues that the introduction of lesbian content&#151;or the replacement of &#145;boy meets girl&#146; with &#145;girl meets girl&#146;&#151;destabilises the genre in significant ways, but that the genre itself equally restricts the representation of lesbianism possible within it. Ultimately, this project proposes a reading of lesbian romantic comedies as conservative and progressive, conventional and subversive, but as nonetheless complex texts that offer a range of pleasures and readings to their audiences and a range of challenges to the genre itself. Such a reading reveals the complexity and negotiation inherent in these films&#146; position as independent films presenting culturally and politically marginal content in a mainstream genre.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158199</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"I know it can change for people with what I've had": Environmental Factors that Influence the Community Participation of Adults with Aphasia</field><field name="creator">Howe, Tami Jean</field><field name="description">The World Health Organization International ClasszJication of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) (WHO, 2001) has recently called for research to investigate the environmental factors that influence the participation of individuals with various health conditions. Participation in life may be hindered if society creates negative environmental factors (barriers) or fails to provide positive environmental factors (facilitators). To date, most of the research in this area has focused on individuals with physical disorders. This qualitative research investigation addresses the gap in the literature in relation to the communication disorder of aphasia. The aim of the study was to explore the environmental factors that hinder or support the community participation of adults with aphasia. Two studies, underpinned by the constructivist paradigm and following the qualitative description research strategy, were conducted to address this aim. In the first phase, 25 adults with aphasia participated in semistructured in-depth interviews. All participants had aphasia caused by a stroke, lived in the community (i.e., in their own homes or a retirement village), and were at least six months poststroke. Informants were 34 to 85 years old with varied aphasia severity as measured by the Western Aphasia Battevy (Kertesz, 1982). The participants were also purposefully selected using maximum variation sampling for variables such as gender, time postonset of aphasia, and education. Qualitative content analysis of the interview transcripts revealed 156 barriers and 206 facilitators. These factors were categorised into 36 subtypes of environmental factors (e.g., Facilitators - Procedures) and six types of environmental factors (i.e., Barriers Related to other People, Physical Barriers, Societal Barriers, Facilitators Related to Other People, Physical Facilitators, and Societal Facilitators). The study also revealed seven themes: Awareness of Aphasia, Opportunity for Participation, Familiarity, Time Available for Communication, Communication Complexity, Message Clarity, and Availability of Extra Support for Communication. A few participants identified environmental factors related to their physical difficulties (e.g., lack of stair railings) during the interviews, while all participants reported some other influences (e.g., "The BARFUERS . . . got nothin' to do with it . . . I just can't TALK") on their community participation, in addition to environmental factors. In the second phase, 10 participants from the first study were observed participating in community environments, using the method of participant observation. The participants, aged 35 to 72, were purposefully selected using maximum variation sampling for a variety of variables such as gender, aphasia severity, and living situation. Qualitative content analysis of the field notes revealed 44 barriers and 59 facilitators, as well as 19 subtypes of environmental factors (e.g., Barriers - Other People's Actions) and the same six types of environmental factors generated by the first study. The investigation identified four of the themes that were revealed in the first study (i.e., Familiarity, Communication Complexity, Time Available for Communication, and Availability of Extra Support for Communication) and two themes that were not revealed by the first study (i.e., Referents and Interaction). The results of the two phases suggested that the participants faced a wide range of barriers to community participation, many of which have not been reported previously. The research also identified a number of existing facilitators and potential facilitators for overcoming these barriers. A preliminary framework for evaluating environmental factors is proposed, involving the themes and environmental factor types and subtypes generated by the two studies. The results of the two investigations share some similarities with the ICF's Environmental Factor domains; however, there are also some key differences. Future versions of the ICF may need to incorporate a broader range of environmental factors into the classification system in order to be relevant for people with aphasia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158200</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">COMPREHENSION AND WELL-FORMEDNESS JUDGEMENT IN BROCA&#146;S APHASIA AND ANOMIC APHASIA</field><field name="creator">Cardell, Elizabeth Ann</field><field name="description">Key investigations into the comprehension and well-formedness judgement abilities of individuals with Broca&#146;s aphasia have shown some well-defined patterns of performance. Three main theoretical proposals have been offered to account for the so-called agrammatic comprehension deficit, namely, the mapping hypothesis, chain-disruption accounts, and processing limitation accounts. A handful of studies have shown other aphasic groupings, such as anomic aphasia, demonstrate the main features of asyntactic comprehension (i.e., difficulty with sentences that are semantically-reversible or have transformational movement). Recent evidence has emerged to suggest that the ability to make judgements of well formedness can be affected in different aphasic groups and that the patterns of well-formedness judgement performance share similar features to those in Broca&#146;s aphasia. However, such reports have been limited in their scope and have studied a narrow range of parsing operations. The series of investigations and analyses reported in this thesis employed well-formedness judgement paradigms to investigate, in an in-depth and systematic manner, the parsing abilities of individuals with Broca&#146;s aphasia and anomic aphasia. The main goal was an attempt to identify converging and diverging patterns of performance and to further understand the nature of parsing deficits in individuals with Broca&#146;s aphasia and anomic aphasia. In particular, the impact from sentence-based, task-based, and extralinguistic influences on performance was investigated. The results speak to the validity of the agrammatic comprehension deficit as a unitary disorder, as well as to models of asyntactic comprehension and of human language processing. Seventeen participants with aphasia (6 with Broca&#146;s aphasia, 11 with anomic aphasia) participated in the research, along with 18 matched control participants. In the initial investigation, syntactic comprehension abilities were tested across a range of constructions. The performance profiles of the two aphasic groups were similar, with the anomic aphasic group showing better accuracy. Reversible sentences and noncanonical sentences were difficult for both aphasic groups. Conjoined sentences, however, were more difficult for the Broca&#146;s aphasic group. Additive effects of sentence complexity negatively affected performance for the three participant groups, and an enactment task resulted in lower scores than a sentence-picture matching task. The next two investigations involved an offline (untimed) well-formedness judgement paradigm that was presented so as to optimize processing abilities. The first investigation targeted systematic interactions between grammatical classes of sentences and different types of syntactic and semantic/pragmatic anomaly. For the three participant groups, detecting errors of inflectional morphology was difficult. The participants with Broca&#146;s aphasia experienced difficulty with thematic-role reversal errors (i.e., where the Agent noun phrase [NP] and Patient NP were reversed) in noncanonical sentences. The anomic aphasic group showed difficulties with thematic-role reversal errors when syntactic processing costs were high. Detection of semantic errors was generally good for all three participant groups. The second offline investigation employed a number of constructions and violations that had been studied in the Broca&#146;s aphasia grammaticality judgement literature, in an attempt to replicate the literature findings and to extend the scope of investigation to anomic aphasia. For all groups, structural violations of syntactic rules were well detected. Particular difficulties occurred when errors violated constraints on movement in AF-chains. Whilst accuracy was better for the participants with anomic aphasia, both aphasic groups showed reduced performance for the conditions that involved mapping thematic dependencies, as well as the conditions in which detecting errors involved the linkage of intrasentential dependencies. When processing costs were high, meaning-based heuristics were present and response bias occurred. Two further investigations replicated the offline investigations, but employed an online (timed) speeded anomaly detection task. The main aims were to investigate the influence that changed task demands (e.g., time pressure; changed input and response modes) had on performance, and to measure response time (RT) to anomalies. The impact of the task manipulations was marked. In the first of the online investigations, detecting semantic errors, which had been easy during the offline task, became more problematic for the participants with Broca&#146;s aphasia. The online performance of the participants with anomic aphasia shared similarities with that of the Broca&#146;s aphasic group&#146;s offline performance, as detecting rolereversal errors was more compromised, online. The control group showed a decrement in detecting inflectional errors. In the final online investigation, the overall results were also similar to those found in the untimed task, but with poorer accuracy across the three participant groups. Reduced sensitivity to all constructions was especially apparent for the Broca&#146;s aphasia group, particularly for the conditions that entailed intrasentential referential dependencies. The overall RT results indicated that the ability to detect anomalies was operating under a slower-than-normal time course for the participants with Broca&#146;s aphasia and anomic aphasia. RTs were strongly correlated to accuracy, as shown by slower RTs to anomalies that produced the lowest accuracy. However, at times, slowed response times marked good performance; hence, a speed-accuracy trade-off was also present. Finally, detailed item analyses were conducted across individual sentence exemplars. These analyses supported the statistical patterns, but showed that a range of lexical, semantic, pragmatic, prosodic, and syntactic variances, which were not considered in the statistical analyses, influenced performance. Importantly, it was shown that, in many instances, all participant groups were operating under similar influences. The collective results from the series of investigations reported in this thesis have revealed a linear relationship between performance on syntactic comprehension tests and performance during judgements of well-formedness. A number of sentence-based, task-based, and extralinguistic factors that influenced performance were identified. The outcomes support models in which parsing proceeds in a relatively hierarchical manner. However, certain processes within the linguistic processing chain appeared to be more vulnerable than other processes, and the present investigations have elucidated some of these points of vulnerability. The response time results suggested that analysis of the auditory string was operating under a slower-than-normal time-course in Broca&#146;s aphasia and anomic aphasia. Finally, the wellformedness judgement results have shown that performance across the participant groups was by degree and was not unique to any particular group, except to the extent that the processing system was vulnerable. Hence, theories that constrain interpretation to the agrammatic comprehension deficit (e.g., the mapping hypothesis and chain-disruption accounts) appear to be too restrictive in their scope. Processing-limitation proposals offer the most coherent account for the results in this thesis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158201</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Macropods, Fire and Habitat Change in Brisbane Forest Park (South-East Queensland)</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Susan Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to investigate the linkages between changes in habitat structure in Brisbane Forest Park and the distribution of macropod populations, particularly eastern grey kangaroo, the red necked wallaby, the whiptail wallaby and macropod species richness. The whiptail wallaby has been reported to have declined and possibly experienced local extinction in Brisbane Forest Park in recent decades. A key hypothesis of this thesis was that the reason for whiptail wallaby declines is alteration of the habitat structure and grass composition due to declines in the frequency of controlled burning. Multi-temporal analysis of aerial photographs shows that habitat structure of Brisbane Forest Park has become increasingly dominated by tree cover. Outcomes of interpretation of tree cover in aerial photographs reveal evidence of an increase in tree and shrub cover over the last 50 years in Brisbane Forest Park and the neighbouring Samford Valley, with a small increase in the Wivenhoe Dam area where whiptail wallabies were observed to be present. Changes in the incidence of fire during the last 30 years may also have had impacts on growth of grasses supporting wallaby presence. Using analysis of regression models, hierarchical partitioning analysis, analysis of variance and chi-squared analyses for eastern grey kangaroos showed grazing, tree cover, grass height, elevation and slope were important in that order. For the red-necked wallaby, tree cover, grazing, grass height, shrub cover, slope and elevation were most important in that order. For macropod species richness, grazing, tree cover, grass height, shrub cover, slope and elevation were most important in that order. The whiptail wallaby was only present at the Wivenhoe study area, with fire within the previous 6 months, grazing (especially by cattle), an open shrub and tree cover, short (&amp;lt5 cm) grass, and greenness of grass key covariate habitat variables. The research outcomes suggest that fire has an indirect impact on the distribution of eastern grey kangaroos and whiptail wallabies. This is because it affects the life cycles of the grasses eaten by these macropod species so the grass is unable to reproduce. Growth of trees and shrubs closes around grassy areas so that the growth of the grasses preferred by the wallabies is prevented. The research outcomes depended on a community survey and field surveys to determine where macropod species were present in the study area. Photos were shown to residents for identification of wallaby species. The results of these surveys were then used to target macropod fecal pellet surveys, direct searches and habitat surveys for 80 sites extending over a large area of Brisbane Forest Park and adjacent areas of Samford Valley and Wivenhoe Dam. ANOVA, regression models and hierarchical partitioning were used to identify significance relationships between the presence/absence of the eastern grey kangaroo, the red necked wallaby and the count of macropod scats (all species) and key environmental and habitat covariates. The key implication for management is that a less frequent fire regime within Brisbane Forest Park is resulting in a more closed habitat structure that is not suitable for the eastern grey kangaroo, the red necked wallaby and the whiptail wallaby, although the red-necked wallaby appears to least affected by these changes. If a key management objective is to increase macropod presence in Brisbane Forest Park, especially whiptail wallaby presence, then a more frequent burning regime of every 2-3 years is required. This would create a more open-habitat mosaic and encourage the regeneration of grasses such as kangaroo grass (Themeda triandra) preferred by the whiptail wallaby. Kangaroo grass is one of the dominant grasses in Brisbane Forest Park, and is less common when burning every 3-4 years than when it is more frequent. Burning also should be in winter months to encourage kangaroo grass dominance. However, other considerations such as smoke pollution of Brisbane and a community preference for wet eucalypt forest and rainforest may preclude a more frequent fire regime.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158202</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conversation repair and adult acquired hearing impairment</field><field name="creator">Lind, Simon Christopher</field><field name="description">Adults with acquired hearing impairment report that miscommunications and their repair occur with such frequency and severity that they adversely affect their enjoyment of and participation in daily conversation. As a result repair behaviours have become targets of rehabilitation services. However, little is known of the patterns of repair as they are influenced by an acquired hearing impairment, particularly the reliability and validity of the clinical assessment of these behaviours. This thesis reports on three studies into repairs that arose in audio-recordings of free conversation between hearing impaired adults and their chosen frequent communication partners, using the analytic method of Conversation Analysis. The aims of the research were to establish what types of repair were more likely to arise in conversations involving adults with acquired hearing impairment, how these were resolved and whether their occurrence in clinical samples provided reliable and valid images of the same behaviour arising in everyday interactions. In the first study, seven adults with severe or greater acquired hearing impairment each undertook a 20-minute free conversation with their chosen frequent communication partner. Analyses focused on the repair sequences occurring across speaker turns. Only the other-initiated self-repairs initiated by the hearing impaired participant occurred significantly more often than the same sequence initiated by the communication partners. No difference was found in the number of turns taken to resolve repairs when classified by hearing status of the speaker of the repair initiator. Qualitative analysis indicated that the location of the repair initiator in the immediate vicinity of the miscommunicated portion of talk, rather than the content of the repair initiator, provided a cue to the conversation partner about the location of the trouble source. Results suggest certain repair sequences are more likely to be affected by the presence of an acquired hearing impairment than others and that partners work together to efficiently resolve miscommunications. In order to assess the reliability of clinical sampling of repair, four couples, meeting the same criteria as in study one, each undertook four 20-minute conversations over two visits to the clinic in study two. Goodness-of-fit analysis across the four samples for each dyad indicated substantial variation in the number of repairs between dyads, but when samples recorded on the same visit were combined, the resulting 40-minute samples demonstrated substantially greater sampling reliability. In study three, the same four couples who participated in study two audio-recorded two to three hours of conversation in their homes in order to assess the validity of clinical samples. Similar proportions of repairs were initiated in the clinic and home recordings both by the hearing impaired adults and their frequent communication partners. In summary, these two studies indicated that clinical sampling of repair provided useful, reliable and valid images of the same behaviour as it occurred in everyday settings. Together, the three studies demonstrated that acquired hearing impairment influenced the frequency and conduct of certain repair behaviours, and that familiar communication partners successfully used various strategies to resolve miscommunications. These results provide a basis for clinical assessment and intervention for these behaviours.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321025 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Hearing and Speech</field><field name="subject">730111 Hearing, vision, speech and their disorders</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158203</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DONA STELLA AND HER RIVALS</field><field name="creator">D'Avila Winter, Isabel Maria</field><field name="description">Creative Project &#150; Dona Stella and her Rivals is a multivoiced novel about perception and misperception, and love&#146;s capacity for both destruction and renewal. Set in Lisbon in the early half of the twentieth century, it tells the story of Dona Stella and her faithless husband, the composer Maestro Luis Afonses Pereira, whose death is foretold in the opening scene. From there many narrators recount their overlapping stories that lead to the maestro&#146;s death. These voices at times obfuscate events, and, at other times, inadvertently reveal what no single character can know.

Critical Essay &#150; &#147;Who was the strange Mr Person: and which part of him, exactly, should we disbelieve&#148; is an essay about the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa (1888 &#150; 1936). Pessoa is best known for his remarkable capacity to create multiple writing selves &#150; his &#145;heteronyms&#146; &#150; complete with different styles and different personalities. Even during his life-time Pessoa &#150; whose name translates to &#145;person&#146; &#150; was aware that he was becoming a myth of freak creative genius. Part of him fuelled this myth, but always with a sense of self-irony that critics often miss. In the essay I investigate the myth surrounding Pessoa and what clues it may contain to the man behind the many personas. Who then was this strange Mr Person? What was he telling us about poetry, creativity and the self? What was he like? Who sat at his table? These are some of the questions that became inevitable while conducting research for a novel that explores multiplicity, and is set in Lisbon at the time that Pessoa walked its cobbled streets. Note: &#145;Mr Person&#146; as a sobriquet for Fernando Pessoa was borrowed from Iain Bamforth, who used it in his article &#147;Looking forMr Person&#148;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158204</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defining and understanding internal brown fleck in tubers of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)</field><field name="creator">Harper, Stephen Mark</field><field name="description">There are numerous internal browning disorders of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers that seriously affect the marketing of this important staple throughout the world. A search of the scientific literature (Chapter 2) revealed that these disorders have generally not been well defined nor are they well understood. In Australia, the term, brown fleck (BF), has been widely used to describe the presence of any internal browning. This disorder, or at least one form thereof, is especially serious in spring (i.e. grown over winter) crops in Queensland. As with most internal disorders of potato tubers, improper definition and poor evaluation of possible causes has hindered the development of a successful field management strategy. This study was initiated (i) to clearly describe the initiation and development of BF, both at the microscopic and macroscopic levels and (ii) to evaluate its possible causes, thereby developing ways that may reduce its impact in commercial crops. A cytological study on potato (cv. Sebago) tubers was conducted to evaluate the initiation and development of BF lesions (Chapter 3). Two forms of BF were observed. The first was initiated early in tuber development (77 days after planting (DAP)). This form of BF resulted in the death of individual phloem sieve cells (PSC) in the tuber medulla and spread to adjacent PSC and healthy parenchyma cells (PC). Symptom development accelerated through to maturity (112 DAP). A further form of BF developed late in maturity (100-112 DAP) where starch amyloplasts of healthy PC browned but occurred independently of the presence of BF in proximal PSC. This study demonstrated that two discrete forms of BF exist and that these forms may have different causes that possibly require different management strategies for their control. Many published studies have shown high variability in using a visual rating to estimate the incidence of internal disorders, including BF, and evaluate possible treatment effects. To overcome this problem of high variability, a computer-based digital imaging technique was developed (Chapter 3) that quantifies the area of tuber tissue visibly affected with BF and allows the calculation of previously unused BF indices and more accurate statistical evaluation of treatment effects. Published scientific information has implicated high temperature in the development of browning disorders of potato tubers. To study this aspect, a series of glasshouse experiments was conducted to evaluate the effects of air and soil temperature on the incidence of BF (Chapter 4). A low incidence of BF was observed at a continuous day/night temperature (DNT) of 18/13oC but was substantially increased at 23/18oC and 28/23oC DNT during tuber development and especially from 91 DAP (Experiment 4.1). Experiment 4.2 showed that the incidence of BF increased with increased duration of exposure (0, 1, 2 and 4 d) to a 28/23oC DNT regime. It is noteworthy that BF incidence at 28/13oC DNT was not different from that at 18/13oC DNT suggesting that elevated day temperature did not increase BF incidence (Experiment 4.3). However, the incidence of BF (total area affected with BF plant-1) at 28/23oC DNT was six-fold greater than that at 28/13oC DNT (552.3 and 92.2 mm2 plant-1 respectively). This clearly demonstrated that BF development was increased by elevated night temperature. Experiment 4.4 evaluated the relative effects of air (18/13oC and 23/18oC DNT) and soil temperature (18oC, 23oC and 28oC) on BF incidence. This increased with increased soil and air temperature. Increasing soil temperature at a 23/18oC air DNT did not significantly increase the number of BF lesions per tuber but did increase the average lesion size and consequently the area affected with BF. The overall conclusion from the series of experiments on temperature effects was that (i) elevated night temperature and (ii) elevated soil temperature increased the incidence of BF. However, the presence of BF, albeit low, in the continuous 18/13oC DNT treatments suggested that factors other than high temperature induce BF or affect lesion development. Indeed, within the literature, the plant&#146;s nutritional status has been implicated in affecting the development of internal disorders of potato tubers (Chapter 2). Consequently, a series of field and glasshouse experiments was conducted to evaluate the effects of calcium (Ca) (up to 127 kg ha-1) and boron (B) (up to 5.0 kg ha-1) on BF incidence. In this study (Chapter 5), the application of Ca or B did not significantly reduce the incidence of BF. The previous studies on temperature effects (Chapter 4) had shown that the incidence of BF is positively correlated with foliage mass. A series of experiments was conducted, therefore, to evaluate the role of assimilate partitioning in the development of BF. Given that BF development was found to be directly related to elevated night temperature and foliage dry mass, and initially occurred in the PSC alone, it was hypothesised that high foliar respiration of assimilate reserves may induce an assimilate deficit in the tubers resulting in PSC death. Two glasshouse experiments evaluated the effects of weekly foliar sucrose supplementation (0-4%), from 56-107 DAP, (Experiment 6.1) and CO2 enrichment of the atmosphere (Experiment 6.2) (1080 &#236;mol mol-1 for 7 d from 94 DAP) on the incidence of BF. Foliar sucrose application increased tuber fresh yield but did not significantly affect BF incidence. Enrichment with CO2 consistently increased the incidence of BF above that in untreated control plants, suggesting that reduced assimilate supply does not cause the initial death of PSC. Three field experiments (Experiments 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5) evaluated the effects of foliage removal, shading and covering of plants with plastic at night (to increase temperature) on BF incidence. Removal of 25-100% of the foliage at 91 DAP consistently reduced BF incidence in mature tubers (115 DAP), but neither shading nor covering with plastic had significant effects. A final study on the phenology of BF development and its relationship to specific weather and yield variables was conducted (Chapter 7). The incidence of BF was positively correlated with leaf dry mass, night temperature and soil temperature, but not to day temperature, relative humidity or solar radiation, thus supporting the previous experimental results. This study has provided improved descriptions of BF, both microscopically and macroscopically, and developed a computer-based procedure to measure its incidence. Factors that increased BF in tubers of cv. Sebago include high air temperature, especially at night, and high soil temperature. Experimental evidence has also been provided that shows a positive relationship between BF and yields of foliage and tubers. There was no influence on BF incidence of Ca or B applications to the soil studied. The evidence presented suggests that the incidence of BF is related to increased night-time assimilate loading to the tubers causing cell damage. Further research is needed, however, to confirm this conclusion, specifically to determine the initial cause of PSC death. At the practical level, the experimental results suggest that BF may be best managed by potato growers monitoring their crop from flowering onwards for the first incidence of BF in tubers. Short term weather outlooks can then be used to predict the likelihood of conditions favourable for the development of BF (especially periods of elevated night temperature). If crops are near to maturity, tubers would be harvested should this seem likely. Furthermore, it is suggested that crops should be grown under conditions to reduce vigorous foliar development, this being achieved, for example, by ensuring that irrigation and nutrition are not excessive. Further research is required to manage plant foliage to reduce BF incidence without decreasing tuber yield.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158205</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Test Bed for the Development of Eddy Current Inspection Techniques for Non Ferrous Heat Exchangers</field><field name="creator">Turner, Michael Martyn</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development and implementation of a test bed for the investigation of eddy current inspection techniques used in the examination of nonferrous heat exchangers found in thermal power stations. This thesis is the product of a research project funded by the Queensland electricity industry and is also the report of its progress. The pressures placed on the environment by the emission of green house gasses and the commercial pressure to decrease the cost of electricity generation has lead to a change in plant inspection philosophy. With the development of nuclear power generation the need for safe reliable operation led to the development of heat exchanger inspection techniques. These techniques placed a priority on guaranteed results with little emphasis on cost. The techniques developed were slow and labour intensive. They were therefor inappropriate for use in non-critical inspections. With the change in environmental policy a move was made within the Queensland electricity industry to develop a cheap effective method to inspect balance of plant heat exchangers in thermal power stations. The development of computer based analysis techniques highlighted basic deficiencies in the theory generally applied to eddy current testing of heat exchangers. This resulted in the commissioning of a project to investigate the process of heat exchanger inspection and develop a more efficient technique to carry out the task. This thesis is the report on the main stream research carried out for this project. The thesis reviews the current techniques available for the inspection of non-ferrous tubing. It covers main stream techniques, as well as specialised and experimental processes. The results of the review indicate that eddy current inspection is still the most appropriate method. A review of the research being undertaken into eddy current inspection was carried out. The review highlighted the pure physics approaches being taken and concluded that their complexity ruled them out for practical implementation. The parametric approaches showed much greater promise and a recommendation for the implementation of some findings was made. The review also highlighted the lack of data for further investigation and indicated the path for the continuation of the project. To enable investigation to be carried out a review of the current state of test instruments was carried out. This review indicated that commercial equipment was unsuitable for research purposes. A design for a modern test instrument was developed using the latest digital concepts and electronics. This equipment allowed data to be collected in its pure form with no black box electronics modifying the raw data. The equipment was prototyped and found to be successful. To enable the accurate collection of data an eddy current probe manipulator was designed. It allows the probe to be manipulated in such a manner as to ensure the probe position and velocity is know and is accurate. The development of an air bearing was carried out to ensure the minimum transmission of mechanical noise to the data being collected. The design of the manipulator was successful for use within the bounds of current standards but will require modification to exceed these standards. To enable the analysis of the electromagnetic effects on defect parameters a technique for the production of artificial defects was developed. Plain defects were designed and a series of defects manufactured. At this point, due to a change in the political climate, the funding for the project was removed. This prevented the implementation of the final stage of data collection and theory development. The thesis then indicated the steps required to bring the project to a fruitful conclusion and those for further development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158206</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploration of the effect on community collaboration and interaction with the introduction of a community website</field><field name="creator">Bartlett, Keiran Michael</field><field name="description">In the outer-western suburbs of Brisbane, the Moggill Community Association (MCA) has attempted to assist the growth of intra-community interaction around local issues and events through the use of technology. The research literature includes some reference to this kind of community support, indicating the potential of simple and easily-accessible technologies such as the Internet or public message boards. An initial exploration of whether or not such effect occurs was the purpose of this study. As interaction enablers such as the Internet, mobile communication and pervasive computing become ubiquitous across societies, members of collocated communities such as Moggill begin to use them to communicate and collaborate on issues of local importance. Where communities are searching for ways to increase their interactive effectiveness, it might be expected that these forms of technology are included as part of the search. However, this had not happened in the studied group. Despite a self-expressed community need for interaction enablers, the Moggill community had made no attempt to use the Internet or other modern communication technologies for this purpose. The aim in this thesis was to explore whether or not specific electronic technology introduced into a community context where improved communication and collaboration are sought affect possibilities for community interaction. This study was limited to a single community in order to provide a rich description of the case. In turn such a description might guide discussion on whether further studies are warranted, and if so, might be suggestive about how these might be designed. The study was conducted in a layered approach incorporating four progressively-informing steps. First, an initial exploration was performed using informal, free-form interviews to assay what members of the Moggill Community Association (MCA) perceived the needs of the community to be. Second, a design probe was developed to test the usefulness of technology to communicate ideas garnered in the interviews. This probe was a simple web-based interface to information previously distributed by the MCA Executive. Third, a participatory design exercise was run to help participants describe what they thought was needed to assist their communication and collaboration tasks. Fourth, prompts from the participatory design exercise were used to improve the design probe. Results taken from the exercises and the usage statistics of the design probes implied that sections of the community were interested not only in receiving the information the site supplied, but also in creating new information for distribution. This finding provides tentative support for a theory that web technologies positively affect community-expressed needs for better communication and collaboration, and a basis for supporting the further investigation of the phenomenon with larger samples.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158207</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#145;FOOD TO GO ROUND&#146; NEGOTIATING HEALTHY EATING FOR MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AMONG SOME URBAN INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIANS</field><field name="creator">Foley, Wendy Lynne</field><field name="description">Approaching the diabetes problem through an in-depth, multi-generational study of Indigenous Australians&#146; food practices and experiences of nutrition promotion for diabetes management, this socially situated research contrasts with the individualistic biomedical dietary discourse presented in much of the literature. Dietary change is mostly discussed in the literature abstracted from the domestic struggles that such change engenders. This research fills a gap in the literature by using ethnographic methods of participant observation and in-depth interviews to provide an emic account of urban Indigenous foodways. It explores negotiation of healthy eating for diabetes management and prevention within families and with health professionals. The dramatic increase in diabetes prevalence amongst Indigenous Australians that occurred during the 20th century is overviewed in the light of explanations for this proposed in the literature. It is well documented that diabetes in Australia is associated with poverty, however genetic predisposition and unhealthy lifestyle explanations have wider currency than the disadvantageous socio-political environments that have circumscribed Aboriginal peoples&#146; lifeworlds since colonisation. The fieldwork was conducted over two years in a Brisbane community, building the research activities around existing activities of the Indigenous Health Program and the Elders&#146; Corporation to lessen the inherent power imbalances between the researcher and the researched. In-depth interviews were recorded with 31 people and coded thematically using NVivo software. An audit of the local cost of recommended foods and a discourse analysis of popular cookery media were conducted. Healthy cooking workshops were also facilitated in the last phase of the fieldwork. While there is increasing focus in the literature on the role of diet in diabetes prevention, greater emphasis is placed on dietary management and there is little integration of preventive action in nutrition promotion for diabetes management. In contrast, this research explored the nexus between diabetes dietary management and prevention in families and examines factors involved in changing or not changing family eating practices. The research showed that while many people, especially women, strive to achieve healthy diets, negotiating family dietary changes challenges food budgets, food culture and family harmony. Bourdieu&#146;s concept of the &#145;habitus&#146; is used to explore what food is considered &#145;normal&#146; in this community. It was found to differ from nutritionists&#146; categories of healthy food and the stylish food featured in popular healthy cooking discourses. The individualistic approach of nutrition promotion for diabetes management was found to perpetuate perceptions about &#145;special&#146; healthy food for people with diabetes, limiting family approaches to healthy eating that could simultaneously contribute to diabetes prevention and management. It also contrasts with the family and community oriented reality of those with diabetes who feel torn between eating with family for social health and eating separate, healthy food for diabetes. Power relations in negotiating healthy eating are a significant issue for the participants and this theme is explored by an analysis of communication with health professionals. Habermas&#146; theory of communicative action illuminates how power imbalances distort these interactions. It is concluded that nutrition promotion engages too much with nutrition &#145;rules&#146; but too little with the social and environmental factors that influence eating practices and so does too little to empower people in their real life dealings with food. Foucault&#146;s concept of bio-power was relevant too, in that many participants have internalised the individualist focus of health promotion and feel guilty about the dietary compromises they make, although these are frequently to do with financial viability and familial harmony and not with unthinking disregard for personal health. Thus the very practices that are designed to ameliorate the impact of diabetes actually provide fertile ground for worsening it by promoting negative self-evaluations and low self-efficacy. It is concluded that nutrition advice for diabetes management limits preventive action and is often at odds with balancing the social, economic and health needs of Indigenous Australians. It is recommended that building rapport with people to establish therapeutic alliances for diabetes dietary management is essential to facilitate informed negotiation about healthy eating within its social context. However, these micro changes can only be truly fruitful when the social and structural factors that perpetuate the economic and political marginalisation of Indigenous Australians are addressed. A social justice approach is recommended to more effectively address diabetes in Indigenous Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158208</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robustness in Boolean Models of Genetic Regulatory Systems</field><field name="creator">Willadsen, Kai</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on characterising and understanding robustness in Boolean models of genetic regulatory systems, both in terms of abstract models &#151; specifi- cally the Random Boolean Network model &#151; and in terms of models of real-world regulatory systems. More specifically, the characterisation of robustness to state perturbation is considered in terms of features of a system&#146;s dynamic structure (state space) such as attractors and attractor basins. This perspective on robustness seeks to quantify the long-term behavioural effects of perturbation in models of genetic regulatory systems. Robustness is studied within the conceptual framework of a system&#146;s state space and the structures of that state space. Schemas &#151; a way of representing multiple system states in a compact fashion &#151; are used to characterise the structure of state spaces and the complexity of the decisions made by a system&#146;s state space. The first study introduces a formal definition of robustness to perturbation, termed coherency, in terms of switching between basins of attraction in a discrete dynamic system. The formal definition allows bounds (upper, random and lower) to be established on the expected coherency of basins of attraction with respect to attractor basin size. The structure of system state space determines these bounds, with the upper bound defined by a highly structured state space, and the random bound defined by an unstructured space. Experiments measuring coherency with respect to basin size in the Random Boolean Network model show that network connectivity has the effect of moving the coherency of attractor basins between the upper bound (at low-connectivity) and the random bound (as the network becomes completely connected). The second study extends the investigation of state-space structures and robustness. As is common in genetic regulatory systems modelling, the assumption is made that the dynamic behaviour of a genetic regulatory system can be reasonably represented in terms of a state space. A series of conjectures is formulated to test common conceptions about state-space properties of genetic regulatory systems, and these conjectures are then investigated in the context of the Random Boolean Network model. The results of these investigations fail to support many of the conjectured properties, and highlight that common expectations about attractor basin structure from low-dimensional systems, such as that attractors are privileged states, are not necessarily applicable within high-dimensional systems. The final study investigates the robustness to state perturbation of Boolean models of real-world genetic regulatory systems&#151;specifically the Drosophila melanogaster segment polarity network and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell-cycle network &#151; by applying the robustness measurements and investigating the state-space properties established in the first and second studies. The results of these investigations demonstrate that the state spaces of these models of real-world systems are comparable to the state spaces created by the abstract Random Boolean Network model in terms of the relationship between basin of attraction structure and robustness. In addition, the results showed that while both systems were robust, state-space structure played a variable role in the robustness of the system, with the Drosophila network showing a much more structured state-space than the yeast network. It is conjectured that the degree to which a system relies upon basin size as opposed to state-space structure in maintaining system robustness depends on the type of system. Specifically, systems such as the Drosophila segment polarity network that can take advantage of environmental cues are able to maintain robustness in a simple state space, while the yeast cell-cycle network is required to make complicated decisions that limit the degree to which it can use state-space structure to maintain robust behaviour. The results of this series of studies demonstrate that investigating system robustness in terms of state-space structure is a valuable and useful approach to understanding robustness in models of genetic regulatory systems. The conjecture about the relationship between the context of real-world genetic regulatory systems and their state-space structure is testable, and can be used to guide future investigations of robustness in models of real-world systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158209</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ANYONE FOR RICE?

In this thesis I present four related case studies, each exploring the ways in which various textual productions within food culture, and culinary tourism in particular, negotiate the cross-hatched issues of cultural labour, ethnic identities, multicultural representation and nationalism in the Australian context. These case studies are based on my readings of Food Lovers&#146; Guide to Australia (2005) produced by Maeve O&#146;Meara and Joanna Savill, Banquet (1999) by Annette Shun Wah and Greg Aitkin, Kylie Kwong&#146;s Heart and Soul (2003) and various promotional materials produced by Fairfield City Council, which construct the suburb of Cabramatta as an ethnic food-scape. I examine each of these sites in relation to the discourses of cultural and ethnic diversity which they reflect and produce, as well as the material conditions of power in which they circulate. I have selected texts with a specifically multicultural aspect, and each of those chosen is authored, produced or hosted by Asian-Australian cultural workers, or represents Asian-Australian foods and identities. I am particularly interested in the discursive construction of Asian- Australian identities, both produced and productive within these sites, and the understandings those constructions bring to bear for broader readings of Australian multiculturalism. This thesis examines a range of food related media such as cookbooks, food shows, websites and pamphlets and treats them as significant sites for cultural analysis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158210</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading Authority and Subjectivity Cross-Culturally: Some Women&#8217;s Fiction and Autobiography Since the 1950s</field><field name="creator">Ms Leili Golafshani</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420000 Language and Culture</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159361</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geometric Algorithms for Machine Dynamics</field><field name="creator">Hillier, Nicholas Simon</field><field name="description">The forward dynamics problem of mechanism and machine theory is the problem of determining the motion that results when arbitrary forces and torques are applied to the links of a mechanism by actuators and exogenous sources. The linearized dynamics problem is that of constructing a linearized model of the forward dynamics, e.g. a local state-space model, along an arbitrary state-trajectory. Both problems arise in the application of modern estimation and control methods to machinery. This thesis develops recursive algorithms for computing the forward dynamics and linearized dynamics for rigid-body mechanisms of both open-tree and closed-loop forms. The emphasis of the thesis is upon developing a framework to perform these calculations which is generally applicable and is formulated using coordinate independent principles. The framework presented uses geometric ideas and draws on the representation of the group of rigid body motions in three dimensions by the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras. The thesis first develops methods for computing the forward and linearized dynamics of serial chain mechanisms. Such mechanisms find common application as robotic manipulators and the forward and linearized dynamic solutions are illustrated using the PUMA560 robotic manipulator. The material covered establishes the ground work for the calculation of forward and linearized dynamics for linkages having closed kinematic loops. The formulation of the forward dynamics for closed-loop mechanisms is developed by extending the formulation developed for open-loop linkages by (i) making virtual cuts of the to &#147;open&#148; the closed loops and (ii) computing the constraint forces required to maintain closure using the principal of virtual work. Similar ideas have been adopted by previous workers, however the method presented here is claimed to be superior in its notation, its formulation, and in the completeness and generality of the description. The formulation includes a novel method for evaluating the constraint forces at the virtual cuts. The approach is illustrated by two examples: a spatial six-bar mechanism and an 11-bar linkage used as the excavation arm for a class of large hydraulic excavators. These investigations include a study of the effect of &#147;cut-joint&#148; selection on algorithm accuracy and cost. The formulation of the linearized dynamics for closed-loop linkages extends that presented for the forward dynamics of closed-loop linkages, again making use of a Lie-group theoretic representation. The presented solution breaks new ground by being the first exact, analytical solution to this problem. All previous work in this area has been based on the numerical method of finite differences. The evaluation of the analytical solution is shown to be faster than a finite difference numerical solution and more accurate. The algorithm is illustrated using the 11-bar closed loop excavation arm. The methods for forward and linearized dynamics developed in this thesis are demonstrated in the context of an optimal estimation problem typical of where they might find application in the evaluation of process model dynamics. The specific problem is that of estimating the payload dug at each pass of a hydraulic excavator. This is a critical problem for the open-cut mining sector. The excavator is that used earlier to illustrate the forward and linearized dynamics algorithms, and the study includes an investigation of the trade-off in process model complexity versus payload accuracy.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158211</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN THE TEACHING AND LEARNING OF STATISTICS: EDUCATIONAL ISSUES AND PRACTICES</field><field name="creator">Li, Wing Kin Ken</field><field name="description">Statistics education has tended to focus on mathematical and mechanical aspects of knowledge. This does not empower students to apply these aspects of statistical knowledge to solve problems generally arising from a specific context. The teaching and learning of statistics should therefore aim at developing problem-solving heuristics, that is, &#145;how to think what to do&#146; rather than &#145;how to do&#146;. Hence, statistics curricula should shift the focus from mathematical calculations to tasks of a practical nature that can be more easily understood by students (Pfannkuch, 2000; Snee, 1993) and stress the ability to apply, evaluate and interpret statistical ideas (Chance, 1997). To achieve this kind of change, teaching should no longer be seen as transfer of knowledge but as a process of engaging students with learning activities in which they develop ownership of knowledge. Information technology (IT) facilitates statistical computing and graphing, and the way educational materials are delivered. Thus, the question of what is an appropriate pedagogy for statistics teaching and learning when integrating IT into classrooms should be addressed from the joint perspectives of statisticians and educators. This thesis did so by developing, implementing and evaluating a socioculturally grounded model of pedagogy in an IT environment and related models of statistical thinking and graphical comprehension in the context of regression modelling. The model of pedagogy in an IT environment was implemented by the teacher-researcher, with students enrolled in the Higher Diploma in Applied Statistics and Computing course in the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education. Data were gathered from a questionnaire based survey, an observational study, and an experimental study to investigate patterns of social interaction associated with statistical thinking and graphing. The results of the questionnaire based survey indicated that most students held positive perceptions of learning with IT associated with productive social interactions with their learning partners and the teacher. They found their interaction with their partners collaborative and their communication beneficial to learning as it enabled them to verbalise their thoughts to sustain task-centred discussion. The observation study drew on Mercer&#146;s (1995) work to categorise student-student talk as exploratory, cumulative, or disputational. Most talk was of the exploratory type, characterised by reasoning and statistical thinking, and only a few instances were classified as cumulative when students were attempting straightforward learning tasks or maintaining harmonious social relations. No instances of disputational talk were observed. A finer grained analysis of students&#146; talk, using an adaptation of Kumpulainens&#146;s (1994) framework, identified some forms of talk that were used for maintaining social interaction, while other forms were associated with making reasoning explicit and activating higher order thinking for a variety of sophisticated tasks, for instance, deducing practical implications for regression parameters. Nevertheless, students&#146; actual progress in regression tasks was linked to the teacher&#146;s interventions. The teacher adopted a combination of means of assisting performance (Tharp &amp; Gallimore, 1988): modelling, questioning, cognitive structuring and contingency management to guide students&#146; thinking towards knowledge construction as well as problem solving. The experimental study compared students&#146; performance in a test involving preliminary examination of regression data with and without, and before and after, peer collaboration. It revealed that students who had pre-task discussion demonstrated better understanding of regression data than those who had no discussion. More interestingly, students who had pre-task discussion gave more complex and connected responses (SOLO analysis) than those who had post-task or no discussion. The extent to which peer collaboration affects students&#146; performance in statistical thinking and statistical graphing tasks may depend on the quality of group discussion and the nature of students&#146; participation and involvement in that discussion. This thesis presents both theoretical proposals and empirical results regarding how students learn statistics in an IT environment. As well as adding the body of work in this field, it provides a practical test case for the use of sociocultural ideas in having students assume greater responsibility for their own learning. The findings from this research demonstrated that collaborative group work with computers can facilitate social interaction and learning in a statistics classroom and help students to appreciate the learning environment fostered by computers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158212</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the Edge of Their Seats: The Novel Manuscript 'Frantic', and the critical essay 'Suspense in Fiction: Its Operation and Techniques'</field><field name="creator">Howell, Katherine Leslie</field><field name="description">The thesis consists of the critical essay and the creative project. The critical essay is an investigation into the nature of narrative suspense, its operation, and the techniques by which an author can develop it. Narrative suspense requires that readers care for characters and feel uncertain about events. An author can use a number of story-telling techniques to make the most of this emotion and uncertainty. Readers may embark on a variety of activities including imagining outcomes and piecing together clues, and these too can be utilised by the author to build suspense. Following the examination of the subject, I explore the development of the drafts of Frantic with particular emphasis on how my research into suspense changed my approach to characterisation, structure, and the process of writing. The creative project is the manuscript Frantic, a crime thriller set in present-day Sydney. When Paramedic Sophie Phillips&#146; husband Chris is shot and their baby kidnapped, Detective Ella Marconi struggles to solve the case. Evidence suggests the act may be revenge by a bereaved father for Sophie&#146;s failure to save a mother and her newborn, and equally that senior constable Chris may have been involved in the police corruption that increasingly appears rife.

One protein critical for epithelial polarization and cell-cell adhesion is the epithelial cadherin, or E-cadherin protein. Although the adhesive function of E-cadherin is mediated primarily at the cell surface, E-cadherin undergoes complex internalisation and intracellular trafficking in response various different physiological circumstances. The mechanisms that regulate these pathways remain poorly defined. A central aim of this thesis has been to characterise the pathways and machinery that regulate internalisation of E-cadherin. To this end, mammary adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells were examined for E-cadherin trafficking, cell-cell adhesion and morphogenetic status in response to stimulation with various growth factors, primarily fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), which play a key role in mammary development and tumourigenesis. FGF stimulation induced the cointernalisation of E-cadherin and the FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) into early endosomes, resulting in disrupted cell-cell adhesion. FGFR1 translocated to the nucleus in response to a number of stimuli. These studies reveal endocytosis as an initial, requisite step for the subsequent nuclear translocation of FGFR1 by a still uncharacterised pathway. In a novel finding, the E-cadherin-catenin complex was found to conversely regulate signalling and nuclear translocation of FGFR1 in response to ligand. The internalisation pathway for E-cadherin was found to be independent of caveolin-1, yet only displayed partial dependence on classical clathrin-based endocytic pathways, suggesting the potential of either an unusual endocytic pathway or of multiple internalisation pathways. Interestingly, stimulation of the same cell type with an alternate growth factor, epidermal growth factor (EGF) resulted in internalisation of free E-cadherin through macropinocytosis, without disruption to polarized adhesion. Surprisingly, neither of these pathways resulted in a significant reduction in E-cadherin protein levels. Additional analyses of cellular machinery revealed recruitment of members of the sorting nexin (SNX) protein family to E-cadherin-containing vesicles, whereby SNX1 was noted to regulate intracellular sorting of E-cadherin away from the degradative pathway. Analysis of the morphogenetic effect of cadherin internalisation revealed that whilst a number of stimuli were able to induce internalisation of E-cadherin, stimulation with FGF alone was able to induce scattering and migratory activity in MCF-7 cells. Curiously, this behaviour was independent of E-cadherin expression, revealing a novel partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (pEMT) in response to FGF. These findings underscore the notion that E-cadherin is able to utilise multiple pathways for internalisation, depending on growth factors, and on cellular context. Finally, studies using epithelial cell lines embedded in extracellular matrix to form glandular like structures suggest the potential for intracellular trafficking of E-cadherin to be studied in 3-D using epithelial cell culture models. These studies reveal the existence of alternate pathways for E-cadherin internalisation and provide an important insight in the differential regulation of E-cadherin localization and function under different physiological circumstances.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158214</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of endoscopic ultrasound and computed tomography for the staging and determination of resectability of pancreatic cancer</field><field name="creator">Devereaux, Benedict Michael</field><field name="description">Pancreatic cancer remains a dismal disease. Despite vast advances in pancreas imaging technology over the past three decades, our ability to predict a patient's suitability for attempted curative surgical resection remains very limited. The two primary objectives of this body of work were to critically appraise the available literature comparing computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and then compare the latest generations of these two techniques in a prospective study. The most common imaging modalities currently used in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancers are CT and EUS. Because of the controversy of this issue and inconsistent findings of the published studies, the literature is reviewed systematically to answer the question, &amp;quotDoes the current literature define which is the superior imaging modality, EUS or CT, for the preoperative assessment of pancreatic cancer?&amp;quot This paper attempts to compare the test characteristics of EUS and CT across studies. More importantly, the methodological rigor of each study is assessed according to standards for assessing the validity of studies evaluating diagnostic tests. Between 1992 and June 2001, fourteen published studies appeared in the literature comparing endoscopic ultrasound and computed tomography for the staging and lor determination of resectability of pancreatic neoplasms, pancreatic and ampullary neoplasms or pancreatic and biliary neoplasms. Ten studies concluded that EUS was superior to CT for the staging of pancreatic cancer, while three concluded that EUS was inferior to CT for the determination of resectability of pancreatic cancer. One study concluded that EUS and CT were equivalent for the staging of pancreatic cancer. A large, prospective study was needed to determine the optimal imaging modality. During a two Fellowship at Indiana University Medical Centre in Indianapolis, Indiana, in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic ultrasound the author established a multidisciplinary group for the study of pancreatic neoplasms. The author formulated and conducted the study: Comparison of endoscopic ultrasonography and multidetector computed tomography for detecting and staging pancreatic cancer. This was a prospective, single-center, observational study. Of the 482 patients screened, 154 were eligible and 120 were enrolled. No procedural complications fkom CT or endoscopic ultrasonography were noted. Of 104 patients, 63 (61%) underwent surgery. In this study, endoscopic ultrasonography was superior to multidetector CT for tumour detection and tumour staging but equivalent for nodal staging and determination of resectability of preoperatively suspected locoregional pancreatic cancer. These data suggest that detection of peritumoural adenopathy is not essential for assessing resectability of pancreatic neoplasms, particularly for masses located in the head of the pancreas. No significant difference was found between endoscopic ultrasonography and multidetector CT for preoperative determination of tumour resectability. Importantly, concordance for resectability between these tests does not seem to improve assessment compared with either test alone. Therefore, if multidetector CT detects a pancreatic mass that appears resectable in an appropriate surgical candidate with suspected cancer, preoperative endoscopic ultrasonography does not seem to be necessary unless tissue confirmation of suspected cancer is desired. However, when multidetector CT fails to detect a mass in patients with suspected pancreatic cancer, we believe that preoperative endoscopic ultrasonography is necessary for tumour detection. This study and the extensive review of the published literature affirms the role of EUS in the preoperative assessment of pancreatic cancer. One of the key factors limiting the applicability of this study's results is the unavailability of expert endosonographers in Australia. The challenge, therefore will be to adequately train therapeutic endoscopists in this technique making EUS available to patients with pancreatic cancer.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158215</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planning for persistence: using the risk of extinction in multi-species approaches to conservation planning</field><field name="creator">Nicholson, Emily</field><field name="description">Although the primary aim of conservation planning is the persistence of biodiversity, methods for planning for multiple species that include the amount, quality and configuration of habitat remain elusive. Traditional reserve selection methods aim to represent different species and ecosystems within a system of conservation areas, and while they can deal with multiple species concurrently, they do not account for species&#146; persistence. This inability to deal with adequacy, a major principle of conservation planning, is a serious problem for those advocating systematic conservation planning. One of the few ways of measuring the viability of a species is through the use of population models. Stochastic population models have been used in single-species analyses to optimise the selection and management of conservation areas, but generally cannot be used in a multiple-species reserve optimisation framework due to extensive computational requirements. Measures of viability for a diversity of species encapsulate a greater array of biodiversity than conservation approaches based on one species alone. Thus a method that incorporates the persistence of multiple species into a decisionmaking framework is required. In this thesis, I address the lack of consideration of the viability of multiple species in conservation planning. In the first two chapters, I introduce and develop the framework for planning for the persistence of multiple species. In Chapter 2, I translate the broad goal of maximizing the viability of species into seven objective functions based on estimates of extinction risk for many species, and explore their underlying biases, strengths and shortcomings for guiding conservation decisions. I find that alternative objective functions can lead to a different ranking of management options. Therefore decision makers need to think carefully in selecting and defining their conservation goals. The importance of establishing the goals of conservation is a recurring theme throughout the thesis. In the third chapter, I present a novel method for finding optimal reserve solutions that minimize the combined extinction risk across multiple species, subject to a conservation budget. I use a spatially-explicit approximation model, developed by Frank and Wissel (2002, Am. Nat.) to estimate metapopulation extinction risk, a function of the landscape configuration and the species' ecology. I compare this method with more traditional, areabased reserve selection methods, using a ten species case study, and find that the expected loss of species is reduced drastically. Unlike previous methods for integrating the amount and spatial configuration of reserves, I avoid having to designate arbitrary weightings between reserve size and configuration; rather my method is based on population processes and is soundly grounded in ecological theory. The fourth chapter examines the impacts of the choice of species modelled, using the ten species case study and method described in Chapter 3. If the overall goal is to conserve as many species as possible, what is the consequence of choosing a subset of species? I use the focal species approach to identify a subset of three species that are the most sensitive to key processes, relating focal species criteria to the model parameters of dispersal capability, home range size and fecundity. I find that the reserve solution that minimises the expected loss of species across the three focal species also minimises species loss across the larger suite of ten species. In this case study, the focal species works in identifying a priori a suite of species that confer protection to other, co-occurring species. In the fifth chapter, I examine the impact of uncertainty on decision making for multiple species. While population models provide one of the few means of assessing the impact of alternative management options on biodiversity persistence, they are inevitably uncertain. Using information-gap theory, I assess the impact of uncertainty in key parameters for the three focal species identified in Chapter Four. I use a metapopulation model to predict the extinction risks of the species under four alternative management scenarios. Three methods are described for making conservation decisions across the three species taking into account uncertainty. I discover that it is possible to make robust conservation decisions even when the uncertainties and complexities of the multiple species problem appear overwhelming. However, the best decision when uncertainty is considered is likely to differ from when uncertainty is ignored, illustrating the importance of incorporating uncertainty into the decision-making process. In the final chapter I conclude with a brief critical assessment of the methods presented, in particular focussing on the use of the metapopulation paradigm and the Frank &amp; Wissel model, and discuss ways in which the methods presented here may be extended for more general cases. While the further development and assessment is required, the methods presented in this thesis present a step forward in the consideration of species&#146; persistence and the adequacy of reserve systems in conservation decision making.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158216</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Playing musical hopscotch: How Indigenous Australian women perform around, within and against Aboriginalism.</field><field name="creator">Barney, Katelyn Sarah</field><field name="description">Indigenous Australian women who perform contemporary music are acutely aware that Aboriginalist discourse has created unrealistic expectations and public perceptions of Indigenous Australian performance. The theory of Aboriginalism is critiqued and interrogated in this thesis in relation to Indigenous Australian women, performance, and race. This thesis addresses the complex and contradictory ways that Aboriginalist discourse fixes non-Indigenous expectations of Indigenous Australian performance, gender, and race by exploring how the performers themselves work within and against these Aboriginalist constructions through their music. One of the immediate effects of Aboriginalism is that it silences Indigenous Australians. In academic discourse and popular media, the voices of Indigenous women who perform contemporary music are rarely heard and often overlooked or ignored. This thesis aims to redress and understand this gender imbalance by focusing on Indigenous women and their contemporary music and illustrate how Indigenous Australian women performers are enacting new types of agency to negotiate their way through, around, and over one-dimensional Aboriginalist constructions of themselves to self-define more positive and diverse identities as Indigenous Australian women. This thesis is divided into four parts. Part One (Chapters One, Two, and Three) provides necessary background to the study. Chapter One introduces the topic and poses research questions in relation to Aboriginalism, Indigenous women, and contemporary performance. Chapter Two examines a number of themes which emerge in the existing literature relating to Indigenous Australian musicians performing contemporary music. Chapter Three locates Indigenous Australian women in this academic discourse and explores some possible reasons for the increasing number of contemporary music recordings by Indigenous Australian women since the 1990s. Part Two (Chapters Four, Five, and Six) positions this study theoretically and methodologically. Chapter Four outlines the theoretical framework that informs this project while Chapter Five discusses the methodological issues and challenges I faced throughout the research process. Chapter Six introduces the Indigenous women performers who took part in this study. This chapter uses the literary convention of a &#147;playlet&#148; by weaving together comments of Indigenous Australian women performers from one-on-one interviews I conducted, media excerpts about the performers, as well as my own questions and comments into a conversation which tells a story about the performers&#146; backgrounds, experiences, albums, and achievements. Part Three (Chapters Seven, Eight, and Nine) comprises the analysis chapters and examines Aboriginalism in relation to race, gender, and performance. Each of these chapters utilise theoretical discussions of Aboriginalism, excerpts from interviews with Indigenous women performers, song texts, and media representations to examine how Indigenous women perform within and against Aboriginalism. Chapter Seven focuses on how Indigenous women performers resist Aboriginalist constructs of race through performance while Chapter Eight turns the gaze to gender and Aboriginalism to explore how the performers challenge Aboriginalist representations of Indigenous women by attempting bring Indigenous women&#146;s experiences, history, and topics to the foreground through song. Chapter Nine examines the way in which Indigenous women performers steer their way through Aboriginalism in music performance by blurring musical boundaries and drawing on a diverse range of musical styles. Finally, Part Four (Chapter Ten) discusses the possibilities of moving beyond Aboriginalism and reflects on my own contribution to discourse concerning Indigenous women performers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">420303 Culture, Gender, Sexuality</field><field name="subject">410104 Indigenous Performing Arts</field><field name="subject">750201 The performing arts (incl. music, theatre and dance)</field><field name="subject">751005 Communication across languages and cultures</field><field name="subject">750309 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander development and welfare</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158217</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&amp;quotO MOTHER WHERE ART THOU?&amp;quot: AN IRIGARAYAN READING OF THE BOOK OF CHRONICLES</field><field name="creator">Kelso, Julie-Anne</field><field name="description">Throughout this thesis I argue that the Book of Chronicles silences women in specific ways, most radically through their association with maternity. Drawing upon the work of two feminist philosophers, Luce lrigaray and Michelle Boulous Walker, I argue that we may discern two principal strategies of silencing women in Chronicles: disavowal and repression of the maternal body. In it simplest form, the silencing of women takes place through both an explicit and implicit strategy of excluding them from the central narrative action. Largely banished from the central action, they are hardly able to contribute to the production of Israel's past. On a more complex level, however, women are most effectively silenced through their association with maternity, because the maternal body is both disavowed and repressed in Chronicles. The association of women with maternity, along with the disavowal and the repression of the maternal body as &amp;quotorigin&amp;quot of the masculine subject, effects and guarantees the silence of the feminine, enabling &amp;quotman&amp;quot to imagine himself as sole producer of his world. These strategies of silencing the &amp;quotfeminine&amp;quot need to be understood in relation to the relative absence of women from the narrative world of Chronicles. I argue that Chronicles depends on the absence and silence of women for its imaginary coherence.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158218</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deformities and disguises in the anxious fiction of Robert Louis Stevenson</field><field name="creator">O'Callaghan, Amanda Catherine</field><field name="description">Robert Louis Stevenson continues to enjoy popular fame for his adventure tales, Treasure Island and Kidnapped, and for his gothic crime story, Jekyll and Hyde. The popularity of these books, combined with some of his own statements and his unconventional and adventurous life, have given him a reputation as a whimsical and lightweight writer who stood aside from mainstream Victorian life. Recent criticism, especially of Jekyll and Hyde, has done much to redress this, and to show Stevenson as an essentially Victorian figure. It has not, however, shown the extent to which Stevenson internalised ideas of deviation from the normal and envisioned himself as constrained by a degenerative ethos. Stevenson's fiction came to be formed in a matrix of deep anxiety caused by chronic illness, social and familial pressure, censorship, and onerous financial burdens. The thesis assesses Stevenson's fictional works in light of his belief that he was deformed, both as an artist and as an individual, by what he saw as the degenerative power of the age in which he lived. Drawing heavily on Stevenson's correspondence, and that of his personal and literary circle, this work contends that the associated motifs of deformity, disguise and degeneration are widespread in Stevenson's fiction, and that they frequently refute the prevailing cultural attitudes of his time. The thesis explores representations of deformity in a variety of forms, including physical, social and artistic depictions. It shows that Stevenson, one of the most experimental and broad-ranging writers of his era, was forced by the dictates of an age increasingly obsessed with control and delineation to produce fiction that conformed to rigid codes of genre and style. It demonstrates that when Stevenson violated these codes - as he did with heightening determination - he was forced either to temper or to abandon the works he had created. Finally, the thesis assesses Stevenson's Pacific fiction in relation to his failed escape from - as he saw it - the oppressive and corrosive effects of the Old World, and it considers how, ultimately, notions of deformity overwhelmed the writer entirely.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420201 British and Irish</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158219</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiresolution and Semantic Caching: A Framework for Network-Based Spatial Applications</field><field name="creator">Sun, Sai</field><field name="description">Spatial data and spatial database systems have attracted a considerable amount of attention for more than three decades and have been utilized in various areas to deal with geometric, geographic and multi-dimensional data. The applications have now been extended to the network environment (referring to both the Web environment and the wireless environment in this thesis) to support map-based applications, to provide online customized spatial queries and to offer location-dependent services. The full potential of spatial applications, however, has yet to be achieved due to performance issues related to the large sizes and high complexity of spatial data. Furthermore, compared to stand-alone spatial applications and non-spatial network applications, network-based spatial applications are confronted with the following issues specific to the network environment: &amp;middot The network bandwidth constraints frequently seriously conflict with the large volume of spatial data. &amp;middot Inhomogeneous spatial data are frequently combined together to answer queries. &amp;middot Spatial data resources may be extensively used and shared by many applications for different purposes or even in different areas. &amp;middot Users of the same spatial application may require different qualities of query results. Traditional spatial database systems are not efficient or powerful enough to address the above issues as geometries of spatial objects are represented and manipulated at a fixed resolution level. It significantly wastes resources when excessive amounts of detail are retrieved that are not useful to an application. One natural way to solve these problems occurring in network-based spatial applications is to exploit the multi-resolution property of spatial objects. The driving force behind developing multiresolution approaches for network-based spatial applications is to reduce the cost of spatial query processing, spatial data retrieval, and spatial data transmission by minimizing the precision of results while still satisfying the requirements of a given application. However, proposing an applicable multiresolution approach is a non-trivial task, which encounters the following main challenges: &amp;middot With the introduction of the concept `resolution', almost all concepts in traditional spatial databases need to be revisited for a new annotation or at least some complementary explanation. To support network-based spatial applications efficiently and consistently, multiresolution approaches should be founded on a well-built multiresolution spatial domain. &amp;middot Supporting built-in simplification is one of the principal requirements of multiresolution spatial DBMS. However, it is conceptually challenging, as many aspects need to be taken into account such as the architecture of SDBMS, multiresolution spatial data structure, existing SQL predicates and spatial indexing, simplification algorithm, and system performance. &amp;middot Multiresolution approaches allow applications to access spatial data according to different resolution levels. This increases the flexibility and efficiency of spatial systems. However, accompanying these benefits, the design of multiresolution spatial data structures becomes increasingly difficult as different access patterns may favour different data-clustering methods. &amp;middot Both the structure and the semantic description of multiresolution spatial data are significantly more complex than standard data or traditional spatial data. This raises technical issues in developing a client-side caching mechanism for network-based spatial applications. To the best of our knowledge, most work in the field of multiresolution spatial databases solely focuses on proposing multiresolution spatial data structures and there has been no significant research proposed to solve the above three challenges to date. In this thesis, we survey previous work related to network-based spatial applications comprehensively, covering the most important techniques utilized in traditional spatial database systems, multiresolution data structures and client-side caching mechanisms. Based on the investigation, we propose a framework for network-based spatial applications by combining a multiresolution approach and semantic caching. By analyzing the resolution-sensitive inherent properties of the z-value, we propose approaches to solidify the implementation and measurement of resolution into data encoding. Based on this, we model a multiresolution spatial domain following in proper sequence, from the definition of multiresolution geometric primitive types to the operations to simplify these geometric types, and finally to the processing of multiresolution spatial queries. To implement the multiresolution spatial model, we further propose two multiresolution spatial data structures, the Position-Map scheme and the Bit-Map scheme. Both of the two schemes break the geometry of a spatial object into vertices and group these vertices into vertex layers according to their resolution priority values. In this way, the two schemes achieve a trade-off between the extreme fragmentation and opacity spatial data organization methods. Therefore they can efficiently support different type spatial queries. Because the partition of vertex layers is based on resolution, multiresolution operations (e.g. simplification) can be built into the spatial DMBS. Among the two data structures, the Bit-Map scheme is believed to be better as it avoids the data replication existing in most current data organization methods and overcomes the drawback of the Position-Map scheme. We then analyze the distribution of spatial data over different resolution levels, construct a cost model to estimate and optimize the storage cost of spatial data under the Bit- Map scheme. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on synthetic and real data to compare the performance of four data organizations: Single Resolution, Multi-Representation, the Position-Map scheme and the Bit-Map scheme. The results show that the Bit-Map scheme outperforms others in the I/O cost, the storage size and the response time. For improving the overall system performance of network-based spatial applications, we develop a Multiresolution Semantic Caching (MSC) model to cache multiresolution spatial data on the client side. We propose MSC query processing strategies which are inspired by our analysis of the characteristics of multiresolution spatial data and multiresolution spatial queries. MSC query processing addresses the issues in multiresolution window query trimming and enriches the traditional three-category query processing in semantic caching, extending it to five categories. The MSC model is especially designed for multiresolution spatial data and outper- forms common semantic caching models in three ways: &amp;middot by reducing the amount and complexity of the remainder queries; &amp;middot by avoiding the redundant transmission of spatial data that have already existed in the client cache; &amp;middot by providing a satisfiable and useful answer before 100% of the query results have been transmitted to the client. In addition, a novel replacement strategy is designed for MSC which takes the query pattern, window size and resolution range of MSC regions into account as well as the moving direction and semantic distance. Furthermore, this strategy adopts `Partial Discard' to avoid the cache granularity problem. Our extensive experiments on a large and complex real spatial database demonstrate a significant performance improvement using our proposed ideas.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158220</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processes Leading to Speciation in Australian Wet Tropics Fauna: Divergence Among Three Sibling Lineages of Skinks</field><field name="creator">Dolman, Gaynor</field><field name="description">The research in this thesis was motivated by efforts to understand the processes that generated the high biodiversity found in tropical rainforests. The objective of my thesis was to investigate processes leading to speciation in a sibling group of Australian Wet Tropics rainforest lizards. Studies of population demographics associated with divergence and pre-mating isolation were used to investigate divergence among this trio of skinks. A broader perspective was obtained through a molecular phylogenetic study of the genus, and comparative analyses of geographical and ecological factors influencing diversification. The trio of skinks central to this thesis include C. rubrigularis, which inhabits rainforest in the Wet Tropics (WT) and is divided into northern and southern mitochondrial (mt) DNA lineages. The third lineage is C. rhomboidalis whose distribution replaces C. rubrigularis at the southern limit of the WT and extends into rainforests further south in mid-east Queensland (MEQ). Northern and southern mtDNA lineages of C. rubrigularis are morphologically indistinguishable but partially reproductively isolated at their parapatric boundary, while C. rhomboidalis has blue, rather than redthroated males and according to mtDNA is more closely related to southern C. rubrigularis than is northern C. rubrigularis. A major objective of my thesis was to investigate population demographic parameters associated with divergence in these skinks. Applying coalescent theory to multi-locus data is becoming increasingly powerful for estimating demographic parameters, and thus it was necessary to isolate nuclear markers specific to C. rubrigularis and C. rhomboidalis for this purpose. In Chapter 2 I tested the utility of 72 PCR primer pairs across a panel of Australian WT endemic herpetofauna, and isolated and characterised eight nuclear markers for use in a range of skinks and frogs. Overall the success of this strategy was low, however it generated 7 nuclear loci (including 5 introns, one small coding segment and one anonymous locus). In Chapter 3, a recently developed coalescent model of divergence, based on the Isolation with Migration model, applied to seven nuclear loci, confirmed the strong effect of historical habitat contraction on rainforest-dependent species. Furthermore this study illustrated varying potential for genetic exchange during periods of connectivity of spatially dynamic rainforests. Morphologically distinct lineages (C. rhomboidalis and southern C. rubrigularis) diverged more recently than morphologically cryptic lineages (northern and southern C. rubrigularis) but have been subject to stronger isolation since divergence, with no broad-scale post-divergence gene flow between southern C. rubrigularis and C. rhomboidalis, but limited and effectively unidirectional gene flow between northern and southern C. rubrigularis. There was little or no evidence for stronger genetic drift in the morphologically distinct lineage (C. rhomboidalis) compared with (C. rubrigularis and C. rhomboidalis). As pre-mating isolation is often considered a more effective barrier to gene flow than post-mating isolation, in Chapter 4, I tested for evidence of pre-mating isolation between northern, and southern C. rubrigularis and between C. rubrigularis and C. rhomboidalis. Analyses of morphometric parameters confirmed morphological conservatism between northern and southern C. rubrigularis and therefore failed to identify any morphological differentiation that could be a cue for assortative mating. In contrast, besides throat colour, southern C. rubrigularis and C. rhomboidalis had significant morphometric differentiation. Mate choice analyses revealed that northern and southern C. rubrigularis females did not discriminate between males from northern and southern lineages. In contrast, between southern C. rubrigularis and C. rhomboidalis there was evidence for asymmetric pre-mating isolation. Further investigation within C. rhomboidalis indicated that females from Mount Elliot (WT) showed significant preference for conspecific males, while females from populations in MEQ did not. As a consequence of experimental design it is evident that female choice rather than male character displacement, was responsible for the significant level of discrimination detected in WT C. rhomboidalis. Evolution of Mt. Elliot male blue throat colouration (shorter patch and brighter colour at low wavelengths) corresponded with evolution of female perception in the Mt. Elliot population. A preliminary investigation of light habitat of southern C. rubrigularis compared with C. rhomboidalis found that irradiance was higher in C. rhomboidalis habitat, thus revealing the potential for habitat specific selection. The divergence between southern C. rubrigularis and C. rhomboidalis was investigated further using multi-locus coalescent analyses to estimate post-divergence gene flow at a finer scale than the previous lineage-wide study. Gene exchange between southern C. rubrigularis and C. rhomboidalis was asymmetric, concordant with mate choice analyses, with effectively no gene flow from southern C. rubrigularis into C. rhomboidalis and low-level gene flow in the opposite direction. While the number and timing of migration events between WT and MEQ C. rhomboidalis provide evidence for periods of rainforest connectivity between WT and MEQ, this gene flow was very low in both directions and thus the WT population has been relatively free to respond to local selection. Mt. Elliot C. rhomboidalis is the nearest population to southern C. rubrigularis, and paleoclimatic modelling and gene flow estimates suggest these populations have interacted in the past. Therefore female preference in the Mt. Elliot population may have been driven by reinforcement. However, present data are insufficient to distinguish between reinforcement or habitat specific selection or both. To obtain a broader perspective on these two alternative hypotheses, Chapter 5 investigated general patterns of speciation at the level of the genus. A previous ND4 mtDNA phylogeny of Australian Carlia was expanded to a multi-locus phylogeny with the addition of another mtDNA locus (16S) and two nuclear introns (Aldolase and &amp;#223-globin). Although overall there was a high level of concordance between loci, partition branch support analysis revealed conflict at some intermediate nodes possibly due to rapid speciation within the genus. Regions of conflict highlighted groups of taxa potentially subject to ongoing lineage sorting and/or introgression. Lineage through time (LTT) plots were significantly more convex than expected under the pure birth death model, and thus the null hypothesis of constant rate evolution was rejected in favour of a scenario of rapid diversification at the intermediate level of the phylogeny. An age-range correlation test showed that allopatry was the predominant primary mode of divergence within Carlia. Comparative sister clade analyses found that divergence in open or closed forest preference was correlated with divergence in male breeding colour. Although this does not account for all cases of colour divergence, ecological divergence appears to be an important mechanism driving colour diversification and perhaps speciation in Carlia. There were positive but non-significant associations between sympatry and colour divergence suggesting if reinforcement has played a role in reproductive character displacement it is likely to have been a minor role. The results show contrasting responses to long-term fluctuations in rainforest habitats, leading to varying opportunities for speciation. Climate driven rainforest contraction led to long-term isolation of northern and southern C. rubrigularis across the Black Mountain Corridor and southern C. rubrigularis and C. rhomboidalis across the Townsville Dry Barrier. This refugial isolation led to genetic divergence among the three lineages of skinks. Northern and southern C. rubrigularis only developed some post-mating isolation and remained morphologically conservative. In contrast, southern C. rubrigularis and C. rhomboidalis developed some pre-mating isolation (albeit asymmetric) and diverged morphologically. Compared with northern and southern C. rubrigularis, southern C. rubrigularis and C. rhomboidalis have experienced less opportunity for periodic gene flow and more opportunity for ecological divergence. Together these factors have contributed to the different responses of long-term fluctuations in rainforest habitats evident between the two divergence events.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158221</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensory processing and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in children with autism spectrum disorder</field><field name="creator">Ashburner, Jill</field><field name="description">Many occupational therapists recommend adaptations to school tasks and classroom environments to accommodate the atypical sensory processing of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), on the assumption that sensory processing impacts on classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes. The purpose of this study was to explore the rationale underpinning this practice. Specifically, the first aim was to determine whether or not children with ASD differ significantly from typically developing children with regard to sensory processing. The second aim was to provide descriptive information about the nature and prevalence of atypical sensory processing in children with ASD. The third aim was to explore associations between the sensory processing patterns and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in children with ASD and typically developing children. This study employed a matched case-control design. To control for differences in teaching styles, classroom environments and educational programs, two typically developing children were selected as controls from each of the classes of thirty students with ASD aged between 6 and 10 years. Twenty-eight children with ASD and fifty-one age- and gender-matched typically developing children were included in the final analysis. The children were all included in mainstream classrooms and were screened using the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test to ensure that their estimated IQ was within the average range. Sensory processing was measured using the Short Sensory Profile. Other independent variables that may have impacted on classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes included symptoms of ASD, IQ and classroom environmental factors. Symptoms of ASD were measured using the Gilliam Asperger Disorder Scale and Gilliam Autism Rating Scale. The Kaufmann Brief Intelligence Test was used as an estimate of IQ, as well as for screening purposes. The investigator recorded observations of the sensory aspects of each classroom environment, including estimates of visual clutter, crowding and background noise. The dependent variables, which included classroom emotional regulation, behaviour regulation (e.g., compliance, attention and social behaviours) and educational outcomes, were measured using two teacher questionnaires: the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment Teacher Report Form and the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form Revised &#150; Long Form. No significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to IQ or age in months, suggesting that the two groups were well matched. Observations of the classroom environments revealed high levels of background noise, visual clutter and unpredictable tactile input. The majority of the typically developing children achieved scores at or near ceiling level on both the measures of classroom emotional and behavioural outcomes and sensory processing. This suggested that most of these children processed sensory input in a typical way and were coping well with the emotional, behavioural and academic demands of school. No significant relationships were found between the measures of sensory processing and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in the typically developing children. The teachers rated the children with ASD as demonstrating significantly more difficulties with attention, emotional and behaviour regulation and social skills and significantly poorer academic performance than the controls. The Short Sensory Profile scores suggested a high prevalence of atypical sensory processing in the children with ASD. There were highly significant group differences on all of the Short Sensory Profile scores (p &gt; .001), with the exception of the Short Sensory Profile score: Movement Sensitivity (p = .016). Multiple regression analysis suggested that the Short Sensory Profile scores: Under-responsive/Seeks Sensation and Auditory Filtering accounted for 47% of the variance in academic performance as measured by the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment Teacher Report Form. As estimated intelligence and autistic symptoms were not predictors in this multiple regression model, these specific sensory processing difficulties appeared to contribute significantly to academic underachievement. The Short Sensory Profile Score: Auditory Filtering was also associated with inattention as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form. An association between Short Sensory Profile Score: Auditory Filtering and social problems as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form approached significance (p = .019). Auditory filtering difficulties therefore appeared to be highly problematic for the children with ASD and likely to be exacerbated by high levels of background noise in classrooms. Multiple regression analysis suggested that the Short Sensory Profile scores for Tactile Sensitivity and Auditory Filtering accounted for 36% of the variance in the score for Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form score for inattention. The Short Sensory Profile score for Tactile Sensitivity accounted for 22% of the variance in a Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form measure of the combined symptoms of ADHD (including inattention and hyperactivity). The Short Sensory Profile score: Movement Sensitivity accounted for 22% in the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form score for oppositional behaviours. An association between Short Sensory Profile Score: Tactile Sensitivity and oppositional behaviours as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form approached significance (p = .015). As atypical sensory processing was found to be associated with difficulties in learning, attention and behaviour regulation at school, sensory processing may need to be considered in the planning of educational programs for students with ASD. The development of effective strategies to accommodate the atypical sensory processing of these students is a priority.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158222</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into electricity pool price trends and forecasting for understanding the operation of the Australian national electricity market (NEM)</field><field name="creator">Sansom, Damien</field><field name="description">This thesis reports findings from a number of modern machine learning techniques applied to electricity market price forecasting. The techniques evaluated were Support Vector Machines, Boosting, Bayesian networks, neural networks and a weekly average method. All techniques were evaluated on seven day into the future forecasting of the Regional Reference (pool) Prices (RRP) for the New South Wales (NSW) region of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). Due to highly volatile and non-repetitive nature of the NSW RRP, all complex machine learning methods provided inferior accuracy forecasts compared to a weekly average method. The weekly average method was computationally less expensive and more transparent to the user than any of the machine learning techniques. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) was chosen for its novel application to electricity price forecasting because it is considered to be the next generation to neural networks. The structured SVM training algorithm proved more consistent and reliable than the neural network algorithm. Bayesian networks offer the adaptability of a neural network with the advantage of providing a price forecast with confidence intervals for each half-hour determined from the actual data. The SVM and Bayesian techniques were found to provide acceptable forecasts for NSW demand. An investigation of international electricity markets found that each market was unique with different market structures, regulations, network topologies and ownership regimes. Price forecasting techniques and results cannot be universally applied without careful consideration of local conditions. For instance, price data for the Spanish and Californian electricity markets were investigated and found to have significantly lower price volatility than the NSW region of the NEM. An extensive examination of the NSW RRP showed that the price exhibited no consistent long-term trend. A stationary data set could not be extracted from the price data. Thus, making forecasting unsuited to techniques using large historical data sets. The strongest pattern found for NSW prices was the weekly cycle, so a weekly average method was developed to utilise this weekly cycle. Over 25 weeks of NSW RRP from February to July 2002, the seven day into the future price forecast mean absolute error (MAE) for the SVM technique was 27.8%. The weekly average method was more accurate with an MAE of 20.6% and with a simple linear price adjustment for demand, the error was reduced to 18.1%. The price spikes and uneven distribution of prices were unsuitable for the Boosting or Bayesian network techniques.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290901 Electrical Engineering</field><field name="subject">660301 Electricity transmission</field><field name="subject">660304 Energy systems analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158223</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IMPACT OF PRIVATE AND FOREIGN TELEVISION ON INDIA&#146;S NEWS AND AUDIENCES: 1991-2001</field><field name="creator">Rodrigues, Usha Manchanda</field><field name="description">The central question this thesis attempts to answer is whether increased competition from private and foreign television networks has had a causal effect on changes in local broadcasting. The Indian television market was transformed between 1991 and 2001 from a single player to a multi-channel global media market. This change raised the question of whether Indian audiences benefited from this transformation from one public television monopolistic market to a global market consisting of multiple networks, owned in various degrees by private and foreign entrepreneurs, and in public ownership. The thesis explores the impact of privatisation and globalisation between 1991 and 2001 on television&#146;s role as a developmental tool as envisaged by the Indian planners during its inception in India in 1959. Until 1991, Indian audiences received a controlled, sometimes development oriented and at other times propaganda induced television programming. By 2001 audiences were subjected to a cacophony of commercially driven multi-channel broadcast. This study looks at the historical growth of the television industry in India with a view to assessing the impact of private and foreign television via cable and satellite technology, and its effect on the concept and practice of public service broadcasting in a nation which is both industrialised and developing. It takes into account the diverse needs of two broad categories of Indian population, the growing middle class, and the poor and the disadvantaged. At a theoretical level, the study explains the impact of globalisation of the Indian television industry on local programming. The study aims to find out whether &#145;news&#146; presented by public and private channels differed in its coverage due to a network&#146;s ownership and commercial imperatives. It looks at the reason for increasing television audience numbers and whether the expansion of television as an entertainment medium was detracting it from its role as a catalyst for social change. The study also explores the socio-economic-political environment in the 1990s in India, which led to the exponential growth of television from a twochannel industry to a multi-channel industry, where a cable subscriber in 2001 could access more than 100 channels at a cost of AU$5 a month. In this context, the study includes an analysis of various Indian governments&#146; policy responses to the exponential growth of the television industry in the 1990s. In conclusion, the study provides a set of policy recommendations to guide the future growth of television in India, particularly the need to maintain diversity, plurality and public service programming for all Indians.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158224</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MICROBIAL PROTEIN PRODUCTION IN BEEF CATTLE FED HIGH MOLASSES-BASED DIETS</field><field name="creator">Dinh, Tuyen Van</field><field name="description">Molasses was successfully used as the major source of energy in feedlot diets for beef cattle in Cuba in the 1960&#146;s. However, the feedlot system based on high molasses diets has not been widely adopted, due primarily to low intake and performance of the animal. Three experiments investigated reasons for the low intake and performance of cattle fed high molasses diets. Intake and microbial crude protein (MCP) production were measured along with associated rumen function parameters such as concentration of ammonia nitrogen (NH3N) in rumen fluid, volatile fatty acid (VFA) patterns, rumen pH, and rate of digestion of roughage in the rumen. All experiments used 8 Brahman crossbred steers and a double 4 x 4 Latin square design. All diets (except for the control diet of Experiment 1) consisted of molasses/mono sodium phosphate (99:1 w/w; molasses) with or without urea (3% urea w/w; molasses/urea mix) and pangola hay. In Experiment 1, the steers were allocated into one of four total mixed rations i.e. Control (pangola hay only), 25M (25% molasses/urea mix + 75% hay), 50M (50% molasses/urea mix + 50% hay), and 75M (75% molasses/urea mix + 25% hay). The results demonstrated that MCP production and efficiency of MCP production (EMCP) of the diet linearly increased as the level of molasses in the diet increased. The EMCP from the molasses/urea mix was estimated to be 166 g MCP/kg digestible organic matter intake (DOMI) indicating a relatively high EMCP value. Intake of dry matter (DM) and DOM was quadratically increased whilst digestibility of DM increased and that of neutral detergent fibre (NDF) decreased linearly with increasing level of molasses in the diet. This effect resulted in no difference in intake of DM and DOM between steers fed the 25M diet and those fed the 75M diet. Molasses inclusion in the diet had no effect on rumen pH, NH3 and VFA concentration in the rumen fluid, urine pH or fractional outflow rate (FOR) of Yb-labelled particles and CrEDTA. In Experiment 2, three different N sources (urea, casein, and cottonseed meal) were tested for their effects on MCP production by the steers fed a 50% molasses diet. The steers were allocated into one of four diets including M-O (50% molasses + 50% pangola hay), M-U (50% molasses/urea mix + 50% hay), M-CAS (50% molasses + 45% hay + 5% casein), and M-CSM (50% molasses + 30% hay + 20% cottonseed meal). The results showed that MCP production and EMCP were significantly higher from true protein as compared to the non-protein N supplement and that there was no difference between the two protein sources. Intake and digestibility were highest with the M-CSM diet due primarily to its higher by-pass protein content and hence metabolizable protein to metabolizable energy ratio. However, the N source had no effect on pH, VFA and FOR of markers. Ammonia concentration in rumen fluid was highest with the M-U diet. The effect of particle size of the roughage component in molasses-hay-based diets on intake, digestibility, and MCP production was investigated in Experiment 3. Two levels of molasses/urea mix (25% and 75%) and two levels of particle size (chaffed and ground through a 4 mm sieve) were included in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement. Intake of dietary DM and DOM was not affected by either molasses level or grinding the hay. The higher level of molasses significantly increased digestibility of DM, increased MCP production and EMCP but decreased digestibility of NDF and FOR of CrEDTA. Grinding the hay reduced digestibility of DM but not NDF, increased EMCP but not MCP production, and had no effect on ruminal pH, FOR of rumen contents, and concentration of total VFA and NH3 in the rumen fluid. However, the effect on digestibility was significant only when the diet contained 25% of molasses/mix but not 75% molasses/mix. It was concluded that a diet with a high level of molasses (&gt;50%) and supplemented with adequate N had a high EMCP, that true protein sources enhanced MCP production and that low MCP production was not a major factor limiting intake and performance of cattle consuming high molasses-based diets. Furthermore, intake was not restricted by particle size of the hay component of high molasses-based diets as grinding the hay had no significant effect on intake, digestibility, and MCP production of the diet.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158225</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outside Orders : Religious Faith and Practice of the Laity in Twelfth and Thirteenth-Century France Based on Chansons de Geste of the Charlemagne Cycle</field><field name="creator">Smith, Kay Lynette</field><field name="description">The centuries under discussion in this thesis, the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, were a time of great change in practice of the rituals of the Christian church in Europe as well as in the development of their underlying theology. And the society that this thesis will investigate, the French speaking people of north western Europe, was the theatre in which much of that debate and change took place. The opinions and arguments of the erudite from that time and place are well known. Studies of their interactions illustrate the existence of many schools and individuals whose deliberations were written down, and which supply ample material to modern scholars who research the theological development of the time. However, what is not so abundantly documented is the impact that religion had on the lay and sometimes illiterate Christians of the day. If, in fact, they did debate their religious beliefs and practices, their debates were not written down for posterity to read. Their opinions can only be accessed obliquely. This thesis takes the form of small social history, history from the lower echelons of society rather than the higher, that plumbs the experiences of ordinary people whose opinions were not important enough to occupy the scholars and administrators of the day. In this case a branch of their literature in the vernacular will be used as source material. I propose drawing out a picture of what the people of the time believed, and how they expressed that belief in action, through a close reading of the popular medieval genre of the chanson de geste. The subject has been broached before, by Carl Josef Merk in 1914, Adolphe Jacques Dickman in 1926, Marianna Gildea in 1943 and J-L. Roland B&#233;langer in 1975. This study will differ from previous studies in its concentration on only one cycle of poems and the depth of examination of those poems. Where Merk, Gildea and Dickman used many poems, almost the entire available corpus, and B&#233;langer used a mixture of the poems of the Loherain Cycle and other earlier chansons, this study will be confined to the poems of the Charlemagne Cycle. The poems of one cycle grew out of a common store of subject matter, in this case stories surrounding the great eighth and ninth century king, Charlemagne. By the time of the production and recording of chansons, Charlemagne had acquired legendary status and been credited with conquests and journeys that he never made in his lifetime. He represented an ideal of kingship and his actions were the actions of the ideal Christian conqueror, a monarch who, with his people, was loved by God and guided and assisted by God in all he undertook. For the most part the stories about him involved the conquest and conversion of non-Christian people. Consequently, although the poems are not overtly concerned with religious teaching or religious practice, their subject matter is imbued with religious language and significance. It is the religious significance of the language and subject matter of these poems and the similarity of the hierarchical structure of the society described to the conjectured celestial structure that makes these poems suitable as subject matter for this study. Eleven poems have been chosen for study, nine concerned with conquest of non- Christian people and two with the existence of traitors among the followers of the king. These two poems add the dimension of loyalty to one&#146;s monarch and preservation of the status quo to that of warfare against non-Christians. The findings are set out in two sections, one concerned with rituals that mark the milestones in the protagonists&#146; lives and the other with more spontaneous expressions of faith. Conclusions are drawn from each section and then melded to give an overall picture of the faith of the laity of the time. Where parallels or contrasts with the practice accepted and prescribed by the ecclesiastical establishment are detected, these are examined in the relevant chapters.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158226</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS IN ITALY AD 493 &#150; 552</field><field name="creator">Fletcher, Maria Louise</field><field name="description">In the first half of the sixth century, Italy was the scene of a conflict involving over 70,000 soldiers as the Byzantine and Ostrogothic armies fought to dominate it. This thesis examines the social background of these soldiers, focusing on where they come from and the extent to which military success depended upon the loyalties of the soldiers. It also examines the difficulties that both armies faced in providing logistical support to their soldiers and the extensive damage that providing sufficient provisions for their soldiers had on the resources of Italy. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between soldiers and civilians in this period, examining the way in which towns acted as focal points of contact between the two groups and reflected the increasing militarisation of the period. Finally, this thesis considers the impact of civilian participation in war and how civilian loyalties had a considerable, but hitherto disregarded, impact on the fortunes of two armies and ultimately the outcome of the war.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158227</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vaccine-adjuvant-carrier design against group A streptococcus and human papillomavirus type-16 infection</field><field name="creator">Moyle, Peter Michael</field><field name="description">Vaccination is one of the most successful and cost-effective public health interventions, with a plethora of vaccines marketed for disease prevention. Most vaccines require parenteral administration, potentially reducing patient compliance due to injection associated pain, as well as requiring administration by trained medical staff. The capacity to deliver vaccines via a mucosal route (e.g. via the nose or mouth) has therefore been subject to a large amount of research. Despite this interest, few mucosal vaccine candidates have successfully progressed to human clinical trials. The attachment of synthetic or bacterial lipids to peptide antigens has been shown to effectively increase the immune response to poorly immunogenic peptide antigens administered via parenteral or mucosal routes. Human clinical trials of lipopeptide vaccines suggest that they in general have a good safety profile, with few or no side effects reported. The lipid core peptide (LCP) system is a lipopeptide vaccine delivery system that incorporates a lipidic adjuvant, carrier, and peptide epitopes into a single molecular entity. The LCPsystem has been demonstrated to adjuvant peptide epitopes from several group A streptococcal (GAS) strains. Antibodies elicited following immunisation with these LCPsystems may potentially protect against challenge with homologous GAS strains. Despite this encouraging data, the LCP-system suffers the inability to be thoroughly characterised, or purified to homogeneity, thus limiting its capacity to be examined in human clinical trials. The ultimate aim of this research is to develop a human-compatible mucosal LCP-based GAS vaccine. The aim of this research was therefore to develop methods for the synthesis of readily characterisable, highly pure LCP-analogues, in decent yield. Techniques that were examined, both in solution and on a solid support, included native chemical ligation and fragment condensation. Both of these techniques suffered from solubility problems. For native chemical ligation, the addition of organic solvents to the ligation mixture helped solubilise species containing the LCP lipid adjuvant, although successful ligation was not observed. The addition of 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) to the ligation mixture however was capable of solubilising lipidic species and enabled successful ligation. The thesis describes the use of this technique for the synthesis of two tri-epitopic GAS LCP-analogues, and a monoepitopic, tetra-valent GAS LCP-system, with the two tri-epitopic LCP-analogues assessed for their capacity to elicit systemic antigen-specific IgG antibodies. Overall, the thesis describes the development of a successful technique for synthesising highly pure, multi-epitopic lipopeptide vaccines for possible use in human clinical trials. In addition, the developed technique should be applicable for the synthesis of lipopeptide vaccines targeting other microorganisms, particularly where a multi-epitopic vaccine approach is warranted. While many studies have examined the LCP-systems capacity to elicit antigen-specific antibodies against attached peptide epitopes, few studies have examined its ability to elicit antigen-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs). The ability to elicit antigen-specific CTL responses is important for the development of therapeutic vaccines against viral infections and cancer. Described is the synthesis of a series of LCP-systems incorporating a human papillomavirus type-16 (HPV-16) peptide antigen [HPV-16 E7(44-62)], containing a CTL, Bcell, and T-helper epitope. The vaccines were synthesised in order to investigate their capability to be used for the prevention and/or treatment of HPV-16 associated cervical cancer. Four mannose residues, both in O-acetylated and de-O-acetylated form, were attached to the vaccines to investigate the effect of potential dendritic cell mannose receptor targeting. The vaccines were assessed using a murine HPV-16 tumour model (TC-1 cells). This model demonstrated the capacity of the HPV-16 LCP-systems to reduce or eradicate TC-1 tumours when administered prior to tumour challenge (prophylactic), with mannose containing vaccines exhibiting greater efficacy. Overall, this study suggested that HPV-16 E7(44-62) LCP-systems had the capacity to elicit antigen-specific CTLs capable of clearing HPV-16 associated tumours when administered prior to tumour development. Based on this data, further research should be conducted to examine whether these vaccines are capable of eliminating or reducing the size of developed tumours, why mannose conjugation improved vaccine efficacy, and whether this was due to mannose receptor targeting.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158228</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differential gene expression associated with the immune response pathways to oral Candida Albicans infection in IL-12p40 deficient mice</field><field name="creator">Kazoullis, Andrea</field><field name="description">The oral commensal Candida albicans is found in a majority of the human population. Defects in innate and cell-mediated immunity alter the status of the yeast from a commensal to an opportunistic pathogen. One of the most common clinical manifestations of this infection is oro-pharyngeal candidiasis. Previous studies have reported on the establishment of a chronic oro-pharyngeal infection in a mouse model. In this study, investigations were carried out on local and systemic immune responses against oral C. albicans infection using an IL-12p40 cytokine deficient knockout mouse model. Draining lymph nodes (LN) and oral tissues (OT) consisting of tongue, buccal mucosa and palate were isolated from na&#239;ve (Day 0) and infected (Day 6) IL-12p40 knockout and C57BL/6J wildtype mice and analysed using Affymetrix Mouse Genechip MOE430A. Quality control of the samples was carried out using hierarchical clustering. Clustering analysis showed how comparable the duplicates for each group were clustered together. Analysis of the data including data mining tool (DMT) and MAS5.0 was performed to generate reliable and manageable gene lists for the lymph nodes and oral tissues, and of highly expressed genes that could be verified using traditional molecular methods. Identification of differentially expressed genes using statistical (t-test and ANOVA with Benjamini-Hochberg correction, p&lt;0.05) and non-statistical (Fold Change &gt; 1.5) tools highlighted substantially greater numbers of differentially expressed genes in the knockout mice with respect to strain and/or disease. Further analysis of this data, limited to the immune response pathways, showed that CD4 antigen was downregulated in the infected knockout mice compared to the infected wildtype mice. The CD8&#945; antigen was also down-regulated in the infected knockout mice compared to the infected wildtype mice. Within the oral tissues, genes expressing proteins such as &#946;-defensin 4 and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (Trem1) were down-regulated in the infected knockout mice compared to the infected wildtype mice. The glycoprotein osteopontin was up-regulated in the oral tissues in the na&#239;ve knockout mice and to a lesser extent in the infected knockout mice. Confirmation of the microarray data was undertaken using real time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction qRT-PCR for the selected immune response genes in the lymph nodes and oral tissues. Real time qRT-PCR data confirmed the differential expression of nominated genes obtained from the microarray analysis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320899 Dentistry not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">730112 Oro-dental and disorders</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158229</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DEFENCE MECHANISMS AND INDUCED RESISTANCE IN &#145;KENSINGTON PRIDE&#146; MANGO</field><field name="creator">Zainuri, not applicable</field><field name="description">The Australian mango industry has developed significantly in recent years, based mainly on the cultivar &#145;Kensington Pride&#146;. Although there is increasing demand for fresh mangoes ( Mangifera indica L.), postharvest disease anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, causes major losses. Researchers are interested in finding alternatives to chemical fungicides for the control of anthracnose in mango, so the aims of this study were to characterise natural defence mechanisms in &#145;Kensington Pride&#146; mango fruit against the anthracnose-causing fungus C. gloeosporioides. The five specific objectives addressed in this research were: 1. To identify and quantify preformed resorcinol compounds that may provide resistance to anthracnose in &#145;Kensington Pride&#146; mango fruit. 2. To determine the effect of chemical resistance activators (e.g. Bion&amp;reg; and Kasil&amp;reg;), biological activators ( C. gloeosporioides and C. musae), and physical activators (e.g. UV-C radiation) on anthracnose progression. 3. To determine the effect of chemical activators on the concentrations of preformed resorcinols. 4. To determine the effect of plant activators on activities of pathogenesis-related proteins. 5. To determine the effect of resistance activators on fruit ripening (e.g. colour and firmness changes). Two main preformed alk(en)ylresorcinols, 5-heptadecenylresorcinol and 5- pentadecylresorcinol were extracted from &#145;Kensington Pride&#146; mango fruit. Of the two, the levels of 5-heptadecenylresorcinol were much higher than those of 5- pentadecylresorcinol. However, in vitro antifungal activity of 5-heptadecenylresorcinol against C. gloeosporioides was significantly lower than that of 5-pentadecylresorcinol. The levels of these preformed resorcinols were very high in the immature fruit and decreased during fruit development, but they remained stable during ripening. The concentration of resorcinols also varied within the fruit. Fruit peel contained larger quantities of alk(en)ylresorcinols than the flesh, and sides of fruit that were exposed to natural ultraviolet radiation during fruit development contained higher concentrations of alk(en)ylresorcinols than those not exposed. A series of experiments was conducted to determine the efficacy of preharvest and postharvest treatments with plant resistance activators in inducing fruit resistance. Preharvest dips of Bion&amp;reg; did not consistently induce fruit resistance. Significant variation was noted in this study between different fruit seasons and production areas, but application of the activator to well maintained mango trees resulted in better induction than in poorly managed trees. Activation of fruit resistance by C. gloeosporioides or C. musae pre-inoculations was not successful in this study, and different types of biological activators may need to be tested on mango. The effectiveness of plant activators was influenced by the method of application. Bion&amp;reg; and Kasil&amp;reg;, when applied as soil drenches, significantly reduced disease progression, but dipping produced variable results. As this experiment was only performed once, more research needs to be carried out to confirm these results. All temperature treatments, including dry hot air (38 &#176;C, 48 h), hot water dip (55 &#176;C, 2 or 5 min) and low temperature (10 &#176;C, 1 week) decreased disease severity upon subsequent challenge-inoculation with C. gloeosporioides. Adding Bion&amp;reg; to hot water did not further reduce severity. Postharvest exposure of mango fruit to UV-C radiation significantly reduced disease progression. The effectiveness of the UV-C radiation in inducing mango resistance was influenced by time of application. Exposing mango fruit to UV-C radiation before inoculation with C. gloeosporioides provided better induction of fruit resistance than in those fruit that were exposed after inoculation. UV-C radiation was more effective when applied to fruit directly after harvest, whereas delayed treatment with UV-C radiation after harvest did not consistently increase fruit resistance. The mechanism of fruit resistance is very complex, and may be associated with induction of preformed antifungal compounds or induction of enzymes associated with induced resistance, such as &amp;beta;-1,3-glucanase and chitinase. However, none of the activators significantly increased the level of preformed alk(en)ylresorcinols or the activities of &amp;beta;-1,3-glucanase and chitinase. Different mechanisms may be involved in the resistance of mango to anthracnose. In conclusion, induction of fruit resistance by applying activators may be an effective and environmentally friendly method to use as a tool in an integrated crop management system for the control of anthracnose disease in &#145;Kensington Pride&#146; mango. However, more research still needs to be carried out to determine the role of preformed alk(en)ylresorcinols and other resistance components, and the means to maximise production of these compounds in the fruit.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158230</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The law relating to liability for economic loss - how to approach the duty issue in a novel case</field><field name="creator">Vaggelas, Karen Margaret</field><field name="description">The topic of this thesis relates to the negligent infliction of economic loss. In particular, it is concerned with the question of how the courts should approach the duty issue in a novel economic loss case. Initially, it was intended that the thesis involve a comparative analysis of the current approaches of the English, Australian, New Zealand and Canadian courts. The aim was to examine the Commonwealth courts1 treatment of economic loss with a view to identifying the most appropriate method of dealing with novel cases. It was, however, found that not one of the approaches presented by the appellate courts in these four jurisdictions could be described as the appropriate method for determining the duty question. The search for the model approach could not be confined to English, Australian, New Zealand and Canadian experiences. It was necessary to embark on a consideration of issues and concepts which were basic and fundamental to the common law. So what began as a comparative analysis also became a critical appraisal. In terms of structure, the thesis is divided into two parts. Part One presents the current approaches of the English, Australian, New Zealand and Canadian courts to determining the duty issue in a novel economic loss case. Using the analysis undertaken in the first part to set the context, the Part Two endeavours to present the appropriate approach. In the course of the analysis undertaken in Part One, it is seen that there are two principal areas of concern which must be addressed before a model approach can be presented. They can be summed up as follows: , (1)the question of what is the appropriate doctrinal basis for the imposition of liability for economic loss and the development of the law relating to economic loss; and (2)the question of what is the role and relevance of policy considerations in determining the duty issue in an economic loss case. The conclusion reached is that liability for the negligent inf lict ion of economic loss must be imposed in accordance with a moral standard which underlies all negligence cases and the law must develop in a manner which ensures a consistent and coherent application of this standard. Accordingly, in most cases, the bounds of liability will be determined by moral or ethical considerations. The relevance of non ethical or public policy considerations as a determinant of liability is not denied. However, the circumstances in which such considerations will operate to override a determination that the plaintiff has a moral right to recover for the economic loss suffered are limited.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158231</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Male Rape and the Government of Bodies: An Unnatural History of the Present</field><field name="creator">Foster, Gary Alan</field><field name="description">This thesis is a cartographic exercise, designed to expand the possibilities of telling and understanding the modern problem of male rape. My initial interest was in mapping and examining the heterogeneous governmental means by which the problem of men raping men is produced and managed, with reference to the Queensland context. This led me to ask questions, not only about the rationalities and technologies in use, the authorities claimed, the ways in which lives are to be ordered, but also the recency of this problematic of male rape, to generate an interest in how its constitutive elements came into being and developed shape. The concern moved beyond cataloguing and critiquing current practices towards documenting and analysing their historical conditions of possibility. A genealogical inquiry of influential regimes of practice has therefore been undertaken as a means to understand better how this problem of male rape has become formulated in the present. To date, male rape has been provided with an extensive, but limited history. It has been said to have been perpetrated across all time, yet only fully recognised and responded to in recent decades; presented as a hidden, under acknowledged, under researched crime that men are reluctant to speak about. This study follows movements to expand the means of understanding the problem of male rape, past incidence and prevalence studies, to pay attention to socio-historical aspects of telling and responding to the act. It is the conditions of formation and appearance of the array of problems and responses to male rape, the cultural temporal sitedness, which is of concern in this thesis. The assembled dossier works to trace and analyse practical, programmatic texts, intended to influence and administer the possibilities of bodies and lives, with respect to an act of non-consensual anal penetration. A genealogical approach, influenced by the work of Michel Foucault, is adopted for its productivity in dissecting, diagnosing and accentuating the building blocks of the present. This method acknowledges and draws attention to the diverse means of governing bodies and acts: the discursive and extra-discursive &#150; sovereign, disciplinary, governmental. The divisions of Part One and Part Two work to emphasise the continuities and discontinuities across time and terrain. In the archive that makes up Part One, &#147;In the Penal Colony&#148;, the unnatural crime of sodomy/buggery appears as an act that can involve both pleasure and pain, something condemned by multiple authorities. For Van Diemen&#146;s Land of the late 1840s, resolution of this public offence is not to be found in the spectacle of punishment, but in an ever more meticulous ordering of lives. Comprehensive practices of separation and superintendence are set up in the name of ending unnatural crime. Medico-legal power/knowledge is ascribed a privileged status, as through naked inspection the convict surgeon is encouraged to discover the truth of what has gone before. Finally, the &#147;ideal&#148; permanent solution requires the convict body become individualised and normalised and that additional women be transported, enhancing the possibility of a self-governing moral subject and society that can properly manage sex. Part Two, &#147;Transformations&#148;, concentrates on responses to the problem of male rape operative in the modern state of Queensland. The current conditions of condemnation and acceptance of anal penetration are laid out, noting how the act has become abnormal and homosexualised. The legislative domain, as a site for the prosecution of non-consensual anal penetration, has been subject to review, producing new possibilities for men who are raped, through reintroduction of the biblical offence: sodomy. The Queensland Response to Sexual Assault, in line with national practice standards, outlines a gender neutral response, which includes men by means of addition to the previously established order. Similarly, the current Adult Sexual Assault Examination for anal rape exhibits traces of a medico-legal power/knowledge designed to facilitate the identification and punishment of the habitual practitioner. The model prison has become the locus classicus of male rape, prompting Queensland Department of Corrective Services to implement specific management and prevention strategies, strategies that would have been familiar to the comptroller general of convicts. In the present, men are encouraged to practise responsible self government, to ensure they are not assaulted. The expectation is one of complete corporeal control. As suitably disciplined subjects &#150; individualised and normalised &#150; men who are raped are required to know, identify and be able to declare their sexuality.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158232</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards the development of a talent identification and development program for coaches</field><field name="creator">O'Keeffe, Erin Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Coach retention is a significant problem for sport at all levels. Coach turnover, especially of talented and experienced coaches, creates a multitude of operational complexities for many sport organisations. The importance of having quality coaches available to assist the development of high performing athletes has been identified by both sports administrators and elite athletes. However, the data indicate that in Australia, coach accreditation rates are decreasing by more than 9% each year (ASC, 2004). Although programs focusing on coach education and pathways have been developed, minimal research has addressed the elements involved in identifying and retaining talented coaches. The first step in developing a coach talent identification and development program is the formulation of a definition of coaching talent. Although definitions of 'talent' exist in the business and sport performance arenas, these are not directly applicable to the sport coaching context. This study used a multi-method approach through the combination of interviews and questionnaires to develop a comprehensive definition of a talented coach. Two research questions were addressed: What are the attributes of a talented coach (and do perceptions of these differ between different stakeholders)? What are the factors that identify a talented coach (and do perceptions of these differ between different stakeholders)? Information gathered from interviews with experienced personnel in sport (seven coaches and administrators and two senior athletes) was transcribed and coded using open, axial and reflective coding. Themes identified in the analysis were incorporated with the literature to inform construction of the Talent in Coaching Questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 100 items investigating three separate but related areas: Demographic Intbrmation (10 items); Attributes of a Talented Coach (77 items); and Identification of a Talented Coach (13 items). Within the Attributes of a Talented Coach section, items were allocated six different categories: Background (10 items); Knowledge (1 3 items); Athlete-Coach Interaction (1 1 items); Operational Practices (12 items); Motivation (7 items); and Attributes (24 items). TWO areas were addressed in the Talent Identification section: the populations in which a talented coach could be found (6 items) and the best possible selection methods to identify a talented coach (7 items). Items were answered using a 5-point Likert scale where 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree. The Talent in Coaching Questionnaire was piloted with nine experienced sport personnel and 21 high performing athletics coaches to obtain feedback on face validity, ease of understanding and readability prior to delivery to 300 coaches and administrators across Queensland. The sample incorporated beginner, experienced, retired and lapsed coaches fiom individual and team sports at club, state and national levels. Administrators were defined as involved in the coordination of coaching and support services at club, state or national level. Subjects were sourced fiom 38 different sports through their respective State Sporting Organisations. Within the time fiame allowed, 162 questionnaires were received (54% response rate), which included responses fiom 32 different sports. The sample comprised 27.7% female and 72.3% male subjects, 66.7% of whom were over the age of 40. Using SPSS, the data were analyzed through descriptive statistics, reliability and factor analysis, ANOVA, and Chi square. Items and categories were ranked according to the mean score fiom all participants. The top five attributes of a talented coach were considered to be an individual who; is aware of the individual differences among athletes (mean = 4.74), has an enjoyment of coaching (mean = 4.71), is always looking for improvement in his / her coaching (mean = 4-70), is willing to learn (mean = 4-69), and has knowledge of the fundamental skills required for the sport (mean = 4.65). Attributes considered less important in a talented coach were; one who is motivated by money (mean = 1-70), introverted (mean = 2.38), makes the athlete the first priority in life (mean = 2.42), has received awards for coaching (mean = 2.92) and coached as a head coach (mean = 2.40), State coach (mean = 2.96), or National coach (mean = 2.83). Results suggest that a talented coach may be found among those individuals already coaching or retiring athletes and may be effectively identified through observation at training and competition, possibly through the use of a talent scout. Significant differences were found when item scores were compared by age, gender, experience, and qualifications (National Coaching Accreditation Scheme). Female coaches considered nurturing and teaching attributes more important than did males, additionally career stage may affect consideration of the most important attributes. Practical implications and directions for future research are also discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321401 Exercise Physiology</field><field name="subject">750203 Organised sports</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158233</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE EFFECT OF CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN ON THE SIZE AND ACTIVATION OF THE LUMBAR MULTIFIDUS MUSCLE</field><field name="creator">Wallwork, Tracy Leigh</field><field name="description">The lack of control of lumbar stability is thought to be a major factor in the aetiology and chronicity of low back pain. The lumbar multifidus muscle is considered to play a significant role in maintaining lumbar stability and stiffness. The aim of this study was to use clinical measures to compare lumbar multifidus muscle in chronic low back pain patients and unimpaired subjects. Sixteen subjects with chronic low back pain and 16 unimpaired subjects were assessed in the study. Cross-sectional area (CSA) and contraction size of multifidus were measured on both sides and at individual vertebral levels, from L2 &#150; L5, using realtime ultrasound. The differences between the chronic back pain and unimpaired groups were statistically significant for both cross-sectional area and contraction size measures. In the unimpaired group, the contraction size of multifidus was greatest at the L5 segmental level, and then decreased in size at higher lumbar levels. In the chronic low back pain group, the contraction size was the same at L4 and L5 levels and contractions were less at these levels than those at L2 and L3. Three way interactions showed a significant interaction (p&lt;0.05) between vertebral levels, change in thickness and group. Contrasts revealed a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) between upper lumbar levels (L2 and L3) and lower lumbar levels (L4 and L5) across groups. In the unimpaired group, the contraction size of multifidus was greater at lower lumbar levels (L4 and L5) than upper lumbar levels (L2 and L3), while in the low back pain group, the contraction size was less at lower lumbar levels than upper lumbar levels. A similar pattern occurred with multifidus CSA&#146;s. In the unimpaired group, CSA was greatest at L5 and gradually reduced at higher lumbar levels. In the chronic back pain group, CSA&#146;s were the same at L5 and L4 and only slightly greater than L3. Two way interactions showed a highly significant difference (p&lt;0.01) between groups across vertebral levels. There was a significant difference between upper lumbar levels (L2and L3) and lower lumbar levels (L4 and L5). Lower lumbar levels were less in the chronic low back pain group than the unimpaired group, when compared to upper lumbar levels. Estimated marginal means showed that CSA at L5 was significantly less in the chronic low back pain group (confidence interval &gt;95%). Results of the study indicate that chronic low back pain patients have poorer muscle activation and greater muscle wasting of multifidus muscle at the lower lumbar levels compared with higher lumbar levels, than normal subjects. Clinical programmes should aim to restore multifidus muscle activation and size, in patients with chronic low back pain.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158234</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On hamilton cycles and manilton cycle decompositions of graphs based on groups</field><field name="creator">Dean, Matthew Lee Youle</field><field name="description">A Hamilton cycle is a cycle which passes through every vertex of a graph. A Hamilton cycle decomposition of a k-regular graph is defined as the partition of the edge set into Hamilton cycles if k is even, or a partition into Hamilton cycles and a 1-factor, if k is odd. Consequently, for 2-regular or 3-regular graphs, finding a Hamilton cycle decompositon is equilvalent to finding a Hamilton cycle. Two classes of graphs are studies in this thesis and both have significant symmetry. The first class of graphs is the 6-regular circulant graphs. These are a king of Cayley graph. Given a finite group A and a subset S &#8838; A, the Cayley Graph Cay(A,S) is the simple graph with vertex set A and edge set {{a, as}|a &#8712; A, s &#8712; S}. If the group A is cyclic then the graph is called a circulant graph. This thesis proves two results on 6-regular circulant graphs: 1. There is a Hamilton cycle decomposition of every 6-regular circulant graph Cay(Z[subscript n],S) in which S has an element of order n; 2. There is a Hamilton cycle decomposition of every connected 6-regular circulant graph of odd order. The second class of graphs examined in this thesis is a futher generalization of the Generalized Petersen graphs. The Petersen graph is well known as a highly symmetrical graph which does not contain a Hamilton cycle. In 1983 Alspach completely determined which Generalized Petersen graphs contain Hamilton cycles. In this thesis we define a larger class of graphs which includes the Generalized Petersen graphs as a special case. We call this larger class spoked Cayley graphs. We determine which spoked Cayley graphs on Abelian groups are Hamiltonian. As a corollary, we determine which are 1-factorable.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">230101 Mathematical Logic, Set Theory, Lattices And Combinatorics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158235</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To Intervene or Not to Intervene? An Evaluation of Strategic Intervention and its Usefulness in the Development of a Value Chain Alliance for the Native Flower Industry</field><field name="creator">Firrell, Craig</field><field name="description">This thesis is a qualitative examination and evaluation of a process used to develop a value chain in the Australian native floricultural industry. It demonstrates that expert facilitators in strategic intervention can successfully encourage changes in practice by enhancing the knowledge, attitude, skills, and aspirations of a group within the industry. It also provides recent evidence that the formation of a collaborative marketing alliance is a difficult process requiring the development of strong relationships with partners who are capable of achieving results. The study provides detailed descriptions and evaluations of the alliance formation process followed by expert facilitators from the Value Chain Program of the Centre for Native Floriculture at the University of Queensland, Gatton. The research covers the period from October 2003 to August 2005 and focuses on a single case in which the facilitators used strategic intervention to assist in the development of a value chain alliance for marketing the native flower Backhousia myrtifolia in Japan. The research adopted a third party evaluator approach to gather information relating to the process and its impact on participants involved in the project. The purpose of this approach was two fold. First, to avoid facilitator bias in the critical assessment of the alliance development framework used by the Value Chain Program of The Centre for Native Floriculture. Then having conducted the assessment, improvements that could help facilitators in future projects were identified. A two pronged approach was adopted. First, the links between the theories of strategic intervention, value chain management and alliance development were established and key indicators for each stage of the process where monitored. Second, Bennett&#146;s Hierarchy (Bennett 1975) was used as a framework for evaluating the process and its impact on the participants. The findings of the research concluded that although progress in capacity building was achieved, building a strong alliance required the success of the following key indicators: propensity to commit, partner selection, a shift in thinking, relationships and the emergence of a leader. It also revealed the limitations of a genuine strategic intervention process. While these findings alone cannot be used to develop generalized theory, this case study does contain valuable insights that if combined with other experiences should influence policy development and practice aimed at funding strategic intervention to develop value chains in rural industries.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158237</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Axon Growth and Guidance in the Embryonic Vertebrate Forebrain</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Nicole Helen</field><field name="description">In the embryonic forebrain, pioneer axons establish a simple topography of dorsoventral and longitudinal tracts. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in elucidating the underlying molecular interactions that mediate pathfinding decisions in the growth cone, primarily through in vitro analyses, and examination of axon trajectories at the ventral midline or in the later-forming retinotectal projection. Despite this, the cues used by axons during the initial formation of the axon scaffold remain largely unknown. I have investigated the axon guidance role of Neogenin, a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily with identical secondary structure to the established Netrin receptor, Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC). Neogenin binds to the chemoattractive ligand Netrin-1, as well as to the chemorepulsive ligand Repulsive Guidance Molecule (RGMa). Despite this, an axon guidance role for Neogenin during early forebrain development is yet to be described. In this thesis, the relatively simple and well-characterised development of the Xenopus brain has been utilised to investigate the role of Neogenin in the development of the early scaffold of axon tracts in the vertebrate brain. A Xenopus orthologue of the Neogenin gene was cloned and characterised, and the expression of this gene in relation to the developing axon scaffold in the forebrain was examined. Neogenin was expressed in a principal nucleus of the developing forebrain, and in neuroepithelial cells underlying the main axon tracts. The specific role of Neogenin in the guidance of axons in the forebrain was assessed using a combination of gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches. Misexpression of Neogenin led to aberrant development of axon tracts emanating from a specific forebrain nucleus, and ectopic differentiation of neurons in the dorsal brain. These results implicated Neogenin in both neuronal differentiation and axon guidance in embryonic vertebrate forebrain. Analysis of loss-of-function embryos generated by morpholino knock down and dominant-negative approaches confirmed that correct spatiotemporal activity of Neogenin was essential for the formation of a specific dorsoventral tract in the forebrain, the supraoptic tract (SOT). In the subsequent chapter, the axon guidance activity of Neogenin was examined in more detail by investigating ligands that could be interacting with Neogenin during axon guidance in the developing vertebrate forebrain. Two Neogenin ligands were examined: RGMa and Netrin-1. Both of these genes were expressed in the developing Xenopus forebrain in patterns that were consistent with their potential role as Neogenin ligands. Morpholino knock down of either Netrin-1 or RGMa produced similar mutant phenotypes in the formation of the SOT to those observed following loss of Neogenin. To examine genetic interactions amongst these genes, I utilised a simultaneous partial knock down approach, which revealed dosage-sensitive interactions and verified that these receptors and ligands were acting in the same pathway. The results confirmed that Neogenin acts as an axon guidance molecule in vivo, and is required for accurate pathfinding by axons navigating the initial axon trajectories. The findings support a model whereby Neogenin-expressing axons respond to a combination of attractive and repulsive cues as they navigate their ventral trajectory. Finally, this thesis describes the identification and initial characterisation of a Neogenin paralogue in Xenopus, termed Neogenin1b. Morpholino knock down analyses suggested that Neogenin1b may function distinctly from its sister gene, despite &gt;90% amino acid identity between them. These results provide the framework for future investigations into the axon guidance role of the Neogenin proteins. Taken together, this thesis demonstrates that Neogenin, RGMa and Netrin-1 contribute to the complement of guidance cues and cellular interactions that are needed for the establishment of the earliest forming axon pathways in the embryonic vertebrate forebrain. Furthermore, this study highlights the remarkable integrative ability of a single axon guidance receptor, which appears to respond to a combination of opposing cues to direct growth along a specific route.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158238</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The value relevance of superannuation disclosures for Australian companies 2002 and 2003</field><field name="creator">Crossman, Deborah Mary</field><field name="description">The focus of interest in this research is the value relevance of superannuation disclosures for corporate employers sponsoring Defined Benefit Plans on behalf of employees. For the period of this study, the two years 2002 and 2003, the relevant reporting requirements came within the accounting standard for employee benefits, AASB 1028. Prior Australian research on superannuation disclosures has already established that such disclosures were value relevant, at least based on an industrial sample in 1995, and more recently on a full sample for the period 2000 to 2003. The primary purpose of this study is to examine the hypothesis that this relationship between shareholder value and superannuation disclosures is asymmetrical i.e. significantly different depending on whether the company-sponsored fund represents a liability (deficit) or an asset (surplus) of the sponsor firm. The reason for investigating this conjecture was that, in light of the changed conditions in the Australian market for many firms, the net asset position of a number of superannuation plans deteriorated, providing the evidence to investigate this hypothesis for the first time. The research methodology used in this study investigates value relevance using the balance sheet valuation model developed by Landsman (1986) and since used in several studies. The findings of the study provide new evidence in support of this hypothesis, consistent with the view that the market will devalue the firm heavily when the fund is in deficit, but will appreciate the value of the firm significantly less heavily when the fund is in surplus. The study finds support for the observed market behaviour in prior research relevant to the impact of &#145;bad news&#146; and the consequent market reaction. The findings are particularly relevant at a time of change in the accounting regulations for superannuation disclosures for corporate sponsors with the move to adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards from January 2005.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350101 Financial Accounting</field><field name="subject">710401 Finance and investment services</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158239</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The sociality of healing Engaging Southern Sudanese refugees resettling in an Australian context &#150; a model of social healing</field><field name="creator">Westoby, Peter Ralph</field><field name="description">Within the thesis the author examines how Southern Sudanese refugees understand healing as a social process in a resettlement context within Australia. This examination has led the author to explore first how do we understand the distress of refugees, and second, what are the social processes that facilitate healing? The author builds on the argument that if healing is at least partly a social process then the re-building of a social world for refugees is critical for recovery. Social healing is the metaphor used as a way of describing this process and a new model of intervention. The key argument of the dissertation is that contrary to much of the literature, the distress exhibited by Sudanese refugees is related more to resettlement issues than to the experiences of violence that caused their refugee status. Broadly speaking, their distress is located in the &#145;social&#146; milieu of their resettlement. It follows from this that the primary goal of intervention should be based on a model of the social that is developed in this thesis. This model differs from current intervention models in two principle ways: (i) instead of being therapeutically oriented to the individual, it requires the identification of social healing across three spheres of culture, community and power; and (ii) rather than focusing on the professional/ client relationship, intervention needs to be dialogically based on the agency of the Southern Sudanese community&#146;s attempt to make sense of their agonistic new location in Australia. The analysis is used to tentatively theorize social healing. The author also aims to build an archive of the subjective experience of refugee distress and their aspirations for and performances of social healing. The model of social healing developed builds on the emerging critique of a psycho-social discourse as it relates to refugees in a resettlement context that represents and problematizes refugees in certain ways. The author argues that the contemporary psycho-social approach, embedded in a therapeutic discourse, constitutes refugees in particular ways that draw on a dominant paradigm that is therapeutically, individually and technically oriented. This dissertation interrupts this discursive practice through drawing on several critical intellectual traditions (anthropology, philosophy and sociology) and also through empirical work with Southern Sudanese refugees that supports the intellectual critique. The distress of Southern Sudanese refugees is made sense of through an alternative paradigm (to the dominant psychological, therapeutic and individually orientated one), through using key concepts such as cultural trauma, social trauma and social distress. These concepts orient the reader towards the collective, the social and refugee agency. Conversely a new social model of healing is then developed that explores the spheres and resources of, albeit disrupted, yet still existing, culture, community and power within the context of a dialogical and elicitive approach to intervention. The new social model provides a new &#145;map&#146; and new &#145;contours&#146; for building theory and identifying practice implications that draw on refugee emic perspectives, endogenous resources and insider action in a resettlement context. The dissertation has used an elicitive approach to research. The research methodology parallels the social model of healing articulated. Interviews, dialogue workshops and participant observation have been used to gain empirical and participant data. At the heart of the methodology is an elicitive process of dialogue that provides the opportunity for a &#145;mutual journey of discovery&#146; in re-building a social world of Southern Sudanese refugees within the spheres of: culture &#150; through for example, [re]orienting and [re]cycling cultural practice; community &#150; through for example, [re]creating bonding and bridging social capital, dealing with conflict, socializing &#145;suffering&#146;; and power through contesting political (structural and post-structural) dynamics linked to citizen rights, formal organized power, and engagement with the settlement and welfare industry. Overall the dissertation is a useful contribution to the ongoing debates about psycho-social and moral-political work with refugee communities within multicultural contexts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158240</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">REDUCTION OF SKIN FRICTION DRAG IN HYPERSONIC FLOW BY BOUNDARY LAYER COMBUSTION</field><field name="creator">Suraweera, Milinda Vishwanath</field><field name="description">The high levels of viscous drag that are produced at hypersonic velocities pose a considerable barrier to the successful development and operation of scramjet flight vehicles. The higher density flow that passes through a scramjet combustor produces a large component of the overall viscous drag of the vehicle. The present study investigates a skin friction reduction method, in which hydrogen is injected and combusted within a turbulent boundary layer, over a range of conditions in the hypersonic regime. Results from an experimental and numerical study of skin friction levels obtained when hydrogen is injected into turbulent boundary layers are presented. Measurements are reported from experiments in the T4 free-piston reflected shock tunnel. Hydrogen was injected from a 3 mm high slot into the boundary layer on the flat surface of one of the walls of a duct 100 mm wide, 60 mm high, and 1745 mm long. The experiments were conducted at Mach numbers ranging from 4.2 to 5.9, flow nozzle-supply enthalpies of 4.8 MJ/kg to 9.5 MJ/kg, and Reynolds numbers of 3.7 &#215; 106 m-1 to 17.2 &#215; 106 m-1. Fuel was injected at mass flow rates ranging from 0 kg/s/m to 0.62 kg/s/m, and nozzle area ratios of 1.0 to 4.2 for test flows of air. Combustion occurred at most flow conditions with results indicating a maximum reduction in skin friction coefficient of approximately 80% of the level measured with no injection. Skin friction reductions of approximately 60% were obtained at two other test flows. Generally, the experimental results showed that when the pressure rise due to combustion was larger, the reduction in local skin friction coefficient was larger. At high nozzle-supply enthalpies of test flows, reductions in skin friction due to combustion reduced as a result of decreasing heat release from combustion. Hydrogen injection into a test flow of nitrogen was also trialled at all flow conditions to compare with the results obtained when fuel was injected into an air flow in order to identify the effects of combustion. In general, the results showed that reductions in local skin friction coefficient were greater when combustion occured than when fuel was injected and did not burn. In addition, measured heat transfer levels were found to be comparable with levels obtained without injection for most of the experimental conditions. Reynolds analogy was also explored at high stagnation enthalpy and high Mach number over a broad range of skin friction coefficients. Results for Reynolds analogy factors at higher skin friction coefficients than previous studies are presented. Results with nitrogen as a test gas to suppress real-gas effects are also included. Shock tunnel measurements of skin friction and heat transfer rates show a trend of decreasing Reynolds analogy factor with increasing skin friction coefficient. This trend is apparently independent of stagnation enthalpy, unit Reynolds number and Mach number for the range of conditions that are examined in the present study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158241</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extrusion of mixtures of starch and encapsulated volatiles</field><field name="creator">Yuliani, Sri</field><field name="description">High temperature, shear and pressure during extrusion can cause a considerable loss of flavour volatiles added in the feed material due to thermal degradation, oxidation, polymerisation or flash distillation. Encapsulating the flavour before extrusion is a promising approach to improve the flavour volatiles&#146; retention during extrusion. &#946;-Cyclodextrin, a truncated cone shaped molecule containing seven glucopyranose units, can provide an excellent protection of flavour through molecular inclusion encapsulation, as the flavour volatile molecules are held inside the hydrophobic cavity of &#946;-cyclodextrin, allowing their high retention. Another encapsulation technique, protein precipitation, is a potential alternative, as &#946;-cyclodextrin is not permitted for food application in some countries. In this technique, flavour is encapsulated in a water insoluble protein based system, providing the flavour with protection against severe damage during extrusion. The capsules incorporated into the feed prior to extrusion also receive the same mixing, heating and shearing as the rest of the feed material during the extrusion process, and their presence may influence the rheological properties of the melt and in turn affect the extrudate properties. Extrusion conditions such as temperature and screw speed can also significantly affect the product quality parameters such as expansion, apparent density, and hardness, as well as affecting the development, retention, and degradation of flavour components. The interaction among those input variables, together with the presence of the capsules in the feed materials can affect the final product properties. The objective of this work was to determine the stability of a model flavour volatile d-limonene encapsulated in both &#946;-cyclodextrin and sodium caseinate capsule when exposed to extrusion conditions, and to determine whether the presence of the capsules and d-limonene affects extruder operation or product characteristics. Two sets of extrusion experiments were carried out in Prism Eurolab KX16 twin screw extruder (16 mm diameter screw; 40:1 L/D ratio) using corn starch as a food matrix. In one set of experiments, d-limonene was encapsulated in &#946;-cyclodextrin. In the other set of experiments, d-limonene was encapsulated with sodium caseinate. Using a Surface Response Methodology, Central Composite Uniform Precision Design, three variables were studied: level of encapsulated ingredient in the feed material (0, 0.01, 2.5, 3.99 and 5%); extruder screw speeds (&#946;-cyclodextrin, 158, 175, 200, 225 and 242 rpm; sodium caseinate, 145, 151, 160, 169 and 175 rpm) and maximum barrel temperatures (&#946;-cyclodextrin, 133, 140, 150, 160 and 167&#176;C; sodium caseinate, 125, 129, 135, 141 and 145&#176;C). Another set of experiment with unencapsulated d-limonene was also performed as a comparison experiment at five levels of d-limonene addition (0.00, 0.07, 0.25, 0.43 and 0.50%), maximum barrel temperatures (125, 128, 135, 142, 145&#176;C) and a screw speed of 160 rpm. In addition, a set of in-line rheometer experiments was carried out to determine the viscosity behaviour of the starch mixture melt as influenced by feed compositions (2.5 and 5% of both capsules addition and 0.25 and 5% of unencapsulated d-limonene addition) at a maximum barrel temperature of 139&#176;C and screw speed of 167 rpm. Measured parameters included extruder operation responses (torque, die pressure, specific mechanical energy [SME], residence time distribution [RTD]), flavour retention and product characteristics (expansion ratio, density, hardness, water absorption index [WAI], water solubility index [WSI] and colour). Extruder operation gave different responses with the variation in feed formulation and extrusion condition. In general, torque and die pressure decreased with the increase in barrel temperature and screw speeds. The presence of capsules modified extruder responses and behaved differently with the type of additives. Incorporating &#946;-cyclodextrin capsules into the feed materials gave a maxima response surface of die pressure, while sodium caseinate capsules exhibited the opposite trend. Minima trends in torque were observed with the addition of sodium caseinate capsule and unencapsulated d-limonene. Barrel temperature, screw speed and capsule level had significant effects on flavour retention and product properties. &#946;-Cyclodextrin capsules gave higher flavour retention (average across 0.01 to 5% levels of addition: 92.2%) than the sodium caseinate capsules (67.5%). Without encapsulation, the flavour retention was very low (average of 8.0%). The retention increased with the increase in capsule level, reached a maximum value at capsule levels of 4.5% and 3.0% for &#946;-cyclodextrin and sodium caseinate capsules, respectively, and then decreased with further increase in capsule level. Without encapsulation, the retention of d-limonene steadily increased with the increase in the level of d-limonene addition. addition. viii A higher radial expansion ratio was observed from the extrudates containing sodium caseinate capsules than those with &#946;-cyclodextrin (average of 1.87 and 1.38, respectively). The expansion ratio responded in the opposite way to flavour retention to increasing levels of encapsulated ingredient addition. The expansion ratio decreased as the capsule level rose to 2.5%, and then went up with the increasing in capsule level from 2.5% to 5% for the sodium caseinate capsules. The expansion ratio of extrudate containing &#946;-cyclodextrin continuously decreased with the increase in capsule level. Extrudates containing unencapsulated d-limonene had the highest expansion ratio (average of 2.1). The presence of capsules enhanced extrudate hardness. &#946;-Cyclodextrin capsules gave the lowest extrudate hardness (average of 1.14 N/mm2), followed by sodium caseinate capsules (average of 2.34 N/mm2) and unencapsulated d-limonene (average of 3.38 N/mm2). These showed that the presence of capsules modified the properties of the extrudates. The presence of capsules, together with the changes in barrel temperatures and screw speeds apparently modified the melt viscosity behaviour possibly through the interaction of starch and capsules, interaction of starch and d-limonene, and lubricating effect of d-limonene released from the capsules to the melt. Power Law models obtained from in-line rheology experiments were applied to predict the viscosity behaviour of the melt with the presence of capsules and unencapsulated d-limonene. It was predicted that an incorporation of 2.5% of sodium caseinate capsules tended to decrease the viscosity, while further increase to 5% resulted in an increase in viscosity. A similar trend of viscosity was also observed in the presence of unencapsulated d-limonene. These results were in agreement with the extruder operation responses and extrudate properties in the presence of sodium caseinate capsules or unencapsulated d-limonene. The presence of &#946;-cyclodextrin capsules tended to decrease the viscosity of the melt, which was not in line with the extruder operation responses and extrudate properties, presumably due to the poor predictability of Power Law model in the case of a mixture containing the &#946;-cyclodextrin capsules. This study enhanced the knowledge in the area of flavour encapsulation for extrusion application. It provided the trends in extruder operation responses, flavour retention and extrudate properties with the changes in capsule type and extrusion conditions. This will allow further development of encapsulation technique and extrusion process to obtain optimum conditions for high flavour retention and desired extrudate properties.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158242</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond Alethia: A Critique of Heideggerian Einaiology</field><field name="creator">Colledge, Richard John David</field><field name="description">The work of Martin Heidegger holds a pre-eminent place in contemporary ontological metaphysics, and this, it is argued, is a deeply two-edged sword. Proceeding on the basis of the unity of Heidegger&#146;s life-long project, the thesis critically evaluates Heideggerian thought, with a particular emphasis on its early formative texts (1923-35), highlighting what are seen as both its radical insights and its important shortcomings. The essay essentially follows Heidegger&#146;s own philosophical practice in two senses. First, it takes a strongly historical approach both to the etymology and semantics of the language of ontology, as well as to the context of Heideggerian thought in the tradition of western metaphysics. Second, beyond the method of &#145;immanent critique&#146; alone, it adopts a version of Heidegger&#146;s own methodology of &#145;retrieval&#146; (Wiederholung) in its confrontation with his thought: on one hand affirming the radically insightful nature of key elements of his work, while on the other hand looking to bring out of Heidegger&#146;s (and his precursors&#146;) own texts something of their &#145;drawing back&#146; from the deepest latent implications of his (and their) own insights. The essay begins with a historico-linguistic survey of the language of western ontology, from its origins in ancient Greek and Hellenistic metaphysics, through to its reception into medieval Latin, and onto its deployment in contemporary German and English, in this way establishing a key aspect of the &#145;pre-history&#146; of the &#145;ontological difference&#146; in terms of infinitival-participial renderings of the &#145;question&#146;. The interpretation offered here is then contrasted with key elements of Heidegger&#146;s own reading of the ancient origins of the tradition, and thus the first major strand of the essay&#146;s critique of Heideggerian thought is established along both linguistic and conceptual lines: i.e., that is amounts to an &#145;einaiolisation&#146; of the broad question of ontology. On the basis on this critique, the essay then sets out the understanding of &#145;be&#146; &#949;&#953;&#957;&#945;&#953;, esse, Sein) to be defended in what follows, a reading that situates itself between the Heideggerian and Thomistic positions, affirming and opposing key elements of each. On one hand, the vast wealth of Heidegger&#146;s alethiological phenomenology of &#145;world&#146; is affirmed as a radical advance on traditional static notions of essence, while on the other hand the collapse of any genuine understanding of the depth dimension of &#145;to exist&#146; (&#965;&#960;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;, ex(s)istere) is identified as a major point of contention with Heidegger&#146;s &#145;einaiology&#146;. In this way, the second major strand of the essay&#146;s critique of Heideggerian thought is established: i.e., that it amounts to a partialising &#145;alethiolisation&#146; of ontology. Within the context provided by the essay to this point, a more explicit &#145;retrieval&#146; of Heideggerian thought is then enacted first of all by situating his thought within the broad transcendental-phenomenological tradition in which it is so deeply embedded. In particular, this entails close readings of the methodological exclusion (&#949;&#960;&#959;&#967;&#951;) of exist(ence) seen in texts by Kant and Husserl, a strategy that in both cases is inadequately ameliorated by allusions to that which is surplus (&#220;berschu&#223;) to predication, meaning, sense, essence. Within the rich context provided by this analysis, the nature of Heidegger&#146;s innovation within, and yet deep adherence to, the transcendental-phenomenological tradition is sketched. The essay&#146;s fourth and final chapter involves a detailed confrontation with Heidegger&#146;s delimitation of the Seinsfrage to alethiological and einaiological concerns alone. This involves a close reading of some major early texts on the question of the independent integrity of beings from world(ing) and thus the meaning of Heidegger&#146;s category of &#145;Vorhandenheit&#146;, noting some substantial ambiguities on this question. It also involves a more systematic assessment of the consequential deep inner-contradictions of Heidegger&#146;s project as a whole, including some reflections on strands of early Heideggerian thought that appear to be attempts to address these deeply embedded tensions and problems. The essay&#146;s conclusion very briefly links the enacted critique of Heideggerian &#145;ontology&#146; to the broader question of the understanding of contingency in contemporary continental philosophy, thereby indicating something of the place of these reflections within a larger project of thought &#150; concerning philosophy as a &#145;hermeneutics of awe&#146; &#150; for which it serves as an essential prolegomena.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440106 Logic</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158243</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INTEGRATED WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: Actors and Rules Negotiating Water Management in Indian Himalayas</field><field name="creator">Subramanian, Saravanan Veluswami</field><field name="description">World wide integrated water resource management (IWRM) has gained prominence as a community-based approach for poverty alleviation and environmental management. However, its practical application, its precise meaning and its implication for policy practice has come under increased scrutiny. The thesis makes a proposition that the best way to understand IWRM in practice was to examine the interactive nature of actors and rules influencing water resource management. This proposition is examined to a core water-related issue applicable in four socioeconomically and hydrologically distinct hamlets from two watersheds in India. The thesis draws on new institutionalism from social sciences to evolve an analytical framework that was empirically applied using diverse research methods to unravel the complex interaction. The information (qualitative and quantitative) collected was collapsed in the Bayesian Belief Network model to identify the actors and rules, understand their influence network, and to determine the probability of decisions influencing water management. The study reveals a notable trend on the role of actors and rules in the comparative watersheds. In Khairi-Ka-Kala watershed that was well connected and located in lower hills, statutory actors play a prominent role in providing boundary, position and authority rules for policy making and water allocation. In contrast, in the remote Rajana watershed it was the socially embedded actors. Interestingly, the household&#146;s capabilities were influenced by socially embedded actors that enabled them to access water in both the watersheds. The differential capabilities enabled households to evolve diverse actions that were facilitated by diverse agents of institutional change. Absence of information and scope rules was a major constraining factor for actors towards making informed water related decisions. The study reveals the role of diverse actors and rules negotiating water at various levels in space and time in the watersheds. In this contested regime, the thesis calls for building better infrastructure facilities to facilitate communication among actors, to monitor and evaluate water resource programmes by sectoral actors, facilitate endowments of actors for managing water and to remain adaptive to the diverse roles of agents for institutional innovation. This provides an enabling institutional environment for actors to exercise and negotiate their differential rules to manage water. The thesis concludes by drawing implications for water management, institutional analysis and by identifying area for future research to understand water resources management.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158245</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robot Navigation from Nature: Simultaneous Localisation, Mapping, and Path Planning Based on Hippocampal Models</field><field name="creator">Milford, Michael John</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the use of a hippocampal model as a basis for a complete robot mapping and navigation system. Computational models of animal navigation systems have traditionally had poor practical performance when implemented on robots. The aim of the work was to determine the extent to which hippocampal models can be used to provide a robot with functional mapping and navigation capabilities. The thesis starts with a review of the mapping and navigation problem and the robotic and biological approaches to providing a solution. The problem is a broad one and to completely solve it a robot must possess several key abilities. These include the ability to explore an unknown environment, perform Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (SLAM), plan and execute routes to goals, and adapt to environment changes. The most successful conventional solutions are based on core probabilistic algorithms and use a variety of map representations ranging from metric to topological. These probabilistic methods have good SLAM performance, but few have been successfully integrated into a complete solution to the entire mapping and navigation problem. In contrast, biological systems are generally poorly understood and current models emulating them have poor practical performance. However, many animals solve the entire mapping and navigation problem without the precise sensors and high resolution maps that are typical of robotic methods. Models of the mapping and navigation process in relatively well understood animals such as rodents offer much potential for practical improvement. The thesis describes a series of studies which implemented computational models inspired by the mapping and navigation processes in the rodent hippocampus. The initial study was based on conventional theories of separate orientation and location representations in the rodent hippocampus. The model was tested in a range of experiments that revealed fundamental limitations in its practical usefulness as a SLAM system. A review of the literature revealed no strong evidence suggesting that rodents overcome these limitations and no mechanisms by which they might do so. Consequently the model was then modified to combine its separate representations of robot orientation and location into a single representation of robot pose. This new model, known as RatSLAM, was able to successfully perform SLAM on two different robot platforms in a range of indoor and outdoor environments. A goal memory system was added to RatSLAM to give the robot the ability to plan and execute routes to goals. However, in large complex environments the RatSLAM model&#146;s pose representation exhibits a number of phenomena that cause the goal memory system to fail. These phenomena were removed or modified by the introduction of a new experience mapping algorithm. This algorithm uses the RatSLAM maps to create spatio-temporal-behavioural representations known as experience maps, which preserve the topological structure of the original map. When used in a number of indoor and outdoor experiments the algorithm generated representations that were globally topological and locally spatial. Subsequent work implemented methods for exploration, goal recall, and adaptation using the representations built by the RatSLAM model and experience mapping algorithm. Each of these processes was tested in a range of autonomous robot experiments. In the final experiments the robot, acting in a completely autonomous manner, explored an unknown environment while performing SLAM, then navigated to goal locations while adapting to simple lasting environment changes. The studies described in this thesis provide a detailed analysis of the mapping and navigation capabilities of current computational models of biological systems within the context of producing functional robot systems. Together the RatSLAM model and experience mapping algorithm bring a biologically inspired method into the realm of conventional robot mapping and navigation techniques for the first time. The combined system was developed heuristically and displayed successful, although sometimes suboptimal, performance in a range of real robot tests lasting up to two hours. The work stands as one of the few examples of a complete integrated attempt to solve all the major mapping and navigation challenges faced by mobile robots.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158246</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Active Audition for Robots using Parameter-Less Self-Organising Maps</field><field name="creator">Berglund, Erik Johan</field><field name="description">How can a robot become aware of its surroundings? How does it create its own subjective, inner representation of the real world, so that relationships in the one are reflected in the other? It is well known that structures analogous to Self-Organising Maps (SOM) are involved with this task in animals, and this thesis undertakes to explore if and how a similar approach can be success- fully applied in robotics. In order to study the environment-to-abstraction mapping with a minimum of guidance from directed learning and built-in design assumptions, this thesis examines the active audition task in which a system must determine the direction of a sound source and orient towards it, both in horizontal and vertical direction. Previous explanations of directional hearing in animals, and the implementation of directional hearing algorithms in robots have tended to focus on the two best known directional clues; the intensity and time differences. This thesis hypothesises that it is advantageous to use a synergy of a wider range of metrics, namely the phase and relative intensity difference. A solution to the active audition problem is proposed based on the Parameter- Less Self-Organising Map (PLSOM), a new algorithm also introduced in this thesis. The PLSOM is used to extract patterns from a high-dimensional input space to a low-dimensional output space. In this application the output space is mapped to the correct motor command for turning towards the source and focusing attention on the selected source by filtering unwanted noise. The dimension-reducing capability of the PLSOM enables the use of more than just two directional clues for computation of the direction. This thesis presents the new PLSOM algorithm for SOM training and quantifies its performance relative to the ordinary SOM algorithm. The mathematical correctness of the PLSOM is demonstrated and the properties and some applications of this new algorithm are examined, notably in automatically modelling a robot's surroundings in a functional form: Inverse Kinematics (IK). The IK problem is related in principle to the active audition problem - functional rather than abstract representation of reality - but raises some new questions of how to use this internal representation in planning and execution of movements. The PLSOM is also applied to classification of high-dimensional data and model-free chaotic time series prediction. A variant of Reinforcement Learning based on Q-Learning is devised and tested. This variant solves some problems related to stochastic reward functions. A mathematical proof of correct state-action pairing is devised.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158247</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensitivity of bovine morulae and blastocysts to heat shock in vitro</field><field name="creator">Naik, Veena</field><field name="description">Bovine pre-implantation embryos are sensitive to high temperatures. The hyperthermia resulting from maternal heat stress leads to an increased loss of early stage embryos. The effects of hyperthermia appear to be more pronounced in the zygote than blastocyst stages. There is also evidence to suggest that B. indicus embryos show better resistance to heat shock as compared to B. taurus embryos. The mechanism of thermotolerance in B. indicus embryos is unknown and it is also unclear if the thermotolerance of these embryos is a result of maternal or paternal contributions. There is also evidence to suggest that male embryos survive heat shock better than female embryos. This research therefore aimed 1. To examine the effect of heat shock on day-7 bovine embryos 2. To study the influence of maternal and paternal genotype on the embryo's ability to survive up to 48 hours post heat shock treatment 3. To study the expression of HSP70 in heat-shocked and non-heat shocked embryos and compare B. indicus and B. taurus embryos. 4. To compare the effects of heat shock on rapidly developing (day-6 morulae) and slowly developing (day-7 morulae) embryos to heat shock treatments 5. To determine the effect of heat shock on the sex ratio of the surviving embryos The work described in this thesis used an in vitro protocol for heat shock studies on embryos, based on observed in vivo rectal temperature fluctuations in heat stressed cows. The first study examined the effects of heat shock on embryos at the morula or blastocyst stage on day 7 of in vitro culture. The embryos were produced in vitro from oocytes collected from ovaries of either pure breed B. indicus or B. taurus and fertilised by frozen semen straws of either B. indicus or B. taurus bulls. Day-7 morulae or blastocysts were used for the study. The embryos were subjected to heat shock (HS) (41.5&amp;degC) or non-heat shock (NHS) (39&amp;degC) temperatures. Embryo survival and development 48 hours (48 h) post treatment were recorded. The data were analysed using binary logistic regression using logit link function to determine the Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence limits for individual factors. The variables used as factors in the analysis were replicate, heat shock, maternal genotype (B. indicus vs B. taurus), paternal genotype (B. indicus vs B. taurus) and stage at which heat shock was applied (morula or blastocyst). The outcome variables used for analysis were the number of viable embryos from the total treated and the proportion reaching expanded or hatched blastocyst stage, and the proportion of male embryos. Heat shock significantly reduced the probability of embryo survival by more than half (OR = 0.47; P &#8804; 0.001) and reduced the probability of the embryo's progression to the expanded or hatched blastocyst stage by almost half (OR = 0.58; P = 0.005) as compared to NHS embryos. The probability of survival of embryos with B. indicus paternal genotype (confounded by the use of a single sire) was double (OR = 2.00; P = 0.002) that of embryos with B. taurus paternal genotype. The heat shock x paternal B. indicus genotype interaction was found to be non-significant. Maternal B. indicus genotype showed no influence on thermotolerance. Nevertheless, the probability of progression to expanded blastocysts for embryos with maternal B. indicus genotypes was double (OR = 2.05; P = 0.030) that of embryos with maternal B. taurus genotype. Comparison of day-7 morulae with day-7 blastocysts showed that the probability of day-7 blastocysts surviving until 48 h after treatment was almost two and half times greater (OR = 2.39; P &#8804; 0.001). The probability of survival of a blastocyst with paternal B. indicus genotype was almost twice (OR = 1.95; P = 0.041) when compared to a blastocyst with B. taurus paternal genotype. The interaction term of heat shock &#215; blastocyst stage was found to be significant (OR = 2.70; P = 0.038) indicating that blastocyst stage embryos were resistant to heat shock. The study showed a trend towards survival of more male embryos (61% males vs 39% females) under heat shock conditions (OR = 1.64; P = 0.070) indicating that male embryos may be resistant to heat shock. The second study was designed to detect the induced form of HSP70 in heat shocked and non-heat shocked day-7 bovine embryos and to compare the patterns between B. indicus embryos and B. taurus embryos. Comparison of confocal images showed that staining for HSP70 was present in most embryos whether heat shocked or not and found to be concentrated in the nuclei and cytoplasm. Heat shock appears to have increased HSP70 staining intensity in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, suggesting increased expression of HSP70 after heat shock. The same general staining patterns were seen in heat shocked and non-heat shocked embryos of B. indicus and B. taurus embryos. In the third experiment, embryos were examined for the effects of heat shock on day-7 or on day-6 of their in vitro culture. The data were analysed to study the effects of heat shock, stage at heat shock (day-7 blastocysts vs day-7 morulae) and day of heat shock (day-7 vs day-6) on embryo survival and progression to expanded or hatched blastocysts 48 h post treatment. We found that heat shock reduced the probability of survival by more than half (OR = 0.40; P = 0.004). Probability of survival of day-7 embryos (confounded by rapidly developing blastocysts and slow developing morulae) was less than half (OR = 0.36; P = 0.008), that of day-6 embryos. The data were then analysed to study the effects of heat shock on day-7 blastocysts and day-7 morulae for embryo survival post treatment. Heat shock negatively affected embryo survival (OR = 0.35; P = 0.007). The probability of day-7 blastocysts surviving HS and NHS was more than two and a half times greater (OR = 2.71; P = 0.008) than that of day-7 morulae. No interaction of heat shock and blastocyst stage was noticed. Subsequently the effects of heat shock and the effects of the day of heat shock on morula stage embryos were examined. Overall, heat shock reduced the probability of survival (OR = 0.35; P = 0.009) and the probability of embryo development to the expanded or hatched blastocysts (OR = 0.35; P &#8804; 0.001), 48 h post treatment. The probability of day-6 morulae surviving HS and NHS was almost three times higher (OR = 2.81; P = 0.007) than that of day-7 morulae. The interaction of stage of development with heat shock was not significant. We concluded that an embryo that was capable of developing to the blastocyst stage by day-7 or morula stage by day-6 had better survival and higher probability of progressing to expanded or hatched stage when compared to an embryo that had slow development (day-7 morulae). The study showed a significantly different effect of heat shock on the survival of male and female embryos (63% males vs 36% females, OR = 1.79; P = 0.014). In our final study, embryos were produced from three different bulls each of B. indicus or B. taurus genotype. Heat shock effects consistently and negatively affected survival of embryos (OR = 0.29; P &#8804; 0.001) and their ability to progress to the expanded or hatched blastocysts (OR = 0.42; P &#8804; 0.001). Embryos with paternal B. indicus genotype showed no advantage of survival over embryos with paternal B. taurus genotype embryos. When the day-7 blastocysts were compared with the day-7 morulae, the probability of day-7 blastocysts surviving HS or NHS was more than double (OR = 2.23; P = 0.009) that of day-7 morulae. In this study the effect of survival of the interaction term of heat shock treatment with the blastocyst stage was significant and negative (OR = 0.49; P = 0.040). However the interaction term of blastocyst stage x HS for an embryo&#146;s ability to progress to expanded or hatched blastocyst stage was positive (OR = 2.00; P = 0.052), indicating that the embryos that did survive heat shock were capable of continuing their developmental progress. Although more male embryos (55% male vs 45% female) survived heat shock, the effect for this study was non-significant. In summary, the studies described in this thesis successfully tested a new in vitro heat shock protocol based on in vivo temperature changes experienced by heat stressed cows. Heat shock was consistent in negatively affecting embryo survival. Heat shock also negatively affected the embryo's progression to the expanded or hatched blastocyst stage by 48 h post treatment. We observed variable cytoplasmic and nuclear staining for HSP70 in day-7 blastocysts of both B. indicus and B. taurus. This distribution did not change dramatically after heat shock, but staining appeared to be more intense in heat shocked embryos, suggesting that there was increased expression of HSP70 after heat shock. No difference in this pattern was observed between B. indicus and B. taurus embryos. The speed of development of an embryo until being subjected to either heat shock or non heat shock temperatures affected the probability of survival and further development. However, the interaction term of day-7 blastocyst stage and heat shock was inconsistent, meaning that the rate of development appeared to specifically protect against heat shock in some studies while in the other studies, the apparent protective effect extended to control as well as heat shocked embryos. Our study found no significant influence of B. indicus paternal genotype on embryo survival. Our study showed evidence of B. indicus maternal genotype influence on the embryo's ability to progress to expanded blastocysts but not on embryo survival. The study found a clear trend towards an increased proportion of male embryos surviving heat shock conditions. In some studies this was significant, and in others it was not, but the trend was always in the same direction. This suggests that male embryos are more resistant to the effects of heat shock in vitro.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300402 Animal Reproduction</field><field name="subject">630103 Beef cattle</field><field name="subject">Sensitivity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158248</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CHEMICAL STUDIES OF SECONDARY METABOLITES IN THE SPONGE ACANTHELLA CAVERNOSA FROM SOUTH EAST QUEENSLAND</field><field name="creator">Jumaryatno, Pinus</field><field name="description">The chemical variation and chemical composition of the marine sponge Acanthella cavernosa from three different dive site locations (Coral Gardens, Old Woman Island and Tani&#146;s Reef) at Mooloolaba in South East Queensland Australia has been studied. A series of isocyanide and isothiocyanate metabolites, including axisonitrile-3 (22) and axisothiocyanate-3 (23) have been isolated from this sponge. The structures of all compounds were determined by GC/MS analysis and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. A specimen of Acanthella cavernosa from Coral Gardens yielded 9-aristolene (66), the aromadendrane compound (69), the eudesmane compound (73), axisonitrile-3 (22) and 1-isocyanoaromadendrane (75). These compounds were identical to metabolites of this sponge previously reported from other Mooloolaba collections. Collections of Acanthella cavernosa from Tani&#146;s Reef yielded a great diversity of sesquiterpene isocyanide and isothiocyanates metabolites including a rare isocyanate compound, axisocyanate-3 (95). Axisothiocyanate-2 (79) is reported for the first time from an Australian sample of Acanthella cavernosa. The novel 10-isothiocyanatoguai- 6-ene (78) was isolated and was fully characterised by a complete assignment using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The pair of metabolites, 7-isothiocyanato-7,8-dihydro-F- bisabolene (82) and 7-isocyano-7,8-dihydro-F-bisabolene (94), were reported for the first time in an Australian specimen of the marine sponge Acanthella cavernosa and were fully assigned by 1D and 2D NMR analysis. Furthermore, the literature NMR assignments for 1-isothiocyanatoaromadendrane (67) and 7-isocyano-7,8-dihydro-F- bisabolene (94) were revised using 2D NMR techniques. The structural relationship between the bisabolene NC/NCS pair was confirmed by conversion of the bisabolene isocyanide to the bisabolene isothiocyanate by reaction with sulphur. The presence of NCO functionality was confirmed by conversion of the isocyanate to its urea derivative. Sesquiterpene isocyanides were found to be the major metabolites from the Old Woman Island collection. The sponges also showed some chemical variations in their isothiocyanate metabolites. The presence of axisonitrile-3 (22) and axisothiocyanate-3 (23) in the sponge Acanthella cavernosa has been investigated by comparison of the chemical constituents within samples across three different locations and within individual samples from the same location. The chemical association between nudibranchs and their sponge prey was investigated using Acanthella cavernosa and the nudibranch Phyllidia ocellata collected from the same location at Old Woman Island. Specimens of Phyllidia ocellata contained axisonitrile-3 (22), 1-isocyanoaromadendrane (75) and 10-isocyano-4- amorphene (36) in which compound 22 and 75 were also found in their food source.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158249</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leading conservatoria through change. New challenges for music institutions and their leaders, 1985-2005</field><field name="creator">Lancaster, Helen May</field><field name="description">Conservatoria in the past provided prospective musicians with training in performance, generally in the classical Western European tradition. Most of them were independent of universities, free from academic constraints, focused on performance, flexible in their practice, and desirous of (yet susceptible to) high profile individual leadership. The last two decades in particular have generated significant change, placing conservatoria under increasing pressure from new challenges. Now confronting those shifting boundaries which have reshaped the artistic climate and organisational environment, many are also compelled to broaden access whilst meeting the challenge of reduced government subsidy. New higher education policies and declining resources have caused the relocation of many conservatoria into the university sector, most particularly (but not exclusively) in Australia and the USA. This development has resulted in new systems of governance and different expectations of both the conservatorium and its leaders. Thus government policy impacts on the potential shape of the conservatorium. Changing funding structures in higher education and the arts further complicate the influence government policy might have on conservatoria. For autonomous conservatoria, government arts and education policies directly effect institutional policy and financial stability. Where conservatoria exist within universities, a domino effect devolves the impact of higher education policy to internal units like the conservatorium. Compounding these circumstances is the reality that traditional performance is diminishing in social relevance and the professions into which future music graduates will move are now more diverse than ever before and clearly less dependent solely on conventional music training. Consequently contemporary conservatorium leaders now confront a different, less compliant musical environment. Decisions made by these leaders have the potential to impact well beyond conservatorium walls. Therefore, for those conservatoria which have evolved as part of the cultural infrastructure of their respective communities, internal conservatorium choices may obscure the broader ramifications these choices have for the wider community. From inside the university sector, some conservatoria are challenged to give priority to the needs of the university community, with resultant effects on their individual conservatorium characters. The time-honoured preference for conservatorium leaders to be renowned musicians does not necessarily meet all of the contemporary criteria relevant to the role. Traditionally, leaders in conservatoria were selected for their artistic profile, ostensibly to enhance that of the institution. As spokespersons and figureheads of their institutions, leaders once made more artistic considerations and connections than strategic decisions. Whereas in years past they may have maintained high profile roles as conductors, performers, composers, or musicologists, now leaders are expected to provide varying degrees of artistic direction, academic leadership, curriculum design, administration, financial management, facilities management, event production, marketing, public relations, and community liaison. These diverse roles make an external career unrealistic for most. This dissertation examines the challenges confronting conservatoria as they appear through the eyes of conservatorium leaders around the world. By analysing the leaders&#146; comments in parallel with surveys, case examples, and documentary research, I aim to develop an understanding of the impact these challenges have on conservatoria and those who lead them. Through continual reporting of the emerging results back to the field during the period of the research, I build on their credibility, shedding light on those policies which both shape the conservatorium condition and elicit resilience among some who lead them. The thesis argues that each conservatorium is distinctive, and that the challenges confronting a conservatorium must be viewed in the light of its specific, often unique context. Among conservatoria, uniqueness emerges from the common ground that all such institutions share: within the context of conservatorium family resemblances, it may be that one conservatorium has a mix of quite distinctive attributes or conditions. It is that idiosyncratic set of circumstances shaping each institutional environment which generates this uniqueness, making generalisations problematical and inappropriate to the conservatorium condition. Each context is further complicated by constant change which is both evolutionary and imposed. For these reasons, there is no single profile fitting a conservatorium leader. Rather, leadership style needs to align to shifting circumstances, which implies that conservatorium leaders need to understand how to adjust their approach to leadership as the individual setting evolves. The argument is consistent with the findings that purposive preparation is crucial for leaders of contemporary conservatoria, to give them the diversity of skills required for the role and the flexibility necessary to adapt to changing circumstances. Because a conservatorium has the potential to be part of the cultural infrastructure of the community in which it resides, these conditions carry implications which extend beyond the conservatorium and have the capacity to impact on future generations. The conservatorium culture implies natural intersections with the community through the provision of performance and teaching services. Conservatorium facilities in their turn become part of the repertoire of community performance and recording resources. The extent to which this relationship might develop relies on each conservatorium&#146;s perception of its place within its own community, and each leader&#146;s interpretation of this positioning. A leader who places emphasis on external relationships might embed the institution within the community, socially and culturally. This combined understanding of the institution&#146;s role within the community is a significant factor in the realisation of each conservatorium&#146;s individual potential.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">750201 The performing arts (incl. music, theatre and dance)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158250</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards Improved Experimental Evaluation and Comparison of Evolutionary Algorithms</field><field name="creator">Yuan, Bo</field><field name="description">Despite the continuous advancement of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and their numerous successful applications to a variety of optimization problems over the past decades, a fundamental issue has received relatively little attention: the development of methodologies and tools for the evaluation and comparison of EAs. Due to their massive parallel and inherent stochastic behaviour, theoretical analysis of EAs has proven to be highly challenging. While progress has been made, theoretical analysis remains largely restricted to scenarios where significant simplifying assumptions must be made with respect to the algorithms and/or the problems in question. Consequently, EAs have mostly been evaluated on an empirical basis with a number of widely adopted benchmark problems. There is some conventional practice of experimental evaluation and comparison of EAs in the literature. However, the methodologies and techniques employed often produce results with low scientific value and lead to conclusions that are not sufficiently supported by those results. It is therefore unclear whether such results and conclusions have any consequences for future research or general application of the algorithms applied. Two specific issues are particularly relevant to this thesis. Firstly, it has been recognized that many of the commonly used benchmark problems in the EA community have some unfavourable features for testing the strengths and weaknesses of EAs. In the meantime, the structure of these problems is usually fixed and specified in isolation, making it difficult to compile sets of experimental results where common properties of problems vary in a controlled way, in order to generalize the performance of EAs to other unknown problems. Secondly, each EA is specified by a set of parameters whose values may have a significant impact on its performance. In the literature, parameter values are often selected with little justification or based on some hand-tuning towards a small group of benchmark problems, without conducting proper experimental exploration of the parameter space. The major issue is that the corresponding experimental results are unlikely to be plausible as they are highly restricted to the specific parameter setting and test problems in use. This thesis is dedicated to the methodologies and techniques for conducting rigorous and principled empirical evaluation of EAs, with particular focus on the issues of test optimization problems and experiments over parameter settings of EAs. Most of the experiments in this thesis are conducted using EAs known as Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), which are based on explicit statistical modelling of the problem space. Although the attention is focused on continuous EDAs and optimization problems, the major contributions of this thesis are also equally applicable to other domains. of exhaustive experimentation by around 90% while maintaining the reliability of results. Furthermore, in order to overcome the lack of exploration mechanism in Racing, a hybrid technique combining Racing and Meta-EAs is proposed and is applied to the parameter tuning task of EAs. Experimental results show that this technique can effectively take advantage of both the efficiency and the encoding-free feature of Racing as well as the exploration ability of Meta-EAs. Finally, a challenging real-world engineering design problem is used to provide some empirical evidence on the effectiveness of different EDAs. More importantly, instead of being regarded as a black-box problem, the structure of this problem is characterized by a statistical technique, which can reveal some important properties of the problem at a small fraction of the cost of an extensive exploration. Statistical analysis shows that this design problem is highly multimodal and is unlikely to be efficiently solved by local searching methods. The importance of capturing dependences among variables in practical problems is also highlighted.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158251</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the membrane interactions of K-ras</field><field name="creator">Lau, Chiyan</field><field name="description">Ras proteins are monomeric GTPases which operate in cellular signal transduction pathways to regulate cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Mutations at amino acid residue 12, 13 or 61 render the protein constitutively active and oncogenic. These mutations are found in 30% of human cancers. There are three isoforms of the Ras protein: H-ras, N-ras and K-ras. All three isoforms localize to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, and this localization is important for their biological function. H-ras and N-ras traffic to the plasma membrane via the classical exocytic pathway, while the K-ras trafficking pathway is non-vesicular and is currently poorly characterized. In order to identify the proteins that may be involved in the K-ras trafficking pathway, an affinity chromatography approach was developed. The method utilized the C-terminal membrane-targeting regions of K-ras (CTK) and H-ras (CTH) as baits to purify cellular proteins from mouse brain cytosol. Proteins which selectively interacted with CTK but not CTH were identified by mass spectrometry. Four of these proteins, B23, Ncl, LANCL1 and laminin receptor-1, were further characterized and evaluated as putative K-ras transport factors. B23 localizes to P100 and nuclear fractions, and selectively interacts with K-ras in vivo. However, overexpression or siRNA-mediated knockdown of B23 does not affect plasma membrane localization of K-ras. Ncl localizes to the P100, S100 and nuclear fractions. Nuclear Ncl, but not extranuclear Ncl, selectively interacts with K-ras in vivo. Overexpression of Ncl does not affect the intracellular localization of either H-ras or K-ras. LANCL1 is associated with the P100, S100 and nuclear fractions, and preliminary results show that LANCL1 may selectively interact with K-ras in vivo. Selective interaction between laminin receptor-1 and K-ras could not be confirmed, either in vitro or in vivo. Also, overexpression of laminin receptor-1 has no effect on the P100/S100 distribution of K-ras, or its downstream MEK/ERK signalling. In conclusion, this thesis represents the first known proteomic approach dedicated to the discovery of K-ras transport factors. Three novel selective interacting partners of the membrane targeting domain of K-ras are identified, although their precise function in K-ras trafficking remains to be elucidated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158252</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">VARIATIONS IN ECOPHYSIOLOGICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTES IN PROVENANCES AND FAMILIES OF COROMBIA CITRIODORA SUBSP. VARIEGATA</field><field name="creator">Tejan, Abdul Gassimu</field><field name="description">Attainment of targets for timber production and greenhouse gas reduction requires the establishment of large areas of forest plantations, particularly in the less densely populated tropical and subtropical areas. In Australia, most of the proposed plantations will be hardwood species, particularly species of Eucalyptus. Relatively little is known of the requirements of different hardwood species in plantation as up to now their supplies have come from native forests. Studies have shown that eucalypts growing under different environmental conditions exhibit considerable morphological and physiological variations. However the selection of appropriate taxa for specific environments is hindered by the lark of information available on the physiological responses of different species to environmental variables. The current study investigated the variation in morphological and physiological attributes between and within families and provenances of Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata (CCV) in terms of their adaptability and suitability to different environments. The study was carried out in two phases. The first phase entailed provenance trials in standard glasshouses to determine variations in growth habits, morphological and physiological attributes of seedlings of two Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata provenances and a hybrid of C.torelliana and C. variegata (CT x CV). Each provenance was tested for speed and completeness of germination, post germination survival, photosynthesis, transpiration, leaf area, stem extension, water use efficiency and drought tolerance. There were no significant differences in speed of germination but differences were observed in growth rates and leaf dimensions among the provenances. Differences in photosynthetic characteristics were evident between and within provenances and between watered and unwatered treatments. Differences in net photosynthesis A, stomatal conductance to water vapour, transpiration rate and water use efficiency (WUE) were observed among the provenances and hybrid. Although differences in WUE among the provenances were related to their natural habitats, they exhibited a great degree of plasticity. More detailed studies were conducted in temperature-controlled glasshouses where the significant effects of different temperature and watering regimes on the responses of different populations were observed. In general stomatal control between and within the provenances was related to atmospheric evaporative demand in response to VPD, soil water status and leaf temperature. There was evidence of visible injury to leaves and apical meristems of the CCV provenances particularly after temperatures rose above 45&amp;degC in the compartments following a power failure that lasted more than 12 hours. The second phase was a two-part field study of the provenances in plantations established under different management regimes and in different environments. The first part entailed a pilot study comparing two provenances (Woondum and Presho) from the two extremes of the CCV rainfall gradient in the expectation that they might exhibit differences in water use efficiency. Another provenance (Richmond Range) was included in the second part because of its rapid growth in early trials. This provenance, like Woondum, originated from a high rainfall area. Field measurements of gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf water potential of the three provenances and soil water content were taken over a period of two years at two trial sites, namely, Tiaro (25&amp;deg 46&#146; 30&#148; S 152&amp;deg 38&#146;E) with a mean rainfall of 1295 mm yr&amp;macr&amp;sup1 and Lilydale (27&amp;deg 30&#146; 15&#148; S 152o 15&#146; 3&#148; E) with a rainfall of around 839 mm yr&amp;macr&amp;sup1. Comparative physiological responses across sites showed statistically significant differences among provenances and between seasons. Photosynthetic rates, fluorescence yields and quantum efficiencies were higher at the Tiaro than the Lilydale site and the Woondum provenance showed slightly higher values of these attributes than the other provenances. Irrespective of site, all the provenances studied showed the typical diurnal pattern of variation of water potential (&amp;#936). There was a gradual decrease from predawn (&amp;#936 pd) optimum values to reach minimum values at midday (&amp;#936 md) and recovery began in the late afternoon. A similar trend was observed in the photosynthetic efficiencies of the sample populations. Significant correlations between leaf to air vapour pressure deficit (VPD), stomatal conductance to water vapour (gs), transpiration (E), leaf temperature (Tleaf) and net photosynthesis (A) were strongest at Lilydale, indicating that these variables were important factors underlying environmentally induced differences in productivity between the sites.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158253</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From genotypes to phenotypes and back again: modeling the interaction between individual behaviour and evolution</field><field name="creator">Watson, James Robert</field><field name="description">Computational modeling provides the means to integrate and test biological theories which span different temporal and spatial scales. This thesis computationally explores the evolutionary relationship between inherited genetic information, organism behaviour, and environment. Recent advances in molecular biology have led to an explosion of data and theoretical revision. The sequencing of genomes has led to increased appreciation of the complexity of the genetic system. The notion of genes assigned to phenotypic traits is being replaced with the understanding that complex networks of gene regulation are the driving force of ontogeny, and that the large-scale dynamics of these networks may confer properties such as robustness to the organism. The genetic whole has become greater than the sum of its parts. The mapping from genotypes to phenotypes is only a part of the evolutionary story. While it is generally accepted that multicellular phenotypes do not directly modify the inherited information they pass to their offspring, there are processes such as the Baldwin effect that act over evolutionary time, and through which individual behaviours can alter the genetic composition of populations. Such relationships between environment and populations, and genotype and phenotype, must be accounted for in evolutionary models. This thesis seeks to address the growing need for models which encompass levels from the genotype to the population from two approaches: 1. Investigating the interactions and information flow from the genotype to the phenotype through a computational model of gene extraction and regulation, and 2. Investigating the impact of phenotype and population behaviours on the genotype through a computational model of genetic assimilation. In the first set of studies, the impact of sequence-level modifications were analyzed at the network level. These studies determined that the types of evolutionary operators commonly used in network-level models of gene regulation can be expanded, and their relative frequencies justified. In addition, the structure of the regulatory networks after cumulative sequence duplications were found to be distinct from networks with cumulative random node and link changes. A model linking this genetic system with a developmental plant phenotype was implemented to further explore ways of appropriately modeling and linking genotype and phenotype. Phenotypic development was based on the structure of the gene regulatory network. This model was revised to study the effects of competing selective pressures, with the development of the artificial phenotype controlled by the dynamics of the regulatory network. Evolutionary simulations of this sequence&amp;rarr;network&amp;rarr;plant model successfully resulted in phenotypes adapted to the competing pressures of light interception, reproductive success and surface area. The second set of studies investigated the conditions under which learnt behaviour could be assimilated into inherited information. Extending previous studies of the Baldwin effect, the conditions necessary for this assimilation to occur were analysed with neural network phenotypes operating in both simple and tunably complex environments. It was found that genetic assimilation will occur when (i) conditions are poised such that a small fraction of the population is able to acquire a task through learning, (ii) the task confers sufficient selective benefits, and (iii) the act of learning incurs a cost. By computationally exploring the two key aspects of the genotype / phenotype mapping &#150; how genotypes control phenotypes and how phenotypes influence genotypes &#150; this thesis provides a methodological scaffold upon which increasingly complex models at each of the levels of genotype, phenotype and environment can be built.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158254</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using group learning to promote deep learning, life skills and integration in veterinary science</field><field name="creator">Mills, Paul Christian</field><field name="description">A research-based model of Group Project Work was introduced to encourage deep learning in second-year students enrolled in the School of Veterinary Science (SVS) at The University of Queensland (UQ). The model was developed in response to the concern that students may avoid deep learning strategies in pre-clinical courses of the program particularly if there is little perceived relevance to their chosen career as a veterinary surgeon. The impetus for the development and introduction of Group Project Work was provided by concerns that students may be using superficial learning techniques due to the heavy content and perceived lack of relevance of pre-clinical courses. This was exemplified in the secondyear course, Musculoskeletal Structure and Function, where knowledge taught by traditional approaches did not appear to be satisfactorily retained in later courses of pathology and surgery. It was also apparent that students tended to form small groups to facilitate understanding. However, the traditional approach to structured group learning in medicallyorientated programs involved Problem-Based Learning (PBL) which required substantial resources and presented some concerns about the way students learned and were supported in solving problems. As a result of these concerns, a search of the literature on group learning was conducted. During this research, it was also realised that interactions between students undertaking group learning could engender the development of life skills, such as decision making, teamwork, problem solving and communication skills. These skills have traditionally been considered difficult to 'teach' yet appear to be essential to the successful transition to professional life. The specific structure and formation of groups towards the model of Group Project Work was therefore developed to maximise the group dynamics that would encourage life skills in individual group members. It was understood that group learning was not a novel concept but the specifics of the model, particularly group size and selection of group members, were critical to its success in terms of deep learning and the development of life skills. The small group size of four to five students was substantially lower than PBL groups commonly used in veterinary curricula. More importantly, engineering of group membership based on previous achievement exposed students to differing viewpoints and motivation and, importantly, removed the comfort zone of familiar peer support. This approach was analogous to initial entry into clinical practice and had also been shown to maximise group dynamics. Based on the literature, a model of Group Project Work was developed. An important aspect of model development was to therefore link course content to 'real life' aspects of veterinary clinical practice, which will drive motivation and learning. The model was also developed within the constraints of large class sizes and limited resources in terms of staff and facilities. A highly successful outcome was the integration of students within each cohort, particularly international students. The resultant collegiate atmosphere appeared to support students within each year and motivate appropriate learning strategies. Several iterations of the model have now been implemented with considerable success. Reflections on the learning from this experience have led to enhanced professional knowledge on the application of group work in large veterinary science cohorts and outcomes have been shared with the wider professional community through conference presentations and a number of publications in educational journals. This thesis begins by describing the context of Group Project Work and the concerns that provided the catalyst for this project. A review of the literature consulted then explains the basis of the model that was developed and supports the key features incorporated.

Each of these stages requires separate, but inter-related, methodologies contributing to the eventual published or disseminated results. Archaeologists are increasingly using residue and microfossil identifications and interpretations to discuss artefact function and site development, making inferences about past subsistence and other activities that in turn impact on broader debates about past economic and social practices. It is the contention of this thesis that the stages of archaeological microscopic analysis themselves require closer examination, as a means of assessing and progressing the viability of reconstructions drawn by residue and microfossil analysts. In particular, three components are examined: identification, taphonomy, and the underlying theoretical framework of residue and microfossil interpretation. These components are investigated using light microscopic analysis of ancient starch and stone-tool residues, with a focus on research conducted, and by researchers based, in the Australasian region. A selection of published peer-reviewed papers forms the central chapters of the thesis. These studies investigate archaeological starch identification and misidentification, ancient starch taphonomy (including decomposition, preservation and movement through sediments) and the value of social-archaeological theory in archaeological stone-tool residue analysis. The roles of analytical scale and narrative presentation are explored as one way of coming to terms with, and communicating the findings of, typically smallscale analyses that record the results of very specific past actions. Original introductory and concluding chapters contextualise the research within current and past trends in microscopic residue and microfossil interpretation. This discussion includes the influence of sample sizes over the validity of stone-tool residue analyses and the place of quantitative and qualitative approaches to archaeological sediment starch studies. Outcomes of the project include an emphasis on understanding taphonomic transformation of recovered residue and microfossil assemblages, recognition of the role played by identification in subsequent interpretation, and the contribution of an alternate theoretical and methodological framework for interpreting microscopic residues on stone artefacts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158256</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of Adult Attachment Theory for Chronic Pain</field><field name="creator">Meredith, Pamela Joy</field><field name="description">This thesis presents empirical evidence supporting the relevance of adult attachment theory in understanding the chronic pain experience. The thesis arose from the recognition that, although pain-related psychosocial variables have been used to differentiate subgroups of individuals in chronic pain, little is known about the developmental origins or cognitive, behavioural, or affective correlates of these subgroups. Attachment theory offers a development framework, which is of potential value in guiding early pain intervention and prevention efforts, as well as tailoring interventions to suit specific patient needs. In order to investigate the value of applying adult attachment theory to the chronic pain field, five central research questions were identified: 1) Does insecure attachment contribute to a more negative experience of acute pain for those not diagnosed with a chronic pain condition? That is, does the association between insecure attachment and maladaptive pain-related variables precede the onset of chronic pain)? 2) How do the subgroups of adult attachment, identified in a chronic pain sample, compare to the clusters identified by pain-related psychosocial measures in the same sample? 3) Are the documented associations between attachment and psychosocial variables (i.e., cognitive appraisals, self-efficacy, coping, social support) evident in the context of chronic pain? 4) Do attachment variables moderate the associations between these psychosocial variables and painrelated variables?, and 5) What is the association between adult attachment variables and outcomes from chronic pain rehabilitation programs? To address the first question, an experimental study was designed to explore the perceptions, emotions and coping patterns of 58 pain-free individuals exposed to an acute (coldpressor) pain experience. Findings revealed that higher levels of anxiety over relationships were associated with lower pain thresholds, more stress, depression and anxiety, diminished perceptions of control over pain, and diminished ability to decrease pain. More secure attachment, on the other hand, was associated with greater perceptions of control over pain, and lower levels of depression and catastrophizing. In order to explore research questions 2-5, data from two clinical samples were collected on the first and last days of participation in one of two chronic pain rehabilitation programs (program length varied from two to three weeks). A total of 152 participants completed questionnaires before treatment, with 100 of these participants also completing questionnaires after treatment. Participants were aged between 18 and 82 years (M = 38.8, SD = 12.4), and had been in pain for an average of 3.7 years (SD = 6.9). Approximately 41% of participants were women, and 58% were men (gender for one participant was unknown). In order to address question two regarding the similarity between adult attachment subgroups and pain clusters based on a psychosocial pain measure (Multidimensional Pain Inventory, MPI), pre-treatment data were analyzed. The clustering approach using the MPI, known as Multiaxial Assessment of Pain (MAP), identifies three subgroups of individuals, labeled interpersonally distressed, dysfunctional, and adaptive copers. These clusters were compared with the four subgroups and two dimensions obtained with adult attachment measures. Results revealed that the interpersonally distressed MAP subgroup was associated with fearful attachment, while the dysfunctional MAP subgroup was linked with avoidant (low comfort) attachment. The comfort attachment dimension was associated with more adaptive MPI variables, while the anxious attachment dimension was linked with more maladaptive MPI variables. Consideration of research questions three to five prompted development of an integrative model, the Attachment-Diathesis Model of Chronic Pain (ADMCP), which provided a framework for exploring the psychosocial mechanisms linking attachment security with the outcome variables of perceived pain intensity, disability, and treatment outcomes. Based on predictions emerging from this model, a set of five studies explored pre-treatment associations between adult attachment variables, six psychosocial mechanisms (pain appraisal, depression, pain self-efficacy, anxiety, perceptions of social support, and coping), and outcome variables pre-treatment. One further paper was devoted to implications of adult attachment for treatment outcome. In general, findings from these studies revealed that variables representing attachment insecurity were significantly associated with more maladaptive coping, cognitive, affective and interpersonal characteristics, both before and after treatment, compared to variables reflecting secure attachment. Overall, both securely and insecurely attached individuals made progress in response to pain rehabilitation. Finally, a summary of the evidence of associations between attachment variables, psychosocial mechanisms, and treatment outcomes revealed by this research is presented, permitting discussion regarding the explanatory value of the ADMCP and clinical implications. Limitations to the present research, including family-wise error, the use of self-report measures, and the self-selecting nature of the sample, are discussed, and directions for further research are proposed. The evidence presented in this thesis advances our understanding of the developmental origins of chronic pain conditions, and provides a lens through which to view the heterogeneity of people with chronic pain. Overall, this project highlights the value of applying adult attachment principles to this field. It is anticipated that findings will assist in the development of a more differentiated range of treatment approaches for the individuals who experience chronic pain. In addition, the findings of this project may have important implications for prevention and early intervention of these conditions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158257</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population pharmacokinetics of itraconazole</field><field name="creator">Hennig, Stefanie</field><field name="description">Itraconazole is a triazole antifungal used in the treatment of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and for the prevention of invasive fungal infections in paediatric patients undergoing bone marrow transplants (BMT). The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of this drug and its active metabolite have been described before; however, there is only sparse information available of the PK properties of this drug in the general paediatric population and CF patients in particular. Even though the target concentrations to obtain treatment success from this drug in ABPA have not been established, therapeutic drug monitoring has been shown to be necessary due to a high interpatient variability and low concentrations reported in these patient groups. The general aim of this thesis was to use modelling approaches to provide a better understanding of the PK of itraconazole, in particular to investigate the relative bioavailability of the two commercial formulations (capsule and oral solution), and to attempt to evaluate relationships between patient characteristics and parameters to enable better individualised therapy to maximise the benefits of this drug. The first study was a paediatric population PK (popPK) investigation of itraconazole and its active metabolite hydroxy-itraconazole in CF and BMT patients. All paediatric CF or BMT patients taking oral itraconazole for therapeutic reasons were eligible for the study. A minimum of two blood samples were drawn after the capsules and also after switching to oral solution, or vice versa. Itraconazole and hydroxy-itraconazole plasma concentrations were measured by a newly developed and validated high-performance liquid chromatography. A nonlinear mixed-effects modelling approach (NONMEM 5.1.1) was used to describe the PK of itraconazole and hydroxy-itraconazole simultaneously. A 1-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination best described itraconazole kinetics, with first order conversion to hydroxy-itraconazole. For itraconazole, the apparent clearance and volume of distribution was 35.5 L/h and 672 L, respectively; the absorption rate constant for the capsule formulation was 0.0901 h&#175;&#185; and for the oral solution formulation it was 0.959 h&#175;&amp;sup1. The relative bioavailability for the capsules was 0.55. Of several screened covariates, only allometrically scaled total body weight significantly improved the fit to the data. No difference between the two populations was found. High inter-patient variability confirmed previous data in CF, leukaemia and BMT patients. From the population model, simulations were performed to develop more adequate dosage regimens to achieve target therapeutic trough plasma concentration of 0.5 mg/L. Higher doses of itraconazole than presently used are needed in these patients, particularly when it is prescribed as capsules. To further support the aims of the thesis, a popPK study with oral itraconazole and its active metabolite in adult patients with CF for capsule and oral solution was performed. A D-optimal study design was developed in MATLAB using POPT v. 2.0, B, which was based on the administration of solution and capsules to 30 patients in a cross-over design. Eight blood samples were taken on two occasions as per the optimal sampling design and assayed by HPLC. NONMEM (5.1.1) was used for the popPK analysis. A total of 241 blood samples were collected, of which 94% were taken within the defined optimal sampling window. A 2-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination best described itraconazole kinetics, with first order formation for metabolism to the hydroxy-metabolite. Absorption rate constants for capsule and solution were 0.0315 h&#175;&#185; and 0.125 h&#175;&#185;, respectively. The comparative bioavailability of the capsule to solution was 0.82 in this study. There was no evidence of nonlinearity in the PK of itraconazole and no screened covariate significantly improved the fit to the data. There was high inter-patient variability confirmed previous results in CF. The optimal design performed well for estimation of model parameters from a complex parent-metabolite popPK model. Due to the sampling windows, most of the samples could be collected within the daily hospital routine, but at times that were &#147;near-optimal&#148; for estimating the popPK parameters. Simulations from the final model showed that the current dosing regimen of 200 mg twice daily would provide a trough target concentration at steady state in only 35% of patients when administered as the solution, and 31% when administered as the capsules. The optimal dosing schedule was 500 mg b.d. for both formulations. Since the therapeutic target for itraconazole, is still unresolved, the potential risks of these dosing schedules need to be assessed on an individual basis. This thesis provides information on several methods and their applications to sparse sampling population pharmacokinetic studies and offers results and future directions to maximize the benefits of itraconazole therapy. The population modelling approach has been successfully applied to both clinical studies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320503 Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics</field><field name="subject">730101 Infectious diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158258</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF A CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WITH ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS IN THAILAND</field><field name="creator">Phukao, Darunee</field><field name="description">Development and evaluation of a culturally appropriate treatment program for people with alcohol use disorders in Thailand Rationale The increasing prevalence of alcohol dependence is well documented in Thailand.

The central hypothesis was that providing a BUMICBT to Thai people with alcohol dependence in addition to standard inpatient treatment would facilitate abstinent and reduce overall alcohol consumption, increase motivation and coping skills at post treatment compared with a control group receiving the standard treatment only. Design Subjects were required to be aged 18-65 years and met the diagnostic criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence on the structured interview CIDI-AUTO. Subjects were randomly allocated to an experiment group, BUMICBT plus standard care (N=26) or a control group, standard care, alone (N=19). Setting Subjects were volunteers recruited from a central drug- treatment hospital, Thanyarak Hospital, Thailand. Measurement Measures of average alcohol consumption (Time Line Follow Back inventory), motivation to change (Contemplation ladder inventory), and coping skills (Process of change, alcohol inventory) were administered at pre and post intervention and at 1, 3 and 6-month follow up. Intervention The BUMICBT intervention involved providing five 2-hour daily sessions for 5 consecutive days. Group sizes did not exceed 8 participants. The BUMICBT approach consisted of providing psychological techniques in culturally acceptable philosophical context. Principles of BMICBT included Chanta (motivation) enhancement, Thai boxing principles for assisting patients in establishing their goals and plans for changing their drinking behaviour, Buddhism Contemplation self monitoring strategies for identifying components of problematic drinking behaviour, Buddhidm- Yonisomanasikarn-cognitive strategies for restructuring maladaptive thoughts encouraging patients to maintain problematic drinking behaviour, and behavioural strategies derived from behavioural therapy discipline and from the three fold training Buddhism principles for dealing with high risk situations tempting patient to drink. The Buddhism Four Noble Truth problem solving principle was employed as the therapeutic process to help people change. Findings There was a significant reduction in overall alcohol consumption in participants receiving BUMICBT in addition to standard care and this improvement remained relatively consistent and did not decline significantly over the 6-month follow up period. In addition, participants receiving BUMICBT in addition to standard care also demonstrated significantly higher levels of motivation to change, self-efficacy, working alliance and quality of life compared to the control group. However, no effect was found for coping skill enhancement. Conclusions This is the first randomized controlled trial conducted in Thailand evaluating the efficacy of a culturally appropriate treatment for treating inpatients with alcohol use disorders. Results provide preliminary support that a brief course of BUMICBT assists Thai inpatients with high level of alcohol dependence to reduce their alcohol consumption, increase motivation to change, increase self efficacy and achieve positive client rated working alliance ratings during treatment. BUMICBT represents an innovation of alcohol inpatient treatment as it is a culturally appropriate integrating evidence-based contemporary Western approaches which provides an effective option for Thai populations. In addition, this treatment can be provided in a group setting over a one-week period as an addition to existing treatment programs. Therefore, it represents another resource effective intervention that can be delivered by a suitably qualified health practitioner. Limitations are a small sample size limiting the generalizabilty of results. Replication is a priority to evaluate whether the effects found in this study can be found in other treatment settings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158259</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Biology of Nod2</field><field name="creator">Barry, Guy</field><field name="description">The NOD-LRR (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat) family of proteins in mammals form part of a wider, extremely well conserved pathogen detection system that includes the CED (cell death abnormality) proteins in C. elegans and the pathogen-detecting disease resistance (R) proteins in plants. The mammalian NOD-LRR protein Nod2 has been shown to mediate NF-KE! activation upon activation by MDP (muramyl dipeptide), a breakdown product of bacterial cell walls, and is thought to form part of the innate host defense system. This protein was isolated as a susceptibility gene for Crohn's disease (CD), an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and to Blau syndrome (BS) which is characterised by early-onset granulomatous arthritis, uveitis and skin rash with carnptodactyly. Data presented in this thesis shows Nod2 mRNA significantly increased with TLR ligands and far less by MDP. The combination of these ligands resulted in an additive effect of Nod2 mRNA production, as examined using real-time PCR, indicating that separate signalling pathways could exist for TLR ligands and MDP. Microarray data showed overlapping, but not exact, gene sets for LPS and MDP, and that MDP induced gene expression at a slower rate than LPS. Furthermore, MDP alone had no observed effect in MTT assays and osteoclast formation using RAW264.7 cells, but the combination of MDP and TLR ligands proposed potential links to apoptosis and osteoclastogenesis respectively. Together these data suggest the need for an initial stimulus for the priming of Nod2. Whereas most of the mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLR) span the cell membrane and bind extracellular pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), Nod2 is cytoplasmic. As it is proposed to play a role in the intracellular PAMP detection system the intracellular location is an important issue. In this thesis it is shown that Nod2 is part of a large cytoplasmic protein complex. and not associated with a membrane-bound organelle such as the endosomal compartment. Attempts to identify intracellular partners of Nod2, with an MDP responsive, V5-His-tagged full length construct, have not been successful to date. Stimulation of Nod2 by MDP has been shown to activate NF-a, linking Nod2 to the inflammatory process, and CD-associated mutants lack this ability. This would seem to contrast the phenotype of CD in patients, exhibiting excess levels of NF-KJ3 and other inflammatory mediators. However, the activation of NF-KB can be part of a negative regulatory pathway. Protein expression in baculovims of the possible dominant-negative LRR domain of Nod2 was suspended after the protein was found to be insoluble and usable amounts were not able to be produced.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158260</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stand Still, Look Pretty: Representation and Tradition in Mainstream American Women&#146;s Country Music 1972-2005</field><field name="creator">Wical, Carol Jane</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that a women&#146;s tradition in mainstream American country music, though it seemingly cannot help but initially mimic the patriarchal model must, at some point, depart from that schema. This departure is necessary as a women&#146;s tradition emerges and attempts to escape the inheritance of a definition the female as subjective object. In the largest possible sense, my question is: How do women utilise narratives that define women? American society has a history of inhibiting the power of women. This suggests that women redefining themselves with any degree of self-awareness need to do so with care. This in turn suggests the need to disguise any attempts at redefinition. This thesis considers how disguise is employed to achieve this within a specific cultural model in a specific timeframe &#150; the popular music genre of mainstream American country music 1972-2005. Although many scholarly approaches to this genre have been concerned with country music history and its perceived homogeneity, this work considers change and the influence of contemporary.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158261</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Model Validity of Published Homeopathic Studies</field><field name="creator">McErlain, Louise</field><field name="description">Homeopathy, as a form of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), is increasingly used by consumers worldwide. Its effects are not well known and usually considered placebo by health care researchers and care providers within the rationalist tradition. Research studies have tested this and other aspects of homeopathy. However many research papers, while having reviewed a range of statistical issues for quality of research in the area of homeopathy, have avoided confronting the equally important phenomenological issue of the required principles and practice in homeopathy, thus raising questions of the validity of much of this research. It is the thesis of this study that the 'scientific' results reported have an ongoing impact within the health care infrastructure, in the perpetuation of a biased health model. This research uses the (Lewith, Walach, &amp; Jonas, 2002) concept of model validity to seek evidence on the validity of evidence-base research, and applies T.S. Kuhn's paradigm theory as the possible explanation for the research problem. Using a template; content analysis on a random sample of studies on homeopathy over a six year period, it was found there was no measurable change towards an application of model validity in the research methods used in studies published from 1996-2001. These finding shows no evidence there is a change towards paradigm sensitivity using model validity in the research on homeopathy. From the Kuhnian perspective this result does not support a theory of a paradigm alteration. It is recommended that clinical trials of homeopathy apply homeopathic principles more rigorously in order to increase the validity of their findings. In addition, more specific longitudinal studies may present a clearer picture of what is happening for paradigm sensitivity in research on homeopathy.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158262</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into the Mechanisms of Drug Modulation of Inhibitory Ligand-Gated Ion Channels</field><field name="creator">Hawthorne, Rebecca</field><field name="description">The ligand gated ion channel superfamily (LGIC) is a group of structurally related ion channels which are activated upon binding of an extracellular neurotransmitter. These receptors share a similar structure with five subunits arranged pseudosymmetrically around the ion conducting pore with each subunit containing four transmembrane domains. The glycine receptor (GlyR) and &amp;#947-aminobutyric acid types A and C receptors (GABA[subscript]AR and GABA[subscript]CR) mediate fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. The search for novel peptides specific for these channels may help in identifying native receptor subtypes, in characterising their physiological roles, in investigating their structural and functional properties and in providing therapeutic leads. Marine cone snail venoms are a rich source of neuropeptides specifically targeting ion channels. No peptides targeting the inhibitory GlyR, GABA[subscript]AR or GABA[subscript]CR have yet been identified. Venoms from various Conus species were screened for activity on the &#945;1 GlyR, &#945;1&#946;1 and &#945;1&#946;3 GABA[subscript]ARs and &#961;1 and &#961;1&#961;2 GABA[subscript]CRs heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells. Patch-clamp electrophysiology and a yellow fluorescent protein based assay were employed for this purpose. Although no active peptides were identified, several active fractions were identified. In combination, these two methods provide a fast screening process followed by a more detailed examination of the venom/ receptor interaction. The Conus venoms remain a promising source of novel peptide modulators of inhibitory LGICs. Agonist-induced conformational changes in the &#945;1 GlyR M2-M3 loop are important for receptor activation. The substituted cysteine accessibility method was used to demonstrate that the allosteric modulator, picrotoxin (PTX), could induce conformational changes in the M2-M3 loop which could not be attained by changing the glycine concentration alone. This revealed a hitherto unexpected complexity in the role of the M2-M3 loop. Two mutants tested in these experiments (R271C and K276C) resulted in PTX being trapped in the pore in the closed state. These mutants should be useful for characterising other pore-binding molecules. Extracts from the Ginkgo biloba tree have recently been shown to block native GlyRs. To investigate the molecular basis of these interactions, several Ginkgo compounds, ginkgolides A, B and C and bilobalide (GA, GB, GC and BB), were investigated at the &#945;1, &#945;2, &#945;1&amp;#946 and &#945;2&amp;#946 GlyRs. The compounds exhibited distinct patterns of subunit selectivity. The most prominent difference was that BB inhibition was less sensitive in heteromers relative to homomers whereas GA, GB and GC inhibition was in general more sensitive in heteromers relative to homomers. Mutational analysis of the M2 domain suggested a direct interaction between ginkgolides and the 2&#146; and 6&#146; pore-lining residues. This was supported by molecular modelling and mutant cycle analysis. The Ginkgo compounds may be useful as probes for investigating GlyR pore structure and as tools for identifying GlyR subtypes in native tissues. The LGIC superfamily is an important group of receptors. This thesis focussed initially on identifying new peptides targeting inhibitory LGICs. It subsequently employed known compounds to investigate GlyR structure and function. These later studies provide examples of how toxins may be used to characterise LGIC structure and function.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158264</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurement and modelling of gas dispersion characteristics in a mechanical flotation cell</field><field name="creator">Sanwani, Edy</field><field name="description">The gas dispersion characteristics in mechanical flotation cells have a significant effect on the overall flotation performance. Three major properties that can be measured in characterising the gas dispersion in a flotation cell are bubble size, gas hold-up, and superficial gas velocity. Another property that is equally important in flotation is bubble surface area flux which is calculated from bubble size and superficial gas velocity. Despite the importance of gas dispersion in flotation, not much work has been reported previously in this area. Moreover, the study of gas dispersion in flotation has typically considered only a few points in a flotation cell and the average values were assumed to represent the gas dispersion characteristics in the entire volume of the cell. It is known however, that the gas dispersion characteristics are not uniformly distributed in a mechanical flotation cell. This thesis seeks to understand better the gas dispersion characteristics in mechanical flotation cells with a view to optimisation, modelling, cell comparison and selection. The main aim of this thesis was to measure comprehensively the gas dispersion characteristics in a mechanical flotation cell, analyse the behaviour in the entire volume of the cell, and develop a methodology for modelling the gas dispersion characteristics in the whole volume of the cell as well as develop the models themselves. For this purpose, a fully instrumented 3 m&#179; glass rectangular flotation cell at the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC) at the University of Queensland was used. The cell was fitted with a Dorr-Oliver impeller-stator mechanism and was provided with facilities to change impeller speed and gas flow rate. Sensors to measure the gas dispersion characteristics were also acquired and modified. This cell could only be operated in a two-phase (air-water) system but the opportunity was taken to make some comparative measurements in an operating plant in a three-phase slurry to compare the gas dispersion characteristics in two and three-phase systems. The comprehensive measurements of the gas dispersion characteristics (i.e. bubble size, gas hold-up, and superficial gas velocity, with subsequent calculation of bubble surface area flux) throughout the entire volume of the 3 m&#179; rectangular flotation cell show that the properties do vary with distance from the impeller, the cell bottom, and the walls. Statistical analysis to test the homogeneity of the properties in the cell confirmed that the differences (variation with distance) were real. It was found that the gas dispersion was poor in the corners of a rectangular flotation cell. These corners are referred to as dead zones. It can be interpreted that in these zones, flotation is less effective compared to other zones in a cell. The results of mapping the gas dispersion characteristics throughout the entire volume of the flotation cell were used to determine the best location to measure gas dispersion characteristics in a flotation cell in order to represent the overall values. It was established that this location in a flotation cell is about halfway between the impeller and the wall, and halfway between the bottom of the flotation cell and the pulp-froth interface. Statistical analysis also showed that there is &#147;quarter symmetry&#148;, i.e. there is no significant difference between equivalent positions in different quarters in a horizontal plane. In any future work, therefore, measurements of the gas dispersion characteristics need only be made in one quarter, and symmetry in the rest of the cell can be assumed. Following from the statistical analysis that established quarter symmetry in the 3 m&#179; glass rectangular flotation cell, a methodology to model gas dispersion characteristics in the entire volume of a rectangular mechanical flotation cell was developed, based on an experimental design known as CCRD (central composite rotatable design) which then modified. Using the methodology, models to predict bubble size, gas hold-up, superficial gas velocity and bubble surface area flux in the entire volume of a rectangular flotation cell were developed as a function of air flow rate and impeller speed. The validity of the models was tested using a predictive (cross) validation method, from where it was concluded that the models were valid. These models were then used to analyse the gas dispersion characteristics in detail in the flotation cell, as a function of flow rate, impeller speed, and location in the cell. Finally, a comparison of gas dispersion characteristics in two and three-phase systems in flotation cells was made. Comprehensive measurements of gas dispersion characteristics were performed in a three-phase slurry in an industrial OK 38 m&#179; rectangular flotation cell at the PT Freeport Indonesia concentrator, and the results were compared to those measured previously in the two-phase system in the 3 m&#179; rectangular cell. It was found that the profiles of gas dispersion were generally similar in both cells but the magnitude of the gas dispersion properties differed between the two systems. The presence of solid particles had greater effect on the bubble size than on gas hold-up and superficial gas velocity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290702 Mineral Processing</field><field name="subject">640300 First Stage Treatment of Ores and Minerals</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158265</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of affect, fairness, and social identification in vertical and lateral exchange relationships</field><field name="creator">Tse, Ho-Man Herman</field><field name="description">Considerable research attention has been devoted to understanding the implications of leader-member exchange (LMX) theory over the last thirty years (see Graen &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1995, for a review). A review of research has suggested that LMX substantially influences employees' work attitudes and behaviours (e.g., see Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997; Janssen &amp; Van Yperen, 2004). Nonetheless, there is an important omission in LMX research; namely, how does LMX quality influence people outside of the dyadic relationships (Sias &amp; Jablin, 1995)? Sparrowe and Liden (1997), Liden and Sparrowe (in press) and Oh, Chung and Labianca (2004) suggest that interpersonal exchange relationships between leaders, subordinates, and coworkers are interconnected to constitute a larger social system that operates in teams and organisations. Similarly, based on a systems perspective, Graen and Uhl-Bien (1995) call for more research to understand how LMX dyadic relationships influence employees' work attitudes, behaviours and perceptions in larger collectives of workgroups. This is because LMX quality is not only influenced by, but may also influence other exchange relationships within the larger system. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the characteristics of a dyadic relationship between a leader and a subordinate will also have implications for team member exchange (TMX), defined by Seers (1989) as the relationship quality between an individual and her or his team members (see also Sherony &amp; Green, 2002; Sias, 1996; Sias &amp; Jablin, 1995). In this thesis, therefore, my aim is to advance the research on interpersonal exchange relationships by addressing research questions that explore how vertical exchange relationships between supervisors and subordinates influence lateral exchange relationships among team members in organisations. Specifically, I have integrated social exchange theory (SET), social identity theory (SIT), emotional contagion theory (ECT), and climate research to develop and to test a multilevel model. At the individual level, I theorised that LMX quality influences individual team members' perceptions of TMX quality. I also hypothesised that social identification and affect act as cognitive and affective mechanisms that mediate the relationship between LMX quality and TMX quality. At the group level, I hypothesised that LMX differentiation fairness moderates the relationship between LMX quality and social identification, while affective climate moderates the relationship between individual team members' positive affect and TMX quality. In order to test the validity of my model, I adopted the post-positivist research position resting on a realist ontology (what is the nature of reality), an objective epistemology (the relationship between the knowledge and the inquirer), where both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to investigate the hypothesised relationships in three studies. Study 1 was an exploratory study intended to identify the nature of TMX and the role of emotions within the team member exchange relationships. Personal in-depth interviews and surveys were used to collect qualitative and quantitative data in this study. The sample for this study was 25 employees working in five different teams in a private health service provider and a medium-sized construction material company in Australia. The qualitative results revealed that a variety of exchanges occur within the team member relationships, including relationship-oriented and task-oriented exchanges. Team members also reported that they experienced both positive and negative emotions in response to their TMX relationships. The quantitative results further indicated that positive emotions, rather than negative emotions, were associated with effective TMX relationships. These results support the findings of past research on TMX and emotions in teams, suggesting TMX relationship was an important outcome variable. Based on these results, only positive affect was included in the model to be examined in the remainder of the studies. Study 2 used a quantitative cross-sectional design to examine the relationships between LMX quality, social identification, positive affect, and TMX quality at the individual level of the multilevel model. The sample for this study was 262 employees of an Australian bank and a national restaurant chain. A web-survey was developed and used to collect data from employees and structural equation modelling (SEM) was utilised to analyse the data. Results showed that LMX quality was positively related to social identification and TMX quality. Further, social identification was found to mediate the relationship between LMX quality and TMX quality, while positive affect mediated the relationship between social identification and TMX quality. These results are consistent with SET, SIT and ECT and support the individual-level relationships between the variables in the model. Study 3 was designed to test the group-level moderating effects of LMX differentiation fairness and affective climate on individual-level relationships between the variables. This study built on the results of Study 2 to evaluate the validity of the overall model. Manager-reported and self-reported questionnaires were used to collected data from 2 15 manager-employee matched dyads working in 36 teams for an Australian bank. Managers provided ratings on LMX quality for each of their subordinates within a team, while employees provided ratings on LMX differentiation fairness, affective climate, social identification, positive affect, and TMX quality. Hierarchical liner modelling (HLM) was used to analyse the multilevel data. Results confirmed that the individual-level relationship between individual team members' positive affect and TMX quality was moderated by group-level affective climate. Overall, findings from this research provide mostly supportive evidence for the hypothesised relationships in the model. The major findings demonstrate that employees enjoying high-quality LMX relationships tend to develop high-quality TMX relationships with their team members because they strongly identify with their teams, and that this identification induces positive emotions, which in turn enhances TMX quality. In addition, individual team members experiencing positive affect were found to be more likely to form high-quality TMX relationships with others when the affective climate in their teams is strong. To the best of my knowledge, this research is among the first to explore interpersonal exchange relationships in a larger social system in organisations by developing and testing a multilevel model. I have outlined the theoretical contributions of this research to SET, SIT, ECT, and climate research. In practical terms, this research increases our understanding of how managers use high-quality relationships with subordinates as a means of maximising individual and team effectiveness by demonstrating concern for subordinates' emotional well-being in the workplace.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">350200 Business and Management</field><field name="subject">720403 Management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158266</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cysteine-rich bioactive peptides A structural and biological characterisation of toxins and bioactive peptides</field><field name="creator">Jin, Aihua Jean</field><field name="description">Cysteine-rich peptides have evolved in a wide range of organisms, and many of these peptides possess specific biological properties. From Na+, Ca&amp;sup2+, and K+ ion channels to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), guanylyl cyclase receptors, and G-protein coupled receptors, cysteine-rich peptides from various species form a large ligand family that act on a broad spectrum of ion channels and membrane proteins with highly refined specificity. Hence, these peptide ligands are invaluable as pharmacological tools and as platforms for developing therapeutic and agricultural agents. This thesis focuses on structural function relationships of cysteine-containing bioactive peptides, including two disulfide-bonded &amp;#945-conotoxins, one disulfide-bonded taipan snake natriuretic peptide and the four disulfide-bonded human hepcidins. A novel &#8216;molecular pruning&#8217; approach was undertaken in chapter 2, based on the hypothesis that &amp;#945-conotoxin [A10L]PnIA could be truncated to smaller loop sizes, while maintaining selectivity and potency. A series of designed truncated analogues of [A10L]PnIA with their unnatural loop sizes [4/6, 4/5, 4/4 and 4/3] were orthogonally synthesised and their structures were analysed by CD and NMR. Their stability was investigated via disulfide scrambling assays, and their binding strength and potency on &#945;7 nAChR were determined via electrophysiology. Outcomes indicate that the second loop of [A10L]PnIA [4/7] could be truncated to smaller loop sizes [4/6, 4/5, 4/4], and still maintain full potency. However, the penalty for truncation was decreased conformational stability. Alpha-conotoxins contain a consensus framework with two disulfide bonds and two variable loop sizes [3/5, 4/3, 4/6, and 4/7]. The newly discovered &amp;#945-conotoxin BuIA is a gene derived mature toxin with a unique loop size [4/4]. The novel &amp;#945-conotoxin BuIA, as a valuable probe to determine the influence of loop size and disulfide bond connectivity to the structure and activity of &amp;#945-conotoxins, was investigated in chapter 3. The globular BuIA and its ribbon isomer were synthesised using orthogonal cysteine-protecting strategy. Their activity was determined by electrophysiology and their structures were analysed by NMR. The results obtained indicate that the globular BuIA was active at the &#945;3&#946;2 &amp; &#945;3&#946;4 nAChRs but displayed multiple conformations in solution. In contrast, the ribbon BuIA formed a well-defined single conformation in solution; however, it did not possess activity at the nAChRs. Outcomes indicate that the [4/4] loop spacing appears to be unique and does not allow a single preferred globular conformation. Natriuretic peptides including ANP and BNP are of great research interest not only because they have been known as body fluid volume modulators for 27 years, but also because they have been gradually recognised as natural protective hormones to compensate for deteriorating function involving chronic respiratory disease, renal dysfunction, and congestive heart failure. Chapter 4 focuses on SAR and stability studies of a group of novel taipan natriuretic peptides (TNPa, TNPb, and TNPc). TNP toxins and designed analogues were chemically synthesised and their activities were determined on conscious rabbits and cultured MDCK cells. TNPc stability was investigated via plasma and pure enzyme assays and its structure was analysed via NMR. Whole animal experiments on rabbits indicate that TNPc is equipotent with hANP in lowering blood pressure. Stability assays indicate that TNPc has a much longer half-life than hANP and NMR studies indicated that TNPc is more structured than that reported for hANP. Hepcidins have been identified as predominantly negative regulators of iron absorption in mammals. They are short, four disulfide-bonded cationic peptides, with a characteristic ladderlike &amp;#946-hairpin structure and an interesting vicinal disulfide bond located in the hairpin loop. These small, cysteine-rich peptides are of great research interest in deciphering mammalian iron imbalance. Chapter 5 focuses on the synthesis of human hepcidins (hHep) via Boc solid phase peptide synthesis technology, as previous low yielding synthetic approaches to hepcidins were reported. Two different synthetic strategies were applied: a random air oxidation and a direct synthesis via vicinal selenocystine substitution. The synthetic products were verified by comparison with native urine-derived hepcidins via LC/MS. Outcomes from this chapter were that the synthesis of hHep20 could be achieved using a redox random air oxidation, whereas the oxidation yield for hHep25 was low. The synthetic process via vicinal selenocystine substitution was advantageous compared with random air oxidation and could be applicable to the future orthogonal synthesis of hepcidins. In addition, the vicinal disulfide bond was proven to be important to the folding of hHep, in comparison with folding of Abu substituted analogues.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158267</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maximising Upper Limb Recovery after Stroke</field><field name="creator">Barker, Ruth Nancy</field><field name="description">Upper limb recovery after stroke is unacceptably poor. As few as one in five stroke survivors regain functional use of the arm, compared with four out of five who regain the ability to walk again. With more people surviving strokes, and with an increase in severe disability, greater demand on services has led to a reduction in hospital length of stay. As the time available for upper limb training is rapidly diminishing, the search for effective and efficient strategies to promote upper limb recovery has become more pressing. Consequently, the aim of this project was to investigate how to maximise upper limb recovery across the stroke population. The first objective was to identify factors that influence recovery, from the stroke survivors&#146; perspective and the scientific literature. The second objective was to develop and evaluate a training program to promote upper limb recovery. A mixed methodology design, which included qualitative and quantitative approaches, was utilized. The project began with a series of focus groups and in-depth interviews with stroke survivors from rural and metropolitan areas of Queensland, Australia (n = 29). A long term view of recovery, with stroke recovery services supporting stroke survivors to drive their own recovery, was advocated. Based on these findings, a quantitative mail-out survey was developed and administered to stroke survivors throughout Queensland (n = 220). The single most important factor found to contribute to recovery was the &#145;use of the arm in everyday tasks&#146;. The second most important factor, which represented the greatest barrier to upper limb recovery, was &#145;not enough movement to work with&#146;. With these findings in mind, review of the scientific literature was undertaken. Motor impairment and the loss of normal movement synergies were identified as key causes of upper limb disability. To enhance recovery across the population, interventions which increase muscle strength and flexibility, and promote reacquisition of skill were recommended. Review of the clinical evidence provided support for this recommendation in part, with intensive and repetitive task-oriented practice found to be effective in promoting upper limb recovery. However, in the context of severe paresis, the application or effectiveness of this approach had not been clearly demonstrated. Therefore, the challenge of this thesis was to make task-oriented practice possible for stroke survivors with severe paresis. Combining the perspective of stroke survivors with the scientific literature, a new intervention was developed to train the task of reaching in stroke survivors with severe paresis. This intervention included a custom built training device, the &#145;SMART Arm&#153;&#146;, for use with or without Electromyography-Triggered Functional Electrical Stimulation (ETS) to the triceps brachii muscle to augment elbow extension. The final stage of the project involved a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess the efficacy of this newly developed intervention in stroke survivors with severe and chronic upper limb paresis. Of the 33 participants who completed the study, 10 received training in reaching to a target using the SMART Arm&#153; with ETS, 13 received the same training but without ETS and 10 received no intervention. Significant improvements in arm impairment and activity limitations occurred after only 12 hours of training, and were maintained two months after training had ceased. No significant changes occurred for those who did not receive training. Changes in triceps and biceps electromyography (EMG) activity indicated that increased coordination of muscles involved in the reaching task may have contributed to improvements. Changes measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) demonstrated that contralateral corticospinal excitability had improved after training in parallel with changes in arm function. While it was apparent that this was the most efficient mechanism for recovery, variation in the utilisation of contralateral and ipsilateral pathways indicated that a number of different mechanisms may have been responsible for recovery of upper limb function. Contrary to our hypothesis, training with, compared to without ETS, did not lead to greater improvements in arm function. Difficulties associated with use of EMG activity to trigger delivery of electrical stimulation (ES) may have concealed possible benefits. Hence, our future research will investigate movement outcome as an alternative method for triggering ES. The study findings confirm that intensive and repetitive task-oriented practice promotes upper limb recovery, even in stroke survivors with severe and chronic paresis. This represents a critical step towards enabling a greater proportion of stroke survivors to drive their own recovery, thereby increasing the potential for improved upper limb recovery across the population.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158268</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probing Chemical, Structural and Electrical Conductivity Changes in Ion Implanted Polyetheretherketone</field><field name="creator">Tavenner, Eric Lloyd</field><field name="description">The ion implantation of the surface of amorphous polyetheretherketone (PEEK) substrates with 50 kV nitrogen ions, 10 &amp; 45 kV tin ions, as well as the 50 kV nitrogen ion beam mixing of tin and tin/antimony thin &#175;lms with PEEK substrates was accomplished.

A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will furnish the highest level of evidence regarding the efficacy of a given intervention, but the immaturity of this area of research means that, currently, an RCT is not an appropriate research design. Therefore the purpose of the program of research presented in this thesis was to strategically contribute to the evidence base required to justify the conduct of a well designed RCT of an intervention promoting physical activity for people with ABI. By increasing participation in free-living, moderate intensity walking, people with ABI may reduce the oxygen cost of walking, thereby improving everyday functioning. The first study (presented in Chapter 3) evaluated a novel over-ground walking protocol in which a third party assists participants with ABI to reproduce previously self-selected comfortable and brisk walking speeds. Such a protocol could be used in conjunction with a portable indirect calorimetry to evaluate changes in oxygen cost of self-selected walking speeds over time. Thirteen people with ABI and related gait pattern impairment (age 31 + 8 yrs) completed two familiarization and two testing sessions. The first testing session used a self-paced (SP) protocol in which participants walked for 6 minutes at two self-selected speeds &#150; comfortable and brisk paces. The second, conducted one week later, used an externally-paced (EP) protocol in which participants were instructed to walk at the pace indicated by the test administrator, who verbally and visually guided the participant to walk at their previous self-selected comfortable and brisk paces. In each testing session participants wore a portable indirect calorimeter (Cosmed K4b2). Measures obtained were oxygen cost of walking (l.min-1) and distance walked (m). Analysis demonstrated that the EP protocol reproduced distances walked at comfortable and brisk speeds with a high degree of accuracy and that agreement between measures of oxygen cost obtained during the SP and EP protocols were acceptable. Steady-state oxygen uptake is characteristic of a constant workload and was elicited during both EP walking trials, indicating that walking speeds were constant throughout the walk trials. It was concluded that the EP protocol described is a valid means of assisting people with ABI to reproduce overground walking speeds and that the protocol would be useful for evaluating changes in the oxygen cost of those walking speeds that may occur over the course of an intervention. The purpose of the second study (presented in Chapter 4) was to evaluate the validity of a uniaxial accelerometer (MTI Actigraph) for measuring physical activity in people with acquired brain injury (ABI) using portable indirect calorimetry (Cosmed K4b2) as a criterion measure. Fourteen people with ABI and related gait pattern impairment (age 32 + 8 years), wore an MTI Actigraph that measured activity (counts.min-1) and a Cosmed K4b2 that measured oxygen consumption (ml.kg-1.min-1) during four activities &#150; quiet sitting (QS), comfortable paced (CP), brisk paced (BP) and fast paced (FP) walking. MET levels were predicted from Actigraph counts using a published equation and compared with Cosmed measures. Predicted METs for each of the 56 activity bouts (14 participants x four bouts) were classified (light, moderate, vigorous or very vigorous intensity) and compared with Cosmed-based classifications. Results indicated that Actigraph counts provide a valid index of activity across the intensities investigated in this study. For light to moderate activity, Actigraph-based estimates of METs are acceptable for group-level analysis and are a valid means of classifying activity intensity. The Actigraph significantly underestimated higher intensity activity although, in practice, this limitation will have minimal impact on activity measurement of most community-dwelling people with ABI as higher intensity activity is likely to be rare in this group. In the third study (presented in Chapter 5), 18 community-dwelling adults with acquired brain injury and a related gait pattern impairment (32.3 + 7.5 yrs) participated in an 8-week intervention promoting lifestyle physical activity. The aims were threefold: to evaluate the physical and psychosocial effects of the intervention; to assess whether the intervention increased the physical activity of participants; and to qualitatively evaluate the perceived effectiveness and acceptability of the intervention. Data were collected at six time points over 28 weeks: three pre-intervention, one each at 12 weeks prior (T1), 11 weeks prior (T2) and immediately pre-intervention (T3); and three post-intervention at immediately after (T4), four weeks after (T5) and eight weeks after (T6) the intervention. Physical outcomes measured were oxygen cost of comfortable and brisk-paced walking and maximum distance walked in three minutes. Psychosocial outcomes measured were SF-36, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and the Barriers to Health Activities for Disabled Persons (BHADP). Physical activity was sampled 6 days at T3, T4 and T6 and two measures were obtained &#150; Actigraph counts per day and total minutes of activity greater than or equal to moderate intensity. Semi-structured interviews were used to evaluate the perceived effectiveness and acceptability of the intervention. The intervention comprised weekly, home-based, interactive problem-solving sessions designed to identify and overcome barriers to activity and to promote walking, together with facilitation of a community based leisure activity of the participant&#146;s choice. Results indicated that the intervention improved important aspects of physical and psychosocial health for community-dwelling people with ABI. Compared with mean baseline measures, improvements in oxygen cost of brisk walking and self-esteem occurred that were both clinically and statistically significant at T6 (p &lt; 0.01). Significant changes in two subscales of the SF-36 and the SWLS also occurred, although they were not sustained at T6. Measures of physical activity increased but not to an extent that was statistically significant. Qualitative data were principally positive, with 100% of participants and their significant others indicating they would recommend the program to another person with ABI. Given the particularly low levels of physical activity in the ABI population, and the correspondingly large individual and community benefits of that will be accrued if their physically active behavior can be increased, the promising results from this program of research indicate that there is a strong justification for allocating the resources necessary to conduct a sufficiently powered, randomized controlled trial of a lifestyle physical activity intervention for people with ABI.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321401 Exercise Physiology</field><field name="subject">750305 Ability and disability</field><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="subject">stroke</field><field name="subject">traumatic brain injury</field><field name="subject">walking</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158050</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">POVERTY REDUCTION MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT: A PLANNING STRATEGY TO PROMOTE MORE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN EAST JAVA &#150; INDONESIA MALANG AS A CASE STUDY</field><field name="creator">Surjono.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines contentions in academic literature that poverty is multidimensional. Development practices to fight poverty, therefore, must address all country-specific essential elements of sustainable development that are inextricably linked to poverty. There is adequate evidence that economic growth is important to reduce poverty, but growth alone is not enough. Development practices since the New Order in Indonesia (1969) have been overly dependent on central government decisions and external assistance. Local capacity building of the regions was weak and the cycle of poverty was unresolved. The decentralization in place since 2001 has not been able to change the centralistic mind-set at the local level, while economic liberalization and globalization have only benefited few market players but disadvantaged the majority of the poor. Approaches to poverty reduction were fragmented and not based on local capacities. This thesis develops an approach for sustainable poverty reduction based on two significant problems: the failure of Indonesia&#146;s planning framework to develop effective poverty reduction strategies at the local level and limited capacity of the regions to meet their responsibilities in accordance with the Law No. 32, 2004 on Regional Governance. A case study field work was carried out in Malang, Indonesia by the writer. Derived from the pressure-state-response (P-S-R) framework, I began by identifying the causes of poverty at national and regional levels, and then, conducting content analysis, by comparing and contrasting indicators of the causes of poverty with the indicators in the existing local planning framework. The second stage, using outputs of the first stage, measures the state of poverty (the capability of the poor) at the local level (Malang) with in-depth assessment on the poor community in Kutobedah, an area within Kotalama Village. The third stage examines capacity building at the local level as the catalyst of sustainable poverty reduction in the on-going process of decentralized Indonesia. The thesis found that the planning framework in Indonesia had provided adequate basic infrastructures to accommodate poverty reduction strategies from the national level to the local level. The ineffectiveness of poverty reduction was greatly caused by the 1997 economic crisis, the failure of the development paradigm, ineffective strategies and the monitoring process due to impracticable indicators and weak capacity development at the local level. This thesis recommends the causes-capability-capacity indicators (3CI) framework for poverty reduction at the local level in Indonesia with clear and tangible indicators for all stakeholders, concludes by proposing policy actions and calls for all development actors to strengthen the capacity building at the local level, particularly the local government.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158374</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scientists in Conflict: Hans Bethe, Edward Teller and the Shaping of United States Nuclear Weapons Policy, 1945-1972</field><field name="creator">Bird, Jacqueline Maree</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the adversarial roles of nuclear physicists Hans Bethe and Edward Teller as political advisors during the first three decades of the nuclear era and the part each played in the shaping of US nuclear weapons policy. It focuses on four episodes - post-war arms control, the development of the hydrogen bomb, the banning of nuclear weapons testing and the deployment and subsequent banning of a limited system of missile defence, and in each episode, it contrasts the scientists&#146; individual motives, political agendas, means of affecting policy and respective degrees of success. Thereafter, it assesses the pair as Cold War political advisors by considering the validity of their advice as regards the Soviet nuclear program. Whereas a number of scholarly works have been devoted to the political career of Teller, these have typically focused on his role in the hydrogen bomb controversy. In contrast, very little has been written about Bethe&#146;s political role, despite its obvious significance. Interestingly, no work to date has focused specifically on the openly confrontational roles of these two scientific advisors, who remained at the forefront of the decision-making process over nuclear weapons policy for many years. This thesis meets this objective by providing an historical voice to Bethe, a largely overlooked historical figure, while offering fresh insight into Teller, a contentious Cold War character. In doing so, it utilizes a range of recently declassified sources to shed further light on previously documented episodes, such as the hydrogen bomb affair, while chronicling largely untold episodes, including the pair&#146;s involvement in the debate over missile defence. At the same time, it challenges a commonly-held conception that Teller, by utilizing his connections to influential Washington conservatives, was able largely to dictate the course of nuclear policy throughout this period. Indeed, a central contention of this study is that Bethe, by effectively employing both his personal and professional reputation, was able to moderate the influence of his well-placed colleague. Finally, through the use of recently published sources on the Soviet nuclear progam, this study assesses the validity of the political advice of the two scientists, concluding that both men were hindered to a certain extent by the rigidity of their respective positions. Specifically, it argues that Bethe&#146;s advice was characterized by an unduly benign view of Soviet intentions, and Teller&#146;s by an exaggeration of Soviet capabilities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430104 History - North American</field><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158344</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Status, Ideology and the Duty of Care in the Roman World</field><field name="creator">Manley, Jennifer Megan</field><field name="description">For a long period of its history, the Roman state did not provide its people with a social support system. Public doctors existed, and were at times exempted from taxation, but the medical &#145;profession&#146; was by no means the main avenue of care for the ill. Instead, the community in which the individual lived would, ideally, rally around him or her in times of need. Kin, friends, patrons and clients formed a social network that largely carried the burden of care &#150; providing nursing, bedside attendance, advice, and consolation. Even when doctors were employed, their behaviour was influenced by social mores and expectations. Duty and obligation provided guidelines for their conduct, just as they did for the conduct of other members of society. Roman social interactions were based upon the idea of mutual exchange and reciprocity. This reinforced the social network and provided an impetus towards the provision of care. Illness provided a great opportunity for repaying the &#147;benefits&#148; bestowed between friends and kin, patrons and clients. This thesis will examine the role of carers in the Roman world, and how ideology and status impacted upon them. Three major arguments will be advanced. The provision of care was influenced by status concerns within the familia and broader community &#150; for example, slave status justified a low standard of care for many. Roman social ideology resulted in a &#145;duty of care&#146; within amicitia and the construct of patronage, based on ideas of reciprocal exchange. Both status and ideology interacted to determine the ways in which individuals at different levels of the &#145;status pyramid&#146; received and proffered care. The source material is varied, and each type carries with it its own bias. Careful use of this material will yield sound conclusions, even though much of the evidence concerns only the elite. Literary topoi can be revealing, however, because they demonstrate the expectations and high ideals of the social world inhabited by the authors. This thesis will examine both literary and epigraphic evidence to illustrate how care for the ill was proffered and procured in the Roman world of the late republic to the early imperial period, with a terminal date of A.D. 235.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158375</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biologically-based insecticides for mosquito control and environmental conservation in south-east Queensland</field><field name="creator">Russell, Tanya Louise</field><field name="description">Mosquitoes transmit a range of pathogens, such as malaria protozoans, dengue, Ross River and Barmah Forest viruses. Human infection with any of these pathogens may lead to the onset of debilitating disease, and due to limited vaccine availability, mosquito control is essential to interrupt the transmission of disease. During control operations, the larvae are targeted and there are two classes of biologically-based insecticides available: microbials (Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis de Barjac [Bti] and Bacillus sphaericus Neide [Bs]) and insect growth regulators (s-methoprene and pyriproxyfen). The aims of this thesis were to: 1) undertake specific research to enhance mosquito control operations; and 2) evaluate the ecological impacts of insecticide use in saltmarsh habitats. Initially, the efficacy of new formulations of biologically-based insecticides were investigated in the laboratory. Bioassays were conducted using third-instars of six common Australian mosquito species, Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus), Aedes vigilax (Skuse), Aedes notoscriptus (Skuse), Culex sitiens Wiedemann, Culex annulirostris Skuse and Culex quinquefasciatus Say. The normal model for log-linear mortality was used to determine LC50 and LC95 values. The newly developed VectoBac WG (3,000 Bti International Toxic Units [ITU]/mg) was highly effective against the range of larvae, contrasting with the unregistered insect growth regulator, pyriproxyfen, which was not effective against some species. Sequentially, the efficacy of Bti formulations was assessed in the field. Larvae were exposed to Bti as free-swimming larvae and in mesh cages, and mortality was calculated after 48 h to examine appropriate sampling techniques. The accuracy of sampling free-swimming larvae with 250-ml &#145;dips&#146; was highly variable, where monitoring mortality of caged larvae was highly accurate; this information was used to design the sequential field trials. In freshwater pools, replicated cohorts of caged Cx. annulirostris were exposed to the water dispersible (VectoBac WG) and liquid (VectoBac 12AS: 1,200 Bti ITU/mg) formulations. Treatment concentrations of 0.008 ppm VectoBac WG and 0.04 ppm VectoBac 12AS and above produced significant larval control (&amp;gt96% mortality) at 48 h, with no residual control after 1 week. In saltmarsh pools, cohorts of caged Ae. vigilax were exposed to the granular (VectoBac G: 200 Bti ITU/mg) formulation; which was effective (&amp;gt99% mortality) at application rates of 4 kg/ha and above at 48 h. Next, the distribution of the granular (VectoBac G) formulation was assessed after an aerial treatment using catch-trays. The accuracy of the catch-trays was defined using mathematical models. Specifically, the analysis revealed that the size of catch-trays can affect the interpretation of results, especially if smaller than 2 m&amp;sup2. The mass of product captured in 1 m&amp;sup2 catch-trays, due to random sampling processes alone, would be expected to range between the equivalent of 2.9 to 7.8 kg/ha for 95% of replicates when targeting 5 kg/ha. During the field trial, 1 m&amp;sup2 catch-trays were used, this catch-tray size was selected as it was the nominated size used by contractors for quality assurance of aerial granular applications. The average flight lane separation of the rotary-wing aircraft was 14.70 m (SD: &#177; 4.52 m) and the average treatment rate was 5.76 kg/ha (SD: &#177; 3.46 kg/ha; CV = 60%). This was close to the targeted lane separation of 14 m and treatment rate of 5 kg/ha. However, the product was not distributed evenly. Nonetheless, there was 100% mortality of third-instar Ae. vigilax that were exposed to the treatment in mesh cages. The most important factors that affected the observed spatial distribution of product were the uneven flight path of the helicopter and the low sensitivity of the small catch-trays. Despite the fact that Bti and s-methoprene are considered to be among the most target specific of insecticides, there are indications that non-target organisms may be impacted in different ecosystems. In response, changes in the density and diversity of non-target communities, after application of either Bti or s-methoprene, were examined. The main taxa collected from ephemeral pools were Copepoda; and from terrestrial plots were Collembola, Coleoptera, Heteroptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera. Applications of both products altered the community composition; however, differences were not consistent over the two localities. After applications of Bti to ephemeral pools, lower numbers of Copepoda were recorded at only one location. No differences were recorded after treatments of s-methoprene to ephemeral pools. After applications of s-methoprene to terrestrial plots, higher numbers of Acariformes were recorded at both localities, and this was also recorded after application of Bti to one of the locations. However, these differences were not spatially and temporally consistent or in agreement with predictions. The results of these trials suggest that applications of Bti and smethoprene will not impact on the long-term structure and composition of arthropod assemblages in saltmarshes. Authors of previous studies from the northern hemisphere had indicated that s-methoprene was more broadly toxic to non-target organisms than Bti; however, this is not true in Australia. The results of this thesis found that Bti can be used to effectively control mosquito immatures under different field conditions. Applications of Bti and s-methoprene did not decrease the diversity or abundance of non-target arthropods in south-east Queensland. As such, future applications of Bti and s-methoprene are supported in preference to organophosphate alternatives; this is based on a comparison with previously published literature that has demonstrated organophosphate insecticides to be directly toxic to non-target arthropods. Considering that the appropriate use of Bti and s-methoprene can reduce the incidence of arbovirus transmission among the local human population, the future application of these products is supported. The use of insecticides should be integrated with public education, biological control, physical habitat modification and early detection systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158269</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wideband Beamforming Employing Fully Spatial Signal Processing</field><field name="creator">Uthansakul, Monthippa</field><field name="description">In the past, wireless communication systems were deployed using antennas with fixed radiation pattern which were meeting desired coverage characteristics. Such systems could not adapt to varying traffic environments. Smart antennas are a new technology that uses array antennas with adaptable radiation patterns. This varying radiation pattern can be accomplished with the use of RF hardware or digital signal processing. The smart antenna concept has mostly been demonstrated for the case of narrowband wireless systems. As the future demands high speed data transmission, a logical step is to consider a smart antenna operating over a wide frequency band. Such an antenna system is alternatively named a wideband beamformer. In this thesis, theoretical and experimental investigations into a wideband beamformer are carried out. The considerations commence with a conventional smart antenna employing a narrowband weighting scheme. The results reveal that this weighting scheme is unsuitable for a wideband array antenna, as the resulting radiation pattern varies with frequency. Next, various remedies are considered to overcome this shortcoming. From a literature review, one can gather that a wideband beamformer can be realized through space-time, space-frequency or fully spatial signal processing. The first two approaches are not considered here because they require a large number of tapped-delay lines or frequency filters. As a result of these considerations, a wideband beamformer using only spatial signal processing, also named a wideband spatial beamformer, is studied in this thesis. The focus is on the wideband spatial beamformer employing a rectangular array with real-valued weights. The advantage of this beamformer is that the weights can be realized by attenuators or amplifiers. As a result, the use of tapped-delay lines and frequency filters is avoided. The thesis points out some shortfalls of the original spatial beamformer, which was reported in the literature, and proposes suitable solutions. It is shown that the original algorithm fails for small size arrays. The thesis proposes a remedy to this problem. The shortfall is overcome through oversampling of the assumed radiation pattern. Having done modifications of the original beamforming algorithm the thesis looks at the issues of beamforming, null steering, and determining the direction of arrival of a wideband signal. The presented solutions form novel contributions of the thesis. In theoretical investigations, the beamforming performances are investigated through own computer programs developed in MATLAB&#174;. The developed algorithms neglect mutual coupling effect in antenna arrays. Next, the full EM analysis (FEKO&#174;) based on the Method of Moments is applied to study the performance of the beamformer when the mutual coupling between the array elements is taken into account. As the original, as well as the newly proposed beamforming algorithm, neglect mutual coupling effects in the antenna array, the radiation patterns show increased side lobes, when mutual coupling is included in full EM simulations. The thesis proposes a suitable solution to this problem. The adverse effect of mutual coupling is reduced by initially assuming the radiation pattern with low side lobes. As a result of this action, when the mutual coupling is present, the computed side lobes are increased to the level which can be tolerated. The next stage concerns the development of a full prototype of 4&#215;4-element beamformer. In the original work concerning the use of microstrip antennas to form a wideband spatial beamformer was postulated. The candidate points out that such an array would be difficult to accomplish in practice. The reason is that microstrip patch antennas usually operate over a narrow band and they radiate in broadside direction which is perpendicular to the array&#146;s plane. The investigated wideband spatial beamformer requires antenna elements to radiate in the endfire direction (that is parallel to the array plane). Because of this requirement the thesis postulates the use of planar monopole antennas. These antenna elements produce their main beam in the direction parallel to the array&#146;s plane. In contrast to microstrip patches these antenna elements exhibit wideband impedance and radiation pattern operation. Also they are compact in size so they can meet tight spacing, as is required in the investigated beamformer. In addition to the appropriate choice of antenna elements, the thesis also provides a suitable solution to the feeding network of the planned prototype. The feeding network is constituted by attenuators, power splitters and a rat2race hybrid. The constructed prototype is tested in an anechoic chamber with respect to its beamforming capability over a wide frequency band. The obtained experimental results show a good agreement with the simulation results, as accomplished the full EM analysis and simulation software FEKO&#174;. In addition to (i) the development of a beamforming algorithm which works for an arbitrary size of the investigated spatial beamformer (ii) the reduction of the radiation pattern degradation caused by mutual coupling and (iii) the development of a fully operational prototype, the novel contributions of this thesis include (iv) the development of a null steering, and (v) direction of arrival algorithms for wideband signals.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158376</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Processes and Tools to Support Adaptive Management in Complex Rangelands Systems</field><field name="creator">Bashari, Hossein</field><field name="description">This thesis begins by identifying appropriate indicators (compositional and functional) of grazing impact for the subtropical grasslands in south-east Queensland that will help landholders to better evaluate rangeland condition. Species composition, Landscape Function Analysis (LFA), and visual condition assessments were used to assess grazing impact at 70 sites in the Ironbark-Spotted Gum Woodland of Gatton. Multivariate analyses, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), were used to identify species&#146; responses on the grazing gradient. Regression techniques were used to explore the correlation between LFA functional indices (stability, infiltration and nutrient cycling) and grazing gradient. The frequencies of six tall tussock, short tussock and lawn species, and the LFA stability index were found to be effective indicators of grazing impact in the study area. The slow response of soil function indices to grazing pressure indicates that the Ironbark-Spotted Gum Woodland examined in this study is a fairly &#147;robust&#148; and stable system with a high resilience to grazing. Although the species composition of the grassland changes under the stress of selective or heavy grazing, trampling and nutrient enrichment, there is no appreciable loss of landscape functions such as nutrient cycling and infiltration. Hence, there was no evidence of major deterioration and degradation. Methods of modelling rangeland dynamics were reviewed to determine their strengths and weaknesses with respect to assessing the effects of management on vegetation change. State and Transition Models (STMs) were found to provide a versatile way of describing vegetation dynamics. An iterative model development process was used to construct an STM for the Ironbark-Spotted Gum Woodland of the study area. This process utilised multiple information sources to identify possible vegetation states and transitions, including experiential knowledge of scientists and land managers familiar with the study area, and results from multivariate analysis to characterise vegetation states in terms of species composition and soil condition. The proposed STM is a three dimensional model showing five vegetation states and seventeen transitions, mapped according to grazing intensity, grassland palatability and soil nutrient content. Despite the advantage of STMs, they are traditionally descriptive diagrams and are unable to be used for predictive modelling and scenario analysis. They also handle uncertainty associated with causes of vegetation change poorly. A Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) was used to assist in the development of a dynamic and predictive STM by providing a graphical modelling framework for building a probability-based cause and effect model. The results indicated that the BBN approach is a highly useful mechanism for adding value to descriptive STMs. First, it allowed the uncertainty in transitions to be expressed by using probabilistic relationships. Second, the approach provided a scenario and sensitivity analysis tool for both scientists and landholders to assess the probable vegetation outcomes of rangeland management decisions, and to identify those management options most likely to improve or degrade vegetation condition. Third, it is particularly complementary to the adaptive management process, because monitoring records can be used to update probability relationships within the BBN model over time. Therefore, the modelling approach supported the planning, monitoring and review steps of the adaptive management cycle. This is an advantage over current rangeland management simulation models that are good at supporting management planning through their predictive capabilities, but poor at supporting monitoring and evaluation steps. Sensitivity analysis using the BBN model constructed for the Ironbark -Spotted Gum Woodland STM highlighted that grazing pressure is the main factor driving almost all transitions. The stocking rate has a great influence on grazing pressure, but drought and the use of dry season supplements magnifies the influence of stocking rate on grazing pressure. Selective grazing is an important factor determining the transitions from or to unpalatable tall tussock grasses. The model also indicates that drought and the occurrence of good seasons, which were the two factors beyond the control of land managers, have a clear effect on the vegetation state via their direct impact on the recovery of tall tussock grasses and their indirect impact on the frequency of fire. Soil nutrient content is an important variable that influences transitions to and from lawns. The thesis concludes by applying the concepts and approaches used in this study to a rangeland area in Iran, in order to explore their applicability in developing a decision support tool (DST) for another area and under different conditions. Particular focus was on identifying potential stumbling blocks to the development and use of the rangeland management DST in another area. The results suggest that the method is transferable to other situations and ecosystems. In Iran, however, the lack of a long-term rangeland monitoring program, which can provide the data needed to update the Bayesian Network Model over time and support adaptive management, was identified as a key stumbling block towards successful implementation of the DST.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158581</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chinese EFL Learners' Pragmatic Competence in Requests</field><field name="creator">Wang, Xian</field><field name="description">This study examines the development of pragmatic competence in requests in two groups of Chinese EFL learners (advanced and intermediate) in a tertiary institute in Macau, China. The learners answer a written discourse completion test that contains ten scenarios where they request common services or ask for favours. The request behaviours are examined in terms of utterance length, strategy types, formulaic expressions, and modifications (internal and external). It is found that, compared with a group of native speakers of English, the learners have not developed native-like pragmatic behaviours. Although the advanced and the intermediate learner groups reach native-like distribution in STRATEGY TYPE for the scenarios taken together, statistically significant differences from the native group are observed in several individual scenarios (particularly with the intermediate learners). In addition, the two groups of learners employ formulaic expressions sharply differently from the native group in types and according to scenario. The learners do not use internal modifiers as frequently or situation-differentially as the native group: they do not show a strong preference for bi-clausal structures and conditionals in the scenarios of substantial favour asking. The learners employ elaborated external modifications and are verbose in requests. According to Bialystok&#146;s (1993, 1994) two-dimensional model of pragmatic competence, the learners are missing analytical knowledge of the scenario-specific behaviours, and their control ability is not fully developed. This study examines adult Chinese learners of English in a foreign language environment, and extends our knowledge of the development of request behaviours in children in second language environments (Achiba, 2003; Ellis, 1992). It also relates to the research on formulae in SLA (Wray, 2000, 2002; Kecskes, 2002) by providing empirical data on formulaic expressions in learners&#146; requests. It is further argued that further examination of interlanguage pragmatics should be (a) scenario-based, and (b) formulae-based.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">751000 Communication</field><field name="subject">380201 Applied Linguistics and Educational Linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158270</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FROM HOPE&#133;TO HOPE: STORY OF THE AUSTRALIAN LEAGUE OF NATIONS UNION, FEATURING THE VICTORIAN BRANCH, 1921 &#150; 1945</field><field name="creator">Summy, Hilary</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the League of Nations Union movement in Australia from 1921 to 1945, with particular emphasis on the Victorian branch. The League of Nations Union (LNU) was first formed in Britain by liberal peace advocates in 1918 to promote the creation of a world organisation for the securing and maintenance of world peace. After the formation of the League of Nations at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, the LNU&#146;s goal was to mobilise support for the new world organisation and to pressure government leaders to uphold the principles embodied in the Covenant. The movement spread to the Dominions, as well as a number of other allied nations, and LNUs were established in each of the Australian capital cities. The LNU movement in Australia has been a neglected area of research. This thesis argues that the LNU played an important and unrecognised role in the peace movement throughout the interwar period and World War II. The LNU was unique in that its leadership comprised intellectuals who were a part of the establishment, unlike the traditional peace bodies that were grassroots based. As a &#145;respectable&#146; organisation, it had the backing of the Government at various times. While it remained an elite-led organisation, it gradually gained broader grassroots participation at the height of its influence, at the same time losing favour with a Government that no longer championed the League. Towards the end of its life, the LNU once again found favour with a new Labor Government that supported its liberal international perspective on world politics. The LNU, it is contended, contributed to the Labor Party&#146;s conception of a radically new post-war international order. Themes in the thesis are presented in a framework of an evolution of hope, agony and despair, with a return to hope, to convey the mood swings that League of Nations supporters experienced over this turbulent quarter century. The 1920s were generally a time of optimism and hope that future war would become obsolete, or at least more difficult to wage, due to the League and other initiatives. Hope began to fade during the 1930s as the League suffered some major setbacks and conditions threatening world peace became increasingly apparent. A mood of anguish turned into one of despair by the end of the 1930s as governments around the world ignored a League that was deemed to have failed. Ultimately there seemed no alternative but a war to defeat forces more evil than war itself. During the war years, the Victorian LNU gradually returned to a mood of hope as a committed core group planned for post-war reconstruction and a new, more improved world organisation. In 1945 the LNU changed its name to the United Nations Association of Australia (UNAA) to coincide with the new world body.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158377</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical discourse analysis on the translation practice of the Singapore's 2004 educational reforms</field><field name="creator">Chua, Siew-Kheng</field><field name="description">In Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong&#146;s 2004 National Day Rally speech, he stressed the need for Singapore to undergo a reformation process in order to secure a promising economic future for the country. For him, Singapore&#146;s education policies provide the opportunity to develop this future by adopting a fresh approach to teaching and learning in 2004 and beyond. The context of these educational reforms is represented by a commitment to build on the past governmental policies, such as the Thinking School, Learning Nation reform in 1997, and Information technology (IT) Masterplan in 1997 to strengthen the life sciences, the research and development (R&amp;D) and biomedical research skill development in schools. The Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) responded to these policy initiatives by introducing more diversity and flexibility in the education system. Its primary goal was to develop a &#147;broad-based education system&#148; in schools, highlighted by the concept of Teach Less, Learn More, to enhance and cultivate a spirit of innovation and enterprise among the students. In line with this political and policy shift, the Singaporean schools have been actively incorporating these reforms in their classrooms. This study traces the translation process of the 2004 educational reforms; and explores the intended and possible hidden effects of them on teachers and students at three levels. First, it looks at the promulgation of reforms made at the political level through an analysis of the discourse found in the government dominated media, that is, how The Straits Times framed and supported the reforms. Second, it analyses the translation of the political discourse through an analysis of theMOE policy document and science syllabus curriculum to explore how the MOE has incorporated the concepts underlying these new reforms into the education system. Finally, it examines a school&#146;s science schemes of work to investigate the extent to which the policy reforms have been translated for implementation at the classroom level. Insights on how this translation practice works draw on postcolonial theory, policy theory, curriculum theory and critical discourse analysis. Despite the intent of the 2004 educational reforms to give education a broader focus, this study found that the current Singaporean educational system continues to be very oriented towards academic performance. The study showed that students who have excelled in their studies tend to benefit more from the new policy changes because schools play a crucial role in producing and affirming the IT, life sciences and biomedical research knowledge targeted by the reforms. As students from the elite schools are usually given more opportunities to learn this type of high status knowledge, inevitably they tend to benefit more from these educational changes. In view of this, the concept of diversity and flexibility appeared to apply more to academically-abled students, further sustaining the elitism found in Singapore. This study also concluded that despite the government&#146;s support for putting in place an education system that promotes the concept of Teach Less, Learn More, this concept has not been effectively translated to the school level. In the case study school, the reform was implemented through the concept of Learn More, Teach More.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158271</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheology of solidifying alloys containing 0-50% solid and the formation of dilatant shear bands</field><field name="creator">Gourlay, Christopher Malcolm</field><field name="description">The growing understanding of partially solid alloy rheology has already improved the prediction of casting defects including hot tears, and allowed engineers to create higher integrity castings through semisolid processing (SSP) techniques. These two examples have evolved from a dedicated research focus on two specific areas: the rheology of globular metallic suspensions, and the deformation of alloys with high solid fraction to relatively small strains. However, rheology across the whole spectrum of solid fractions, solid morphologies and deformation conditions is not well understood and the role of rheology in a range of industrial casting processes remains under-explored. One group of casting processes where rheology is expected to play a significant role includes squeeze casting and high pressure die casting (HPDC) where elevated pressures are applied to fill narrow die cavities and to increase productivity. Even when these processes start with liquid alloy, solidification during filling and pressurisation results in large stresses and pressures acting on partially solid microstructures. This thesis investigates how rheology influences filling, feeding and microstructure formation in HPDC and, in so doing, more generally explores the rheology of solidifying alloys containing 0-50% solid with a range of solid morphologies. Previous research has related mush rheology to the narrow bands of positive macrosegregation and porosity that commonly follow the surface contour of HPDC components. This thesis therefore uses defect bands as a feature with which to study the rheology relevant to HPDC. The approach has been to design reductive experiments which contain aspects of HPDC but which can be controlled and monitored sufficiently to study rheological mechanisms and phenomena. Throughout the research, AM and AZ series Mg-Al alloys and Al alloy A356 (Al-7Si-0.3Mg) have been used. In the first series of experiments, a gravity-flow-through technique was developed to simulate the concurrent flow and solidification that occurs during HPDC. Alloys containing 0-30% solid were poured through an open ended, relatively cold steel die. The externally solidified crystals (ESCs) were found to migrate towards the centre of the cross-section during flow resulting in an ESC distribution similar to those in HPDC components. Additionally, bands of positive macrosegregation formed in A356 and bands of concentrated porosity formed in AM/AZ series Mg-alloys similar to those in HPDC. During gravity-flow-through experiments, it is proposed that defect bands form in the stagnant, partially solid layer emanating from the die wall due to solute-enriched liquid being drawn to a locally collapsing dendrite network. Localised collapse is suggested to be caused by the shear stress acting on the immobile solidifying mushy layer due to bulk flow through the die. The formation of a localised band of dendrite network collapse is next investigated using vane rheometry in which a four-bladed vane is rotated for one revolution during equiaxed solidification at solid fractions in the range 0 &lt;fs &amp;le; 0.5. It is found that, once the growing crystals have impinged, deformation becomes localised in a band at the vane path. Additionally, concentrated porosity forms in the localised band in Mg-Al alloys but not in Al-Si alloys, similar to defect bands in HPDC. The findings from gravity flow-through experiments and shear rheometry experiments are then drawn together to show that, shortly after crystal impingement, solidifying alloys behave as cohesionless compacted granular materials and exhibit Reynolds&#146; dilatancy. Similar to compacted granular materials, it is suggested that after crystal impingement, crystals must push each other apart and increase the space between themselves in order to rearrange, causing the material to expand in response to shear. It is shown that defect bands in all laboratory experiments and HPDC are dilatant shear bands similar to those that form in a wide range of compacted granular materials including dense sand and glass beads. Moreover, dilatant shear bands are found to form in microstructures with a range of solid morphologies from equiaxed dendritic to globular. It is concluded that, when defect bands form in casting processes, the material in that region consists of a geometrically crowded assembly of crystals where deformation occurs by dilatancy-enabled crystal rearrangement. After examination of HPDC microstructures, it is suggested that dilatant shear bands could form during die filling in the stagnant partially solid material at the die wall, and/or during the pressurisation stage when a large pressure differential exists between the plunger and the shrinking and contracting solidifying alloy.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158378</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic Culture and the Grand Strategy of the United States, 1997-2003.</field><field name="creator">Lock, Edward Geoffrey</field><field name="description">Since 2001, a broad consensus has formed amongst scholars regarding the occurrence of a major shift in US grand strategy during the early years of the twenty-first century. While disagreement exists regarding the likely consequences of this shift, most scholars accept that, during the early years of the twenty-first century, we have witnessed a marked shift in US grand strategy from multilateralism to unilateralism. This thesis challenges such arguments, and contends that US grand strategy did not radically change during the early years of the twenty-first century, despite the election of George W. Bush and the impact of 9/11. Instead, through highlighting the constraining and enabling role played by American strategic culture, this thesis argues that throughout the period from 1997-2003 administration officials persistently deployed rhetoric regarding US grand strategy that was characterised by the tension between unilateralism and multilateralism. The thesis proceeds in three parts. The first chapter of this thesis presents both a critique and a reconceptualisation of strategic culture theory. Chapter one defines strategic culture as an intersubjective system of symbols and norms that constrains and enables political practices relating to the construction of grand strategy. Strategic culture constitutes the political practices of security policy makers as meaningful and, in doing so, shapes the realm of the politically possible with regard to the construction of security policy. The constraining influence of strategic culture results in the emergence of patterns in the rhetorical practices of security policy makers. This account of strategic culture theory provides the theoretical foundation upon which the remainder of the thesis is built. The purpose of chapters two and three is to map American strategic culture. Chapter two compares three prominent narratives of US security policy history, and concludes that it is the unilateralist/multilateralist narrative that it is the most compelling of the three. Chapter three goes on to construct a &#145;map&#146; of US strategic culture that emphasises the central role played by the logics of unilateralism and multilateralism. In order to do so, this chapter identifies and distinguishes &#145;unilateralist&#146; and &#145;multilateralist&#146; norms relating to, firstly, the identity of the United States, secondly, the meaning of security, and thirdly, the relative utility of security policy instruments. Furthermore, this chapter locates these norms relative to one another and, in doing so, draws out the internal logic of unilateralism and multilateralism. Chapters four and five apply this &#145;map&#146; of US strategic culture to an examination of the grand strategies of the Clinton and Bush administrations. More specifically, these chapters conduct an analysis of the rhetoric and practices of these administrations. It is within the administrations&#146; rhetoric and practices that the tension between unilateralism and multilateralism is evident. In each of these two chapters this tension is elucidated through the analysis of the rhetorical practices of administration officials as they relate to US identity, the meaning of security and the utility of military force. The analysis of US grand strategy carried out in this thesis highlights the persistent tension within the grand strategies of Clinton and Bush between the logics of unilateralism and multilateralism. In doing so, this thesis challenges the theoretical underpinnings and the empirical findings of much of the existing literature on US grand strategy. Through focusing on the role of strategic culture in the enabling and constraining of political action with respect to security policy, this thesis challenges accounts of grand strategy that highlight the causal power of either the constraints imposed by the external security environment or the role of specific policy makers in the shaping of US security policy. Instead, this thesis demonstrates that strategic culture influences both representations regarding the external security environment and the realm of political possibility in which policy makers must act. Empirically, this thesis challenges the argument that US grand strategy has shifted radically in the early years of the twenty-first century, and suggests instead that we are likely to continue to witness an American grand strategy that is shaped by the tension between unilateralism and multilateralism within US strategic culture.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158582</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrifying bacteria characterisation to identify and implement factors leading to nitrogen removal via nitrite in activated sludge processes</field><field name="creator">Blackburne, Richard John</field><field name="description">Nitrogen removal in biological wastewater treatment plants by nitrification and denitrification can be short-cut via nitrite instead of the traditional nitrate and has the potential for up to a 25% reduction in aeration and 40% reduction in COD requirements. While the potential monetary savings for nitrogen removal via nitrite are significant, the difficulty lies in achieving specific inhibition or removal of the nitrite oxidising bacteria (NOB; those that oxidise nitrite to nitrate) whilst retaining ammonia oxidising bacteria (AOB; those that oxidise ammonia to nitrite). In approaching this general problem, characterisation of NOBs (both Nitrobacter and Nitrospira) were used to determine, in conjunction with AOB data, reactor operating factors which may lead to NOB removal. From literature, the AOBs have been hypothesised to have a higher oxygen affinity (lower oxygen half saturation constant, K[subscript]o) than NOBs. The K[subscript]o values of both Nitrospira and Nitrobacter enrichments (NOBs) and a Nitrosomonas enrichment (AOB) were determined with floc size distributions that indicated oxygen mass transfer was negligible as 0.54 &#177; 0.14 mg.L&#175;&#185;, 0.43 &#177; 0.08 mg.L&#175;&#185; and 0.033 &#177; 0.003mg.L&#175;&#185;, respectively. The relative AOB and NOB K[subscript]o values confirm the hypothesised difference in oxygen affinity. The growth rate values of the same Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter enrichments were determined using a novel nitrifier growth rate method (developed in this thesis) as 0.47 &#177; 0.09 day&#175;&#185; and 0.60 &#177; 0.03 day&#175;&#185;, respectively. Therefore, whilst the NOB maximum growth rate was determined as greater than that of the AOB maximum growth rate at saturated dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, at low DO concentration the maximum growth rate of AOBs was determined as greater than the maximum growth rate of the NOBs. Hence, washout of NOBs was achieved by operating a continuous reactor at a DO concentration (0.4 mg.L&#175;&#185;) and a sludge retention time of 2.4 days which allowed for AOB retention but not NOBs. The results from the continuous reactor experiments suggested that the growth rate of NOBs may not be exclusively greater than the AOB growth rate, contrary to previous thought. Therefore, if aeration is terminated at the end of ammonium oxidation in a batch process (such as a sequencing batch reactor; SBR) with accumulated nitrite remaining, then the relative population of AOBs would eventually dominate. Indeed this concept was investigated using an SBR treating domestic wastewater (TKN concentration of about 43 mgN.L&#175;&#185;) with a pre-denitrification configuration and only the termination of aeration at the end of ammonium oxidation (aerobic duration control) as the selection factor for AOBs. The process proved effective in achieving a steady state whereby 80% nitrification to nitrite (20% to nitrate) was observed. Investigation of the cause of nitrification to nitrite by a calibrated ammonium and nitrite oxidation model showed the aerobic duration control as the key selection factor for AOBs. The results of numerous simulations with the same computer model also verified the importance of a greater AOB growth rate than a NOB growth rate in achieving sustained nitrite as the product of nitrification. The processes developed in this thesis to remove NOBs, i.e. low DO concentration and aerobic duration control could theoretically be implemented in current operational wastewater treatment plants. The low DO concentration selection factor against NOBs would probably be more effective in combination with other selection factors against NOBs (e.g. high temperature) as this would enhance the effectiveness of such processes. However, the aerobic duration control could theoretically be implemented immediately in similar SBR processes treating similar domestic wastewater.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">279900 Other Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">779999 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158272</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Apoptosis and Matrix Membrane Metalloproteinases in Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm</field><field name="creator">Jalali, Leyla</field><field name="description">Background: Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) associated with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) shows elastic fibre fragmentation, up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) apoptosis with an absence of inflammatory cells. Recently, apoptosis has come to be considered as an important factor in VSMC loss during aneurysm formation. However, it is uncertain whether apoptosis happens secondary to aneurysmal formation or whether fundamental abnormalities in VSMCs lead to apoptosis as a primary cause in aneurysm formation. Therefore the exact stimuli for VSMCs apoptosis are not clear. Given the role of MMPs in matrix remodelling during morphogenesis and tissue repair, their involvement in aortic aneurysm has been frequently suggested. Abnormality of the extracellular matrix influences elasticity of the aortic wall and may lead to disorganisation and weakening of the aortic wall, producing aortic dilation followed by aneurysm formation. Amongst all MMPs, matrix membrane metalloproteinase type 1 (MT1-MMP), an active cell membrane collagenase involved in cell migration and tissue remodelling, has commonly been documented to be associated with apoptosis. Another member of this family, MMP-2 (gelatinase A) activation is critically dependent on its processing by MT1-MMP. In addition MMP-2 has commonly been associated with apoptosis and aneurysm formation. This thesis has examined the association of VSMC apoptosis, MT1-MMP expression and MMP-2 activity in TAA. Methods and results: Studies were carried out on tissue specimens and cultured cells derived from aortic tissue obtained from subjects undergoing surgery for TAA: MFS (3M, 2F; mean age: 59 years) and BAV (5M; mean age: 64 years). Normal aortic tissue was obtained from organ donors (4F, 1 unknown, mean age: 43 years). The concentration of apoptotic cells in tissue and in cell culture was determined using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated nick end labelling (TUNEL) method to identify apoptotic cells. The concentration of MT1-MMP expressing cells in tissue and in cell culture was determined using immunochemistry. Gelatine zymography was performed to detect MMP-2 activity. Apoptotic cells (% of VSMC showing positive TUNEL marker/ high power field, mag 200) and MT1-MMP expression (% of cells showing positive MT1- MMP marker/ high power field, mag 200) in aneurysm tissue and cultured VSMC (mag 400) were compared with controls. Withdrawal of serum from cell culture media was used to induce apoptosis and a caspase inhibitor (ApoBlock) was used to block apoptosis. Cultured VSMCs were plated at a density of 10,000 /ml in standard culture medium with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS), serum free media (absence of FCS) or serum free media + caspase inhibitor (ApoBlock) for 24 hours. The degree of apoptosis and number of MT1-MMP expressing cells were significantly increased in aneurysm specimens (P&lt; 0.05) in both tissue and in cultured cells. Apoptosis level was 10x higher in MFS (21% &#177; 10%) and 6x higher in BAV (13% &#177; 7%) tissue specimens compared to normal controls (2% &#177; 1%, P&lt; 0.05). Number of MT1-MMP expressing cells was increased in both MFS (31% &#177; 8%) and BAV (36 % &#177; 12%) in comparison with controls (1% &#177; 1 %, P&lt; 0.05). In aneurysm derived cells cultured in standard media apoptosis levels and number of MT1-MMP expressing cells were also increased in MFS and in BAV compared to normal cells (P&lt; 0.05). For cells cultured in serum free media (absence of FCS) apoptosis levels and number of MT1-MMP expressing cells were even more increased compared to control cells. The number of MT1-MMP expressing positive cells was significantly reduced in MFS (65% &#177; 7%) and BAV (47% &#177; 18%) VSMCs cultured in serum free media in the presence of caspase inhibitor compared to MFS (88% &#177; 8%, P&lt; 0.05) and BAV (77% &#177; 17%, P&lt; 0.05) cells cultured in serum free media only. The percentage of MT1-MMP positive cells identified in combined serum free media and caspase inhibitor however was greater than the percentage of MT1-MMP positive cells in normal culture media, indicating MT1-MMP was likely to be only partly inhibited. Both pro and active forms of MMP-2 detected in culture media extracted from BAV and MFS cells cultured in the presence and absence of caspase inhibitor were significantly higher compared to controls. However, there was no significantly difference in pro and active MMP-2 activity in cultured VSMCs in the presence of caspase inhibitor compared to cultured VSMCs in the absence of caspase inhibitor. Conclusion: There was significantly increased concentration of cells undergoing apoptosis and expressing MT1-MMP marker in aortic aneurysm tissue and in cultured cells compared to normal tissue or normal cells respectively. Under conditions of stress induced by serum free media VSMCs derived from aneurysm were significantly more vulnerable to apoptosis and showed a greater concentration of cells expressing MT1-MMP marker compared to cells grown in standard media. The concentration of MT1-MMP positive cells was significantly reduced in the presence of caspase inhibitor (ApoBlock) but did not reach the percentage level of MT1-MMP positive cells in standard culture conditions. MMP-2 activity was significantly higher in cultured media derived from aneurysm cells both in the presence and absence of caspase inhibitor. However, MMP-2 was not significantly reduced after blocking apoptosis pathway, indicating lack of a direct association between apoptosis pathway and activated MMP-2. MT1-MMP positive cell expression was significantly reduced by inhibiting apoptosis pathway, suggesting MT1-MMP is a contributing factor to VSMC apoptosis in aneurysms associated with MFS and BAV, although other contributing factors can not been excluded.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158583</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changes in Bacterial Communities, Carbon and Nitrogen Dynamics on Coral Surfaces Following Mortality: Potential Implications for Reef Systems</field><field name="creator">Davey, Andrew Mark</field><field name="description">Prokaryotic energy and nutrient cycling is critical to coral reef ecosystems. Living coral surfaces can harbour diverse but markedly different bacterial communities than other marine surfaces and, these communities may alter considerably following a disturbance. The consequences of these changes may include; alteration of fluxes and routes of organic and inorganic matter cycling, accelerated eutrophication and proliferation of algal blooms, all of which may ultimately lead to changes in trophic interactions. Coral reefs worldwide are experiencing a decline in health of a magnitude not seen in recorded history. In view of current trends and events over the last 30 years, it appears inevitable that we will lose a large percentage of living coral in the coming decades. It is therefore necessary to gain a greater understanding of the consequences associated with a substantial increase in the area of dead coral substratum. In particular the changes in the bacterial associates of coral surfaces following mortality may lead to dramatic changes in carbon and nutrient cycling, which may have implications throughout the ecosystem. This study investigated the primary colonization and early succession of bacteria on dead coral surfaces following mortality. This included an examination of the associated changes in production, carbon and nitrogen dynamics of the developing biofilms, and the consequent contributions to reef carbon and nutrient budgets. Inferences were made to the ecosystem changes that may be associated with a decrease in living coral and concomitant increase in bacterial mediated carbon and nutrient processes. Coral mortality via thermal stress resulted in the development of markedly different bacterial communities to those of live corals. Analysis of bacterial primary recruitment and early succession using Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) allowed direct visualization of bacteria and their spatial heterogeneity within and across samples. Members of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteriodes (CFB) and the gamma Proteobacteria dominated samples from dead corals, while members of the alpha Proteobacteria were apparent over time after coral mortality. Profiling of bacterial populations using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and Terminal- Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) showed significant differences in surface bacterial populations between live and dead coral and that the bacteria on dead corals were dynamic over time post-mortem. In addition, T-RFLP allowed the identification of bacterial species that have previously been linked to nitrogen processes. The results of molecular analysis suggest that significant changes in surface biogeochemistry may occur concurrently with the changes in coral-surface bacteria following coral mortality. Surface associated oxygen metabolism was investigated using a combination of oxygen microelectrode profiles and Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) Fluorometry. Results demonstrated a significant increase in oxygenic photosynthesis from dead coral biofilms. The associated P/R ratios implied a net increase in autotrophic carbon fixation, which was also demonstrated by increases in photosynthetic pigments and algal biomass. The developing biofilms also had greater photosynthetic efficiency, particularly at lower light levels, suggesting a greater capacity for carbon fixation. Changes in nitrogen processes were investigated by nitrogen fixation assays as well as fluxes of NH3/NH4[superscript]+ and NO[subscript]x. A significant increase in nitrogen fixation was observed from dead coral surfaces. These nitrogen fixation rates represented a significant input of &#145;new&#146; nitrogen to coral reefs, particularly in the initial two weeks after coral mortality. Analyses of nitrification and denitrification processes indicated these processes were absent in the initial development period of the dead coral algal-bacterial community. Assessment of the coral surface algal-bacterial biofilm showed an increase in carbon and nitrogen within the biofilms, which suggested that biochemical activity within the biofilm was primarily responsible for the increase in algal biomass observed. Overall, the results demonstrate a change in coral surface biogeochemical processes, which in the context of coral bleaching, may have ecosystem wide consequences. Coral bleaching has already been responsible for the death of large areas of coral. Death of coral over large spatial scales and the consequent increase in bacterial-mediated nutrient cycling may provide a significant input of new nitrogen to the system. This thesis explores the potential significance of these changes for the long term alteration of coral reefs subject to thermal bleaching.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158273</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical Modelling of the Electromagnetic Field &#150; Material Interactions in Magnetic Resonance Imaging</field><field name="creator">Trakic, Adnan</field><field name="description">With the latest developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology, particularly in the areas of high-field superconducting magnets, high-performance ultra-short gradient coils and high radio-frequency (RF) excitation devices; the interaction of electromagnetic fields generated by the new generation of imagers and patients, healthcare workers as well as system components has recently attracted substantial attention. Due to the complexity of the electromagnetic field - tissue and field - metal interactions, computational modelling plays an essential role in the analysis, design and development of modern MRI systems. Recent progress in the development of MRI superconducting magnets has resulted in a considerable increase in human exposure to very large static magnetic fields of up to several Tesla. Body movement through these fields can cause the induction of currents that are potentially above the regulatory limits. In addition to that, novel imaging sequences demand very large magnitudes and high switching rates in magnetic field gradients, which are known to be the prime source of frequently reported peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) sites in the patients. When highfrequency fields are employed to excite a spin ensemble during MRI imaging, electromagnetic energy is coupled with the tissue and deposited within, which causes regional temperature elevations within the patient, thus leading to possible tissue/cell injury. Overall, electromagnetic field &#150; tissue interaction is a hot topic of research and requires further analysis and consideration. Apart from interacting with the patient, electromagnetic fields produced by the imager also couple to the conducting materials in the MRI system to induce eddy currents that degrade image quality. The eddy current manifestations are a significant concern in MRI and require accurate prediction models, analysis schemes and control methods. Overall this thesis is concerned with computational bioelectromagnetics and associated effects such as concomitant thermal changes. The developed methods are also used in novel design scenarios. In part, this research engages the numerical computational modelling of patient and healthcare worker exposures to strong static and low-frequency pulsed magnetic fields produced by different main superconducting magnets and gradient coils respectively. The main focus herein is on the computation of electric field and current density distributions and levels within tissue-equivalent models of males and females. Various exposure scenarios and setups are considered in the work to evaluate, analyze, compare, comprehend and predict the worst-case field induction in the tissue. This information is particularly useful in terms of compliant activity around and within the clinical MRI imagers. The thesis also details the development and utilization of modified finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods in cylindrical space for numerical modelling of lowfrequency transient eddy currents induced within realistic cryostat vessels during both longitudinal and transverse magnetic field gradient switching. In addition, transient eddy currents are numerically evaluated using the method and incorporated into a longitudinal gradient coil design process. In the optimization procedure the gradient coil is modified so that the fields created by the coil and the eddy currents combine together to generate spatially homogeneous gradients that follows the desired temporal variation. In that way the eddy currents are neither prevented nor minimized but rather constructively used in shaping uniform space-time magnetic field gradients. Furthermore, the research presents linear and non-linear heat transfer computational models on the basis of the conventional Penne&#146;s bio-heat transfer equation. The nonlinear model is verified against experimental temperature results from a hyperthermia study on a mouse using a 150 kHz induction coil, while the linear model is used directly in a study on rats under the exposure of high-frequency volume resonators (0.5 - 1 GHz). The thermal models find applications in modelling the deposition of electromagnetic field energy within tissue and computation of associated thermal effects in high-field MRI.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158585</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the treatment of drug resistant malaria in Timika, Papua, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Ratcliff, Alison Jane</field><field name="description">Introduction The burden of malaria has been significantly underestimated with the emergence of antimalarial drug resistance confounding malaria control efforts. Within Papua, Indonesia multidrug resistance has arisen to both P. falciparum and P. vivax and the associated morbidity and mortality is high. We conducted a series of chemotherapeutic trials to define the current efficacy of local antimalarial treatment protocols in Timika, southern Papua, Indonesia and investigate suitable alternative treatment strategies for patients with acute uncomplicated P. falciparum or P. viva infections. Methods A preliminary efficacy study was conducted to establish the current efficacy of the recommended therapy for uncomplicated malaria. Patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum were treated with chloroquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and those with P. vivax with chloroquine monotherapy. Patients failing therapy received unsupervised oral quinine +I- doxycycline for 7 days. Follow-up was continued for 42 days for falciparum malaria and 28 days for vivax malaria. Two further studies were then conducted. The first study compared the safety and antimalarial efficacy of two co-formulated artemisinin combination regimens: artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) for uncomplicated malaria. Children aged one year or older and adults, with symptomatic uncomplicated malaria from P. falciparum or P. vivax, were randomized to receive either treatment and then followed for up to 42 days. The primary endpoints of therapeutic efficacy for this trial were the overall 42 day parasitological cure rate and the parasitological cure rate at day 42, adjusted for reinfections by PCR genotyping. Failure rates were estimated and compared by survival analysis. In the second, the efficacy of amodiaquine for the treatment of chloroquine resistant P. vivax was determined Res u I ts Of the 143 patients enrolled in the first study, 103 were given chloroquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (CQ+SP) for P. falciparum or mixed infections and 40 were given chloroquine (CQ) for P. vivax infections. Early treatment failures occurred in four patients (4%) treated with chloroquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and 6 patients (1 6%) treated with chloroquine monotherapy. By day 42 the PCR corrected recrudescence rate after CQ+SP was 48 % [95%CI: 3 1-65%]. The day 28 failure rate for patients treated with CQ was 65% [95% CI 49-81]. In those patients with P. falciparum retreated with unsupervised quinine * doxycycline 48% [95%CI: 3 1-65%] had recurrence by day 28. Of the 88 patients with recurrent P. vivax who received amodiaquine monotherapy the day 28 failure rate in those patients who completed therapy was 28% [95%CI: 1 1-45%]. In the comparative study 774 patients were enrolled into the prospective randomised trial: 387 patients were enrolled to receive dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and 387 to receive artemetherlumefantrine. Of these patients; 473 (61 %) had P. falciparum, 1 14 (15 %) mixed infections and 175 (23 %) had P. vivax infections. The overall rate of parasite reappearance was higher after artemether-lumefantrine (5 1% [95% CI: 43 - 59%]) compared to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (38% [95% CI: 25 - 51 %I); (p&lt;0.001). The PCR corrected cure rate of P. falciparum infection by day 42 exceeded 98% in both treatment arms. However reinfection rates from P. falciparum were higher after artemether-lumefantrine (19% [95 % CI: 14 - 24 %I) compared to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (1 1 % [95 % CI: 7- 15 %I); (p= 0.002). By day 42 P. vivax parasitaemia occurred in 37% [95 % CI: 32-42 %] patients treated with artemether-lumefantrine compared to 8 % [95 % CI: 5 - 12 %] treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (p&lt;O.OOl). Conclusions The rapid emergence of strains of P. falciparum and P. vivax resistant to both chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine are now undermining malaria control strategies in southern Papua. We have shown the first line therapy ineffective and also that the second line regimen (unsupervised quinine * doxycycline) is not a suitable alternative. New treatment strategies are urgently needed. Although the overall efficacy of amodiaquine monotherapy was better than that of chloroquine in the treatment of P. vivax, the high failure rate suggests that it can not be recommended in this area. However both artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine were safe, well tolerated and effective in this population. Dihydroartemisininpiperaquine had the advantage of significantly decreasing reinfection with P. falciparum and relapse of P. vivax, a reflection of its long terminal elimination half life. This led to a significant improvement in haematological recovery. Using information provided from these clinical trials the local Indonesian Health services have incorporated dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine as first line therapy for uncomplicated malaria in patients in the Timika region. Further studies are ongoing to assess the impact of such policy change in this area. Our studies have implications for policy makers in areas of mixed infections (&gt;40% of malaria areas) and also policy makers in areas of high transmission (Africa)</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158586</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hijacked Agenda: The National Museum of Australia and the Gallery of the First Australians</field><field name="creator">Dauber, Christine Louise</field><field name="description">In 1975, Museums&#146; Australia in conjunction with the Federal government undertook an assessment of museums throughout Australia. The results of this study were published in what has become known as the Pigott Report. Almost twenty years later the objectives of the report were utilised as the foundational document for the establishment of the National Museum of Australia, Australia&#146;s first fully national museum, which finally opened its doors to the Australian public in March of 2001. Housed within it is The Gallery of the First Australians. Within this gallery Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history is told from a revisionist perspective. National Museums play a major role in projecting narratives of national identity &#150; they have done so in North America and in New Zealand. This thesis examines what is at stake in representing Australian indigenous culture in a national museum within a postcolonial context. The central question is what role Aboriginal culture plays within the national imaginary as represented within the museum. At issue is the place of indigenous cultural representation within the totalising concepts of national identity and national history. Therefore consideration is given to the way in which the National Museum in its internal organisation and by its architecture, signals the concept of nation. Since the late eighteenth century when the great museums of the world opened their doors to the general public, museums and the development of the nation state have been intimately connected, so much so that museums have been described as one of the &#145;fundamental institutions of the modern state&#146;. As such, they have enjoyed a respected and authoritative position within the societies which they served. Whilst the storm of controversy surrounding the National Museum indicates that this position is under threat, it also suggests that museums, as national institutions, remain important to contemporary society. In order to address the controversies surrounding the Museum this thesis examines the policies, structure, and focus of the National Museum and its representations, both museological and architectural, of indigenous peoples within the Gallery of Aboriginal Australia. It also gives consideration to the Museum&#146;s public critics and to its relationship with the government that funded its establishment. It questions how these public and governmental responses might affect both Aboriginal and non- Aboriginal Australians and the much debated reconciliation process. The implications of the Mabo decision for museum collection and display are also considered. In order to illuminate the Australian situation, comparisons are made with the representations of First Nations&#146; people within other museums such as Te Papa, Wellington, New Zealand, the Museum of Civilization, Hull, Quebec, and the Pequot Tribal Nations&#146; Museum, Stonington, Connecticut. This study is located within the broad arena of museum history but focuses on the history of indigenous representation. To enable an understanding of the complexity of the relationships involved, a multi-disciplinary approach is used. This calls on the disciplines of Art History, History, Memory Theory, Ethnography and Museology. Whilst the primary concern is to elucidate museum practice within Australia, the thesis addresses how the inclusion of the Gallery of Aboriginal Australia within the National Museum of Australia inflects perceptions of the national in Australian culture.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158379</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Spatial and Temporal Distribution of the Metal Mineralisation in Eastern Australia and the Relationship of the Observed Patterns to Giant Ore Deposits</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Larry</field><field name="description">The introduced mineral deposit model (MDM) is the product of a trans-disciplinary study, based on Complexity and General Systems Theory. Both investigate the abstract organization of phenomena, independent of their substance, type, or spatial or temporal scale of existence. The focus of the research has been on giant, hydrothermal mineral deposits. They constitute &lt;0.001% of the total number of deposits yet contain 70-85% of the world's metal resources. Giants are the definitive exploration targets. They are more profitable to exploit and less susceptible to fluctuations of the market. Consensus has it that the same processes that generate small deposits also form giants but those processes are simply longer, vaster, and larger. Heat is the dominant factor in the genesis of giant mineral deposits. A paleothermal map shows where the vast heat required to generate a giant has been concentrated in a large space, and even allows us to deduce the duration of the process. To generate a paleothermal map acceptable to the scientific community requires reproducibility. Experimentation with various approaches to pattern recognition of geochemical data showed that the AUTOCLUST algorithm not only gave reproducibility but also gave the most consistent, most meaningful results. It automatically extracts boundaries based on Voronoi and Delaunay tessellations. The user does not specify parameters; however, the modeller does have tools to explore the data. This approach is near ideal in that it removes much of the humangenerated bias. This algorithm reveals the radial, spatial distribution, of gold deposits in the Lachlan Fold Belt of southeastern Australia at two distinct scales &#150; repeating patterns every ~80 km and ~230 km. Both scales of patterning are reflected in the geology. The ~80 km patterns are nested within the ~230 km patterns revealing a self-similar, geometrical relationship. It is proposed that these patterns originate from Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection in the mantle. At the Rayleigh Number appropriate for the mantle, the stable planform is the spoke pattern, where hot mantle material is moving upward near the centre of the pattern and outward along the radial arms. Discontinuities in the mantle, Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection in the mantle, and the spatial distribution of giant mineral deposits, are correlative. The discontinuities in the Earth are acting as platforms from which Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection can originate. Shallow discontinuities give rise to plumelets, which manifest at the crust as repeating patterns ranging, from ~100 to ~1,000 km in diameter. Deeper discontinuities give rise to plumes, which become apparent at the crust as repeating patterns ranging from &gt;1,000 to ~4,000 km in diameter. The deepest discontinuities give rise to the superplumes, which become detectable at the crust as repeating patterns ranging from &gt;4,000 to &gt;10,000 km in diameter. Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection concentrates the reservoir of heat in the mantle into specific locations in the crust; thereby providing the vast heat requirements for the processes that generate giant, hydrothermal mineral deposits. The radial spatial distribution patterns observed for gold deposits are also present for base metal deposits. At the supergiant Broken Hill deposit in far western New South Wales, Australia, the higher temperature Broken Hill-type deposits occur in a radial pattern while the lower temperature deposits occur in concentric patterns. The supergiant Broken Hill deposit occurs at the very centre of the pattern. If the supergiant Broken Hill Deposit was buried beneath alluvium, water or younger rocks, it would now be possible to predict its location with accuracy measured in tens of square kilometres. This predictive accuracy is desired by every exploration manager of every exploration company. The giant deposits at Broken Hill, Olympic Dam, and Mount Isa all occur on the edge of an annulus. There are at least two ways of creating an annulus on the Earth's surface. One is through Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection and the other is through meteor impact. It is likely that only 'large' meteors (those &gt;10 km in diameter) would have any permanent impact on the mantle. Lesser meteors would leave only a superficial scar that would be eroded away. The permanent scars in the mantle act as &#145;accidental templates&#146; consisting of concentric and possibly radial fractures that impose those structures on any rocks that were subsequently laid down or emplaced over the mantle. In southeastern Australia, the proposed Deniliquin Impact structure has been an 'accidental template' providing a 'line-of-least-resistance' for the ascent of the ~2,000 km diameter, offshore, Cape Howe Plume. The western and northwestern radial arms of this plume have created the very geometry of the Lachlan Fold Belt, as well as giving rise to the spatial distribution of the granitic rocks in that belt and ultimately to the gold deposits. The interplay between the templating of the mantle by meteor impacts and the ascent of plumelets, plumes or superplumes from various discontinuities in the mantle is quite possibly the reason that mineral deposits occur where they do.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158588</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The hydrology of septic tank &#150; soil absorption systems: investigation and prediction of hydraulic failure</field><field name="creator">Beal, Cara Diane</field><field name="description">The mechanisms governing hydraulic failure of septic tank &#150; soil absorption systems (SAS) are not well understood. The low permeable biomat zone that develops on the infiltrative surface is a key component of the hydraulic and treatment performance of a SAS. In this study, the hydrology of SAS, including biomat development, the role of soil texture and key effluent flow pathways, was investigated. A survey of 19 councils in south-east Queensland was undertaken to obtain data on aspects of SAS management, and to identify the number and type of SAS failure rates. A survey of this nature had not been carried out in Queensland before, and it illustrated the importance of field inspections of every non-sewered allotment to achieve meaningful compilation of data. The number of on-site systems (in 2003) was estimated to be 127,000 with septic systems accounting for approximately 80%. Over 75% of SAS were split systems (separate greywater/blackwater treatment). A common SAS failure was surcharging trenches, which was observed predominantly in soils of low permeability. Whilst the reported frequency of SAS failures was quite low (usually &lt; 1% per year) there was a widespread opinion by councils that this was a substantial under reporting of the real situation. The effects of biomat development on long-term infiltration rates in different soil textures was investigated. Septic tank effluent was applied to repacked sand, Ferrosol and Vertosol soil columns over 16 months, at equivalent loading rates of 50, 35 and 8 L/m2/d, respectively. Biomats 1 to 2 cm thick developed in all soils with corresponding hydraulic resistances of 27 to 39 days. These biomats reduced a four order of magnitude variation in saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) between the soils to a one order of magnitude variation in long-term acceptance rate (LTAR). A relationship between biomat resistance and organic loading rate was observed in all soils. Results show that whilst initial soil Ks is likely to be important in the establishment of the biomat zone in a trench, LTAR is predominantly influenced by the biomat resistance, and to a lesser extent the unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity, and not the Ks of a soil. One dimensional and two dimensional hydraulic models were used to investigate the relative importance of sidewall and vertical flow rates and pathways in SAS. In the permeable soils, under high trench loading, effluent preferentially flowed in the upper region of the trench where no resistant biomat was present (the exfiltration zone). In comparison, flow was more evenly partitioned between the biomat zone and the exfiltration zone of trenches in the low permeable soils. An increase in effluent infiltration corresponded with a greater availability of exfiltration zone, rather than a lower resistance of biomat. Field studies were conducted on two permeable soils (clay loam and loamy sand) to characterise the biomat physical properties and to calibrate 2D modelling. Field results indicated that sidewall flow above the biomat during high trench loading was a major flow pathway in the soils. Hydraulic transport and Ks parameters were calibrated using inverse modelling procedures in HYDRUS-2D. There was good agreement between measured and predicted matric potentials, and the optimized Ks biomat parameters of 0.003 and 0.004 m/day fell well within the range reported in previous field-scale studies. Predictive modelling indicated that during extreme loading conditions, the exfiltration zone is the major flow pathway for trenches in permeable soil. The influence of soil texture on SAS hydraulic failure was shown to be more important in situations of extreme hydraulic loading into a trench, rather than on the normal functioning of a trench. Soil column studies indicated that the biomat resistance is the key driver of long-term vertical flow rates, regardless of initial saturated hydraulic conductivities. Modelling and field studies demonstrated that during extreme trench loadings (such as extended rainfall events or episodic shock loads), the permeability and extent of the biomat-free upper sidewalls is the ultimate determinant of trench hydraulic failure.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158381</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the boundaries of emotional responsiveness in young children with autism spectrum disorders</field><field name="creator">Hudry, Kristelle</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158274</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Palynology, sequence stratigraphy, and palaeoenvironments of Middle to Upper Jurassic strata, Bayu-Undan Field, Timor Sea region</field><field name="creator">Mantle, Daniel</field><field name="description">Detailed palynological analysis of 230 core and sidewall core samples from the uppermost Plover, Elang, and lower Frigate formations, Bayu-Undan Field, Timor Sea, reveals the presence of diverse and moderately well preserved palynomorph assemblages (predominantly dinoflagellate cysts, together with acritarchs, spores, and pollen grains) that facilitate biostratigraphic, sequence stratigraphic, and palaeoenvironmental interpretations. The palynomorph assemblages, detailed systematically herein, comprise 96 spore and pollen species, 84 dinoflagellate species, and 15 acritarch species. Of these, the following 14 dinoflagellate cyst species are newly instituted: Ampulladinium aiax, Batiacasphaera macbethiae, Broomea fusticulum, Cauca bayuiana, Egmontodinium elongatum, Ellipsoidictyum fenestellum, Evansia? lacryma, Leberidocysta? strigosus, Leptodinium? ancoralium, Meiourogonyaulax baculata, Nannoceratopsis reticulata, Paragonyaulacysta? feneseptata, P. helbyi, and Yalkalpodinium playfordii. A further five species are not formally named due to a lack of adequately preserved specimens. One genus, Broomea COOKSON&amp;EISENACK, is formally emended. The palynostratigraphic sequence has previously been assessed as latest Bathonian to early Oxfordian in age, based mainly on correlations with European dinoflagellate assemblages dated by ammonite faunas. Ten subzones (TB1-5 and VT1-5) are informally erected, collectively encompassing the Ternia balmei and Voodooia tabulata dinoflagellate cyst Interval Zones. The subzones are defined variously on first and last appearance datums, first and last common occurrences, and species acmes. The acme events are coincident with marine flooding surfaces and enable precise correlation across the Bayu-Undan Field. The Elang Formation &#150; the prime focus of this study &#150; is divided into three third order sequences, each comprising a lowstand, transgressive, and highstand systems tract. These tracts and their delimiting stratal horizons or flooding surfaces possess distinctive palynological or palynodebris assemblages. Qualitative and quantitative variations of these assemblages correlate very closely with gamma-ray log profiles and can be consistently placed within a sequence stratigraphic framework across the Bayu- Undan Field. Palynofacies analyses provide additional means to distinguish among the systems tracts; viz., microphytoplankton diversity increases through transgressive systems tracts to a peak diversity at the maximum flooding surface; atypically brown wood frequencies may also peak at maximum flooding surfaces; and black debris frequencies increase higher in the highstand systems tracts. Palaeoenvironmental interpretations based primarily on palynological assemblages (especially microphytoplankton groupings and palynodebris distribution) provide a means to identify depositional settings in non-cored intervals. For instance, the occurrences of Ternia balmei, the Meiourogonyaulax group, the Ctenidodinium group, and the Rigaudella group represent an approximate gradient from very nearshore to offshore environments or possibly an increase in salinities from euryhaline to stenohaline conditions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260113 Palynology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158275</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time Horizon and Uncertainty in Continuous Time Finance: Preferences for Information and Term Structure Modelling</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Stuart</field><field name="description">This thesis makes a contribution to the literature on pricing and valuation in continuous time' finance by examining the relationship between investment time horizon, uncertainty and asset valuation. Part one of ths thesis concentrates on the generalized stochastic differential utility model. The first chapter contained in this part of the thesis provides a review of the infinite horizon backward stochastic differential equation and its associated g-expectation. The g-expectation is a special class of non-linear expectation operator that preserves all properties of the classical linear expectation other than linearity. The results reviewed in this chapter are then used in the second chapter of part one to construct an infinite horizon extension of the generalized stochastic differential utility model. This model is then used to formulate an infinite horizon theory of preferences for information, which focuses on the idea of non-indifference to the inter-temporal resolution of consumption risk when investment time horizon is also unknown. In this approach a preference for the early resolution of uncertainty is defined as a preference for a finer information filtration on a given consumption process. A preference for the late resolution of uncertainty is then defined as a preference for a finer information filtration on a given consumption process, which in turn leads to a definition of information neutrality or indifference to information. Based on this definition an optional stopping theorem is constructed which, based on the properties of the g-expectation operator, provides sufficient conditions for information neutrality or indifference to information in finite time. Part two of this thesis focuses on the application of stochastic partial differential equations for modeling interest rate term structure. The first chapter contained in this part of the thesis develops a new technique for simulating the stochastic partial differential equations. This technique extends to stochastic environments a numerical procedure for solving deterministic partial differential equations known as the method of lines. The first chapter contained in this part of the thesis develops the method of lines technique and provides a proof that it can be applied to solve boundary value problems associated with the linear elliptic and parabolic stochastic partial differential equations. The second chapter uses the method of lines to simulate the term structure of interest for models in which the forward rate dynamics of the zero coupon bond are defined in terms of a boundary value problem of a stochastic partial differential equation. Two forward rate models are simulated. In the first model, the forward rates follow a generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. In the second model the forward rates are assumed to follow an integrated generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Numerical simulations of the forward rate processes for these two models point to an important role for numerical experiments in complementing theoretical developments in finance. Firstly, in both models the simulations show an unusual relationship between the forward rate and volatility: when the volatility term increases, the amount of volatility in the forward rate decreases. This indicates, for both models, that noise can be used to stabilize the stochastic partial differential equation. This phenomenon is known as stochastic resonance and is a known means of controlling unstable deterministic differential equations. In the second model, which is based on the integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, there is a diffusion constant that influences the curvature of the yield curve. Numerical experiments show that when this constant becomes large it leads to an inversion of the yield curve.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158589</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pore Water Exchange Processes in Offshore Intertidal Sandbanks</field><field name="creator">Gibbes, Badin</field><field name="description">In recent years blooms of the toxic marine cyanobacteria Lyngbya majuscula have been frequently observed in a system of offshore intertidal sandbanks in Moreton Bay, Australia. Past research suggests that these blooms are linked to the presence of bioavailable forms of iron. Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is thought to provide an important nutrient (particularly iron) transport mechanism at locations where L. majuscula blooms are observed. In this study the feasibility of the current conceptual model for SGD to offshore L. majuscula bloom sites was examined using a combination of field measurements and numerical models. Numerical simulations indicated that SGD could occur several kilometres offshore within the sandbank system if a continuous, low hydraulic conductivity aquitard extends from the onshore aquifer to the offshore sandbank. Models that incorporated significant discontinuities or gaps in the aquitard unit resulted in SGD at the location of these discontinuities before reaching the offshore sandbank system. Improved hydrogeological data, particularly in relation to the presence and continuity of any aquitard units, is required to enable a better assessment of SGD mechanisms in this area. Simulated maximum instantaneous vertical flow velocities in the near-surface zone of the sediments around the offshore exit point were an order of magnitude lower the velocities associated with local-scale pore water flow processes that are driven by tidal and subtidal pumping. As such these local-scale flow processes (instead of SGD) are likely to provide the dominant pore water exchange mechanisms in the offshore sandbank systems. Field data was collected from a L. majuscula bloom site at an offshore intertidal sandbank within the Eastern Banks of the Bay to examine these local-scale flow processes. The measurements identified a tidally-induced residual pore water flow system in the sandbank, with seawater entering the upper sandbank platform and discharging through the bank edge. Furthermore the field data revealed concentrations of bio-available iron in pore waters that were more than four times greater than concentrations previously shown to stimulate L. majuscula growth. Upward flow and elevated near-surface dissolved Fe(II) concentrations (&gt; 20 &#181;M Fe(II) at -0.05 m depth) were measured simultaneously in the discharge zones at the sandbank edge. Analysis of dissolved Fe(II) profiles within pore waters at the site showed that measurable concentrations of dissolved Fe(II) were absent at the base (-2 m depth) of all monitoring stations. This result seems to indicate that terrestrially derived SGD is not an iron source at the site. Numerical simulations of the tidally-induced pore water flow at the field site generally showed good agreement with the field data. Simulation results revealed a more complex residual pore water flow system in the sandbank than shown by the field data. Both numerical simulations and field measurements suggest that the residual flow might provide a mechanism for transport of bio-available iron across the sediment-water interface. During periods when these sandbanks are submerged a number of pore water exchange processes, collectively termed subtidal pumping, are likely to be operating at the site. Numerical models were developed to examine one particular form of subtidal pumping, i.e., current-bedform interactions. These models were based on a one-way sequentially coupled model of surface water and porous medium flow. Interactions between unidirectional and bi-directional currents with simple two-dimensional fixed bedforms were considered. Results suggested that while pore water exchange was likely in distinct zones around the sandbank edges, a whole-of-bank scale pore water circulation was unlikely to occur. Smaller scale (&lt; 1.0 m) variations in the sandbank topography might exert a stronger influence on the pore water flow and associated pore water exchange. Simulations showed more complex pore water flow paths and longer pore water residence times in systems under bi-directional flow conditions compared to systems subject to unidirectional flows. The consideration of bi-directional flows is important in modelling current-bedform interactions in tidally influenced environments. The findings of this study have implications for the current conceptual model for L. majuscula blooms in offshore intertidal sandbanks within Moreton Bay. This conceptual model should be updated to include tidal and subtidal pumping as potential delivery mechanisms for bio-available iron. Further investigations are required to fully understand the role of tidal and subtidal pumping in controlling the export of bio-available iron to coastal waters at the field site. In particular there is a need to better assess the link between the pore water flows and the geochemical reactions that might occur along the flow path. Improved data on pore water chemistry as well as the solid phase mineralogy is required to develop reactive transport models for these flow systems. Such models would allow further investigation of the importance of tidal and subtidal pumping as a mechanism for exporting dissolved chemicals across the sediment-water interface.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158590</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BIOSYNTHESIS OF CIRCULAR PROTEINS IN PLANTS</field><field name="creator">Saska, Ivana</field><field name="description">Backbone cyclisation has the potential to improve the thermodynamic and biochemical stability of proteins. The discovery of backbone cyclised (circular) proteins in nature has therefore generated a great deal of interest, both in understanding the basic biology of the cyclisation process and in its prospective application to bio-engineering. Naturally occurring circular proteins have now been identified in bacteria, plants and animals but their biosynthesis remains poorly understood, especially in eukaryotes. The broad aim of this study was to gain insight into natural mechanisms of cyclisation by examining the biosynthesis of the cyclotides, a large family of plant-derived circular proteins. The cyclotides are topologically complex circular proteins produced by plants from the Rubiaceae and Violaceae families. To date over 100 cyclotide sequences have been identified, but their total number is predicted to be in the thousands. Structurally, cyclotides are characterised by the combination of a cyclic backbone and a cystine knot arrangement of their three disulfide bonds. This framework is exceptionally stable and allows cyclotides to tolerate thermal, chemical and biological conditions that would degrade most linear proteins. The compact structure of cyclotides, while very stable, complicates detection of the proteins and has impeded efforts to characterise cyclotide expression levels in plants. As a result, in this project an alternative method for the detection of cyclotides was developed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The method facilitates both the detection and quantification of cyclotides in heterogenous mixtures, and challenges current assumptions that MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is exclusively a qualitative technique. The analysis of cyclotides was also augmented by the development of a transient assay for the expression of cyclotide genes in Nicotiana benthamiana, a plant which does not endogenously produce cyclotides. Cyclotides are expressed as part of linear precursor proteins from which they must be excised before cyclisation can take place. Based on sequence conservation, processing at the N-terminus of the cyclotide domain does not appear to be specific but at the C-terminus occurs almost exclusively following an Asn or Asp residue. A major watershed in understanding this process was the finding presented that plants which do not naturally contain cyclotides are capable of producing the circular proteins when supplied with cyclotide precursor genes. This result indicates that the biochemical machinery necessary for protein cyclisation is not unique to cyclotide containing plants, but is common to plants in general. The production of cyclotides was less efficient in the transgenic system, leading to the production of linear cyclotide forms not characteristically observed in cyclotide containing plants. An analysis of the evolution of the linear species over time revealed an aberrant C-terminal processing mechanism that competed with the cyclisation process. This showed that the substrate for cyclisation was an extended linear cyclotide including part of the C-terminal tail and indicated that cleavage of the asparaginyl bond at the C-terminus of the cyclotide domain occurred together with cyclisation. Subsequent work was therefore directed towards identification of an enzyme capable of cleaving asparaginyl bonds. Only one class of enzymes, the legumains, are known to specifically hydrolyse asparaginyl, and occasionally aspartyl, bonds. These enzymes are common in plants where they are alternatively called asparaginyl endopeptidases and vacuolar processing enzymes (VPE). In vitro studies demonstrated that VPE activity was responsible for asparaginyl bond hydrolysis in cyclotide containing plants and was also capable of cleaving synthetic cyclotide substrates at the C-terminal asparaginyl bond of the cyclotide domain. The C-terminal Asn residue was not targeted when part of a full length precursor protein, suggesting that VPE activity was limited to the late stages of processing. Two approaches were used to assess the effects of decreased VPE activity on cyclotide biosynthesis in vivo. Both the application of a VPE inhibitor directly into plant leaves and virus induced gene silencing of VPEs caused a decrease in the levels of circular protein produced upon expression of the cyclotide precursor in N. benthamiana. The decease in VPE activity also correlated with an increase in the linear cyclotide forms, consistent with previous findings that cyclisation occurs together with cleavage of an extended linear substrate. The identification of a VPE from a cyclotide containing plant was the first step towards characterising this mechanism. Further inhibitor studies pointed towards the involvement of a cysteine protease in processing upstream of the cyclotide domain and subsequent non specific trimming to the N-terminal cleavage site. In summary this study has provided important insights into the processing and cyclisation of cyclotides in plants. A mechanism for backbone cyclisation is proposed in which cleavage at the C-terminal asparaginyl bond of the cyclotide domain is coupled to cyclisation in a transpeptidation reaction catalysed by a VPE.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158591</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of dietary factors in the aetiology of Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a case-control study in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.</field><field name="creator">Syafiq, Ahmad</field><field name="description">Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is the most common cancer among males in Yogyakarta, Indonesia and rank second among males in Indonesia after skin cancer. NPC is associated with Epstein-Barr Virus, genetic susceptibility, and chemical carcinogens from occupational exposures and diet. Dietary factors might play role both as promoter and protector to NPC development. This study aims at investigating the role of dietary factors in NPC development in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Design of the study was case-control with two types of controls, that is hospital controls and community controls. Cases were 73 histopathologically confirmed NPC patients, while hospital controls were 73 other cancer patients matched by diagnostic year and community controls were 73 healthy closest neighbours of cases matched for age and sex. Dietary exposures were collected retrospectively using specifically developed and validated food-frequency questionnaires. Design of the study also allows the collection of early information on survival analysis of NPC, which availability is very limited in Indonesia. The study was successfully developed food-frequencyquestionnaires modified from the available existing questionnaires through combination of different qualitative methods. In general, the questionnaires had a relatively moderate to high reliability and validity coefficients, although for some food items the reliability and validity was considered as poor. Results of the study showed that the risk of NPC was higher for those who consumed fermented salted fish during childhood period (OR: 9.3 CI 1.1-76.6). The risk of NPC was higher for those who consumed shrimp paste during the adult period (OR: 2.1 CI 1.1-4.0). Results on the fruit and vegetables hypotheses are a little mixed and uncertain because even though consumption of carrot during weaning period showed significant protective effect (OR: 0.4 CI 0.1-0.9), several other fruit and vegetable items showed significant risks as promotive factor of NPC. One possible explanation was related to low validity of measurement of distant past intake of fruit and vegetables. Hypotheses that we could not test due to small numbers of subjects were hypotheses related to duration of exposure and hypotheses related to dose response relationship.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158382</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-temperature viscosity measurements in slags</field><field name="creator">Raghunath, Sreekanth</field><field name="description">Viscosity is one of the most important physical properties of slags, which needs to be controlled to improve the efficiency of operation of a wide range of industrial processes. The present investigations deal with viscosity measurements in the molten metal oxides as applicable to the pyrometallurgical and power generation industries. The effect of temperature and composition on the viscosities of the silicate melts was the topic of primary interest during present investigations. Viscosity measurements were carried out in the systems &#145;FeO&#146; &#150; SiO2, &#145;FeO&#146; &#150; MgO &#150; SiO2, and Al2O3 - &#145;FeO&#146; &#150; SiO2 at metallic iron saturation conditions; and the CaO &#150; K2O &#150; SiO2 system during the course of the present program. Upon critically reviewing the existing literature in the systems of interest, it was found that there was a serious lack of reliable and systematic experimental data. The compositions selected for measurement in the present investigation will enable the systematic study of the effects of the different components in the melt on the viscosity of the melt. The temperature range was chosen keeping in mind the limiting factors, such as, the liquidus temperatures of the various slag compositions and the maximum operating temperature of the furnace. The high-temperature viscosity measurement apparatus that was recently constructed by the Pyrometallurgy Research Centre at The University of Queensland, was commissioned to operate under controlled atmospheres and used for experimental measurements during the present program. An experimental methodology, inclusive of sample preparation methods, viscosity measurement procedure and post-experimental analysis of samples, was established for conducting successful experiments using the viscosity apparatus. Rotational cylinder viscometry was employed as the technique to measure viscosity, as it was found to be suitable for the range of viscosities under consideration for present investigations. The viscometers were calibrated against standard liquids to determine the equipment constant to be used in converting the raw viscometer data into absolute values of viscosities. The viscosity measurements were typically conducted at 50 K intervals, after equilibrating the sample at each temperature. The sample was quenched from above the liquidus temperatures to analyse the phase and compositional homogeneity of the melt, using the unique quenching mechanism available on the viscosity apparatus. The microstructures of the slag samples after viscosity measurements were studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM); composition analysis was done using Electron Probe X-ray Micro Analysis (EPMA); and the bulk compositions of the slag samples were determined using X-ray Florescence (XRF) technique, to determine the phase homogeneity and bulk compositions of the quenched samples. This approach provided a way of determining any possible deviations from target compositions and presence of any crystal phases during the course of the experiment, and enabled the reduction of uncertainty associated with the measurements. Slag compositions in the systems &#145;FeO&#146; &#150; SiO2, Al2O3 &#150; &#145;FeO&#146; &#150; SiO2, &#145;FeO&#146; &#150; MgO &#150; SiO2 and CaO &#150; K2O &#150; SiO2 have been selected for investigations to enable systematic studies of the effects of compositional variation to be undertaken. In the &#145;FeO&#146; &#150; SiO2 system at metallic iron saturation, measurements were conducted for four compositions with SiO2 concentration varying between ~31 mol % to ~41 mol %, over the temperature range 1523 K &#150; 1773 K. In the Al2O3 &#150; &#145;FeO&#146; &#150; SiO2 system at metallic iron saturation, measurements were conducted for seven compositions over the temperature range 1473 K &#150; 1773 K. In the &#145;FeO&#146; &#150; MgO &#150; SiO2 system at metallic iron saturation, measurements were conducted for seven compositions over the temperature range 1523 K &#150; 1773 K. Measurements in the CaO &#150; K2O &#150; SiO2 system were conducted for three synthetic slag samples and two natural slag samples for compositions pertaining to biomass ash slags in the temperature range 1270 K &#150; 1873 K. The new experimental viscosity data obtained from the experiments were critically analysed and were found to match well with expected trends in terms of dependence of viscosity on composition and temperature variations. The data obtained ivfrom the present investigations were compared with results reported by other researchers. The present data were shown to be self-consistent and reproducible, the uncertainties in absolute values of viscosity were demonstrated to be significantly lower than most previous studies. The new data enable the individual effects of changing Al2O3, CaO, FeO, K2O MgO and SiO2 concentrations on the viscosities of fully liquid silicate slags to be identified in a systematic way. This systematic approach is particularly useful in resolving the effects of complex interactions in the melts, such as, charge compensation reactions (Me+, Me2+)O &#150; Al2O3. The modified-Urbain viscosity model, one of the predictive models developed at the Pyrometallurgy Research Centre, was used to compare with results from experiments and validate the model parameters. In most cases, the absolute viscosities from present measurements were found to be slightly higher than model predictions, although the slopes of plots of logarithm of experimental viscosities as a function of inverse temperature were found to match well with the predictions by the model. The new data from the present investigations will be used to optimise the modified Urbain model parameters to improve the accuracy of viscosity predictions. The present investigations have resulted in: &#149; Improved procedures for slag viscosity measurements &#149; Systematic measurement of uncertainties in viscosity as a function of geometry of the crucible/bob assembly &#149; New experimental data in a number of important slag systems, data of importance to both industrial applications and the improvement of predictive slag viscosity models.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158592</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anima/Animus: Depardieu and the Projection of Masculinities</field><field name="creator">Ward, Wendy H.</field><field name="description">From his first starring role as the macho Jean-Claude in Bertrand Blier&#146;s controversial Les Valseuses (1973), G&#233;rard Depardieu&#146;s imposing presence has left an indelible impression on cinema audiences &#150; not only in his native France, but across the world. Through his enormous body of work (over 150 films), his enormous body has become the object of the collective gaze. This body, however, is the site of a paradox that has achieved the status of myth &#150; rather than functioning as an unambiguous signifier of machismo, Depardieu&#146;s power to fascinate the gaze appears to rest more on his ability to project a &#147;feminine&#148; fragility and vulnerability. This &#147;brute au coeur tendre&#148; (brute with the tender heart), as he has become universally known, takes apparent delight in challenging the boundaries of sex and gender &#150; as attested by his extraordinarily diverse choice of roles, his unique performance style, and the ubiquitous references to his so-called femininity in countless media texts. Depardieu&#146;s negotiation of gender has not necessarily been received as subversive. Ginette Vincendeau, for example, has argued that the actor&#146;s incorporation of the feminine works to marginalise &#147;real&#148; women, while at the same time reinforcing his own (very heterosexual, very hegemonic) masculinity. It will be the contention of this thesis, however, that such arguments are unnecessarily reductive, in that they function to reinforce, rather than deconstruct, essentialist, binary-ordered notions of gender. In order to avoid the limitations of this approach, and to more thoroughly investigate the complexities of Depardieu&#146;s persona and the diverse range of masculinities that he embodies, this thesis will apply aspects of Jungian theory (specifically, Jung&#146;s theory of contrasexuality) to the close reading of a number of key films in the actor&#146;s corpus. The final two chapters, which specifically address Depardieu&#146;s embodiment of the queer, will also draw on Judith Butler&#146;s theory of performativity. The plurality of gender being a key tenet of this investigation, the films presented for analysis have been chosen to represent a range of masculinities that Depardieu has embodied thus far. Moreover, to better reflect the diversity of the actor&#146;s corpus, the selection has been drawn from a variety of genres &#150; including auteur, mainstream Hollywood, comedy, drama, and heritage films. In contrast to the narrow focus of most Freudian-influenced approaches to gender, Jungian theory allows for plurality and fluidity by positioning the gender binary within the subject. From this broadened perspective, Depardieu&#146;s relationship with the feminine can be understood as an ongoing performance of the process of individuation, the archetypal quest for wholeness through the balanced integration of masculine and feminine.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158383</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of collaboration: a study of the influences of violinists on the violin repertoire of Sergei Prokofiev.</field><field name="creator">Maddick, Andrew Flannigan</field><field name="description">This critical commentary examines the process of composer-performer collaboration in the violin works of Sergei Prokofiev.

Over the past decade, because of the simultaneous evolution of micro-bubble engineering and contrast specific imaging modalities, the use of intravenously administered micro-bubbles to traverse the myocardial microcirculation in order to outline myocardial viability and perfusion has become a reality. The overall hypothesis of the studies undertaken in this thesis was that utilizing contrast agents during clinical echocardiographic studies can overcome the known limitations of non contrast echo imaging, facilitate the evaluation of novel diagnostic strategies and improve the accuracy of various echocardiographic techniques for diagnosis of clinical cardiac abnormalities. Further, this thesis hypothesises that the use of quantitative myocardial contrast echocardiography will enable further understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in development of myocardial dysfunction in sub clinical cardiac diseases (eg patients with diabetes). The thesis initially reviews the evolution and development of contrast echocardiography, with focus on the clinical utility and technical aspects of qualitative and quantitative interpretation of contrast specific imaging. A number of unresolved clinical and technical issues are discussed, and will be addressed/investigated in this thesis. The second chapter describes the methodologies used in this thesis, with particular emphasis on new technologies used in the studies. Chapters 3 and 4 are studies which address the potential clinical utility of contrast agents for left ventricular opacification (LVO). Chapter 3 evaluates the benefit of LVO for calculation of left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction (EF), using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination as a gold standard. Thirty patients with a previous history of ST elevation myocardial infarction underwent 2 dimensional (2DE) and three dimensional (3DE) echocardiography, with and without contrast for LVO. There was a significant improvement in accuracy for calculation of volumes and EF for 2DLVO and standard 3DE compared with standard 2DE, with 2DLVO and 3DE demonstrating comparable results. Overall 3DLVO demonstrated the closest accuracy, correlation and limits of agreement for all parameters. These results confirm previous studies which have demonstrated utility of both 2DLVO and non-contrast 3D for calculation of LV volumes and EF, although this is the first to address both modalities in a single cohort of patients. Additionally we have introduced a new, highly accurate modality, contrast 3D echocardiography which was the best predictor of MRI parameters. One limitation of stress echocardiography is reliance on image quality. Chapter 4 examines the incremental benefit and cost effectiveness of adding contrast for LVO to stress echo studies for diagnosis of CAD, using angiography as a gold standard. We prospectively recruited 135 patients planned to undergo coronary angiography, who were studied with pharmacologic and or exercise stress, with rest and peak/post stress images performed with and without contrast. Contrast significantly increased the sensitivity for overall diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD), recognition of single vessel CAD as well as extent of CAD. Unfortunately a cost benefit analysis based on published outcomes of patients having undergone stress echocardiography suggested the utility of this approach was not cost effective Chapters 5-8 are studies investigating use of contrast agents for qualitative and quantitative myocardial perfusion imaging. Reliance on ischaemia has been a documented limitation of stress echocardiography, with wall motion abnormalities developing late in the ischaemic cascade. Chapter 5 further advances the work of chapter 4, investigating the incremental diagnostic benefit of adding myocardial perfusion imaging to both standard and LVO for diagnosis of CAD, using a novel stress protocol (combining dipyridamole and exercise) to maximize acquisition and assessment of wall motion and perfusion images. We studied 70 patients planned for clinically indicated angiography, and 15 normal controls. Addition of contrast for myocardial perfusion (assessed qualitatively) to standard wall motion analysis and LVO significantly improved the diagnostic sensitivity for recognition of CAD and disease extent, with an insignificant reduction in specificity. This study provides further support for adding contrast to all stress echo studies, and demonstrates the diagnostic utility of assessing for ischemia earlier in the ischemic cascade, using technology with high spatial resolution. Another significant limitation of standard stress echo has been the qualitative nature of interpretation. Chapter 6 explores the use of a pure quantitative approach to stress echo, using myocardial contrast echocardiography. Stress MCE (using combined exercise-dipyridamole protocol) was performed in 90 patients undergoing angiography, with quantification of myocardial blood flow reserves for the left anterior descending and non-LAD coronary territories. Pure quantitative MCE was feasible and accurate for diagnosis of CAD, particularly in the LAD territory. Chapter 6 also investigates the contribution of dipyridamole to hyperaemia at the time of image acquisition in our protocol. A sub group of 18 patients from the study group were re-tested with exercise stress alone, and demonstrated significantly lower MBF reserve with exercise than with combined stress, enabling us to conclude that inclusion of dipyridamole was a critical component of the protocol. Patients with diabetes and no known coronary disease have been demonstrated to have impaired coronary flow reserve when tested invasively. Chapter 7 investigates whether this phenomenon is demonstrable with myocardial contrast echocardiography, and if present whether this impacts the accuracy of qualitative and quantitative MCE for diagnosis of CAD. MCE was performed in the LAD territory of 83 patients undergoing angiography for assessment of chest pain. Of these 28 patients had significant LAD stenosis (8 with DM) and 55 had no CAD (19 with DM). The presence of DM had no impact on qualitative interpretation, however quantitative MBF reserve was reduced in DM patients without CAD, significantly reducing test specificity, indicating caution should be exercised when using standardized cut offs for pure quantitative MCE to diagnose CAD in patients with DM The next chapter involves the application of quantitative tools to resting echocardiography. Clinical evaluation of reperfusion of the infarct related artery (IRA) following thrombolysis for ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is unreliable. Chapter 8 investigates the utility of resting quantitative MCE for prediction of angiographic flow in the IRA in 34 patients with STEMI going for angiography. In patients with STEMI, quantitatively derived myocardial blood flow was significantly lower in territories subtended by an artery with impaired (TIMI 0 to 2) flow than those territories supplied by a reperfused artery with TIMI 3 flow. A receiver-operator characteristic curve derived cut-off Q value of &lt;11.3, representing impaired myocardial flow, was 73% sensitive and 67% specific for TIMI &lt;3 flow at angiography, which was superior to standard clinical parameters. We concluded that quantitative MCE can predict impaired flow in patients with acute STEMI. Chapter 9 further explores the use of quantitative myocardial contrast echocardiography and other quantitative modalities for determination of myocardial function. The pathogenesis of the cardiac dysfunction in patients with DM and no CAD is controversial, but micro-vascular disease is suggested as a significant contributor. Patients with diabetes, normal left ventricular ejection fraction and no demonstrable myocardial ischemia have been demonstrated to have sub clinical LV dysfunction manifest as abnormal strain rate imaging (SRI) parameters. In Chapter 9 we examined the relationship between myocardial flow and function in type II diabetes. Stress MCE and resting SRI were performed in 48 patients (22 with type II diabetes mellitus and 26 controls), all with normal LV systolic function and no obstructive coronary disease by quantitative coronary angiography. The mean strain, SR and MBF reserve were all significantly lower in the diabetic group compared with controls, with diabetes the only independent predictor of each parameter. No correlation was demonstrated between MBF and SR (r=-0.10, p=0.54), or MBF and strain (r=-0.20, p=0.20) indicating that whilst micro-angiopathy and dysfunction coexist microvascular disease does not appear to be the predominant causative factor in this disease. In conclusion we have demonstrated the use of microbubble contrast agents with echocardiography enables accurate estimation of ventricular volumes and ejection fraction, with contrast enhanced 3-D echocardiography appearing superior to standard 3-D and contrast enhanced 2-D images. We have demonstrated the incremental benefit for diagnosis of CAD of adding contrast for LVO and perfusion to stress echocardiographic studies, and furthermore demonstrated that quantitative MCE is a tool with potential utility for diagnosis of CAD, as well as for recognition of infarct related artery flow in the setting of acute ST elevation myocardial infarction. Finally we were able to use quantitative MCE and also techniques for quantification of myocardial function to gain insight into the influence of diabetes on the microcirculation as well as the development of diabetes related myocardial dysfunction.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158593</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of Ring Exported Proteins in Plasmodium falciparum</field><field name="creator">Hawthorne, Paula Louise</field><field name="description">Despite many years of research, malaria remains a major public health problem with 300-500 million clinical cases and one to two million deaths per year. Malaria is caused by species of the protozoan parasite Plasmodium. Four species of Plasmodium infect humans but the most severe morbidity and mortality is caused by infection with Plasmodium falciparum. Development of new drugs and vaccines has been impeded by a lack of knowledge of basic parasite biology. Sequencing of the genome of the P. falciparum laboratory strain 3D7 was completed in late 2002 and many of the annotated genes were found to display no homology to other eukaryotic organisms. A major factor associated with the severe pathology observed with P. falciparum is the phenomenon of cytoadherence or sequestration, where infected red blood cells (RBCs) adhere to endothelial cells in the capillaries of all organs including the brain. It is generally accepted that P. falciparum sequesters to avoid clearance of infected RBCs by the spleen. This is a successful strategy for the parasite but deleterious to the host and this process can lead to severe syndromes such as cerebral malaria. The mechanism by which cytoadherence causes such severe pathology may have an immunological basis, be due to mechanical blockage of blood flow or a combination of both. RBCs are highly specialized cells lacking organelles and trafficking machinery. The parasite thus faces a unique challenge in infecting these cells and must set up its own trafficking machinery in order to import nutrients, export waste and insert parasitederived proteins on the surface of the infected RBC. Proteins involved in trafficking cytoadherence proteins and the proteins directly involved in cytoadherence on the surface of the RBC are all parasite-derived and therefore prime therapeutic candidates as they are unique to the parasite and so distinct from the host. A drug targeting cytoadherence, while not treating the actual infection, may reduce some of the severe pathology seen with P. falciparum infection. A vaccine that prevents infection is probably many years away so the possibility of treating severe symptoms of P. falciparum should be investigated. In addition, as it is accepted that P. falciparum parasites sequester to avoid clearance by the spleen; by preventing cytoadherence an infection may be cleared more efficiently by the host immune system. P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) is a parasite protein which has been found to be the major adhesion ligand for cytoadherence on the surface of the infected RBC. PfEMP1 is a unique parasite protein but it is encoded by a large gene family known as var and the parasite regularly exchanges the expressed var gene generating antigenic variation of the PfEMP1 protein on the infected RBC surface. Antigenic variation enables P. falciparum to avoid immune clearance and diminishes the usefulness of PfEMP1 as a drug candidate designed to prevent the severe disease caused by cytoadherence. However, proteins involved in trafficking cytoadherence proteins such as PfEMP1 to the surface are more attractive targets for chemotherapeutic intervention as they are less likely to be modulated by immune evasion mechanisms than parasite proteins located on the surface of the RBC. P. falciparum develops asexually within RBCs over 48 hours progressing from the ring stage, to the trophozoite stage and finally to the schizont stage, after which the infected RBC ruptures, releasing merozoite stage parasites that infect new RBCs. Cytoadherence and rapid growth of the parasite occurs in the later trophozoite and schizont stages. The ring stage lasts almost half the asexual cycle and is characterized by low metabolic and biosynthetic activity. The ring stage parasite is thought to modify the RBC during this &#147;lag&#148; phase in preparation for the rapid growth and cytoadherence observed in the later stages of infection of the RBC. Proteins encoded by genes transcribed in ring stages are therefore likely candidates with involvement in the trafficking of cytoadherence proteins to the surface of the RBC. Investigation of ring stage specific genes in recent years has demonstrated that many show no homologies to proteins in other organisms and in conjunction many are exported into the host RBC where they may play a role in trafficking and host cell modification. In this thesis the ability to grow and genetically manipulate P. falciparum in vitro has been used to investigate the role of novel genes transcribed in ring stages in the trafficking of cytoadherence proteins. It has been shown that a number of independent clones and isolates lose cytoadherence to C32 melanoma cells, presumably via the receptor CD36, after passage in culture. This loss of cytoadherence was mapped to a 55 kb region on the right arm of chromosome 9. Sequencing of the genome of 3D7 revealed there are thirteen genes located in this region. Gene expression profiling and northern blotting has revealed three genes located in the region of chromosome 9 linked to cytoadherence have ring stage specific transcription. This thesis describes the investigation of these three ring stage specific genes in the region of chromosome 9 linked to cytoadherence. All three of the proteins encoded by these genes are exported into the host RBC cytoplasm, with two of the proteins localizing to the Maurer&#146;s clefts. The Maurer&#146;s clefts are unique parasite derived membranous structures found in the infected RBC, they have been implicated in protein trafficking but their exact function has not been completely elucidated. Maurer&#146;s clefts are thought to be involved in the trafficking of PfEMP1, as PfEMP1 is observed to transiently associate with the clefts before reaching the infected RBC surface. Export of all three proteins beyond the parasite into the host RBC and localization of two of these proteins to the Maurer&#146;s clefts indicates they may have a role in trafficking parasite proteins in the infected RBC. Loss of these genes does not affect growth in vitro which may point to a specific role of these genes in trafficking cytoadherence proteins in vivo in P. falciparum. To date, database searching has revealed no homologs of these three genes in other species of Plasmodium or other organisms. The Maurer&#146;s clefts themselves are a novel organelle in terms of trafficking and investigation of these proteins in this thesis adds to the depth of knowledge about these unique parasite organelles. It is hoped that the work on these novel proteins encoded by genes transcribed in ring stages, which is described in this thesis, will further knowledge about the biology of P. falciparum and in the future may lead to the development of novel treatments for the severe pathology caused by cytoadherence.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158385</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of urban growth in the process of impoverishment of campesinos&#8217; households living in peri-urban areas: a case study in Mexico City</field><field name="creator">Mendez de Martinez, Yadira Mireya</field><field name="description">In the last 50 years, Mexico, like many other countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa, has experienced accelerated urban growth. Urban growth has been accompanied by an increase in urban poverty. While the spatial distribution of poverty in urban areas in Mexico is varied, new settlements that tend to grow in the peri-urban hinterland of cities are largely associated with poverty. This is because inexpensive, but mostly illegal, agricultural land (ejido or private) has been alienated to satisfy the demands of low income population for housing. The focus of this study lay in the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City (MAMC), which is the habitat of diverse low-income groups. Among those groups are the campesinos (people with rural background engaged totally or partially in agricultural livelihoods). Some studies have suggested that campesinos are very vulnerable to urban growth, since population expansion has put severe pressure on their agricultural land, which, despite its marginal value, is used to produce crops for either semi-commercialisation or subsistence. Although such research has showed how poor campesinos have engaged in non-agricultural activities to make a living and how land and their communities are threatened by urban growth due to speculative pressures on land and/or environmental deterioration, little is known about the impact of urban growth in the process of impoverishment of campesinos living in peri-urban areas. This study aims to understand how the growth of the MAMC affects poverty in campesinos&#146; households, in order to recommend directions for poverty reduction. Three villages in Chalco municipality, which is situated in the peri-urban fringe of Mexico City, were selected as the study area. Based on the development of a conceptual framework, this study considered three interconnected elements underpinning poverty: multi-dimensionality, complexity and dynamism. For this reason, the Sustainable Livelihoods approach was selected as an analytical tool, as it provided a flexible analytical framework that encompasses all those elements. The study is divided in three stages. In the first stage (namely documental investigation), a series of published and unpublished written materials were reviewed to determine how the growth of the MAMC transformed the nature and availability of resources in Chalco municipality from 1970 to 2000. This stage was followed by the empirical investigation that aimed to examine how those transformations affected campesinos&#146; assets (human, natural, physical, productive and social), the strategies they used to adapt to such changes, and how they perceived changes in poverty status. Accordingly, for this stage, quantitative and qualitative longitudinal and cross-sectional data were collected from 110 campesinos&#146; households living in the study area in 1997 and 2003 by using structured questionnaires. Qualitative data were also collected by using semi-structured interviews from 34 campesinos&#146; households in 2000. The final stage, called recommendations, involved the synthesis of the results of the documental and empirical investigations and suggests a series of directions for poverty reduction in campesinsos&#146; households in the study area. The documental and empirical investigations revealed that changes in asset ownership, between 1997 to 2003, depended on both transformation in the nature and availability of resources in Chalco and intra-household organization. Fundamental transformations in socio-demographic, economic, natural, physical and political/organisational resources of Chalco municipality were mainly, but not exclusively, associated with the growth of the MAMC. Climatic and physical characteristics of Chalco were also evident. To respond to such changes, campesinos implemented a series of strategies to get access to resources. Such strategies were based on campesinos&#146; needs, priorities and the portfolio of assets available, and their functionality. It was clear that campesinos depleted some existing assets to acquire urban assets and preserve their rural assets. In some instances, such strategies led campesinos&#146; families to satisfy their basic needs and, therefore, perceive themselves as non-poor. However, in other instances, such strategies prevented families from meeting their needs, leading them to the perception of being poor. The recommendation was made that in order to reduce poverty among campesinos in the study area, it was necessary to identify different alternatives to support their urban and rural assets and certain of their strategies that improve the wellbeing of individuals, families and communities and mitigate constraints to meeting their goals.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="subject">Poverty</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158594</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MODELLING GEOLOGICAL UNCERTAINTY FOR STOCHASTIC SHORT-TERM PRODUCTION SCHEDULING IN OPEN PIT METAL MINES</field><field name="creator">Jewbali, Arja Jogita</field><field name="description">Short-term scheduling manages the quality and quantity of ore to be processed given operational and access constraints. To deliver the forecasted project performance it needs to track the long-term schedule, which defines the extraction sequence that maximises project value. The effect of grade uncertainty on project performance has been well appreciated in the mining industry. Grade uncertainty has subsequently been modelled with conditional simulation, the outputs of which have been used in stochastic mine planning and optimisation. Generally, the simulated orebody models used in stochastic mine planning and optimisation have been based on the wider spaced exploration data, this while short-term scheduling is very much a factor of local deposit characteristics and geology represented by grade control information. However, grade control data is not yet available by the time short-term scheduling is done. This thesis presents an approach to short-term scheduling containing three components: (I) an approach based on sequential Gaussian co-simulation that allows for the simulation of future grade control data, that is, grade control data not yet available at the time production scheduling is done; (2) a second component based on conditional simulation by successive residuals (CSSR) that can update existing orebody models when new information becomes available. This will be used to update orebody models based on exploration data, which were used in stochastic long-term scheduling and optimisation with the in Step 1 simulated future grade control data; (3) a third component consisting of a stochastic integer programming formulation (SIP) that can take the update orebody models as input an generate an optimised short-term schedule. The first component in this approach to short-term scheduling is the generation of a simulation algorithm that can update already existing orebody models when new information becomes available. Conditional simulation by successive residuals (CSSR) allows for a separation of data influences through the column decomposition of the covariance matrix. The separation makes updating of existing orebody models possible by permitting a recalculation of only those influences that change when new information becomes available. Because only part of the calculations are redone for the update, CSSR offers a more efficient way of regenerating a set of simulations compared to assembling all existing and new information and repeating the entire simulation process. Three different implementations of the CSSR approach are generated and investigated using the Walker Lake data set. Their results are then benchmarked against the sequential Gaussian implementation (SGSIM) of the public domain software GSLIB. The first implementation, named Implementation A, is shown to be only successful in cases of high data density. When data density is low, artefacts occur and variogram reproduction suffers. The second implementation, Implementation B, makes only partial use of the new information available and hence generates updated realisations that do not differ significantly from the pre-update realisations. The third implementation, Implementation C, makes full use of the new information and generates updated realisations that clearly reflect this new knowledge. Reproduction of one and two-point statistics is shown to be excellent. All three approaches simulate clusters of grid nodes simultaneously, which adds computational efficiency. The updating capabilities (outlined above), however, need increased storage requirements compared to methods that do not perform updating. Runtimes for updating using Implementation C are in the order of 40-90% depending on the size of the field and the size of the node clusters. The worst update times occur when large fields are simulated using small node clusters. For large fields, the computational overheads lie on the data search and other operations compared to matrix calculations and the update algorithm offers very little improvement. The second component within the short-term scheduling framework is a methodology for simulating future grade control data, that is, grade control data not yet available. To this end a sequential Gaussian co-simulation approach based on exploration data is used to simulate future grade control information. The distribution and spatial correlation structure of the hture grade control data are derived from past grade control information. Because it is not physically possible to have exploration and grade control information available at the same location, the regular cross variogram cannot be used to infer the cross correlation between exploration and grade control data. Instead the pseudo cross variogram is used, which does not require collocated data for inference. The approach is tested on the Walker Lake data set and subsequently applied at the Sunrise Dam gold mine, WA. It is shown to generate simulated grade control data that display the characteristics, that is, distribution of past grade control information and the auto and cross correlation in Gaussian space. The third component within the short-term scheduling framework is a stochastic integer programming (SIP) formulation that maximises discounted cash flow while minimizing deviations from production targets. It takes as input a set of orebody models and produces a raw schedule hedged against all the input orebody models. The short-term scheduling framework has been applied at the Sunrise Dam gold mine, WA. First, the CSSR approach was used to generate a set of 20 simulated orebody models based on exploration data; next, the sequential Gaussian co-simulation method was applied to simulate future grade control information. Subsequently, the orebody models based on exploration data were updated using the simulated grade control information. The result is two sets of orebody models, one based on exploration data and one displaying local characteristics inherent in grade control information. A comparison of the grade tonnage curves for both sets of models shows that the models based on the simulated grade control information predict more ore compared to the exploration based models. Using both sets of orebody models, risk profiles are derived for the Sunrise Dam mine long-term schedule. Risk profiles generated with the exploration based models and the orebody models displaying grade control characteristics, indicate a shortage of ore compared to the target of 3.5 Mtpa. The MIK model indicates that it will generate a cumulative NPV of 497 million AU$, while the exploration based orebody models predict an expected cumulative NPV of 368 million AU$ and the orebody models based on grade control information 327 million AU$. Next, the exploration based models are input into the SIP formulations and used to derive the raw long and short-term schedules which are post processed to produce practical, feasible schedules in terms of equipment space and mining width. Both the raw and smoothed schedules fulfil the targets for grade (2-7 g/t) and ore production (3.5 Mtpa) and indicate a mine life of 4 years (2005-2008). Because the updated orebody models based on simulated grade control data are better able to define ore and waste, they are used to determine the feasibility of the derived exploration based schedule and are used to derive risk profiles for grade and ore tomes. The updated models indicate that if the exploration based schedules are used to mine the deposit, there is a 100% probability that the ore production will be higher than the target of 3.5 Mtpa and that the life of mine can be extended. Next, to define schedules that actually fulfil the set targets of grade (2-7 g/t) and ore production (3.5 Mtpa), the updated orebody models are used as input into the SIP formulation and the raw long and shortterm schedules are derived. These are also post processed to make them practical. The smoothed short-term schedule produces an expected cumulative NPV of 561 million AU$, which is 78 million AU$ (14%) more than generated by the smoothed exploration based short-term schedule. It also extends the life of mine to 5 years, well into 2009. This incorporation of local orebody information in the form of simulated future grade control data coupled with the use of a SIP formulation that can handle geological uncertainty has resulted in a production schedule that extends the life of mine and increases the total expected NPV to 561 million AU$. Recommendations for further work include adapting the SIP formulation to incorporate the practical aspects of mining such as equipment space, mining width, etc. Also, the CSSR algorithm should be investigated further to speed the updating component up.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158276</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Micro-Intonation and the viola: a study of just intonation, the pythagorean scale and equal temperament in relation to the performance of unaccompanied viola repertoire.</field><field name="creator">Garrett, Linda Catherine</field><field name="description">This discussion examines just intonation, the Pythagorean scale and equal temperament in relation to string playing and explores ways that intervals from these systems of temperament can be used to enhance the acoustic and expressive qualities of an unaccompanied performance on viola.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">750201 The performing arts (incl. music, theatre and dance)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158386</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drug Resistance in Trichomonas vaginalis and Giardia duodenalis</field><field name="creator">Wright, Janelle Marie</field><field name="description">Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection (STI) with an estimated 170 million new cases each year. T. vaginalis infections are often associated with other STIs including gonorrhoea, Chlamydia and syphilis and an increased risk of HIV transmission. Giardia duodenalis is transmitted via the faecal/oral route and is the most common intestinal protozoan parasite of humans. G. duodenalis is estimated to infect 280 million individuals annually, with high incidence rates recorded in developing countries, childcare centres and nursing homes where hygiene conditions are poor. Metronidazole (Mz) is the drug of choice for the treatment of T. vaginalis and G. duodenalis infections, but treatment failures and drug resistance are well documented. The increase in Mz-resistant (MzR) cases necessitates the development of new alternative chemotherapeutics and a better understanding of MzR mechanisms. Mz resistance in laboratory-induced Mz-resistant (MzLR) lines of T. vaginalis is caused by the down-regulation of hydrogenosome function. In these lines pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) and ferredoxin (Fd), the major proteins involved in Mz activation, are down-regulated. Similarly, Mz resistance in G. duodenalis is related to down-regulation of PFOR and Fd. However, the mechanism(s) of clinical Mz resistance in T. vaginalis is not understood, thus this study aims to identify these mechanisms. The true prevalence of Mz resistance is not known as trichomoniasis is not a notifiable disease but it is estimated that 5 % of all T. vaginalis isolates demonstrate some level of Mz resistance. Monitoring of Mz resistance in newly established T. vaginalis isolates collected from different regions of the world was a priority of this study and we demonstrated 54.5 % of isolates had some level of Mz resistance. These isolates were used to screen experimental drug compounds to identify potential drug resistance mechanisms, including biochemical pathways and transporters. Resistance to two of the most effective experimental compounds was induced in T. vaginalis and G. duodenalis, resulting in syngeneic lines. These lines were used in further drug susceptibility studies aimed at developing a better understanding of drug resistance. Resistance to Mz was induced in a highly clinical MzR (MzCR) T. vaginalis isolate to examine the effect upon its hydrogenosomes. Hydrogenosomes are down-regulated in MzLR T. vaginalis, as is associated enzymes and proteins, but using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) it was observed that the scaffolding of the intact hydrogenosome remains. TEM was used to determine that MzCR T. vaginalis have normally sized hydrogenosomes as compared to those observed in the MzS isolate and that its hydrogenosomes could be down-sized when the parasite was exposed to Mz for a prolonged period of time. These observations support the theory that an alternative mechanism of resistance is present in MzCR T. vaginalis. Protein expression differences in MzR and MzS isolates were observed, with many proteins up-regulated in the laboratory induced drug-resistant lines. Protein expression patterns were not uniform between MzCR T. vaginalis isolates. A protein in the membrane fraction of &gt; 200 kDa was observed in a MzCR T. vaginalis isolate. Nterminal sequencing identified this protein as a GAF-domain containing protein. GAF proteins are able to bind to multi-drug resistant proteins. This finding introduces an alternative mechanism to down-regulated hydrogenosomes for Mz resistance in T. vaginalis. The data presented in this thesis has important implications for the development of alternative chemotherapeutics to combat T. vaginalis and G. duodenalis and indicates new mechanisms of drug resistance in MzCR T. vaginalis. In addition, this body of work contributes to the better understanding of biochemical processes of these two medically important protozoa.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulated microgravity and the lumbo-pelvic musculature Development and application of novel analysis techniques and implications for lumbo-pelvic pain &#230;tiology</field><field name="creator">Belavy, Daniel Ludovic</field><field name="description">The presence of gravity throughout evolution has shaped the human body. The European Space Agency&#146;s &#147;Berlin Bed-Rest Study&#148; (BBR) offered a unique opportunity to researchers from The University of Queensland to study the effects of a lack of weightbearing (inactivity, unloading and/or sedentarism) on the lumbo-pelvic (LP) region. LP pain has been linked to a &#147;lack of muscular stabilisation&#148; and some authors have suggested a link between LP pain and inactivity. Furthermore, studies in bed-rest and microgravity have largely ignored the LP region, hampering the development of effective countermeasures. The muscular systems of the LP region are differentially involved in postural control and joint stabilisation. By its effect on the body and environment, gravity generates continual challenge to the central nervous system (CNS) for controlling the muscles of the LP region. As part of coping with this challenge, the CNS selectively recruits the deep (local) muscles to stabilise the joints with more task-oriented activation in the superficial (global) muscle systems. Concomitantly, the CNS exploits a number of motor control strategies: modulation ongoing (tonic) muscle activity and overall activation levels as well as anticipatory muscle function and co-contraction. Studies where the gravitational challenge is removed (bed-rest, spaceflight and related &#147;unloaded&#148; environments) show significant effects on the neuromuscular system. Greater atrophy of deep anti-gravity extensor muscles occurs. A &#147;down-regulation&#148; of anticipatory muscle activity occurs. Underactivity of the deep muscles with little change or overactivity in the superficial and flexor systems is observed. Tonic muscle contraction is inhibited and there is an increase in superficial muscle co-contraction. These findings bear parallels to changes observed in LP pain. Selective atrophy of the deep extensor muscles occurs. A delay of anticipatory muscle activity, especially in the deep muscles, is also observed. Superficial LP muscle overactivity and increased co-contraction has also been shown. Recent studies have also found a reduction in tonic muscle contraction in the deep systems. Importantly, however, there are distinct limitations in the quantification methods used to measure tonic and phasic muscle activity. The goals of this work were firstly to develop novel electromyographic quantification algorithms and secondly to examine the effect of bed-rest on the LP musculature; specifically in terms of muscle size (cross-sectional area, CSA), tonic and phasic muscle contraction, timing of muscle activity, activation levels and co-contraction. As part of the BBR, twenty subjects underwent 8-weeks bed-rest with 1-year follow-up. Ten subjects received a vibration exercise countermeasure, whilst the remaining ten were completely inactive. Non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging was used to study CSA changes in the deep and superficial muscles and superficial electromyography during a repetitive-movement task provided data on the motor control parameters. In addition to the development of novel analysis techniques, the key outcomes of this thesis were findings on the effect of bed-rest: (a) selective atrophy of the deep multifidus muscle (b) increased CSA of the LP flexor muscles, which appears to persist up to 6-months after bed-rest in the oblique muscles, (c) a shift from tonic to phasic muscle contraction in the superficial LP muscles, (d) a delay of LP muscle activation, (e) superficial LP muscle overactivity, (f) decreased co-contraction and, critically, (g) that a number of the changes persist up to the end of the 1-year follow-up period. Another important finding is that the vibration exercise countermeasure employed in the BBR prevented an overwhelming number of the changes observed in the inactive subjects. However, whilst reducing multifidus atrophy, it did not prevent it, and did not reduce lumbar erector spinae muscle atrophy. The significance of these results are that, firstly, it suggests the pattern of LP muscle and motor control change occurring in bed-rest is indeed similar to that observed in LP pain. This could suggest that long-term inactivity results in neuromuscular changes that reduce LP stabilization and increase risk of LP pain. Importantly, also, this thesis is the first detailed study of the LP musculature in bed-rest and provides information to space agencies necessary for the development of countermeasures. Furthermore, the vibration exercise countermeasure was in part effective in ameliorating the effects of bed-rest, and further steps can be taken for its optimization.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158387</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">WILDLIFE IS OUR GOLD: POLITICAL ECOLOGY OF THE TORASSI RIVER BORDERLAND, SOUTHWEST PAPUA NEW GUINEA</field><field name="creator">Hitchcock, Garrick</field><field name="description">This thesis is a critical ethnographic account of the Wartha people, a small group of hunter-horticulturalists living on the Torassi or Bensbach River, in the southwest corner of the Western Province of Papua New Guinea (PNG). This area is adjacent to the international border between PNG and Indonesia&#146;s Papua Province (West Papua). Since 1895, the mouth of the Torassi has anchored the southern border between New Guinea&#146;s colonial territories and their successor states. The Wartha experience of colonial and postcolonial developments has been shaped by their borderland status. Up until the 1960s, the Wartha had sporadic contact with outsiders and virtually no involvement in the cash economy. Subsequent state and capitalist encroachment has often attempted to manage or exploit the area&#146;s abundant wildlife, which Wartha have described as &#145;our gold&#146;. These engagements have led to social disruption, including conflicts over lands and resources, and the erosion of their moral economy. A political ecology perspective is employed to analyse the Wartha relationship with their dynamic, biodiversity-rich savanna environment, and their interaction with wider political and socio-economic systems on a remote, underdeveloped borderland. Past consideration of conservation and development in the area has focused on problems of distance, environment, economic resources, infrastructure and services. I argue that a detailed understanding of core aspects of Wartha society&#151;kinship and exchange relations, political leadership, and associated cultural orientations&#151; elucidates the nature of articulation with outside others. Contestation over resources, and landscape change, must also be understood with reference to the transboundary region in which these occur, a zone of engagement between two contiguous borderlands, enmeshed within wider polities and biophysical processes. The Wartha live on the periphery of the PNG state, and have limited involvement with wider markets. Nonetheless, articulation with capitalism on an Asia-Pacific borderland has resulted in deleterious social and environmental outcomes; developments that can be explained using a political ecology approach. In so doing, this thesis presents new insights on the Melanesian experience of modernity, and makes an anthropological contribution to the growing literature on border studies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158277</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heart failure in Australia: trends in determinants, incidence and survival</field><field name="creator">Najafi, Farid</field><field name="description">Background and aims: Heart failure (HF) is a common health problem worldwide. Despite its importance, the epidemiology of HF is incompletely understood. Frequent references to an &#145;epidemic of HF&#146; are at odds with recent reports of a decline in mortality from heart failure. In addition, reports based on admissions to hospital with a diagnosis of HF show that an earlier upward trend levelled off in the late 1990s in most developed countries. However, HF is a heterogeneous condition with multiple underlying causes. A decline in the severity of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), one of the major underlying causes of HF, and improvement in the treatment of patients with AMI as well as of hypertension are factors that might produce contradictory effects on the epidemiology of HF. Recent claims of a major contribution of improved survival after AMI to the reported epidemic of HF in the United States of America need to be examined in other populations. This thesis aims to define more precisely the epidemiological features of heart failure in Australia, and how these have evolved over the last decade. It examines secular trends in mortality, hospital admissions, incidence and survival related to HF. Methods: Trends in mortality from HF and admission to hospital with a diagnosis of HF are examined using computerized records of all deaths occurring in Australia for calendar years 1997-2003 and National Hospital Morbidity Data for financial years 1996-1997 to 2003-2004, obtained from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. A death or admission to hospital was defined as involving HF if at least one of the causes of death or one of the diagnoses of each separation was coded to any of the relevant rubrics within the International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) or 10th Revision, Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM). The analyses are based on age- and sex-specific death and hospital separation rates for HF either as underlying cause (or principal diagnosis) or mentioned anywhere on the death certificate (or recorded in any diagnostic position in the hospital electronic file) for each calendar or financial year. The investigation of trends in incidence and outcome of early-onset HF (HF complicating an index AMI within 28 days) and late-onset HF after AMI (HF developing 28 days after an index AMI) was based on the World Health Organization MONItoring trends and determinants of CArdiovascular disease (MONICA) register in Western Australia. The study included all residents aged 25-64 years of Perth, the capital city of Western Australia, who were admitted to hospital between 1988 and 1993 with non-fatal definite AMI and who had no history of AMI or HF in the hospital record. Trends in incidence and outcome of early- and late-onset HF were investigated using appropriate statistical methods. Results: From a total of 907,242 deaths occurring in Australia between 1997 and 2003, heart failure was coded as the underlying cause of death (UCD) for 29,341 (3.2%) and was mentioned anywhere on the death certificate in 135,268 (14.9%). Over this period, in both sexes, there were decreases in the absolute numbers of deaths and in the age-specific and age-standardized mortality rates for HF either as UCD or mentioned anywhere on the death certificate. HF was mentioned in 24.6% and 17.8% of deaths attributed to ischaemic heart disease and circulatory disease respectively, and these proportions remained unchanged over the period of study. In addition, HF as UCD accounted for 8.3% of deaths due to circulatory disease and this did not change from 1997 to 2003. From a total of 48,562,285 separations from hospital between 1996-7 and 2003-4, HF was coded as the principal diagnosis for 344,081 (0.8%) and was mentioned anywhere on the hospital record in 1,212,109 (2.5%). While the number of separations with HF remained stable, the age- and sex-standardized separation rate for HF recorded as principal diagnosis decreased from 2.0 per 1000 population in 1996-1997 to 1.7 per 1000 population in 2003- 2004. The corresponding values for HF recorded in any diagnostic position were 7.8 and 5.0 per 1000 population. From all patients (N = 4006) who met the criteria for first-ever, non fatal &#145;definite&#146; AMI in the Perth MONICA Register, 897 (22.4%) had early-onset HF complicating the index event. After adjustment for age and sex, the odds of developing HF declined by 13% (odds ratio for the period 1989-1993 relative to 1984-1988 = 0.87, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.75 to 1.01). After adjustment for age and history of diabetes and hypertension, the hazard of death in patients with early-onset HF (i.e. case fatality) declined by 26% (HR for the period 1989-1993 relative to 1984-1988 = 0.74, 95%CI: 0.57 to 0.96). Of 3109 patients who did not develop early-onset HF, 406 (13.1%) had at least one subsequent hospital admission with a diagnosis of HF (defined as late-onset HF). Following adjustment for age and sex, the hazard ratio for late-onset HF for the period 1989-1993 relative to 1984-1988 was 0.85 (95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.69-1.04). History of diabetes and hypertension, current smoking, length of initial admission for AMI, recurrent acute coronary syndrome and coronary artery revascularization procedures were predictors of late-onset HF. After a median follow-up of 3.2 years and adjustment for age (&#8805;70 years) and history of diabetes, the hazard of death in patients with late-onset HF did not change over the period of study (HR for year = 1.02, 95%CI: 0.98 to 1.06). Conclusion: For reasons discussed in the body of the thesis, the observed decline in mortality from HF measured as either number of deaths or rate probably reflects a real change in the epidemiology of HF. In addition, there was no increase in the number of hospital admissions involving HF and standardized rates of hospital separations fell in Australia between 1996 and 2004. These results do not support a major increase in the caseload of HF over recent years. In addition, a decline in the risk of early- and late-onset HF after AMI as well as all the evidence on decline in incidence and severity of coronary artery disease and hypertension argue against an increase in inflow from these two important risk factors of HF. However, taking all of the influences on the epidemiology of HF together, it is likely that because of the increasing number of older people, the number of new cases of HF will rise over the next few years, even if the incidence rate falls.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heart failure</field><field name="subject">mortality</field><field name="subject">hospitalization</field><field name="subject">acute myocardial infarction</field><field name="subject">incidence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158596</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motor control dysfunction of the shoulder muscles in throwers with shoulder pain: A basis for conservative management of shoulder pathology</field><field name="creator">Hess, Sally Anne</field><field name="description">The complexity of the shoulder&#146;s anatomy and biomechanics combined with the demands of overhead sport predispose the area to many pathologies. In addition to possible damage to the passive structures of the shoulder complex, patients with shoulder pathology and pain present with multifactorial problems of poor muscle control of the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints, along with limited flexibility in some of the soft tissues of the shoulder complex. Few studies have addressed the intricate role of the muscle system in joint control at the shoulder. This research aimed to evaluate the neuromuscular control and patterning of the force couples of the muscles of the shoulder complex in throwers with and without shoulder pain. Establishing alterations in the patterning of the muscles of the shoulder complex in these two groups, would give direction to preventative and rehabilitative exercise regimes. A reaction time task (RTT) of rapid internal and external shoulder rotation was developed to investigate the effects of pain on the activation patterns of the shoulder muscles in throwing athletes. A group of throwing athletes with shoulder pain was compared to a matched control group without shoulder pain during external rotation in sitting (ERS), external rotation in prone (ERP) and internal rotation in prone (IRP). This study demonstrated a difference in the temporal pattern of the shoulder muscles in the pain population. In the analysis of the glenohumeral muscle group, subscapularis was active significantly earlier than infraspinatus and supraspinatus in the control group for all three test procedures (ERS p=0.02; ERP p=0.039; IRP p=0.047). During external rotation in sitting and prone, subscapularis was activated significantly later when compared to the onset of infraspinatus in the pain group (ERS p=0.002; ERP p=0.013). In the group with shoulder pain, latissimus dorsi was active significantly earlier than the other torque producing muscles (ERS p&lt;0.001; ERP p=0.044; IRP p&lt;0.001). It is considered that the slower activation of subscapularis in the group with shoulder pain would impact on the stability of the glenohumeral joint, leaving the joint vulnerable to injury. It is proposed the early activation of latissimus dorsi in the pain group is an attempt by the central nervous system (CNS) to provide additional stability to the glenohumeral joint. The identification of a motor control dysfunction of the shoulder complex in athletes with pain provides additional insight into the complexity of stability mechanisms of the shoulder. Physiotherapy is a health profession based on the conservative management of musculoskeletal pathology with an emphasis on evidence based treatment techniques. This study gives a direction for rehabilitation and exercise for the shoulder complex and contributes to the development of an evidence base for physiotherapy practice.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158388</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variation in Great-Call Structure of Hybrid Gibbons in Central Borneo</field><field name="creator">Sanderson, Sunny Jane</field><field name="description">A study on the variation in great-call structure of hybrid gibbons (Hylobates agilis x H. muelleri) was conducted throughout the headwaters of the Barito River in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. A total of 88 females from 22 sites were recorded between September&#150; November, 2004 and May&#150; August, 2005. A detailed spectrographic analysis was made on 469 great-calls, which revealed that six of the 45 variables measured could accurately differentiate between agile and M&#252;ller&#146;s gibbons: (1) Number of great-call notes, (2) Great-call rate of emission, (3) Number of climax notes, (4) Climax rate of emission, (5) Mid-climax note duration, and (6) Inter-climax note interval. Of these, only the variable "climax rate of emission" could reliably distinguish between the calls of agile (n = 23 females), M&#252;ller&#146;s (n = 14 females) and hybrid gibbons (n = 51 females). A coefficient of variation indicated that intra-individual variation in great-call structure was low for each of the six variables. Non-parametric tests revealed that intra-population variation in great-call structure varied significantly (P&lt; 0.05). A discriminant function analysis found that great-calls could be correctly assigned to the individual that produced them at a rate higher than would be expected by chance (cross-validated classification rate: hybrid = 81.9%; agile = 54.4%; M&#252;ller&#146;s = 52.4%). There was a significant (P &lt; 0.05) level of inter-population variation in great-call structure. The cross-validated correct assignment rate was 94%, indicating that the agile, M&#252;ller&#146;s, and hybrid populations could be reliably distinguished by the two functions of the discriminant function analysis. One of the main variables in each of the two functions was "climax rate of emission". Within the hybrid population, females located on the western side of the hybrid zone had a slower climax rate of emission (mean = 2.07 notes/s) than those located on the eastern side (mean = 4.55 notes/s). This finding is likely due to a larger proportion of agile genes on the western side of the hybrid zone, and a larger proportion of M&#252;ller&#146;s genes on the eastern side. It appears that the average climax rates of emission on both sides of the hybrid zone have increased since last surveyed by Mather (1992), indicating that the rate of emission of hybrid great-calls is accelerating. There was a significant level of variation between mother-daughter pairs, one generally having a faster climax rate of emission than the other. It appeared that the regular participation of daughters in song bouts was to practice their own song, rather than learn that of their mother. Female neighbours also varied significantly in their call structure. The wide range of inter-individual variation indicates that great-call structure is inherited and not learnt. The hybrid zone appears to have increased in size since it was last surveyed (Mather, 1992). Fifteen of the 29 females recorded between the western side of the Busang River and the northern side of the Joloi River were hybrids. These females were sparsely distributed from the village of Parahau down to the northern banks of the Joloi River. They had a faster climax rate of emission (range = 0.67-4.89 notes/s) than the agile gibbons in the same region (range = 0.37-0.65 notes/s). It is likely that limited hybridisation has long been present in this region, but that hybrids have become more abundant than when last surveyed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158597</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using the floatability characterisation test rig for industrial flotation plant design</field><field name="creator">Coleman, Robert Gerald</field><field name="description">Flotation is the separation process most used to recover valuable minerals from sulphide ores. The design of industrial flotation plants is a complex process involving many stages. Current design practice involves performing laboratory scale grinding and batch flotation tests, followed by a circuit design based on the scale-up of the laboratory kinetics and recovery-grade data. A pilot plant is then operated to evaluate the performance of the circuit based on recovery and grade, usually in the configuration of the intended full-scale plant. The circuit design is refined and economically evaluated after which the design of the full-scale plant is performed. A new approach to full-scale flotation plant design has been proposed by the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre and the Mineral Processing Research Unit of the University of Cape Town, as part of the Australian Minerals Industries Research Association (AMIRA) P9 Project. In this new methodology, the effects of the ore on plant performance are decoupled from the circuit effects. The ore properties are characterised by operating the pilot plant in as simple a configuration as possible. The pilot plant units are configured to perform a similar duty (in terms of mineral content and particle size) to the full-scale operation and their response measured. An important factor in the success of the methodology is having a pilot plant that is capable of accurately characterising the ore properties. For this purpose, the Wemco&#174; Floatability Characterisation Test Rig (FCTR) was built. The FCTR is a self-contained, highly instrumented mobile pilot plant designed to develop and validate the new flotation plant design methodology. The aims of this thesis were to propose, develop and validate a methodology for using the FCTR to design industrial flotation plants. The hypothesis was that full-scale flotation plant design could be accurately performed using the P9 flotation model and modelling and scale-up methodologies, in conjunction with the FCTR. Test work was performed in three main areas: calibration of the ore characteristics and model parameters for the flotation model currently used by the AMIRA P9 Project; validation of the flotation model and modelling methodology; and prediction of full-scale plant performance using parameters determined on the FCTR. The ore floatability characteristics were calibrated using four FCTR circuits of increasing complexity. The ore floatability characteristics were determined for various models derived from data from one, two, three and four calibration circuits. Validation of the flotation model and modelling methodology was performed using three validation methods: internal validity tests, parameter sensitivity tests and predictive validation. From the internal validity tests, some of the models did not meet the validation criteria. The parameter sensitivity tests used Monte Carlo simulations to determine the sensitivity of the regressed model parameters. The tests produced small differences in the values determined from the models and the average values from the Monte Carlo simulations. The floatability characteristics appeared to be stable and unique. Predictive validation was performed using five FCTR circuits, different in configuration to the calibration circuits. The predictive validation was performed using the floatability characteristics determined from each of the calibration models, in conjunction with estimates of the model parameters. Overall, the predictions of the circuit performance were accurate and within experimental standard deviations for most streams in the circuits. The predictions of the key parameters of pentlandite and chalcopyrite recovery were accurate, especially for the final concentrate. The prediction of pyrrhotite recovery produced the largest errors. The prediction of pyrrhotite recovery appeared to be dependent on the addition of depressant to the cleaner and recleaner circuits of the circuit to be predicted. When the depressant addition rates were significantly different from those used in the calibration circuits, the prediction of pyrrhotite recovery was inaccurate. These errors were however reduced when experimental water recovery values were used. The extensive and robust validation of the flotation model and modelling methodology has shown that the flotation model and modelling methodology are valid under certain conditions. This test work represents the first comprehensive validation of the flotation model and modelling methodology incorporating changes in circuit configuration. Using the proposed modelling and scale-up methodology in conjunction with the FCTR, the metallurgical performance of three industrial flotation circuits were predicted. The predicted results were then compared to the experimentally determined results around the industrial circuits. In each case, a scale-up factor between the ore floatability characteristics determined on the FCTR, and the full-scale floatability characteristics, was required to achieve an accurate prediction. The scale-up factor ranged from 0.17 to 0.97 for the case studies investigated. In light of the results from each stage of test work, the proposed flotation plant design methodology was refined. With this methodology and the continual development of techniques for the measurement and prediction of the P9 flotation model parameters, accurate industrial plant design using the FCTR will become possible. With the addition of other unit operations, such as comminution, into the flowsheet, this methodology will eventually lead to the achievement of the ultimate goal of accurate plant design of green-field sites.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290702 Mineral Processing</field><field name="subject">091404 Mineral Processing/Beneficiation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158278</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Total Synthesis of Proposed Active Constituents in Echinacea. sp. and Chamaelirium luteum.</field><field name="creator">Matovic, Nicholas John</field><field name="description">Chapter one of this thesis contains a critical review of herbal medicine focusing on traditional medicine, active constituents, safety, quality assurance, efficacy and regulation of medicinal plant products, and the herbal medicine industry. A more detailed overview of Echinacea and False Unicorn products then follows, covering botanical descriptions, traditional and modern use, possible active constituents and documented biological activity. Chapter two describes the chemical synthesis of nine alkyl amides which occur naturally in Echinacea, which were required for use as authentic synthetic standards for quality control of Echinacea products. Their preparation was achieved by direct and flexible routes, with the aim of providing methodology for the convenient and cost effective preparation of these and analogous alkyl amides in research laboratories. These efficient syntheses relied upon robust methods for construction of subtly different unsaturated chemical moieties. Of particular utility was the development of an unprecedented methodology for preparation of methyl diynes, involving potassium tert-butoxide catalysed isomerisation of readily accessible terminal skipped diynes. The reagent Rieke zinc played a key role in the highly stereoselective cis-reduction of conjugated alkynes and was central to a practical synthesis of the two major alkyl amide components from Echinacea ((2E,4E,8Z,10Z)-N-isobutyldodeca-2,4,8,10-tetraenamide and (2E,4E,8Z,10E)-N-isobutyldodeca-2,4,8,10-tetraenamide). A short review of general methods for the cis-reduction of alkynes is also included in this chapter, and will be of use to synthetic organic chemists. Chapter three analyses the relative proportions of the two major alkyl amides in various E. purpurea and E. angustifolia extracts. This was achieved by concomitant use of GC/MS and synthetic alkyl amide standards. It was found that levels of the two major Echinacea. sp. alkyl amides fluctuate considerably within commercial preparations containing the species E. purpurea and E. angustifolia, which may help explain the differences in activity seen amongst Echinacea preparations. The identification of another alkyl amide 2E,4E,8E,10Z)-N-isobutyldodeca-2,4,8,10-tetraenamide), previously unreported to occur in Echinacea was also described. Chapter four describes the stereoselective synthesis of a steroidal aglycone which was crucial for determining the absolute C-23, C-24 stereochemistry contained within the major steroidal saponin previously isolated from False Unicorn (Chamaelirium luteum). The synthesis was accomplished in 16 steps from commercially available pregnenolone, after which it was shown that the synthetic 23R, 24S compound was spectroscopically identical to the natural material. Stereochemical assignments for the synthetic aglycone were then proven by X-ray crystallography. The key step in the synthesis involved the stereoselective introduction of the side chain at C-17 and C-20 utilising Anionic Oxy-Cope methodology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158598</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polyhydroxyalkanoate copolymer production from synthetic carbonaceous wastewater using glycogen accumulating organisms</field><field name="creator">Dai, Yu</field><field name="description">Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are polyesters produced and stored intracellularly as reserve materials for carbon and energy by a wide range of prokaryotic microorganisms under imbalanced nutritional conditions. PHA production by pure culture has been extensively studied, enabling high production yields and a variety of polymer characteristics. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB)-co-3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) (PHBV) has been commercially available under the trade name Biopol. However, the high production costs of these biopolymers are a major barrier for their widespread acceptance as substitute for traditional non-biodegradable polymers. The main costs are associated with maintaining the sterile conditions required by pure cultures, the use of expensive feed materials (eg. sugars) and also the polymer extraction process. Producing PHAs using mixed cultures (such as activated sludge) can drastically simplify the production process and significantly reduce the feed costs due to the use of cheap substrates. It also has the additional benefits in reusing waste materials. To date, substantial efforts have been put into improving PHA productivity in mixed cultures, with the characteristics of these bio-polyesters largely unexplored. The main product is typically PHB, which has several inherent deficiencies in properties. These include brittleness due to its high crystallinity, and thermal instability near its melting point of 175-180&amp;degC. To overcome the drawbacks of PHB, non-3HB monomer units are incorporated in the bio-polymerisation process, but this generally requires the addition of specific and often complex precursor substrates. Glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) are emerging as an attractive alternative to other heterotrophic PHA producers due to their special metabolism. GAOs were initially identified as competitors to the polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) in alternating anaerobic/aerobic wastewater treatment systems. Under anaerobic conditions, GAOs generate energy and reducing power from glycogen hydrolysis, which are used for taking up carbon sources (eg. acetate or propionate) and their synthesis into PHAs as intracellular storage products. Under aerobic conditions, the stored PHAs is partly oxidised for energy generation with the remainder used for biomass growth and glycogen replenishment. The anaerobic hydrolysis of glycogen yields both acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA which can be condensed to form 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and 3-hydroxyvaleryl-CoA, the precursors of 3HB and 3HV. Therefore GAOs are capable of producing multiple 3- hydroxyalkanoate (3HA) monomers even when only a single carbon source (eg., acetate) is supplied. The potential of producing copolymers without addition of particular monomer-relevant carbon sources provides GAOs an advantage over other mixed culture heterotrophs in terms of polymer quality. So far, two main bacterial species have been identified to display the GAO phenotype, namely, Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis (henceforth referred to as Competibacter) and Defluviicoccus vanus-related GAOs belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria phylum (henceforth referred to as DvGAOs). This thesis focuses on the PHA production by GAOs. The capability of GAOs to produce heterogeneous PHAs from a single carbon source is investigated by characterising the PHA products and optimising the polymer productivity. Moreover, DvGAOs are comprehensively studied for their ability to yield novel four-monomer copolymers of 3HB, 3HV, 3-hydroxy-2-methylvalerate (3HMV) and 3-hydroxy-3- methylbutyrate (3HMB) with controllable composition and favourable physical properties. The main contributions from this thesis are summarised below. The polymers consisting of 3HB, 3HV and minor amounts of 3HMV and 3HMB, produced by Competibacter-dominated GAOs using acetate as a sole carbon source, were identified to be true copolymers based on a detailed characterisation using &amp;sup1H and &#185;&amp;sup3C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The monomer sequence distribution analysis using a known polymer characterisation model suggests that these polyesters are mixtures of random copolymers and thus likely possess desirable properties for practical use, which was confirmed experimentally. This demonstrates that GAOs have a true potential for producing high-quality polymers from a simple and cheap carbon source. The PHAs produced by GAOs under anaerobic and aerobic conditions were characterized using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The acetate-derived copolymers possessed characteristics similar to those of commercially available PHBV products. The anaerobically produced PHA contained a relatively constant proportion of non-3HB monomers (30&#177;5 C-mol%), irrespective of the amount of acetate assimilated. In contrast, under aerobic conditions, GAOs only produced 3HB monomers from acetate causing a gradually decreasing 3HV fraction. The 3HV fraction thus obtained ranged from 7 to 35 C-mol%, depending on the amount of acetate supplied under aerobic conditions. The PHAs produced under solely anaerobic conditions featured lower melting points and crystallinity, higher molecular weights, and narrower molecular weight distributions compared to the aerobically produced polymers. However, the anaerobic production yield was limited at 28% of dry cell weight (DCW) due to the shortage of glycogen, while aerobic production obtained a maximum polymer content of 41% based on DCW. To increase the PHA yield from anaerobic production, a novel three-stage strategy was developed. It was demonstrated to be an effective approach to optimise both the quantity and quality of the copolymers produced by GAOs. Using the Competibacterdominated GAO culture, up to 48 wt% poly(3HB-co-3HV-co-3HMV) based on DCW was achieved from acetate as the sole carbon source, close to the highest copolymer yield reported to date produced by mixed cultures but using specific precursor substrates. The optimisation method comprised of an aerobic famine, an aerobic feast, and an anaerobic feast period. The glycogen storage was enhanced through the initial two aerobic periods and hence increased the energy and reducing power available for the final anaerobic polymer synthesis step. The terpolymers/copolymers thus produced displayed high molecular weights (380-460 kg/mol) with a narrow distribution range. A feeding strategy based on pH-stat was demonstrated to achieve the automatic control of feed addition. Using a highly enriched DvGAO mixed culture (95&#177;3%) copolymers of 3HB, 3HV, 3HMV and 3HMB with controllable monomer fractions were obtained from acetate and propionate substrates. Through manipulating the ratio of acetate and propionate in the medium, the 3HB and 3HMV monomer portions could be varied extensively (10 to 66 mol% 3HB and 2 to 41 mol% 3HMV). The microstructure study revealed that the PHAs produced were likely random copolymers or mixtures of random copolymers. These PHA products were demonstrated to possess favourable properties. The weight-average molecular weights were in the range 390-560 kg/mol, while the DSC traces showed melting temperatures in the range of 70 to 161 &amp;degC, glass transition temperatures between -8 and 0 &amp;degC, and melting enthalpies (&#916;Hm) between 9.1 and 31.5 J/g. The incorporation of considerable amounts of 3HMV and 3HMB constituents greatly lowered the crystallinity, potentially providing the ductile and tough materials required for many practical applications. The anaerobic metabolism of DvGAOs with acetate and propionate was found to be well described by the metabolic models previously proposed for GAOs and verified with experimental data obtained with other types of GAO cultures. The results suggested DvGAOs likely use metabolic pathways similar to those used by other GAOs for anaerobic acetate and propionate uptake. However, when both acetate and propionate were present simultaneously, DvGAOs took up these two carbon sources sequentially, with propionate uptake preceding acetate uptake. As a result, mixtures of 3HV&amp;3HMV-rich copolymers and 3HB&amp;3HV-rich copolymers were formed. Through model-based analysis, it was hypothesised that DvGAOs prefer propionate in order to maximise their production of PHAs with the same glycogen consumption, which would enhance their growth potential in the following aerobic period. This feature may explain the more efficient PHA production by DvGAOs with propionate as the carbon substrate compared to acetate. Despite very low acetate consumption when propionate was available in excess, the presence of acetate considerably stimulated the uptake of propionate in comparison to the case where only propionate was present. This was likely due to the difference of the intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level in the two cases. A lower intracellular ATP level detected in the simultaneous presence of acetate and propionate might stimulate the glycolysis process resulting in a higher propionate uptake rate. This thesis shows that GAOs have indeed a good potential as cost-effective PHA producers. They are able to efficiently generate true copolymers of up to four 3HA monomers with desirable properties from simple carbon sources. Through manipulating the feed composition, comonomer fractions can vary in a wide range resulting in a variety of polymer properties. The contribution from this work could be very useful for the current drive to cost-effectively produce good quality PHAs to replace conventional petrol-derived polymers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">279900 Other Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">779999 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158279</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanised Moriculture Production System</field><field name="creator">Anota, Loko</field><field name="description">Although, mulberry plants are grown in Australia as ornamentals or fruit, there are no data available or work done to assist in establishing a sericulture industry. This research conducted in Lockyer Valley in South East Queensland covered four areas of mulberry leaf production in identifying mulberry varieties and practices suitable for Australian conditions. The first trial involved identifying local mulberry varieties with desirable characters of high leaf yield, high protein content, high carbohydrate content and high moisture content; these are the characters desirable for sericulture production. Nine mulberry varieties consisting of Morus nigra, Morus alba and Morus macroura cv. Shahtoot, were identified as planting material in South East Queensland. Cuttings were raised in polybags in a glasshouse for 18 weeks. The plants of nine varieties (LV1 to LV9) were transplanted into the field on raised plastic mulch beds at a row by tree spacing of 4 m &#215; 2 m. A randomised block design and three replications was used. Irrigation and fertiliser were applied through a drip system. Three sets of data were recorded over the trial period. Harvest 1 was taken at 20 weeks after transplanting, Harvest 2 at 13 weeks after first pruning and Harvest 3 at 30 weeks after second pruning. The characters evaluated were leaf and shoot yield (fresh and dry weight), crude protein and carbohydrate (TNC) content, moisture content, growth rate, number of shoots, number of branches, stem diameter, longest shoot height, internode length, leaf size and shape, number of leaf lobe and 20 leaf weight. The number of branches, stem diameter, longest shoot height, internode length were measured on the longest shoot at harvest. Using Harvest 2 data, when leaves are normally harvested and fed to silkworms, varieties, LV5 and LV7, recorded higher fresh leaf yields (2.13 t/ha and 2.21 t/ha respectively), leaf moisture content (60% and 59%), and intermediate carbohydrate content (17.5% and 14.9%). Although both varieties, LV5 and LV7, recorded low protein contents (13.6% and 15.7% respectively), they were recommended for sericulture production based on overall performance. LV9, at Harvest 3 recorded high fresh leaf yield (5.6 t/ha), protein content (18.6%), carbohydrate content (12.5%) and moisture content (65%), therefore it was also recommended for sericulture production. The second trial involved five varieties Morus alba sp. (MA), Morus nigra sp. cathayana, Morus nigra sp. kanva (MK), Morus nigra sp. multicaulis (MM) and Morus nigra sp. (MN) imported from Indonesia. The trial set up, data collection and analysis were the same as in the first trial. Two sets of data, Harvests 1 and 2, were recorded over the research period. Varieties, MM, MK and MC were recommended for silkworm feeding based on leaf yield, protein content, carbohydrate content and moisture content. MM recorded the highest leaf yield (6.57 and 8.13 t/ha), followed by MK (3.66 and 4.79 t/ha) and then MC (3.43 and 4.54 t/ha) for Harvests 1 and 2. Moisture content for MM (68% and 75.1%), MK (71% and 77.5%) and MC (71% and 76.2%) were high at both harvests except for MM (68%) which recorded the lowest at Harvest 1. MM (17.5% and 15.5%) recorded the lowest at both harvests for protein content, whereas MK (17.8% and 18.9%) and MC (17.6% and 18.9%) maintained intermediate protein contents at both harvests. MK (18.1% and 15.5%) recorded the highest carbohydrate at both harvests while MM, in general, recorded intermediate carbohydrate contents. MC recorded intermediate and lowest carbohydrate content (13.8% and 12.7%) at Harvests 1 and 2 respectively. In general, MM, MK and MC showed characters which were higher than MA and MN, although MM recorded low protein content. The third trial looked at the effect of plant density on the main economic characters of mulberry plants. A local variety, LV1, was planted using six density treatments of row x plant spacing 0.6 m x 0.5 m, 0.6 m x 1.0 m, 0.6 m x 1.5 m, 4.0 m x 0.5 m, 4.0 m x 1.0 m, 4.0 m x 1.5 m using a strip plot design. Two sets of readings were measured over the research period. Harvest 1 occurred at 26 weeks after first pruning and Harvest 2 at 37 weeks after the second pruning. The 4.0 m x 0.5 m spacing treatment (5,000 plants/ha) was recommended for sericulture practice because leaf yield was high (2541 kg/ha and 4274 kg/ha) at Harvests 1 and 2, protein content was highest (19.7% and 19.1%) at both harvests, carbohydrate content was lowest (14.1%) but second highest (20.2%) at Harvest 1 and 2 respectively. Moisture content was highest (59.9%) and low (61.4%) at Harvests 1 and 2. The fourth area of study involved designing, developing and testing a mechanical mulberry leaf harvester. The harvester consisted of a reel, reciprocating cutting knife, conveyor, hydraulic system, lift mast, collection bin and support frames. The harvester was supported at the tractor&#146;s three point linkage and operated by the tractor&#146;s hydraulics. The harvester was field tested on 14 and 20 week mulberry plants, planted at 1 m apart and at row spacing of 4 m. Harvesting operations were performed at three tractor forward speeds (1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 km/h) in combination with reel, cutting knife and conveyor speeds. It was observed that all mulberry plants within the effective cutting area (100% cutting efficiency) were harvested at the three forward speeds. The collected yield ranged from 0.63 t/ha to 2.25 t/ha, collection efficiency ranged from 65% to 93% and damaged shoots ranged from 9% to 34%. New shoots budded and grew from all the harvested shoots (damaged and undamaged). The four trials showed that local varieties LV5, LV7, and LV9 together with imported varieties MC, MK and MM produced high leaf yield, protein, carbohydrate and moisture content. A 4 m x 0.5 m spacing (5000 trees/ha) treatment showed high values for the desirable characters, therefore the six high production varieties as well as the 4 m x 0.5 m spacing arrangement are recommended for sericulture production in Australia. Also the mechanical leaf harvester which showed satisfactory performance can be utilised to minimise labour costs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158389</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Existence of Solutions to Continuous and Discrete Boundary Value Problems for Systems of First-Order Equations</field><field name="creator">Mohamed, Mesliza</field><field name="description">In this thesis we investigate the existence of solutions to boundary value problems (BVPs) for nonlinear systems of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and difference equations. The thesis is divided into two parts. Part one is devoted to the study of difference equations where two types of problems are studied. First, we derive the existence of solutions to first-order systems of difference equations that arise when one applies the trapezoidal rule to approximate solutions of second-order scalar ODEs. Strict discrete lower solutions are used with maximum principle arguments in the discrete problem to obtain a priori bounds on solutions. The a priori bounds on difference quotients for solutions of the discrete problem are obtained from the Bernstein-Nagumo condition. We use homototopy to find solutions of the discrete amroximations. Second, motivated by Ma [60] we consider existence and uniqueness of solutions to difference equations which arise as discrete approximations to three-point BVPs for systems of first-order ODES after employing the Euler method. Several existence and uniqueness results for three-point BVPs are established, using the contraction mapping theorem and the Brouwer fixed point theorem in Rn. In part two, two types of problems for systems of first-order ODES are analyzed. First, we study the existence of a unique solution to a system of first-order differentia1 equations under multi-point BVPs with nonlinear boundary conditions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions for a system of first-order three-point BVP under which the properties of linear three-point BVP are preserved under small nonlinear perturbations of both the differentia1 equation and the boundary conditions. The method of proof of the existence of solutions using the Banach contraction mapping principle is similar to that used by Rodriguez [75], who studied the discrete analogue of this BVP. Second, motivated by Cronin 120,211 we investigate the existence of solutions to three-point BVPs in perturbed systems of first-order ODEs at resonance where the associated homogeneous linear problem has nontrivial solutions. Based on the second part of the investigation of three-point BVPs in perturbed systems of first-order ODEs at resonance, four different results were obtained: (i) The existence of solutions via a version of the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem which is due to Miranda. (ii) The existence of solutions to the problem through the application of the Implicit Function Theorem. These two results extend the work of Feng and Webb [34], and Gupta [39] for the problems at resonance in Euclidean 2-space. (iii) Existence results for three-point BVPs at resonance for general BVPs through the application of Brouwer degree theory; we show the degree is non zero through the application of Borsuk's Theorem for one problem and through a result of Cronin involving pairs of polynomials in two variables whose terms of highest order have no common factors. (iv) The existence of solutions to the entrainment of frequency problem in Euclidean 2-space. We will investigate conditions under which entrainment of frequency for three-point as well as two-point BVPs by adapting the work of Cronin in periodic case. We will describe such conditions and then show the degree is non zero through a result of Cronin involving pairs of polynomials in two variables whose terms of lowest order have no common factors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158600</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding Continuing Professional Learning</field><field name="creator">Webster-Wright, Ann</field><field name="description">Continuing to learn is universally accepted and expected by professionals and other stakeholders in professional practice. However, despite changes in undergraduate professional education in response to research findings, most continuing professional development (CPD) practices focus on delivery of content rather than on learning. Professional development still largely consists of brief, didactic episodes, often separated from practice or ongoing support. In exploring reasons for the lack of significant change in support for continuing learning, scant research was found about how professionals experience learning through their working lives. This study explores how allied health professionals learn in the current changing work context. The aim of the study is to enhance understanding about continuing learning so that support for professionals can improve. The findings have implications for learning in health and other professions. Using a phenomenological framework, continuing professional learning (CPL) is conceptualised in this study as part of the professionals&#146; lived experience of everyday practice. This conceptualisation challenges the problematic way in which much previous research views professional knowledge as a commodity that can be transferred and accumulated, separate from the professionals&#146; working context. Rich and diverse descriptions of learning were gained from interviews with sixteen therapists, contextualised through worksite visits, network meetings and relevant policy documents. These data were analysed using Giorgi&#146;s empirical phenomenological methodology. A key finding of this study is the identification of significant dissonance between the reality of the professionals&#146; experiences of learning and the rhetoric of stakeholders&#146; expectations about professional development. The main focus of previous research, on the implementation and outcomes of CPD activities, fails to acknowledge the complex, diverse, multifaceted and idiosyncratic nature of professional learning experiences. Professional responsibilities with respect to CPD are linked to supervision of standards, monitoring of accountability and promotion of evidencebased practice. As this study clearly reveals, the participants are enthusiastic learners who take these professional responsibilities seriously, but consider that their continuing learning is richer than this narrow CPD interpretation. The findings are reported in two phases. The first describes commonalities across diverse experiences of CPL, in terms of four inter-related constituents: understanding, engagement, interconnection and openness. Within the complexity of descriptions of CPL, tensions are revealed, particularly between the openness and uncertainty of learning, and the constraints and regulation of context. How tensions are resolved depends on each person&#146;s way of being a professional, so that each professional&#146;s learning has a unique quality permeating what is essentially a shared experience. The second phase of the findings draws on phenomenological philosophy to interpret the shared experience of CPL. The key argument of this phase is that the dissonance between rhetoric and reality in CPL is largely hidden from public discourse, being mainly voiced between professionals in supportive environments. It is argued that the hidden nature of this dissonance is one reason for the lack of significant change in CPD practices, in that few professionals publicly question CPD practices or the current context for learning. Within the usual CPD discourse, learning is viewed in epistemological terms as change in professional practice knowledge, with the professional viewed as deficient and in need of developing. In this study, the ontological dimension of CPL is highlighted, in that who the professional is shapes and directs what and how the professional learns. The ontological dimension of learning and the impact of context on learning are overlooked in most CPD practices. It is important that learning providers are cognisant of the complex, diverse nature of CPL so that innovative ways of supporting professionals to learn can be encouraged. Although CPL can&#146;t be controlled, it can be supported, so that professionals can continue to learn in their own authentic way, whilst taking into account the expectations of their working contexts. In seeking a balance between responsibility and agency in CPL, a framework of &#147;Authentic Professional Learning&#148; is proposed as congruent with, and supportive of, professionals&#146; experiences of learning, yet cognisant of the realities of the workplace with respect to accountability. Constructive strategies are developed from this framework to enable change from the current practice of CPD to that of authenticity in CPL. This study integrates, empirically confirms and extends research in higher education, workplace learning and adult education. The contribution made to understanding and supporting CPL is both theoretical and practical. Furthermore, demonstration of the value of a phenomenological framework as an alternative approach to researching continuing learning makes a methodological contribution to research in this area.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158280</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Randomised Cluster Study of an Intervention Aimed at Improving the Health Outcomes of Adults with an Intellectual Disability</field><field name="creator">Lennox, Nicholas</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321212 Care for Disabled</field><field name="subject">730301 Health education and promotion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158390</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE ROLE OF FLUENCY IN MATHEMATICAL DEVELOPMENT: FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH EARLY LEARNING DIFFICULTIES IN MATHEMATICS</field><field name="creator">Finnane, Maureen Kathryn</field><field name="description">This thesis explores factors associated with the development of early learning difficulties in mathematics from two perspectives: issues relating to mathematics development and early mathematics education, and models of memory and information processing. A principal aim of the research was to better understand the puzzling question of why a significant number of students with otherwise good reasoning capacity are unable to develop efficient, effective strategies for solving basic number combinations. The very poor mathematical understanding and skills of students who have been described as mathematically disabled (MD) or as having an arithmetic learning difficulty (ALD) or mathematical learning difficulty (MD) have been described in the research literature over a period of thirty years. The profile of the characteristics of MD students is well established, having been described with a consistent prevalence of 6-8% students in several countries. In spite of having average conceptual understanding in some areas of mathematics, these students face an outstanding difficulty in mastering basic arithmetic facts (Ginsburg, 1997), and continue to use very slow and ineffective strategies for solving even basic arithmetic problems, usually reliant on counting-by-ones finger strategies. More recent accounts of MD students also emphasize their poorly developed number sense and estimation skills. The development of effective interventions for mathematical learning difficulties is complicated by the fact that there are no distinctive diagnostic measures available for identifying MD (Geary, 2004). Furthermore, there are now strong indications that there are at least two distinctive forms of MD, with different instructional needs (Jordan, Hanich &amp; Kaplan, 2003; Fuchs, Fuchs &amp; Prentice, 2004). Accordingly, one goal of this thesis was to identify significant predictors of early mathematical learning difficulties, as a guide to identification and intervention. Based on previous research exploring factors associated with MD, a comprehensive range of assessment measures was administered to 68 children in three Year 2 classes in metropolitan Brisbane, Queensland. The measures included detailed assessments of mathematical skills and understanding, and a range of memory and processing tests, to capture underlying factors constraining early mathematical learning. Children at risk of early mathematical difficulties were identified by a statewide process of diagnosis in Queensland administered in the second year of formal schooling, known as the Year 2 Diagnostic Net (Numeracy). In view of the high rate of comorbidity of mathematical and literacy learning difficulties, data were also collected about which students failed the Year 2 Diagnostic Net (Literacy). For the same reason, the children&#146;s speed of naming symbols, letters and words was measured at the same time as their fluency in identifying numbers. To understand better the nature of their learning difficulties, diagnostic teaching sessions were undertaken with ten of the students caught in the Year 2 Net (Numeracy), whom their teachers perceived as most in need of intensive learning support. In addition, an assessment and intervention were conducted with a Year 4 student at one of the study schools, who was facing significant mathematical and literacy learning difficulties. The study showed that forwards counting fluency and stage of strategy development (SEAL) on the Learning Framework in Number (Wright, Martland &amp; Stanger, 2000) in the beginning of Year 2 were significant predictors of being caught in the Year 2 Net (Numeracy) at mid-year. Net status was also predicted by a student&#146;s performance on the Make 10 test, a novel task designed by the researcher to assess fluency in retrieval of Ten Fact combinations. As well as the level of strategy use (SEAL), a student&#146;s level of identification of written numerals was a further significant predictor of performance at the end of Year 2 on I Can Do Maths (Doig &amp; de Lemos, 2000), a standardized test of early knowledge of Number, Measurement and Space concepts. The importance of identification and intervention for students at risk of MD was indicated by the increasing gap in performance between Net and normally achieving students on I Can Do Maths by the end of Year 2. The speed of processing of particular numerical skills were shown to be important indicators of early mathematical learning. Net students were significantly slower than their normally achieving peers in identifying 2-digit numbers on the CAAS 2-Digit task, and were slower on all the PAL rapid automatised naming RAN tasks - RAN Digits, Letters, Words, Words &amp; Digits (Berninger, 2001). Fluency in rapidly naming and switching between 2-digit numbers and familiar words, as measured on the RAN Words &amp; Digits task was also shown to be a significant predictor of performance on the One Minute Basic Number Facts Test of Addition. The level of Highest Forward Digit Span and poor performance on a working memory Counting Span task significantly discriminated between Net and normally achieving students. Information processing models and models of working memory provide useful explanatory frameworks to account for particular error patterns, and for the characteristic failure of MD students to learn basic arithmetic facts. Insights from the mathematics development and mathematics education literature add to our ability to understand the early impasse in learning of students at risk of MD. Work samples from diagnostic teaching sessions with five of the Intensive Net students further illustrate the influence of a low stage of counting fluency and strategy use on a student&#146;s self-perception and ability to access the Year 2 mathematics curriculum. Processing strengths and weaknesses are discussed in relation to possible effects on the students&#146; mathematical learning. The detailed case study of the Year 4 student demonstrates how a researchbased intervention, which took into account cognitive factors, was successful in enabling learning of arithmetic facts and markedly changing the motivation and confidence of a student who was formerly very resistant to mathematics instruction. In particular, increased counting fluency and automatisation of addition facts appeared to free working memory resources for monitoring and self-correction by the student, and to facilitate a positive interest in exploring mathematical relationships. Based on the significant predictors of poor achievement in early mathematics, assessment measures are proposed which are critical for the identification of early mathematical learning difficulties. The thesis concludes with a number of recommendations for intervention, with accompanying requirements for pre-service and in-service training to assist effective implementation. Future directions for research in the identification and intervention of MD are proposed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158601</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Road trauma related facial injuries and their management in Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Batstone, Martin Druce</field><field name="description">Introduction -- Road traffic accidents cause severe facial injuries and are frequently associated with injuries to other organ systems. The aims of this study were to define the patient population who suffer facial injuries in road traffic accidents in Queensland, Australia and examine the course of their treatment from injury through to rehabilitation with specific reference to treatment delays. The study also aimed to examine the nature of facial and other organ system injuries suffered by victims of road trauma and assess the need for a multidisciplinary approach to their management. Methods -- A retrospective study of all patients over 14 years of age suffering facial injuries over a five year period was conducted at two tertiary referral trauma hospitals in Queensland, Australia. Data was collected on demographic and treatment details, the nature of their facial and other injuries and the impact of interspeciality management on their treatment. In addition a separate study was performed on paediatric dentoalveolar trauma presenting to a tertiary referral hospital in an attempt to more accurately define the nature of treatment delays. Results -- Four hundred and nine patients were identified. Young adult males were the most commonly injured group. Delays in transfer were common and caused a delay in the management of the patients&#146; facial injuries. There were deficits in patient assessment and the ordering of appropriate investigations. The midface was injured more frequently than the mandible and the majority of patients had multiple facial injuries. Patients with multiple facial injuries were more likely to have injuries to other organ systems. Neurologic, orthopaedic, thoracic and abdominal injuries were common and impacted on the management of the patients&#146; facial trauma. The recording of post treatment outcome was poor. In the study on children with dentoalveolar trauma there were significant but reducible delays in the management of their injuries relating to both the patient&#146;s transport and their hospital assessment and management. Discussion -- The identification of young adult males allows a clear target for preventative measures. Education of staff in peripheral hospitals and the enhanced use of telemedicine facilities may help to streamline patient transfer. Road traffic accidents cause more severe facial trauma than other mechanisms of injury. Other organ systems are more likely to be involved. Head injuries, abdominal and thoracic injuries and orthopaedic trauma were common amongst the patients in this study and those with more severe facial injuries were more likely to have concomitant injuries. The management of other organ systems often impacts on their facial injury treatment demanding high levels of inter-speciality cooperation. The post treatment outcome recording and referral to rehabilitative services need to be improved.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158391</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical Activity in Children with Physical Disabilities: Factors Influencing Participation and Functional Outcomes of Participation.</field><field name="creator">Svensson, Lee</field><field name="description">The benefits of physical activity participation are greater for children with physical disabilities compared with able-bodied children because these children have the potential to gain not only the same health benefits of participation as their able-bodied peers but also specific benefits related to their condition. Research in this area is particularly limited, however theoretically physical activity participation may intervene in a cycle of disuse which often leads to de-conditioning, secondary health complications and further decreases in physical function for children with physical disabilities. Despite these potential benefits, children with physical disabilities have low levels of physical activity participation and perform less physical activity than their able-bodied peers. To improve these participation levels the factors that influence participation need to be understood. Study Number 1 in this thesis investigated the factors that influence the physical activity participation of children with physical disabilities. A pilot study determined that the best method for gathering the data was through the use of semi-structured interviews. Therefore, 14 children (ranging in age from 8 to 16 years of age) with physical disabilities, including spina bifida, cerebral palsy and acquired brain injury, were interviewed to examine factors influencing physical activity participation, from the child&#146;s perspective. The interviews were tape recorded, later transcribed verbatim and analysed by identifying core themes which recurred frequently in the data and linked the data together. This qualitative analysis resulted in the identification of nine factors. The most noteworthy of these factors were: availability of skilled and knowledgeable leaders; school practices that influence physical activity participation; peer acceptance or rejection, and; desire to be physically active and/or attitude towards physical activity. It was concluded that the identified factors could positively inform the development of future strategies or interventions to increase the physical activity participation of children with physical disabilities. Study Number 2 in this thesis, used the results of Study Number 1 as a guide for developing an effective short-term intervention program for a specific group of children with physical disabilities. As mentioned earlier, research in the area of the outcomes of physical activity participation for children with physical disabilities is limited. Therefore, the provision of evidence for the benefits of physical activity participation for this group coupled with the results of Study Number 1 may enable appropriate bodies to act upon the need to increase physical activity participation for children with physical disabilities. Consequently, the aim of Study Number 2 was to determine a disability-specific benefit of physical activity participation, improved physical functional ability, for children with physical disabilities. Study Number 2 was a prospective nonrandomised control study where the intervention was an 8 week progressive resistance training program instructed by an Exercise Physiologist. Subjects (manual wheelchair users with spina bifida, aged from 10 to 17 years of age) chose to be either in the Intervention Group (IG; n = 8, who participated in the twice weekly individualised program) or in the Usual Care Group (UCG; n = 9). Parameters of upper body muscular strength and physical functional ability (measured by three wheelchair propulsion tests and the mobility domain of the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory {PEDI}) were measured prior to the commencement of the intervention period and following the completion of the intervention period. The changes in the measurement parameters pre-test and post-test, within and between groups were calculated, and paired t-tests were performed, to determine the outcome of the intervention. Significant increases in upper body strength of up to 75.6% (p &amp;lt 0.00005) for the IG compared with the UCG following the intervention were found. However, the results of the physical functional tests were not as conclusive. There was no change in the mobility domain of the PEDI following the intervention however, a significant improvement in the time to complete one of the wheelchair propulsion tests by the IG was found. It was concluded that further research into the strain of wheelchair propulsion during various activities of daily living and other aspects of physical function of children with physical disabilities following a physical activity intervention is needed. In summary, this thesis established a list of factors that influence physical activity participation of children with physical disabilities that can inform future intervention strategies to improve physical activity participation levels of this group. Additionally, this thesis confirmed previous evidence for increasing the strength of children with physical disabilities through participation in a progressive resistance training program. And finally, this thesis demonstrated a clear trend for improving physical functional ability by participation in resistance training and provided new methodological ideas for the application of a future successful intervention to clearly define the ability of progressive resistance training to increase physical functional ability in children with physical disabilities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158281</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EQUINE RESPONSES TO FEAR-PROVOKING STIMULI: IMPLICATIONS FOR FERAL HORSE MANAGEMENT</field><field name="creator">Joseph, Sarah Danielle</field><field name="description">From a holistic perspective, the research that comprises the body of this thesis was conducted in an attempt to integrate rigorous ethological methodology with the management of an invasive species, the feral horse (Equus caballus). Specifically, a series of experiments was conducted in order to compare relative response, measured through behavioral and physiological indicators of fear, to a variety of potential feral horse repellents. Additionally, these indicators were used to aid in identifying aspects of feral horse management that might be of particular welfare concern. Chapter 1 serves as a general introduction to feral horses as an invasive animal in Australia and outlines the reasons for managing them. It also provides an overview of the social climate and ethical debate surrounding Australian feral horse management. An awareness of these issues is critical in understanding the constraints placed on current management and the need for innovation in future management. Relevant literature is reviewed in Chapter 2. The multidisciplinary aspects of this thesis require a broad consideration of equine behavior and invasive animal management. In particular, a paucity of research on both repellents for use in feral horse management and the equine fear response is highlighted. The experiment discussed in Chapter 3 used a novel, highly repeatable design to measure changes in heart rate and behavior in restrained, domesticated horses in response to presentation of a range of auditory, olfactory, and visual stimuli. This was done in order to assess the relative potential effectiveness of fear-provoking stimuli as repellents for feral horses. A total of 23 repellents were presented to three groups of four mares. Significant differences (P&lt;0.05) in response were found at both the category (olfactory, auditory, and visual) and individual stimulus level. In particular, the auditory stimuli caused a greater increase in heart rate and defecation rate than either visual or olfactory stimuli. Visual stimuli caused a higher heart rate response than olfactory stimuli as well. These findings may have significance for feral horse management, as most commercially available herbivore repellents are olfactory or taste-based. Further testing of best candidate repellents (Chapter 4) was carried out on 12 young, unbroken domesticated horses in open-field tests in order to examine the relationship between fear and repellency. Additionally, this trial was conducted to verify the results of the previous experiment. Changes in heart rate and behavior were measured in response to conflicting motivation caused by the presence of a food reward and the introduction of a potentially fearprovoking stimulus. At the category level, horses demonstrated a stronger avoidance of auditory stimuli than either visual or olfactory stimuli, and in general were more hesitant to approach visual stimuli than olfactory stimuli, reflecting the fear response measured in the previous experiment. Category specific behavioral patterns were observed, suggesting that different types of stimuli might have different applications as repellents. The accuracy of using a domesticated horse model to predict feral horse response to novel visual stimuli is explored in Chapter 5. A total of six foals in two groups were tested in a familiar environment. One group consisted of foals that had been removed from a feral population, while the second group contained foals that had been bred and raised in captivity. A silhouette of a lioness and an observer waving a flag were positioned in front of a food reward, and data on time to approach and consume the feed were recorded. While feral foals initially took longer to approach and consume feed, their response was not significantly different (P&lt;0.05) from the domesticated foals by the third day of testing. This indicates that while the degree of responsiveness may vary between domesticated and feral horses, their pattern of habituation to fear-provoking stimuli will likely be similar, suggesting the potential suitability of using domesticated horses as models for feral horses in future research. A final experiment was conducted on 12 young, unbroken domesticated horses (Chapter 6) in order to investigate the effects of group dynamics and familiar environment on the relative efficacy of olfactory, visual, and auditory stimuli. Horses were tested in 3 groups of 4, and were presented with one repellent from each category. Groups were significantly more likely to approach a food reward within 30 seconds of its presentation when no stimulus was present (P&lt;0.05), and tended to take longer to consume feed in the presence of a stimulus. However, differences between the three stimulus categories, in terms of approach and feed consumption data, were not significant. Overall approach and consumption time was short, perhaps due to experimental design, indicating a need for further testing of feral horse repellents in a field situation to be carried out. In Chapter 7, several phases of a current feral horse management operation were observed and assessed for relative humaneness. Insights into the equine fear response, which had been acquired from previous experiments, were used to help identify areas of particular welfare concern and to make recommendations for possible improvements. In particular, the presence and proximity of humans to captured horses, and the order in which horses are destroyed, should be given special attention by managers. Because opportunities for scientists to observe feral horse management operations, particularly those involving lethal control, are rare, it is especially important that observations such as these be reported. It is hoped that my recommendations may provide a foundation for future assessment of relative humaneness involved in feral horse management. In summary, the studies reported on in this thesis suggest that fear does indicate a degree of repellency, and that it may be possible to rapidly screen a number of potential repellents on domesticated horses before carrying out costly field trials. However, high motivation to enter an area or consume a food source may greatly reduce the effectiveness of repellents in a field situation, and further testing is required to assess this. Finally, by examining the psychological stressors involved in a range of management techniques, it is possible to improve the welfare of managed feral horses.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158392</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SURFACE MODIFICATION USING AMPHIPHILIC DIBLOCK COPOLYMERS FOR TISSUE ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS</field><field name="creator">Setiawan, Laurentia Eka Kristanti</field><field name="description">Surface modification of biomaterials is becoming an increasingly popular method to improve device biocompatibility, functionality and mechanical properties. Amphiphilic block copolymers have been utilized for many applications based principally on their ability to self assemble within the bulk and at interfaces into regular nano-meter scale patterns. The self-assembled patterns of the block copolymers at surfaces are thus seen as ideal surface modifiers for tissue engineering applications. In this project, a model diblock copolymer system, polystyrene-polyacrylic acid (PS339- PAA84), was prepared using the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization technique. The behaviour of PSAA was studied in dioxane-water mixtures. The morphologies changed with increasing water content from sphere to rods and to vesicles. The spinodal and binodal phase diagrams of PSAA in a dioxane-water system were thereafter determined. The self-assembly of these amphiphilic diblock copolymers at the surface of a twodimensional (2D) polystyrene film was then characterised as a function of concentration and block composition. The size of the self assembled aggregates at the PS surface was shown to vary from 10 to 30 nm by changes in the block copolymer concentration. Fibroblast cells cultured on these films demonstrated a strong dependency on PAA aggregate size and number density with regards to their attachment on the modified PS thin films. Two primary morphologies of the attached cells were observed: radial spread and axial polarised. Interestingly the number of cells attached at a period of 24h was similar for all films investigated. This study has shown the significant potential of block copolymers as surface modifying additives for use in tissue engineering applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158602</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The comparative ecology and population dynamics of koalas in the koala coast region of south-east Queensland</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Jim, (James Athol)</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">0501 Ecological Applications</field><field name="subject">Koala -- Ecology -- Queensland, Southeastern.</field><field name="subject">Koala -- Habitat -- Queensland, Southeastern.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158282</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Revenge and the state: Relations between family and state in early modern English revenge drama</field><field name="creator">McMahon, Christopher Robert</field><field name="description">Early modern revenge plays explore the underbelly of contemporary discourses on family and state as were proposed in political treatises, sermons, tracts, household manuals and conduct books. Transforming contemporary discourse on family and state, these plays staged crises of belief with regard to domestic and civil practices. The aim of this thesis is to analyse how early modern revenge plays construct family and state institutions and the relations between those institutions. In order to provide such an analysis, several plays receive close reading. By tracing the ways symbolic and material forms of capital are constructed and made to interact within these plays, this thesis attempts to understand how these plays are posing extraordinary questions regarding the morality of such matters as the situation of women, the duties pertaining to familial identity and the prerogatives of executive power. This thesis focuses on ways in which the plays operate different modes of transaction such as sale, gift and theft, thereby hoping to enhance our understanding of the sophisticated nature of these plays with respect to the way each play utilises civil violence as a problematic by which to explore various paradigms of household government and state administration. Compared and contrasted, the plays represent markedly different approaches to issues of shared concern. In The Spanish Tragedy, the family is violently isolated and revalorised, thereby creating a crisis regarding the symbolic superiority of the king. In Hamlet, an attempt is made to neutralise that crisis by subsuming the struggle of the private family into a struggle to de-reify primogenitural rule. In The Revenger's Tragedy, the cause of the private family is re-asserted in association with an elaborate regime of household management. This regime of household management is co-opted by the state in The Malcontent where the private family becomes an informal state apparatus. In The Duchess of Malfi, the private family is linked to a re-assertion of &#147;middle-class&#148; interests. Analysed in this way, each play takes a substantially different approach to institutions of family and state, constructing these institutions in different ways and staging the relations between these institutions according to different political outlooks. The plays nevertheless can be seen as responding to each other by means of an identifiable mechanism of negation and co-option. As a series, the plays tend to move from the aggressive privatisation of the family, through contestation of state authority, towards the elaboration of the private household as an informal state apparatus.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158393</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimising very preterm infant outcomes: An evidence based targeted screening and surveillance method</field><field name="creator">Pritchard, Margo Anne</field><field name="description">BACKGROUND. There are various methods of health care follow-up of children born very preterm (VP, &#8804;31 week gestation) from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Whilst the gold standard is the systematic NICU based follow-up program, which provides highly specialised neurodevelopmental and medical assessment, it is not feasible at all the appropriate times for all infants because of cost and geographical constraints. In Queensland, and elsewhere, 50% of children born VP rely on primary care-general practice for their screening and health needs once discharged from hospital. Recently, randomised and interrater agreement studies have shown the feasibility of the use of a questionnaire-based collection of late health status in children born VP. A preterm-targeted childhood primary health screening and surveillance program which draws from these methods may be effective in collecting long-term disability data and meeting the screening needs of children born VP. AIM. To (1) develop and (2) assess a Preterm-Targeted Screening and Surveillance Program against the routine National Health Medical Research Council (NHMRC) program for the early detection of sensorineural based disability in children born VP by general practitioners in the primary health setting for (1) prevalence estimation and (2) as a screening tool. METHODS. A two-part approach was chosen. Part 1 was a reconstructed cross-sectional cohort of 388 of 523 (74.2%) located and consented 2, 4 and 7 year ca (corrected age) children with a birthweight &#8804; 1250 grams (g) born in Queensland. Epidemiological information was collected on child health outcomes and factors relating to the feasibility of providing a standardised targeted screening and surveillance program to be used by general practitioners to detect sensorineural based disability in children born VP. The Preterm- Targeted Screening and Surveillance Program was developed using World Health Organisation (WHO) screening program criteria and NHMRC evidence based health practice criteria. Part 2 was a multicentred randomised controlled trial to test the efficacy of the newly developed program in 202 VP infants who were randomised to receive the NHMRC or Preterm-Targeted Screening and Surveillance Program. The primary outcome was correct identification of sensorineural disability (developmental quotient &gt;-1 standard deviation (SD), cerebral palsy, bilateral blindness or deafness requiring aids) at 12-months ca by general practitioners assessed against gold standard paediatric assessments. The odds ratios (OR) calculated the disability status (agreed vs. disagreed/unsure). Kappa statistics (k) and screening test characteristics calculated interrater agreement and screening accuracy (agreed vs. disagreed). Logistic regression investigated factors that might affect agreement between general practitioners and paediatric assessment for disability. Secondary outcomes were designed to be descriptive and included post-natal depression, parental stress, health service utilisation and satisfaction. RESULTS. Part 1 demonstrated that in Queensland there is no state-based information on 25.8% of children born VP. Children assessed suffer from sensorineural impairment and a range of other health and developmental problems. In addition, there is limited specialist child health resources located outside the major metropolitan areas and families rely heavily on general practitioners for child health care. Parents and general practitioners clearly demonstrated that they would use an evidence-based targeted childhood screening and surveillance program for children born VP. The Preterm-Targeted Screening and Surveillance Program provide parents and health practitioners with an evidence based-high accuracy standardised screening for sensorineural and non-sensorineural domains. In Part 2, 195 of 202 infants randomised were assessed for the primary outcome. There was no difference in the correct identification of sensorineural disability between general practitioners in either group shown by an OR of 0.91 (95%CI 0.50, 1.65) (preterm-targeted 65.6% vs. NHMRC 67.6%). No prognostic factors independently affected this outcome. Interrater agreement was fair (preterm-targeted k =0.30, p for Ho=0.001 vs. NHMRC k =0.29, p for Ho=0.002). The preterm-targeted group had more disability identified (73% vs. 33%) with less under-referrals (27% vs. 67%) but poorer specificity (70% vs. 92%) with more over-referrals (30% vs. 8%) compared to the NHMRC group. Secondary outcomes showed that children born VP experience high rates of health services use but their families experience similar rates of depression and parental stress compared to the general paediatric population. Satisfaction results suggest that the program was well received. CONCLUSION. A comprehensive epidemiological approach to collecting a broad range of VP child health outcomes and health service data was successfully used to develop an evidence-based Preterm-Targeted Screening and Surveillance Program which proved to have excellent uptake by parents and general practitioners. Assessing the program using a randomised methodology has allowed demonstration of its efficacy as a screening tool when used by general practitioners in the primary health setting. The Preterm-Targeted Screening and Surveillance Program is superior in identifying disability at 12-month ca compared to the standard NHMRC program. Whilst the results are promising, the program will not provide totally accurate prevalence of disability data because of the overestimation of disability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pre-term screening</field><field name="subject">Infant</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158603</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Depression and Quality of Life Among Methamphetamine Users</field><field name="creator">Grant, Tanya Marie</field><field name="description">There has been a significant increase in the use of amphetamine type stimulants (ATS) in Australia over the last decade, and according to the National Drug Strategy Household Survey (2004) results, amphetamine is the second most commonly reported illicit substance used by Australians after cannabis. It has been widely documented that illicit drug users, and in particular ATS users, experience high levels of psychiatric comorbidity and particularly high levels of depression. Depression is one of the leading diseases in the modern world and causes significant burden to those who suffer from it. The main aim of this study is to determine the levels of depression among a sample of regular amphetamine users and investigate the subjective experience of life quality among those with comorbid depression and those without. This study was a separate component of a randomised controlled trial for regular amphetamine users in Queensland and New South Wales (Baker, Lee, Claire, Lewin, Grant et al, 2003). Participants were required to be 18 years and over and regular users of amphetamines as defined by use of amphetamines on at least four occasions in the previous month. A total of 2 14 participants were recruited from a range of sources into the study. Levels of depression (measured by the BDI-11), quality of life (WHOQoL BREF), dependence status (SDS) and drug use patterns (OTI) were all examined. High levels of depression were found among the same with 84.6% of the sample reporting clinically significant depression with a large proportion of this group falling into the moderate to severe spectrum (7 1 %). Results identified several areas of major risk for poor quality of life for amphetamine users, including dependence, frequency of use and route of administration, and showed how these risks areas can be compounded by level of depression to create significantly decreased quality of life. No amphetamine withdrawal scales were administered in the assessment protocol for this study. It is possible that some of the reported symptoms of depression could be related in part to an amphetamine withdrawal syndrome. Further study of the natural history of withdrawal and the prevalence of related metal health symptoms is warranted. This sample was a treatment seeking, dependent group of amphetamine users. The results confirm the high rates of mental health comorbidity among regular amphetamine users and highlights the added burden of disease that this group suffers. The results have implications for treatment services, which need to manage both comorbidity and individual aspects that contribute to an improved quality of life. Further analyses examining treatment outcomes for this group would be useful.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Amphetamine</field><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">quality of life</field><field name="subject">comorbidity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158283</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agency, discourse and academic practice: Reconceptualising international students in an Australian university</field><field name="creator">Kettle, Margaret Anne</field><field name="description">My research project is the case study of a Master of Education course called Debates in Education and Leadership as told through the accounts of six international postgraduate students. Most were undertaking study in Australia for the first time. The study is a detailed investigation of the students&#146; representations of and participation in course practices. It is a discourse analysis with a focus on social practice, power relations and knowledge. The study describes academic activities within the course and the lecturer&#146;s and students&#146; ways of interacting and acting, of representing knowledge and the social world, and of being. The analysis draws out the students&#146; &#145;readings&#146; of preferred ways of doing academic work and identifies the programs of strategic action that they undertook as a result. The genesis of this study lies in my experiences with students in academic English programs. My aim in the study is to build a comprehensive understanding of student practice with a view to challenging the reductive images in the research literature and circulating in popular discourse. Utilising ethnographic perspectives, an extensive corpus of the students&#146; representations of the course was collected, with triangulation provided by the lecturer and a body of written materials. The data includes interviews, videoed classroom sessions, a written archive of course documents including the course outline, teaching evaluation forms, student assignments and lecturer feedback, email communication between the lecturer and students, and field notes. The students&#146; representations of the course emphasise English and particular academic activities such as writing assignments and voicing ideas in class which require new skills, new identities, new ways of viewing the world, and new interaction patterns. The other prevalent themes are the teaching and issues related to the self. Contrary to previous work which has tended to represent students as fixed entities challenged by cultural and academic change, the students in this study are found to be engaged in a project of change and the uptake of practices that is characterised by a gradual coming to &#145;do&#146; and &#145;be&#146;. The analysis finds that the lecturer&#146;s teaching approach is significant in facilitating both of these efforts. English is a salient factor and the students respond strategically to the discourse that draws together English and academic practice in a formidable regime of expectations and requirements. The analysis details the students&#146; recognition of and response to this discourse and its associated practices. Above all, the students&#146; undertakings and engagement in the course are found to be part of a larger project of personal transformation as they harvest opportunities made available in the prevailing context of internationalised higher education. The implications for the provision of international education by Australian universities are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158394</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Location-Specific Sustainability Metrics for Hydrogen Energy Systems</field><field name="creator">McLellan, Benjamin Craig</field><field name="description">The aim of the current work is twofold &#150; it seeks to complete the knowledge gaps in relation to sustainability assessment of hydrogen energy systems in Australia, but in doing so, a new methodology of sustainability metrics assessment incorporating location-specific environmental factors by way of an emissions transport model is developed. The major contributions of this research are: 1. Validation of the hypothesis of environment-dependent sustainability with a process model for environment-industrial interaction and the unique use of long-term historical data from an isolated Australian power station. 2. A novel sustainability metrics model which assesses the deviation due to the plant against the environment&#146;s carrying capacity, based on site-specific environmental signatures and process emissions. 3. Determining the sustainability metrics in terms of soil acidification for coal gasification, natural gas steam reforming and conventional coal electricity powered electrolysis, in the context of providing hydrogen to Brisbane, Australia. These contributions are achieved by: 1. Determining the Fuel Cycle Inventory of emissions and inputs of the selected hydrogen production technologies; 2. Development of a methodology of sustainability assessment that incorporates local environmental limitations; 3. Development of a process model for environmental transmission of contaminants to provide the basis for the sustainability metrics; 4. Validation and proof of the model with historical data (intermittent years from 1983 to 1987 and 2006) from Tarong power station; 5. Incorporation of this model in the sustainability metrics and application of these metrics to the selected hydrogen production processes. It is found that the emissions transport model (ETM), incorporating atmospheric and hydraulic transport is able to be validated with historical data, providing an accurate model of the soil sulphur concentrations at sites around the Tarong power station. The availability of historical data of the kind used in this validation for such an isolated pollutant source, which can be claimed to be the only contributor to local emissions, is very limited, thus offering a unique opportunity in terms of developing an accurate ETM. It is shown that the assumption made in current methodologies, that the load of emissions can be used as the only indicator of sustainability is false. This work shows that for soil acidification impacts, environmental dispersion and sensitivity is a non-linear process, and that the specific environment in which a plant is located is particularly important to the overall sustainability. The validated ETM is then used as the basis for the development of a set of sustainability metrics (SM) that incorporate local environmental transport, sensitivity and limitations. The new SM model is applied to the selected hydrogen production technologies, and the model is shown to vary significantly in its output from the current methodologies. In particular, the incorporation of &#147;critical loads&#148; to give the environmental susceptibility to acidification gives the SM model the ability to measure sustainability in an absolute, rather than relative, sense. The spatial and temporal variability of sustainability is shown, and contours of sustainability, highlighting &#147;hot spots&#148; of low sustainability are produced. Further work is recommended to expand the scope of hydrogen systems examined and the number of sustainability impacts assessed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158395</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physiological ecology of the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas in the Brisbane River</field><field name="creator">Pillans, Richard David</field><field name="description">The bull shark, Carcharhinus leucas is one of few elasmobranchs capable of living in, and moving freely between, freshwater (FW) and seawater (SW). Despite this remarkable ability, very little is known about the osmoregulatory physiology and ecology of this species. Bull sharks are common in the Brisbane River, a tidal river in subtropical Australia that has about 90 km of habitable water and salinity gradient from 33&#137; (seawater) at the mouth to 0 &#137; (freshwater) in the upper reaches. The presence of bull sharks in the Brisbane River, and the accessibility of this system, provides a unique opportunity to investigate how this species osmoregulatory ability allows it to utilise freshwater, estuarine and marine environments. The distribution, size structure and movement patterns of bull sharks in the river and surrounding marine environment were investigated by capture, tagging and acoustic tracking. A total of 712 bull sharks were captured in Brisbane River and Moreton Bay. Juvenile bull sharks showed a strong preference for the upper FW reaches with the catch per unit effort (CPUE) in upper FW reaches (1.18 sharks per hr) significantly higher than Moreton Bay and the river mouth (0.08 and 0.09 sharks per hour) Presence of open umbilical scars indicate that bull sharks are born at 65 &#150; 83 cm Total length (TL). Size composition in the river was strongly skewed towards juveniles, with neonates contributing 68% to the riverine population. Although neonates dominated the catches, animals between 85 &#150; 130 cm were not uncommon and this together with tag recapture data indicates that bull sharks remain in the Brisbane River from birth until approximately 140 cm when they move to a marine environment. Six animals were tracked using acoustic tags. Three juvenile animals tagged in freshwater reaches showed very similar movement patterns remaining in the upper reaches and did not encounter any changes in environmental salinity. Two out of three animals tagged in the estuarine reaches moved upstream and downstream and were exposed to large and rapid fluctuations in environmental salinity resulting in a need to osmoregulate in hyper and hypo-ionic environments. Plasma osmolality of bull sharks captured along a salinity gradient from FW to SW was always hyperosmotic to the environment, ranging from 642 &#177; 7 mOsm.kg&amp;macr;&amp;sup1 (FW animals) to 1067 &#177; 21 mOsm.kg&amp;macr;&amp;sup1(SW animals). In FW animals, sodium, chloride and urea were 208 &#177; 3, 203 &#177; 3 and 192 &#177; 2 mmol.l&amp;macr;&amp;sup1 , respectively. Plasma sodium, chloride and urea in SW-captured C. leucas were 289 &#177; 3, 296 &#177; 6 and 370 &#177; 10 mmol.l&amp;macr;&amp;sup1, respectively. This osmoregulatory strategy necessitates active Na+ and Cl- secretion by the rectal gland in SW and active conservation of these ions in FW. Despite the increased importance of the rectal gland in hyper-ionic environments, there was no difference in the rectal gland mass of C. leucas captured in FW and estuarine environments (20&#150;28&#137;) of the Brisbane River. Juvenile C. leucas captured in freshwater (FW) (3 mOsm) were acclimated to seawater (SW) (980 &#150; 1000 mOsm) over sixteen days. A freshwater group was maintained in captivity over a similar time period. In SW, juvenile sharks regulated all plasma osmolytes to the same degree as adults captured in SW showing that juveniles are capable of osmoregulation in SW and that preference for FW is due to behaviour rather than a physiological constraint. Gill, rectal gland, kidney and intestinal tissue were analysed for maximal Na+/K+- ATPase activity. Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the gills and intestine was less than 1 mmol Pi.mg&amp;macr;&amp;sup1 protein.h&amp;macr;&amp;sup1 and there was no difference in activity between FW and SW acclimated animals. In SW, rectal gland Na+/K+-ATPase activity (9.2 &#177; 0.6 mmol Pi.mg&amp;macr;&amp;sup1 protein.h&amp;macr;&amp;sup1) was significantly higher than FW animals (5.6 &#177; 0.8 and 9.2 &#177; 0.6 mmol Pi.mg&amp;macr;&amp;sup1protein. h&amp;macr;&amp;sup1). Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the kidney of FW acclimated animals (8.4 &#177; 1.1 Pi.mg&amp;macr;&amp;sup1 protein.h&amp;macr;&amp;sup1) was significantly higher than SW animals (3.3 &#177; 1.1 Pi.mg&amp;macr;&amp;sup1 protein.h&amp;macr;&amp;sup1). These differences were attributed to the increased importance of the rectal gland to secretion of Na+ and Cl- in SW and the need for the kidney to actively reabsorb Na+ and Cl- in freshwater. Despite large biochemical changes in the rectal gland, structural changes were less obvious. There was no difference in rectal gland cross sectional area, lumen area, rectal gland vein area, number of secretory tubules or secretory cells per secretory tubule in FW and SW acclimated animals. At a cellular level, there was no difference between the degree of basolateral and lateral folding, number of mitochondria or number of desmosomes per tight junction. Tight junction width was significantly greater in SW acclimated animals. The number of red blood cells in the interstitial tissue was also significantly higher in SW acclimated animals reflecting an increased perfusion of the capillaries of the rectal gland. The lack of large morphological changes reflects the small amount of FW habitat in the Brisbane River and the fact that animals are exposed to increasing salinity when they move downstream. Results of acoustic tracking showed that animals were capable of moving rapidly between salinity gradients. Do determine the extend and timing of plasma and erythrocyte solute properties, animals captured in freshwater (FW) were acutely acclimated to 75% seawater (SW), and 100% SW. Blood samples were taken at 0, 12 and 96 h following transfer to 75% SW and 24 h and 72 h after transfer to 100% SW. A control group in FW was subjected to the same sampling regime. Upon transfer of C. leucas to 75% and 100% SW, plasma Na+, Cl-, K+, Mg&amp;sup2+, Ca&amp;sup2+, urea and TMAO concentrations all increased significantly but disproportionately. Plasma Na+ and Cl- increased immediately, followed by an increase in plasma urea. Erythrocyte urea and TMAO concentrations increased significantly following transfer to 75% and 100% SW, however changes in erythrocyte inorganic ion concentrations were insignificant. Haematocrit, haemoglobin and mean cell haematocrit did not differ significantly after transfer to seawater, however, plasma water was slightly reduced after 24 h and 72 h in 100% SW. Red blood cell (RBC) water content was elevated 24 h after transfer to 100% SW but returned to FW levels after 72 h. Juvenile bull sharks tolerated rapid and significant increases in salinity by rapidly increasing plasma osmolality to be hyperosmotic to the environment whilst maintaining a tight regulation of their intracellular fluid environment. Results from this research indicate the juvenile bull sharks spend several years in the Brisbane River before moving to a marine environment. Despite a preference for the FW reaches, juveniles are capable of living in both FW and SW and osmoregulate equally well in both environments. The bull sharks ability to live and move between FW and SW is due to their rapid control of plasma and erythrocyte ion and water content via the action of the rectal gland, gills and kidney.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158284</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social contextual influences on union participation: A group processes approach to explaining collective action</field><field name="creator">Blackwood, Leda</field><field name="description">Like all social movements, unions experience alternating periods of member apathy and fervent activity. This is invariably linked to the demands of the industrial relations context (Fosh, 1993). Yet, much of the research that has investigated union activity has sought explanations in enduring qualities of the individual. Where social context has been investigated, the focus has been on the individual&#146;s reading of the context, divorced from the influence of those with whom they act in solidarity. This program of research sits with recent efforts to examine the group-processes&#151;as opposed to individual-level processes&#151;that underpin collective action, such as through a union. It is largely informed by social identity (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979) and self-categorization theories (Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, &amp; Wetherell, 1987) wherein collective action is conceived as an outcome of the psychological processes associated with selfcategorization with a contextually-salient and behaviourally meaningful group. This theoretical perspective invites a more dynamic interpretation of the interplay between people&#146;s perceptions of social-contextual factors and their more enduring union-related attitudes (see Hogg &amp; Abrams, 1995) in the prediction of collective action. Five studies were conducted using academic members and non-members of the National Tertiary Education Industry Union and members of the University of Queensland student union across a period that included some level of stability, as well as threats to student and academic interests, and to their ability to protect those interests through their respective unions. A mix of field studies, both cross-sectional and longitudinal, and experimental studies, were employed. Across all studies, the relationships between people&#146;s union-related beliefs, (i.e., group-based efficacy and ideology beliefs) and constituent group (i.e., student or academic) identity on the one hand, and perceptions of social context (i.e., perceived intergroup threat and in-group norms) on the other, were tested in models predicting union support, intended behaviour, and actual behaviour (including participation in a national strike). Although the relationship between people&#146;s beliefs and their perception of context should be bidirectional, the focal interest was in the potential for change in people&#146;s political activity as a function of change in the social context The importance of people&#146;s group-based efficacy and ideology beliefs to union behaviour was supported. More critically, this research program demonstrated that people&#146;s perceptions of social-contextual factors, such as group-related threat and norms, added directly to explanations of union behaviour and moderated the effects on union behaviour of more enduring factors. Independently of their union-related beliefs, people engaged in union activity where their perception of a threat to group interests and of a normative environment supporting such behaviour made it meaningful to do so. Moreover, these perceptions of the social context qualified the role played by people&#146;s union-related beliefs in ways that differed depending on whether the studies were conducted during periods of industrial stability or conflict. In the studies conducted in more stable environments, union activity was the province of those members who both believed in the union (ideologically and in terms of its efficacy) and perceived a climate of pro-union normative support amongst their colleagues and peers. This contrasts with studies conducted in more threatening environments where, regardless of the normative environment, there was strong union support from those who believed in the union; and those with weaker beliefs also showed a propensity to increase their efforts to support the union, to the extent that they perceived normative support for this action. Together, the five studies demonstrated the dynamic nature of union behaviour and the importance of examining such behaviour in context. This dynamism was most clearly expressed in the longitudinal study where an increase in union activity over time was shown to be a consequence of perceived increases in threat to the group and prounion norms, particularly among the less committed unionists. Theoretically, these studies support the proposition that collective action is, at least in part, a consequence of contextually activated group processes; and suggest the utility of the social identity theoretical framework for future collective action research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158672</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children of the depression: Brisbane 1929-1939</field><field name="creator">Leach, Carolyn Ann</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">2103 Historical Studies</field><field name="subject">Children -- Queensland -- Brisbane -- History</field><field name="subject">Brisbane (Qld.) -- History.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158396</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refuge competition in the freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium Australiense : linking individual behaviours to population patterns</field><field name="creator">Lammers, Jan Hsuan</field><field name="description">By utilising an individual-based model (IBM) I directly examined the link between system level properties and their structural roots, the small scale competitive behaviours of individuals. The refuging behaviours of a diurnally inactive freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium australiense, were used as the basis for the IBM which explored the role of refuge competition on exposure to predation. Physical experiments were conducted to determine the behavioural rules and parameterise the model. The first series of experiments investigated the diel refuging patterns and competitive refuging behaviours of the study animal (Chapter 2-4). These were found to be strongly anti-predatory; individuals sharply reduced diel activity and spent the vast majority of their time in available vegetation refugia (Chapter 2). The presence of conspecifics, however, affected the activity of focal individuals, and their exposure to predation, by two separate mechanisms. The first was detectability related to the Size of the conspecific and the Refuge stalk Density (SiRD mechanism) (Chapter 3-4), the second was driven by the activity of the conspecific (Motion mechanism) (Chapter 4). During the SiRD mechanism the response of the individual was also related to its position in the dominance hierarchy relative to the conspecific. For dominant individuals activity increased in all refuge densities tested with increasing conspecific detectability (Chapter 3). Subordinate response in the SiRD mechanism was also affected by the quality of the refuge (Chapter 4). When faced with increasing dominant size subordinates in low quality refugia reduced activity, this contrasted with high quality refugia where their activity increased. This was explained in terms of alternative mechanisms to minimise contact with dominants: evasion and crypsis in high and low quality refugia respectively (Chapter 4). Compared to SiRD the Motion mechanism was relatively straight forward. In all cases the activity of other individuals was found to trigger an increase in the activity of proximate conspecifics (Chapter 4). During these experiments it was noted that when introduced to a novel environment M. australiense individuals would actively explore it, showing uncharacteristically high levels of diel activity. The subsequent experiments examined whether or not they required this exploratory period to determine the location and quality of refugia (Chapter 5). The results demonstrated that the study animals were able to detect and evaluate the quality of distant novel refugia without exploring them first. However, this ability did not preclude the performance of exploratory behaviours (Chapter 5). The behaviours in the preceding chapters formed the basis for the construction and parameterisation of the IBM (described in Chapter 6). Tests of the models validity showed that it could make adequate predictions about the distribution of individuals around an experimental aquarium and was able to reproduce a majority of trends seen in a series of independent experiments (Chapter 7). Though, the SiRD mechanism was underestimating the magnitude of the size related trends. The overall results determined that the model could describe the general effects of different behaviours on the exposure of individuals to predation, but would need further parameterisation to make predictions about real world scenarios. Bearing this in mind exploratory simulation experiments were conducted to test the link between the simulated behaviours and system level patterns (Chapter 8-9). Three core effects were found to affect the population&#146;s exposure to predation. First, the cumulative Motion mechanism resulted in the emergence of a density-dependent pattern affecting predator exposure which increased with escalating population size and decreasing refuge availability (Chapter 8). Second the low movement likelihood of individuals limited their spatial range to a subsection of the simulated environment. Because of this the fragmentation of refugia only had an impact on exposure to predation when it occurred at a scale relative to this spatial range (Chapter 8). The third core effect demonstrated a mechanism by which refuge competition could affect individuals exposed to predation and subsequently the size structure of the population (Chapter 9). When individuals, which surpassed a threshold of exposure to predation, were removed from the population there was a general increase in the average body size of the population. The number of individuals removed from the population, and the rate of increase in average body size was strongly affected by the initial body size variation of the individuals. This effect was strong despite the fact that it was probably underestimated by the model, as it was driven by the SiRD mechanism (Chapter 9). Overall the behavioural rules of the model succeeded in reproducing the system level patterns, demonstrating that they captured some essential processes of competitive refuging behaviours. The main contribution of this thesis to the scientific literature is the description of an explicit link between the competitive refuging behaviours of individuals and their resultant population patterns.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158604</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EFFECTIVENESS OF NO-TAKE MARINE RESERVES IN MORETON BAY, SUBTROPICAL AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Pillans, Suzanne</field><field name="description">Present global concern for the conservation of marine biodiversity (including fisheries) has resulted in the recent implementation of systems of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). No-take marine reserves (referred to throughout this thesis as &#145;marine reserves&#146;) are one type of MPA which provide permanent areas closed to all forms of fishing and extractive activities. Whilst there is a growing body of theoretical information supporting the role of marine reserves in conserving both marine biodiversity and fisheries resources, very few studies have examined their dual role empirically, particularly within inshore and coastal environments (Chapter 1). This thesis examines the effectiveness of two relatively small (&amp;lt 6km2) inshore marine reserves in Moreton Bay Marine Park (MBMP) in terms of their ability to sustain fisheries species and conserve marine biodiversity. Insights from this empirical research support a refined approach to the future design and management of marine reserves in subtropical Australia. Two studies were carried out to assess the effectiveness of marine reserves in Moreton Bay for exploited fisheries species. Firstly, the impact of deliberate sex-biased fishing and marine reserve protection on the mud crab Scylla serrata was assessed (Chapter 2). Using catch and release sampling through the use of baited crab pots the catch rates (catch-per-unit-effort CPUE), mean size, sex ratios and movement were determined for S. serrata and compared in two coastal marine reserves (1.9 and 5.7km2) and four non-reserve &#145;fished&#146; sites. The marine reserves surveyed in this study were located in different geographical locations in Moreton Bay (north and south). Five years after establishment (closure), both marine reserves supported higher catch rates and a larger mean size of S. serrata than non-reserve sites. Sex ratios of mature male and female crabs revealed a strong skew (2:1) towards mature males in both marine reserves whilst a skew towards females was found in all non-reserve sites, which was most likely a result of the ban on taking female S. serrata in Moreton Bay. Of the 472 S. serrata captured in this study, 338 were tagged in the reserves in order to document their movement. Of the 37 recaptured crabs, 69% were recorded inside the reserves with some &#145;spillover&#146; of crabs recorded in fished areas. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of small (&amp;lt 6 km2) inshore marine reserves for a sex-biased exploited invertebrate fisheries species. The protection afforded to inshore habitats of S. serrata in Moreton Bay highlight the benefits, both within and acrossboundary (spillover), that small marine reserves provide to relatively sessile marine invertebrates which has important implications for the design and location of future marine reserves in Moreton Bay. My second study to assess the effectiveness of marine reserves for fisheries species was focused on marine reserve protection of exploited finfish species (Acanthopagrus australis, Platycephalus fuscus and Pomadasys kaakan) (Chapter 3). Using experimental angling (catch and release) the relative density, mean size and biomass of fish were determined and compared between the marine reserves and non-reserve &#145;fished&#146; sites. Again, results revealed that after just five years of protection both marine reserves supported significantly higher relative density, mean size (except P. kaakan) and biomass of exploited finfish species. The most popular angling species in Moreton Bay, A. australis and P. fuscus, responded most to reserve protection with at least three times higher density, a 10% increase in mean size and at least 15% greater biomass within both marine reserves compared to non-reserve sites. Tag recapture data for A. australis (a mobile species) and P. fuscus (a relatively sedentary species) revealed that although recapture rates were low both species were recorded outside reserve boundaries in adjacent fished waters. The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of small (&amp;lt 6km2) inshore marine reserves in providing protection to multiple exploited finfish species despite their variable movement patterns. This empirical evidence strengthens the use of marine reserves as a precautionary multi-species management tool, which could complement existing fisheries management in Moreton Bay and assist in the design and location of future marine reserves in subtropical Australia. To assess the potential dual benefits of the marine reserves in Moreton Bay I assessed the effectiveness of the marine reserves in terms of their protection for marine biodiversity (ie. nekton) (Chapter 4). Catch and release sampling using multiple hauls of a seine net were used to survey the two marine reserves and four corresponding non-reserve sites. Species richness, evenness (Bulla, E), density and mean size of the inshore communities were compared between the reserves and non-reserve &#145;fished&#146; sites. No statistical significant difference was detected in species richness between the sites however species evenness was significantly lower in the only non-reserve site impacted by commercial net fishing. There was no statistical significant difference detected in density and mean size of nekton between the marine reserves and nonreserve sites. Multivariate analysis revealed differences in community composition, particularly between the geographical locations where sites were impacted by different types of fishing pressure (recreational v commercial). These findings highlight the impact commercial fishing can have on entire nekton assemblages, not just on targeted species. Further, the results of this study demonstrated that the small (&amp;lt 6km2) inshore marine reserves in Moreton Bay are protecting aspects of marine biodiversity and are thus at least partially achieving their management objective (to enhance the zone&#146;s marine biodiversity), which has important implications for the design and location of future conservation marine reserves in the Marine Park. The final component of this thesis provides a qualitative two-part review of conservation planning in Moreton Bay Marine Park (MBMP) (Chapter 5). The aim of this review was to 1. provide a historical account of conservation planning of the MBMP and 2. provide an improved approach for future conservation planning for the MBMP, both of which are discussed in terms of the empirical findings of the first three studies (Chapters 2-4). Firstly, a review of conservation planning of the MBMP revealed that the existing &#145;system&#146; of marine reserves were established following an ad hoc and highly political process. Despite this approach the empirical findings of the three studies (Chapters 2-4) revealed that the marine reserves were effective in providing dual benefits to the marine environment. Considering the important implications of this empirical evidence the second component of the review suggests improvements to future conservation planning in MBMP, particularly in light of the upcoming re-zoning of the Marine Park. A holistic approach to the upcoming re-zoning is recommended through the adoption of a &#145;combination approach&#146; which incorporates the biophysical, political and social components of marine reserve effectiveness. A &#145;combination approach&#146; would need to adopt the following components: a science-based approach to MPA planning (biophysical); a whole of government approach encouraging the collaboration of marine resource government agencies (political); and ensure that stakeholder consultation process is extensive, open and transparent (social). Each of these components are discussed in terms of the empirical findings of this research coupled with lessons learned worldwide from similar re-zoning exercises. This review proposes an improved approach to conservation planning in Moreton Bay Marine Park which forms the basis for a list of general recommendations for marine resource practitioners charged with the upcoming re-zoning (Chapter 6).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158285</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What happens when groups say sorry?

Yet, for each circumstance in which apologies are offered, there are others in which apologies are not given though victim groups demand them. The frequency of intergroup apologies and requests suggests that these are important and not without cost. Yet, little is known of the actual effectiveness of intergroup apologies for victim groups. This research represents an attempt to answer this question. There are no previous investigations of the effectiveness of intergroup apologies for victim groups (see Chapter 2 for review). Research on apologies in the interpersonal domain have repeatedly demonstrated conciliatory effects on measures such as perceived remorse, satisfaction and forgiveness (e.g. Darby &amp; Schlenker, 1989; Exline &amp; Baumeister, 2000; Girard, Mullet, &amp; Callahan, 2002; Gold &amp; Weiner, 2000; Gonzales, 1992; McCullough et al., 1998; Ohbuchi, Kameda, &amp; Agarie, 1989; Ohbuchi &amp; Sato, 1994; O'Malley &amp; Greenberg, 1983; Scher &amp; Darley, 1997; Schmitt, Gollwitzer, Forster, &amp; Montada, 2004; Tomlinson, Dineen, &amp; Lewicki, 2004). Yet, theorists have suggested that intergroup apologies differ from interpersonal apologies in the amount of emotional expression used and, consequently, in the extent to which these affect perceptions of remorse (Edwards, 2005; Govier &amp; Verwoerd, 2001; Lazare, 2004; Tavuchis, 1991). As a result of these hypothesised differences and due to the lack of research in the area, this thesis sought to investigate the effectiveness of intergroup apologies in increasing perceptions of remorse, satisfaction and, importantly, intergroup forgiveness. As a first step, a survey was conducted of intergroup apology remembrance and intergroup forgiveness (Study 1). Participants from Australia (N = 120), the Philippines (N = 89) and Malaysia (N = 134) were invited to describe the offences committed by Japan in World War II and to report whether Japan had apologised. Participants showed inaccuracy in their remembrance of apologies, many were unaware of apologies that had been made and some even reported apologies that never occurred. However, those who thought there had never been an apology were significantly less forgiving than those who were aware of apologies, an effect that was mediated by perceptions of remorse. This survey was followed by experiments that used scenarios of actual events in which the participants&#146; ingroup was harmed. In Study 2, 60 participants read five offence scenarios each paired with a different apology condition. The five apology conditions included a no apology control, an expression of remorse, an expression of remorse with responsibility, an expression of remorse with an offer of repair, and an expression of remorse with a promise of forbearance. In Study 3, 60 participants read one of the five available scenarios paired with no apology or a full apology, containing an expression of remorse, responsibility, offer of repair and promise of forbearance. Results showed that, although group apologies increased satisfaction and perceptions of remorse, they did not affect forgiveness. Additional results collected in Study 3 also showed that group apologies increased perceptions that apologisers were driven by ulterior motives. These findings suggested that there might have been barriers to the development of intergroup forgiveness in the experiments conducted. In response to this, Study 4 (N = 73) examined whether participants needed more time to forgive. Forgiveness levels were recorded immediately before and after an apology, and again a week later. Forgiveness levels did increase over time, but an equivalent increase in forgiveness was found in a no apology control condition. At none of the time points was there a significant difference in levels of forgiveness in the apology and the no apology condition. This is despite the fact that participants perceived the group to be more remorseful and were more satisfied with the response in the apology than in the no apology condition. Study 5 (N = 214) examined whether permission to forgive was needed from ingroup victims. Participants received an apology, and were urged to accept the apology and forgive by either an ingroup victim, an ingroup non-victim, or an outgroup member. Again, apologies increased response satisfaction and perceptions of remorse compared to a no apology control. But apologies did not help promote forgiveness, regardless of whether or not there was an advocate. These findings regarding intergroup apologies contrast with findings from the interpersonal literature, showing that apologies are effective in promoting forgiveness for individuals. Therefore, it was considered appropriate to directly investigate differences between individual and group apologies. In Study 6, 167 participants read an offence scenario and then an apology, given either by an individual offender or by the offending group. Forgiveness for the individual offender, the offending group and the wider group was then measured. Results showed that individual apologies could promote forgiveness for individual offenders, whereas group apologies were still unable to promote forgiveness. Furthermore, while both apologies effectively promoted remorse perceptions and satisfaction, only group apologies affected perceptions of ulterior motives. In sum, it is clear that intergroup apologies are qualitatively distinct from their interpersonal counterparts, and have different effects on recipients. A greater understanding of the source of these differences might contribute to the development of means through which group apologies can be made more effective in promoting forgiveness. With this in mind, theoretical and applied implications of these data are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158605</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HOST PLANT INTERACTIONS OF A POLYPHAGOUS HERBIVOROUS PEST, HELICOVERPA ARMIGERA, IN RELATION TO A PRIMARY HOST SPECIES</field><field name="creator">Rajapakse, Champa Nirupa Kumari</field><field name="description">Helicoverpa armigera is a polyphagous pest with wide range of host plants. This species is considered to be a generalist with a generalised mechanism for host location and oviposition and this mechanism is seen as the way they expand their host range to suit local plant species availability. The underlying interactions of this pest species with its different host plants have never been fully investigated, perhaps because the insects are seen to be maximizing their fitness opportunistically. Various measures of larval and/or adult performance therefore often take precedence. However, circumstantial evidence suggests that even a polyphagous herbivore like H. armigera utilises their different host plants differently and some plants are preferred more for oviposition and offspring development. The differential use of hosts is acknowledged, but is usually portrayed as choice, and sequence of choice is sometimes predicted to correlate with larval performance. The research reported in this thesis focuses on the most preferred host species known for H. armigera. The eggs and larvae of the insect occur more regularly on such primary host plant species. The interactions of H. armigera moths with such host plants cannot be explained by the model that focuses on the &#147;generalist behaviour&#148;. In other words, the underlying mechanism that confers the potential for multiple host use is hidden. In the same context the wide range of host plants listed make it difficult to structure strong scientific tests that relate to host use by H. armigera. By contrast, if such herbivorous insects are adapted to specific environmental circumstances, then specific mechanisms can be expected for &#147;placing&#148; them precisely within the appropriate environment. Host plant recognition and acceptance is one such adaptation and the host plant species (and there may well be more than one of them) to which the insects species became adapted under selection at the time of speciation must be the primary host plant(s) of the species (Chapter 1). The ecological settings of the primary host plant(s) and the insect species must be similar. Also the insect species must have strong affinity for the plant species in terms of its ovipositional behaviour and offspring development. These interactions of the insect species with its primary host plant(s) can be used as the starting point for understanding the underlying nature of the polyphagous behaviour of the herbivore insect species. In this thesis I propose that H. armigera evolved in relation to primary host plant(s) and predict that its key adaptations to the primary host plant(s) will be similar across the geographical distribution of the species. More specifically I propose pigeon pea might be one of the primary host plants of this insect based on information from Indian H. armigera. If these moths encounter plants that share characteristics (mainly chemical) with these primary host plants they are liable to utilise these plants to some extent, perhaps mostly in the absence of their primary host plants. Such hosts can be termed secondary or incidental host plants. In this way the polyphagy and the invasive potential of H. armigera can be explained in mechanistic physiological and behavioural terms. I first investigated the oviposition preference and offspring performance of Australian subspecies of H. armigera on a subset of its host plants, selected for their reputed relative importance in the field, including cotton, sweet corn, pigeon pea, mungbean, bean, and common sowthistle (Chapter 2). Flowering pigeon pea was the most attractive host for oviposition. Pigeon pea, cotton and common sowthistle are equally suitable for larval feeding although the latter two plant species attract far less oviposition than pigeon pea. Mungbean was less attractive as an ovipositional host but returned intermediate success for larval growth and survival. Bean was the least attractive for oviposition and the least beneficial in terms of larval growth. Oviposition tendencies, larval performance and larval behaviour of Australian H. armigera are consistent on pigeon pea relative to Indian H. armigera. From the evidence available, the host recognition and acceptance behaviour of this species is fixed across geographical populations of H. armigera, at least in relation to pigeon pea, which shows signs of being a primary host species for H. armigera. To investigate which chemical signals female H. armigera moths respond to, headspace volatiles of flowering pigeon pea plants and a subset of other commonly used flowering host plants (tobacco, cotton and common bean) and nonhost plants (lantana and oleander) of H. armigera were screened by gas chromatography (GC) linked to a mated female H. armigera electroantennograph (EAG) (Chapter 3). EAG responses for pigeon pea volatiles were also compared between females of different physiological status (virgin and mated) and across the sexes. Eight electrophysiologically active compounds in pigeon pea headspace were identified in relatively high concentrations using GC linked to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). These included three green leaf volatiles ((2E)-hexenal, (3Z)-hexenylacetate and (3Z)-hexenyl-2-methylbutyrate) and five monoterpenes, (&#225;-pinene, &#226;-myrcene, limonene, E-&#226;-ocimene and linalool). (3Z)-hexenyl-2-methylbutyrate was detected only in pigeon pea headspace volatiles, at relatively low levels. The other host plants tested contained smaller subsets of these electrophysiologically active compounds and even the nonhost plants contained some of these compounds, all at relatively lower concentrations than pigeon pea, with some apparently at concentrations lower than that perceivable by the insect antenna. These results explain why pigeon pea is one of the most attractive hosts for oviposition for H. armigera and how the other tested plants can be secondary targets for ovipositing moths. The threshold concentrations at which some of the signature volatile compounds are perceived by moth antennae might be the key factor that dictates the host recognition behaviour of this insect. The physiological status or sex of the moths had no effect on the neurosensory responses for these identified compounds. The complex behavioural decisions thus seem to be controlled by the central nervous system rather than the peripheral senses. The attraction of gravid females of H. armigera for flowering host plants is well documented. Helicoverpa armigera is a nectar feeding moth, hence this attraction might also serve in relation to the adult nutritional requirements of this species. To investigate the underlying physiological needs of H. armigera for nectar feeding, I conducted a series of laboratory experiments, substituting nectar with sucrose solution (Chapter 4). The lifetime complement of oocytes present at the time of adult eclosion is entirely dependent on the food harvested by the larvae. However, the maturation of these oocytes and their subsequent deposition are both dependent to some extent on the incoming adult nutrients. Oviposition rate is directly proportional to the amount of exposure of the moth to carbohydrate food. If females are deprived of carbohydrate during their preovipositional period, subsequent egg maturation and deposition is reduced by 33%. If females are fed only with water, 40-50% reduction in realized fecundity occurs. If they are deprived of food for their entire life, the reduction is 85%. Adult nutrients are thus important for the overall sustenance of the moths and enable them to reach their full reproductive potential, which is initially determined by the larval diet. In chapter 4, I discuss the ecological consequences of the importance of adult feeding in this polyphagous pest. Since oviposition of H. armigera moths is strongly associated with flowering plants, I predict this insect, soon after eclosion, searches for host plants with nectar to support their maintenance functions and thus their reproduction. Nectar quality and associated floral volatiles may, therefore, be important factors that influenced the evolutionary association of H. armigera to its primary host plant species. I also investigated the interactions of ovipositing moths and their offspring with pigeon pea through a series of glasshouse and laboratory experiments (Chapter 5). The results show that nectar feeding female H. armigera moths are strongly attracted to the reproductive structures of pigeon pea, especially the flowers. These reproductive structures themselves are the main attraction for gravid females, because deflowered plants no longer attract moths and flowerless plants with fresh flowers attached regain their attraction to some extent. Females feed several times before ovipositing on buds, flowers and immature pods. There appears to be a tight correlation between the neurosensory and physiological adaptations of the ovipositing moths and those of the immature larvae. Immediately upon hatching immature larvae settled on flowers for feeding and at no time they did feed on leaves of pigeon pea. This was true even of larvae from eggs that had been manually placed on lower most leaves. Weight gain and survival of larvae are far greater on a flower diet than a leaf diet. Because the behavioural adaptations of the larvae of H. armigera are very agreeable with their mother&#146;s oviposition choice, it seems these two behavioural traits have been shaped closely in relation to one another through evolutionary time. Presumably, the primary host species, pigeon pea, has the entire range of characteristics that attract gravid H. armigera moths when the plant species bear the flowers and pods. The physiological and neurosensory adaptations of the insects to utilise this plant species are consistent across the continents. The secondary hosts used by H. armigera have only some of the characteristics that attract the H. armigera and these hosts are utilised by the insects to some extent, probably when their primary hosts are not readily available. A polyphagous species such as H. armigera does have considerable potential to establish in a new environment and become abundant, if one or more other hosts incidentally match the primary requirements of this insect. The population levels of the insect may depend on the abundance of such hosts in the new environment. For an agricultural pest species such as H.armigera the ephemeral and sequential presence of many incidental or secondary hosts within a cropping season, when climatic factors are appropriate for their optimal development, explains why they are so hard to control.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158397</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Telling Tales: Settler Fictions and the Short Story Composite</field><field name="creator">Kuttainen, Victoria</field><field name="description">&#147;Telling Tales: Settler Fictions and the Short Story Composite&#148; looks at the resurgence and deployment in the twentieth century of a unique form of writing, the short story composite. The short story composite is a collection of discrete, interlinked short stories that can also be read independently. Although the form has a long history, dating back to such well-known works of literature as Chaucer&#146;s Canterbury Tales and Boccaccio&#146;s Decameron, its twentieth century origins can be traced to local colour stories in colonial print culture, and the popularization of the short story collection during the modernist period. Even though it has been regarded as a marginal genre of writing, scholarly discussions of the form have burgeoned in the last quarter of the twentieth century, and writing in the form continues to be rich, diverse, and prolific. The short story has been a favourite genre of postcolonial theorists who have often invoked it as a marginal form attuned to the inclinations, expression, and nascent publishing markets of colonial writers. Yet, the short story composite expresses many difficult relations, not the least of which is its relation to the short story form. This study considers how the short story composite might be regarded as a curious postcolonial return of a colonial and modernist genre that possesses &#147;shifty&#148; attributes and demonstrates how settlers and critics have used this form in curious ways. Recent scholarly discussions of the short story composite in the twentieth century have mostly linked it to community dynamics within the nation-state, noticing that it is useful for articulating the concerns of &#147;the one and the many&#148; in multicultural nations such as Canada and the USA. This thesis is a comparative study of the genre that expands the national framework of these previous projects. It notices that this genre forms an extensive literary archive in Australia, Canada, and the USA, among other settler nations, and it considers the implications of this. Because of their analytic frames, many nation-based studies of the form have been involved in one way or another with national canon-building projects, even as they have questioned standard narratives of the nation that have focused on the novel or other dominant forms of writing. This thesis makes the point that this form of writing is well-suited to articulating the legacy of settler colonialism in these three national cultures where this form has been popular. Because the genre expresses awkward affiliations of individuals to place, home, nation, culture, and history, short story composites from these three nations can be usefully positioned within the broader context of settler colonialism and its aftermath. This thesis includes detailed readings of Margaret Laurence&#146;s A Bird in the House; William Faulkner&#146;s Go Down, Moses; Stephen Leacock&#146;s Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town; Sherwood Anderson&#146;s Winesburg, Ohio; Olga Masters&#146; A Long Time Dying; Scott R. Sanders&#146; Wilderness Plots; Thea Astley&#146;s It&#146;s Raining in Mango; Sandra Birdsell&#146;s Night Travellers and Ladies of the House; Tim O&#146;Brien&#146;s The Things They Carried; and Tim Winton&#146;s The Turning. Alongside close readings of these short story composites, it also includes readings of the critical archive. The thesis notices how the short story composite has been taken up, for instance, as a site that is particularly serviceable to &#147;nation-narration&#148; and it inquires about its role in national canon-formation. It looks at how the short story composite has been read by cultural nationalist critics, and it also considers at how second-wave feminists used and interpreted the form in the service of their &#147;domestic&#148; fictions in the 1980s. It proceeds to inquire into how the form has certain links with the project of historiographical metafiction that was popularized in the 1990s as writers and postcolonial academics attempted to come to terms with the history of colonization and its aftermath, and as postmodern theory began to favour openly fictional contestations of grand-unified, celebratory narratives of the national past. Finally, it considers links between the form of the short story composite and the fractured, multiple narratives of trauma. It tracks the emergence of the &#147;trauma industry&#148; in the academy, and reads trauma composites that emerge in the late twentieth century as forms that exploit and respond to the popular appetite for colonial trauma, most especially. Many studies of the short story composite have been formalist in their nature. Other studies of the form have looked at how it expresses the needs of various &#147;ethnic&#148; groups. The formalism of the first set often relies upon an old-fashioned universalism that overlooks cultural factors. Further, the dichotomy between these two sets reveals an unacknowledged racialist bias. It is no longer acceptable to view &#147;ethnicity&#148; and &#147;race&#148; as something only deployed or possessed by ethnic groups struggling to overcome oppression. Recent theorizing has noticed that these assumptions only reinforce dominant racial myths and stereotypes and further serve to discriminate between who is &#147;at home&#148; in the nation, and who is an outsider. This suggests that it might be fruitful to also interrogate how settlers have used the form to negotiate their claims to place, their negotiations of home, their ties to community and nation, and their shifting relations to the colonial past and the imagined postcolonial future. This study seeks to bridge these two dominant forms of studying the short story composite to attend to the cultural uses of the form in settler cultures, by settlers, in their varying processes of acculturation and nation-narration and in their quest for postcolonial status.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158607</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Graduate Overeducation in Australia</field><field name="creator">Kler, Parvinder Singh</field><field name="description">Australia has witnessed a massive increase in tertiary educated labour force participants, and especially so in the last 30 years. Thus, a study into graduate overeducation in Australia is pertinent in understanding this increasingly important subset of the labour force. This thesis is the first investigation of graduate overeducation in Australia. It seeks to investigate the depth of this phenomenon among various graduate sub-groups in the labour market, including females and immigrants. The thesis hopes to broaden current knowledge by offering a comprehensive account of graduate overeducation in Australia from various perspectives. There is no universalistic theory of overeducation from which a multitude of theories and assumptions can be tried and tested. Hence, this thesis begins by defining the phenomenon before discussing the various theories and methods used to study overeducation. This is especially necessary given the paucity of research into overeducation in Australia. This thesis utilises a variety of measures and datasets to study graduate overeducation in Australia. The commonly employed Over, Under and Required (ORU) earnings function is used as the main measure of calculating returns to overeducation while the Job Analysis / Objective measure is the main method utilised in calculating incidences of graduate overeducation. The thesis does however depart from standard tests of overeducation in a number of respects. First, it controls for self selection into employment in determining the causes of graduate overeducation by using bivariate probit models. Second, it uses a synthetic panel dataset to control for unobserved heterogeneity which potentially bias results obtained from cross-sectional datasets. Third, it utilises an immigrant-specific longitudinal dataset that provides a natural experiment to assess changes in policy and their effect on graduate overeducation in Australia among immigrant groups. Fourth, it provides some of the first econometric evidence on the relationship between various measures of workplace satisfaction and graduate overeducation. Incidences of graduate overeducation are sensitive to measurement method used but it is clear that it is pervasive in the labour market. The likelihood of graduate overeducation is influenced by characteristics and background. For example, younger graduates are more prone to mismatch, which may suggest that overeducation is a temporary phase for some graduates. The returns to required and surplus education largely match the stylised facts except for young males, who enjoy better returns to surplus rather than required education. The use of a synthetic panel dataset illustrates that cross-sectional datasets are subject to possible bias. Specifically, it appears that the returns to required and surplus education from the cross-sectional datasets used are downwardly biased. An examination of overeducation amongst tertiary educated immigrants produces results showing diverse outcomes based upon their backgrounds. English speaking background (ESB) immigrants perform well in the labour market, at times better than native-born Australians while Asian non-English speaking background (NESB) immigrants do very poorly, with very high incidences of overeducation. Returns to surplus education are small, and at times insignificant, indicating that overeducated immigrants are particularly heavily penalised for their excess education. The analysis also identifies that the tightening of entry requirements and restricting access to welfare that occurred during the period of analysis increased the incidences of overeducation. Bivariate probit models control for potential endogeneity when investigating links between job satisfaction and graduate overeducation. Results indicate that overeducated graduates are less satisfied with pay, work, job flexibility and overall job satisfaction compared with job-matched graduates but have higher levels of satisfaction with job security. However, overall levels of satisfaction remain high; this indicates that satisfaction should be viewed from a relative, rather than absolute perspective. Together, these results illustrate various factors that have contributed to the rise in graduate overeducation in the last decade and some of the implications that may arise from this. Moreover, the findings indicate that policy development in a number of areas is required to address issues of misallocation of Human Capital resources.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158286</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Germination and Dormancy of Australian Native Grass Species Used for Minesite Rehabilitation</field><field name="creator">Farley, Grus John</field><field name="description">In response to a greater awareness of the impact of modern mining upon the environment, rehabilitation of degraded land is moving towards an ecologically sustainable end use. In many cases upon closure of mining activities there is a requirement to create sustainable native vegetation communities and this requires all species to be re-established, often from germinated seed. Many Australian pre-mined or developed plant communities consist of tree, shrub, forb and grass species and any attempt to re-construct a sustainable plant community should include suitable examples from each of these categories, if not the same species and in comparable proportions. Problems arise when these species fail to establish in the field resulting in a reduction in biodiversity, or in the case of grasses, supplementation with easy-to-establish exotic species. One of the reasons for the poor performance of native grasses in rehabilitation projects is believed to be seed quality, particularly the presence of seed dormancy. An understanding of the causes of seed dormancy in native grass species, and how to overcome it, will increase the success of these species in further rehabilitation projects. Results from this study indicated that although dormancy was an issue in relation to poor germination of native grass species, it is not the only problem and it is just as important to recognise other aspects of seed quality, such as seed fill and viability. Four species including Neurachne alopecuroides (11 &#177; 2 %), Triodia longiceps (26 &#177; 2 %), Themeda triandra (41 &#177; 6 %) and Sarga timorense (48 &#177; 2 %) presented less than 50 % seed fill when typical field collections were assessed, with N. alopecuroides (11 &#177; 2 %) and T. longiceps (22 &#177; 1 %) also having very low levels of seed viability. Seed dormancy was found to affect the final germination and/or the rate at which germination occurred for all species within the laboratory, which may have important implications in the field. Mechanisms of dormancy were found in the outer structures of the seed (the hull), the seed coat (testa and pericarp) and also within the seed embryo. Several species were found to have more than one mechanism preventing germination of at least a portion of its seed. This knowledge may allow rehabilitators to overcome dormancy in these species, whilst leaving some dormancy to ensure temporal germination of the seeds in the first few years. An understanding of the causes of dormancy will help in the development of practical methods to over come or remove it. In a detailed study into the mechanism of dormancy the covering structures around the seed (hull) of Themeda triandra were found to not influence the uptake of water, but rather the distribution, whilst the seed coat reduced some oxygen uptake in both T. triandra and Astrebla squarrosa. Both of these results could reduce the germination of &#147;healthy&#148; seeds initially with the &#147;barriers&#148; breaking down with time or through other treatments. The use of smoke or smoke water is one method that has been shown to overcome seed dormancy and increase the germination of native grass seed, although further investigation is required to fully understand its mode of action. Six of seven species tested showed a significant increase (Brachyachne convergens [53 %], Sorghum stipoideum [50 %], Themeda triandra [30 %], Astrebla squarrosa [43 %], Enneapogon nigricans [44 %] and Chloris truncata [17 %]) in germination of dormant seed after the application of smoke water. It is recommended that smoke is an effective tool in overcoming dormancy in native grass species but of some concern though, is the lack of quality control in smoke used in experimental studies. To overcome this, an apparatus was constructed to produce smoke water under reproducible conditions, thus allowing more precise studies to be made within the laboratory. Such precise studies may help to increase the effectiveness of smoke as a dormancy breaking tool and allow it to be used on a much larger scale than laboratory conditions allow. The response to smoke was found to differ between different populations of T. triandra and this was due to the degree of dormancy expressed for each population, a variable that may be affected by genetic diversity and/or environmental conditions. The environment in which a seed develops on the parent plant and a plant&#146;s location or genetic composition may also affect the ability of a seed to germinate successfully. A series of studies demonstrated that air temperature and soil moisture levels in which a plant produces seed may alter the quality of that seed and its expression of dormancy for an individual species, though no pattern was established for native grasses in general. Finally, seed storage and how it can affect seed viability and dormancy was explored. It was found that seed stored at +23 oC generally increased in germination primarily due to the loss of dormancy, though this was accompanied by a significant decrease in viability for some species. Whilst viability of the seed stored at -18 oC was maintained, germination did not increase due to the lack of dormancy loss. Freezing dried seed appears to be a viable way to store seed for long periods of time without any appreciable loss of viability, though seed would require treatment to alleviate dormancy before being used in the field. This research aimed to explore, locate and understand the mechanisms of dormancy in native grasses, for the purposes of improving the rates of germination in rehabilitated areas. Specific seed structural traits were found to influence the germination rates, and techniques were developed to overcome dormancy mechanisms. While these techniques may be applied to native grass seed with reproducible results within populations, storage and environmental conditions were found to impact on the degrees of dormancy and germinability of seed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158398</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk factors for cancers of the oesophagus</field><field name="creator">Sadeghi, Shahram</field><field name="description">Background Oesophageal adenocarcinomas including adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus (OAC) and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagogastric junction (OGJAC) were previously rare tumours; however in recent decades the incidence has risen faster than all other cancers in developed countries including Australia. Various factors including gastro-oesophageal acid reflux, smoking, obesity and alcohol consumption have all been implicated as risk factors for these cancers although whether the association is causal remains unclear. It has previously been suggested that people who regularly use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may experience lower rates of epithelial cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, including OAC, OGJAC and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). A population-based case control study was undertaken to identify major risk factors for oesophageal cancers and to examine associations between exposure to NSAIDs and risk of these cancers. Furthermore it was sought to determine the prevalence of molecular changes in oesophageal adenocarcinomas, especially expression of genes related to metabolism of NSAIDs by staining the tumour tissues to cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) as well as factors related to cell division (p53 and p16). Methods In a population-based case-control study in Australia, patients with OAC (N=367), OGJAC (N=426) and OSCC (N=308) were identified through hospitals and cancer registries. Control participants, frequency matched by age, sex and state to the cases, were sampled from a population register (N=1580). Data for this study were collected from consenting participants through a main study questionnaire and a telephone interview. The main study questionnaire included information on medical and family history, personal behaviors, and exposure to a range of environmental factors during specified periods of life. Interviews conducted by study nurses collected more detailed information concerning timing and frequency of use of therapeutic drugs, and about symptoms and the events leading to diagnosis for cases. Estimation of the relative risks by odds ratio (OR) and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) was done by simple and multivariable analysis using logistic regression models. For the laboratory part of this study 350 tumour blocks related to 161 patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma were obtained from diagnostic laboratories. Sections of tumour tissue were prepared from the blocks and used for immunohistochemical analysis using the p53, p16 and COX-2 antibodies. Staining of the sections was scored in collaboration with a histopathologist to quantify the amount and intensity of positive staining to each of the antibodies. Associations between potential risk factors and negatively- and positively-staining tumours were assessed using case-control analysis and case-case analyses. Cases positive and negative for biomarkers were separately compared with controls and with each other using logistic regression. By doing this analysis ORs were calculated for each biomarker. Results In risk factor analysis it was found that cigarette smoking, obesity and gastro-oesophageal acid reflux increased the risk of OAC. For OGJAC however, the risk increase was found to be slightly higher for smoking and slightly lower for obesity and reflux than was observed for OAC. Alcohol was not found to have a significant association with any type of oesophageal adenocarcinoma, however people who drank 21 or more drinks per week were found to have an increased risk of OSCC. Moreover, smoking was identified to be the strongest risk factor for OSCC. Obesity was not found to be a risk factor for OSCC, in fact being overweight or obese slightly reduced the risk of OSCC. High frequency of reflux was identified as an intermediate risk factor for OSCC. The effect of smoking cessation on reducing the risk of oesophageal cancer was also examined for almost all types of oesophageal cancer and it was identified that; while smoking cessation for more than 20 years reduces the risk, smoking remained a significant risk factor especially for OGJAC and OSCC. Any exposure to NSAIDs was inversely associated with risk of all types of oesophageal cancer. Observed associations did not lose their significance after adjustment for other factors; in fact, associations were slightly strengthened after adjustment. This study found somewhat greater risk reductions among regular users of NSAIDs than occasional users, and there was greater risk reduction among people who used these medications more recently (in the last 10 years) than people who used them in the past (more than 10 years ago). Moreover these analyses revealed a dose response association between total number of the tablets and risk of all type of oesophageal cancer after excluding conditions related to very short periods of consumption (headache and period pain). Finally, for the specific types of medications, there was a suggestion that use of aspirin was associated with greater risk reduction than traditional NSAIDs, and that COX-2 specific medications were not found to be superior to other NSAIDs in reducing the risk of oesophageal cancer. In the tumour staining studies, expression of p53 and COX-2 proteins was noted in over three quarters of tumours; for p16 a third of the tumour tissues stained positively. This expression level reduced considerably for tissues with dysplasia, staining levels were negligible in normal oesophageal squamous epithelium. No substantial differences were observed in the associations with NSAIDs and other risk factors for oesophageal adenocarcinoma among tumours with and without staining among used antibodies. However a few non-significant differences were observed among immunonegative and immunopositive cases stained for COX-2 in regards to their exposure to NSAIDs and reflux. Observed ORs for NSAIDs exposure among cases with positive staining was lower than OR observed for negative staining, on the other hand, among cases with daily reflux associations were in the opposite direction with slightly higher OR observed in the immunopositive stratum. Conclusion Smoking, obesity and reflux were identified as independent risk factors for both OAC and OGJAC, and exposure to NSAIDs reduced the risk of oesophageal cancers. For cases with OAC and OGJAC, the risk reduction was more significant for people with history of reflux and to a lower extent among people with history of smoking. The protective effect of NSAIDs against reflux was supported (although weakly) with the findings of the IHC analysis as cases with more positive staining to COX-2 had more risk reduction for oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC and OGJAC combined) by being exposed to NSAIDs. Findings from this observational study therefore support the notion that NSAIDs reduce the risk of oesophageal cancer. A definitive test for this hypothesis can only come from a randomised controlled trial among patients with high risk for oesophageal adenocarcinoma.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158608</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bivalves and the Bucephalidae: A parasitic system on the Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="creator">Bott, Nathan James</field><field name="description">This study set out to examine, for the first time, both the molluscan intermediate and the teleost definitive hosts of a major assemblage of trematode parasites present on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The parasite taxon was the Bucephalidae which occur in piscivorous fishes as sexually reproducing adults and in bivalves as asexually reproducing stages. The goal was to characterise the overall richness of the system and to explore patterns of host-specificity. Because of the size of this fauna it was not possible to incorporate all the taxa found in this study. This thesis reports the results of a survey of bivalves from this region, taxonomic studies on several elements of the fauna of fishes, and efforts to link life-cycles between bivalves and fishes. I surveyed 2256 bivalve individuals (47 species, 17 families) from South-east Queensland, Heron Island (southern GBR) and Lizard Island (northern GBR). Infections of trematode species from three families, Bucephalidae, Gorgoderidae and Monorchiidae, were found. Overall prevalence of infection was 2.3%. The Bucephalidae (11 species) was the most commonly found family. A single gorgoderid infection was found from a venerid, Lioconcha castrensis. This is the first report of a gorgoderid from a marine bivalve and phylogenetic analysis suggests that the species belongs to the Gorgoderinae. Monorchiids (5 species) were found from Tellinidae and Lucinidae. All infections are new host/parasite records. I deduce that this study produced lifecycle information, but no actual identifications, for 10% of the species of trematodes that infect bivalves of Queensland marine waters. Prosorhynchoides apogonis n. sp. is described from the intestine of the apogonid Cheilodipterus macrodon from the southern GBR. This is the first bucephalid to be described from the teleost family Apogonidae. Prosorhynchoides lamprelli n. sp. is described from the intestine of the carangid Caranx papuensis from off Lizard Island, GBR. This is the first bucephalid to be described from Caranx papuensis. A new trematode genus, Grammatorcynicola n. g. (Dolichoenterinae), and two new species, G. brayi n. sp. and G. nolani n. sp., are described from the intestines of the scombrids, Grammatorcynus bicarinatus and Gr. bilineatus respectively. Grammatorcynicola n. g. differs from other dolichoenterine genera in having a simple sucker-like rhynchus, the ovary anterior to the testes and by not having a particularly thick cirrus-sac wall. Six new species of bucephalid trematodes from the prosorhynchine bucephalid genera Prosorhynchus Odhner, 1905 and Neidhartia Nagaty, 1937 are reported from the epinepheline serranid genera Cephalopholis, Cromileptes, Epinephelus and Variola from the GBR. Two species of Prosorhynchus and one Neidhartia are reported from Epinephelus spp., P. jexi n. sp. from E. quoyanus, P. lafii n. sp. from E. fuscoguttatus, and N. epinepheli n. sp. from E. maculatus. The other species are P. robertsthomsoni n. sp. from several species of Cephalopholis, P. conorjonesi n. sp. from Cromileptes altivelis, and P. milleri n. sp. from Variola louti. I examined three species of Plectropomus (Serranidae: Epinephelinae), Pl. laevis, Pl. leopardus and Pl. maculatus from off Heron Island and Lizard Island on the GBR. Nine bucephalid species from the Prosorhynchinae were found, three species of Neidhartia and six species of Prosorhynchus. The three species of Neidhartia, N. haywardi n. sp., N. plectropomi n. sp. and N. tyleri n. sp., are readily distinguishable by morphology. Two of the six species of Prosorhynchus (P. lesteri n. sp. and P. wrightae n. sp.) are easily distinguished from their other congeners by morphology but the other four species (P. adlardi n. sp., P. heronensis n. sp., P. munozae n. sp. and P. plectropomi n. sp.) are highly similar in morphology and were only distinguished convincingly by comparing their ITS2 rDNA sequences. Both P. adlardi n. sp. and P. wrightae n. sp. have also been found once in V. louti at Lizard Island. This is also the first study to identify life-cycle matches of the Bucephalidae using molecular techniques. I found two perfect life-cycle matches (identical sequences). The bivalve host of Prosorhynchoides lamprelli is a tellinid, Exotica clathrata; Rhipidocotyle sp. from the sphyraenid Sphyraena jello also has E. clathrata as its first intermediate host. Bayesian Inference Analysis shows that all seven species from bivalves that were sequenced belong to the Bucephalinae. Perhaps the most striking finding of the study was that one bivalve species, E. clathrata, was shown to harbour four separate species. Matching of ITS2 rDNA sequences between life-cycle stages is highly effective in circumstances of great richness such as the Great Barrier Reef. Based on my data collected, the total bucephalid species in the system is estimated to be 84.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300508 Parasitology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158287</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utilising Airborne Bistatic Radar for Target Detection and Imaging</field><field name="creator">Palmer, James Edward</field><field name="description">In bistatic radar, a spatially separated transmitter and receiver are employed for target detection and/or imaging. The use of bistatic geometries has implications for the apparent Radar Cross Sections (RCS) of targets and can allow detection of targets that are stealthy in monostatic (i.e. collocated transmitter and receiver) scenarios. Bistatic radar has been an on-going area of research since the original development of radar early last century. However, it has only been with the recent improvement of signal processors that the full possibilities of the bistatic geometry may be investigated. In this thesis, we consider a number of variations on the standard bistatic geometry and employ several novel detection and imaging algorithms that exploit some of the advantages provided by bistatic radar geometries. Specifically we consider the Shadow Detection technique, the Emulated Bistatic Radar (EBR), the EBR for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging, inverse SAR (ISAR) imaging and interferometric purposes, as well as bistatic ISAR imaging. The Shadow Detection technique utilises the variation of the received signal power from constantly transmitting satellite sources, such as the GNSS satellite systems, as a detection method. Two signals are received by an airborne receiver that is flying over the open ocean. The first signal is the direct Line of Sight (LOS) from the satellite, whilst the second is received from the sea surface reflection in the quasi-specular region. Both signals are studied for signal strength variations that are otherwise unexplained by any variation in the system geometry, and in the case of the sea surface reflected signal, by sea surface scatterer variation. The presence of an unexplained signal strength variation may indicate the presence of a target somewhere along either of the received signal paths. In this part of the thesis, consideration is given to the detectability of targets and at what range they can be detected, as well as what signal modulation effects are introduced to the received signal as a result of the target&#146;s presence, which would assist in target size and range determination. We consider theoretical, simulated and experimental results in support of this detection and ranging technique. The Emulated Bistatic Radar (EBR) detection technique is similar to the Shadow Detection technique in that it utilises the reflective nature of the sea&#146;s surface, however in the EBR we employ an active airborne monostatic radar as opposed to the parasitic use of illuminators of opportunity. The EBR uses the sea surface to create an indirect illumination path to the target, whilst focusing its receiver on the target directly. This introduces a bistatic angle into the detection geometry that will change the apparent RCS of the target. For low monostatic RCS targets, this RCS gain could be such that the effective detection range and probability of detection of the radar is improved. We also explore the use of the EBR with highly coherent imaging techniques such as SAR, ISAR and interferometry. In this thesis, we present a theoretical discussion with simulated, experimental, and real world results that verifies the usability of EBR in these imaging scenarios. Lastly, we consider the use of conventional bistatic radar geometries with ISAR imaging. In this section we present a theoretical discussion, as well as simulated and experimental results that demonstrate the viability of using ISAR imaging techniques with conventional bistatic geometries.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158399</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical and Biological Studies of Cyclotides</field><field name="creator">Plan, Manual Rey Ra&amp;ntildea</field><field name="description">The cyclotides are an interesting family of naturally occurring macrocyclic peptides that are highly stable and possess a diversity of biological activities, including uterotonic, haemolytic, anti-HIV, neurotensin antagonist, anti-microbial, trypsin inhibitory, anti-tumour/cytotoxic and insecticidal activity. Their chemical stability, as demonstrated by their resistance to proteolytic degradation and capacity to withstand extreme temperature and pH conditions, is attributed to their unique protein structural motif termed the cyclic cystine knot (CCK), which is composed of a cyclised peptide backbone and a knotted disulfide topology, where two disulfide bridges and their connecting backbone segments form an embedded ring that is threaded by a third disulfide bond. In this project, the cyclotides were investigated for their potential use as naturally occurring crop protection agents against a number of economically important agricultural pests. However, the study was broader than this and included the discovery of novel cyclotides, bioassays and NMR studies. Chapters 1 and 2 provide an introduction to the topics and describe the materials and methods, respectively. Chapter 3 describes the complete suite of cyclotides present in the African plant Oldenlandia affinis, characterised by LC-MS, MS-MS, total amino acid analyses and UV-visible scans. This study expanded the total number of known cyclotides in this plant to 17, of which nine new sequences were characterised. In addition, five cyclotide derivatives containing oxidation products of tryptophan were identified, including oxindolylalanine, n-formylkynurenine, and kynurenine derivatives. Furthermore, two linear derivatives of cyclotides were described. These acyclic derivatives have three intact disulfide bonds, and their N- and C- termini coincide with the hypothesised cleavage site from the precursor protein. This work has increased knowledge about sequence variation accommodated by the CCK scaffold, confirms its applicability as a template for drug design, and also shows the first natural degradation pathways for the cyclotides. These degradation pathways have important implications on the half-life of the cyclotides, and hence their persistence and environmental fate if used in agriculture. The The molluscicidal activity of members of the cyclotide family is reported in Chapter 4. Pure and crude cyclotide extracts from O. affinis and the ornamental groundcover Viola odorata were found to have molluscicidal activities against the most important pest in wetland rice production, the golden apple snail (GAS), Pomacea canliculata. Crude cyclotide mixtures from V. odorata and O. affinis both have molluscicidal activities, the former being more potent than the latter. The 24 h LC[subscript]50 for kalata B1, B2 and metaldehyde, a known molluscicide, were determined at 90, 54 and 105 &#181;M, respectively. At 65 &#181;M, pure cyclotides from V. odorata, namely cycloviolacin O1 and kalata S, both caused 100% GAS mortality while kalata B1, B2 and metaldehyde caused 78, 68 and 60% mortality, respectively. Kalata B7 was weakly active, while kalata B8 did not have molluscicidal activity. The possible downstream effects of the cyclotides on non-target freshwater (Nile tilapia) and saltwater (brine shrimp) marine organisms were investigated. The studies showed that kalata B1was only mildly toxic to brine shrimp compared to podophyllotoxin, a known cytotoxic agent. Similarly, kalata B2 was at least three times less toxic to Nile tilapia than rotenone, a known piscicidal agent. Autolytic degradation sites in present cyclotides have been identified in exposed inter-cysteine loops, particularly among the Trp and Gly residues. Knowledge of these autolytic degradation sites gives insights into how the half-life of these novel molluscicidal agents can be manipulated to ensure a balance between efficacy on pests and proper degradation in the environment. In Chapter 5, members of the cyclotide family were tested on three nematode species, Caenorhabditis elegans, Meloidogyne javanica and Radopholus similis, to investigate their potential use as nematicidal agents. The results show that the cyclotides have nematicidal activities comparable to, if not better than, the known nematicidal agent fenamiphos. Although active at hundreds of micromolar concentrations, the mortality rate increased with increasing time of treatment. It was also found that C. elegans, M. javanica and R. similis have different degrees of susceptibility to the peptides. Different cyclotides have varying haemolytic activities, but compared to melittin the cyclotides are only mildly haemolytic. The pesticidal mode of action of the cyclotides is yet to be fully elucidated but appears to involve more than just their capacity to disrupt cell membranes, their hydrophobicity, or their CCK topology. The varying pesticidal potencies of different cyclotides show that their activities are based on their sequence variations. Kalata B2 was not phytotoxic to tomatoes, suggesting that cyclotides can potentially be used as a soil drench or in seed treatment for nematode control without adverse effects on crops. Alternatively, transgenic plants can be created to specifically express cyclotides in their roots to protect them from nematode infestation. In Chapter 6, cyclotides with insecticidal activities were identified and their possible mode of action was elucidated. It was confirmed that fresh O. affinis leaves contain insecticidal agents. Cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) larvae fed with young fully-expanded leaves did not grow beyond first instar and died three days after treatment. In a search for putative insecticidal peptides in O. affinis, kalata B2 was identified as the major leaf-specific peptide that was expressed in both winter and summer. Kalata B5 was identified as a differentially-expressed peptide in the aerial parts of the plant during winter, when the plant is at its reproductive phase, possibly to protect its flowers and pods from insect attack. Therefore, the insecticidal properties of kalata B2 and B5 were investigated and compared against those of kalata B1. Assays on H. armigera larvae fed on an artificial soya bean diet showed that kalata B5 is a potent insecticidal peptide, killing 100% of the treated population after four days of treatment, while kalata B2 had a similar activity as kalata B1, with 27.5% and 20.0% mortality, respectively. Nevertheless, kalata B1 and B2 inhibited the growth and development of the surviving larvae by 75.4 and 70.8%, respectively. Results from a protein blot assay of the insect frass showed that the larvae did ingest the peptides from the artificial diet and that the peptides were not degraded even after passing through the insect gut. The possible modes of action of kalata B1, as demonstrated in the human body lice (Pedicularis humanus humanus) assays, was mainly systemic- and to some extent contact-, but not repellent-insecticidal. In Chapter 7, the three-dimensional structure of kalata B5 was determined by NMR spectroscopy and was compared to the structures of kalata B1 and B2 in an endeavour to elucidate the observed differences in insecticidal activity reported in Chapter 6. Kalata B5 was also compared to the prototypic bracelet cyclotide, cycloviolacin O1. Detailed structural studies were conducted on all four peptides by subjecting them to various pH and temperature conditions. Kalata B5 adopts a cyclic cystine knot motif. Its solution structure can be described as a well-defined bracelet structure consisting of 30 amino acids with a cyclised peptide backbone, a cystine knot core, a region of &amp;#946-sheet, a 3[subscript]10 helix, and a number of &amp;#946-turns. Although kalata B1 and B2 adopt a similar global fold, they lack the 3[subscript]10 helix in loop 3 that is present in kalata B5. Nevertheless, for all four peptides, it was found that residues in loop 3 interacted with the conserved Glu3 residue in loop 1 to stabilise the structure of the peptide during the deprotonation. While the amino acid composition of kalata B5 is significantly different to that of B1 and B2, many of the intra-molecular hydrogen-bonds identified were situated in similar places within the inter-cysteine loops. However, a number of residues in loops 2, 3 and 5 are not hydrogen bonded, and could potentially form hydrogen-bond interactions with a putative receptor. The surface representations of the three peptides highlighted these obvious differences and found that loops 2 and 3 in kalata B5 formed a region of hydrophobic patch, while in kalata B1 and B2 this region is predominantly hydrophilic. In addition, loop 5 in kalata B5 consists of charged residues, while this region is substituted by hydrophobic residues in kalata B1 and B2. Overall, this project has confirmed the potential use of the cyclotides as naturally occurring pesticidal agents against a number of economically important agricultural pests. The project elucidated the gross modes of action, the downstream effects on non-target aquatic organisms, the degradation pathways and the phytotoxic effects of the cyclotides. It also contributed in the discovery of novel cyclotides, including some modified and linear derivatives. Finally, this project resulted in the structure elucidation of kalata B5 and identified the important roles of particular residues in the activity and structural stability of the cyclotides.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158288</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality of Life: Conceptualising measurement for client outcomes in hospital social work</field><field name="creator">Felton, Kathleen Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The current research examines the nature and scope of client quality of life (QOL) outcomes as impacted upon by social workers in general hospitals. A new QOL instrument is conceptualised and qualitatively tested with social work clients in a hospital setting. The thesis has three broad aims, which are: 1) to explore and examine the nature and scope of client outcomes in an Australian public hospital; 2) to conceptualise a method to measure these outcomes that is in keeping with client-centred practice and the values of the social work profession and 3) to prepare and qualitatively pre-test an instrument to assess social work sensitive outcomes in a general hospital. In recent years, there has been a burgeoning of interest in outcomes and outcomes measurement generally, as part of a broader &#145;outcomes movement&#146;. National and international literature, however, indicates that social work has lagged behind with regard to the conceptualisation and measurement of outcomes. Importantly, client perspectives are often marginalised in the contested discourse of the outcomes movement. The current research aims to centrally locate the stories of social work clients regarding the impact of social work interventions on their QOL. To address the complexity of the social work role in general hospitals and the inexactitude in the literature regarding the nature and scope of social work outcomes, seven experienced practitioners, administrators and academics in the health field participated in a modified Delphi process. The aim of this process was to develop a degree of consensus regarding parameters of social work client outcomes in hospital settings. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), which is widely touted as a framework from which to develop outcome indicators for client functioning, was utilised to develop a questionnaire. Two round of the modified Delphi process were electronically administered. The quantitative data gathered were analysed through simple statistical analysis. Open-ended data were thematically analysed. The findings indicated that thirteen categories from the ICF classification were perceived by practitioners as relevant to social work practice in general hospitals. In order to centrally locate subjective perspectives of client well-being in the study, fourteen former social work clients were recruited from the Royal Brisbane and Women&#146;s Hospital (RBWH), Queensland, Australia. Focussed interviews were conducted with individual participants. The content of the interviews addressed the impact of social work services on their QOL and data relating to the conceptualisation of QOL, including: time taken for effects to be perceived; relative importance of QOL outcomes; permeability of outcomes; intermediate and ultimate outcomes and the process-outcome linkage. The data were pooled across participants and analysed thematically. Data were managed with NVivo software. A number of categories of client outcomes emerged from the participants&#146; accounts. These categories were: emotional well-being including mood, identification and expression of feelings; self-concept including ideas and feelings about self; developing a sense of control over feelings, thoughts and behaviours; quality of relationships with important others; having information about services, health and illness, personal development; acquiring strategies and skills to manage psychosocial well-being; acquiring the ability to manage stress and anxiety; achieving and maintaining basic financial security; achieving and maintaining personal independence within and outside the home; acquiring a safe and appropriate place to live, including nursing home and hostel placement; acquisition of goods and services to ensure personal well-being; the ability to participate in community life; maintenance of personal rights, which is inclusive of the right to self-determination, legal rights as a citizen and protection against discrimination and spirituality. Within each broad dimension, a range of sub-themes emerged. Based on the data collated from the practitioners, administrators, academics and clients, the ICF, along with insights from the literature relating to QOL and client outcomes, a draft QOL instrument called the Quality of Life &#150; Social Work (QOL-SW) was designed to capture objective and subjective experiences of well-being across seven broad domains and fifteen facets. The final component of the component of the study incorporated qualitative instrument pre-testing. Eight former social work clients were recruited in individual structured interviews utilising a &#145;think aloud&#146; process as they completed the instrument. The participants were also requested to respond to a number of questions about the format, relevance and interpretability of the instrument. Based on the findings of this component of the study, a number of revisions were made to the instrument. The thesis concludes with a draft instrument ready for quantitative testing. The implications of this research centre on enhanced client-centred practice and research within general hospital settings. Importantly, enhanced practice requires greater clarity with regard to client outcomes. Such clarity will increase practitioners&#146; ability to develop effective intervention plans, leading to improved outcomes for clients. Furthermore, it is asserted that through increased clarity regarding client outcomes, social work practitioners are better able to facilitate clients&#146; participation in the development of individualised intervention plans. In the research domain, it is asserted that clarity regarding outcomes will allow efficacy researchers to develop more specific and targeted research questions. Furthermore, the draft instrument will potentially provide researchers with a tool to quantitatively measure the range of outcomes relevant to social work clients in the context of general hospitals. It is asserted that this will provide researchers with the capacity to answer the question, &#145;What works for whom and under what circumstances?&#146;</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158609</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Specifying and Verifying Key Distribution Protocols: A Layered Approach</field><field name="creator">Long, Benjamin Wallace</field><field name="description">Digital communication is secured by applying cryptographic functions, most notably encryption using cryptographic keys, to prescribed sequences of messages called security protocols. Key distribution protocols are security protocols executed by agents wishing to establish cryptographic keys for future secure communication with each other. Although key distribution protocols are supposedly secure themselves, they may be attacked by intruders that forge messages by clever manipulation, tricking protocol agents into interacting with them, and violating fundamental security goals such as confidentiality and authentication. Key distribution protocols can be studied at various layers of abstraction, focusing on different aspects of security. Traditionally, such protocols are described using a &#145;standard notation&#146; that tends to leave several important details regarding the various layers implicit. This makes proving the protocols&#146; correctness difficult. Also, implementers and users of security protocol analysis tools are forced to fill in the gaps where these notations are ambiguous, a process which is errorprone. Therefore, a lack of precise detail in the protocols&#146; specifications at any of the layers can lead to protocol insecurity. &#145;Formal methods&#146; provide well-defined languages that allow precise specifications to be written and subsequent rigorous verification procedures to be performed. Hence formal methods are strongly advocated for security protocol development, especially to specify precise details that commonly-used notations leave implicit, to analyse specifications for vulnerability to attack, and to verify protocol goals and claims of security on those specifications. Previously-published approaches to formal analysis of key distribution protocols are largely based on specifications at the application layer. However, it has been shown in practice that protocols can be vulnerable to attack at any abstraction layer. In particular, by relying on application layer specifications, proofs of correctness may not be accurate with respect to the implementation of the protocol at the lower presentation layer. Motivated by this risk, we provide a general approach for formally specifying key distribution protocols at various layers of abstraction, in a way amenable to formal verification techniques such as model checking and theorem proving. We follow a structured approach in which we consider each layer of abstraction individually to avoid unnecessary complexity. Additionally, our approach allows us to perform cross-layer verification to identify whether implementationdependent type flaw attacks suspected at the application layer are actually possible given the protocol&#146;s presentation layer design, and to confirm the required presentation layer defences for inclusion in the formal specification. At the trust layer we demonstrate how trust can be incorporated in specifications of key distribution for a more complete understanding of how key distribution and trust management components depend on each other. We provide an abstract specification of a key distributing agent and a hierarchy of &#145;suspicious&#146; agents based on existing trust management models. As an example, we combine a suspicious agent with the abstract specification of key distribution, and add custom behaviour to precisely describe the key validation policy taken by Pretty Good Privacy. At the authentication layer we demonstrate an approach for identifying the behaviour required by protocol agents to correctly authenticate messages they receive. We identify a series of message authentication protocols, each identifying properties and behaviours of protocol agents for achieving a particular aspect of authentication. By identifying message authentication protocols as subprotocols of a particular key distribution protocol design, we identify those messages that can be authenticated and the properties and behaviours of that design are necessary for doing so. At the application layer we demonstrate how to formalise the behaviour necessary for participating in key distribution protocols, including necessary behaviour identified by authentication layer analyses. We present a generic message structure for specifying the types of recursively-defined messages that may be needed in key distribution protocols. Verification techniques such as model checking and formal proof are applied to find attacks and to determine whether suspected attacks are actually possible given our detailed specifications. At the presentation layer the generic message structure is modified for reasoning with implementation-dependent attacks that rely on presentation layer behaviour. By making presentation layer detail transparent, our specifications are consistent with those at the application layer, thus improving readability and simplifying translation for input to off-the-shelf analysis tools.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158400</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional Characterisation of the role of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase CD148 in Macrophages</field><field name="creator">Dave, Richa</field><field name="description">Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) represent a biochemical counterbalance to the activity of protein tyrosine kinases, thus regulating the dynamic phosphorylation state of a cell and controlling diverse physiological processes. In macrophages, tyrosine phosphorylation regulates many signalling pathways including growth, differentiation, activation, phagocytosis and adhesion. This study aimed at the functional characterisation of the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase CD148 in macrophages. The transcriptional regulation of ptprj (which encodes for CD148) in mouse and human mononuclear phagocytic cells was characterised. The expression of ptprj was found to be highest in macrophages, myelomonocytic cell lines and macrophage-enriched tissues. Ptprj expression was down-regulated by the macrophage growth and differentiation factor macrophage colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and significantly up-regulated by bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CpG DNA. Both ptprj transcript and protein were induced and found to be associated with disease progression in mouse chronic inflammatory disease models. In vitro knockdown studies of ptprj using RNAi constructs confirmed that ptprj regulates macrophage activation and proliferation. Attempts to overexpress ptprj in mice in a macrophage-specific manner were unsuccessful, further suggesting that ptprj inhibits macrophage proliferation and/or differentiation. Following stimulation of bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMMs) with CSF-1 and LPS, there was a redistribution and association of CD148 with membrane ruffles, F-actin and Pyk2 suggesting a role for CD148 in regulating macrophage morphology in response to these stimuli. Treatment of BMMs with anti-CD148 monoclonal antibody inhibited CSF-1 induced macrophage spreading, cytoskeletal changes and chemotaxis, without affecting CSF-1 receptor downstream signalling and cell survival, thereby negatively regulating a subset of CSF-1 receptor responses in macrophages. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that CD148 is a regulator of macrophage activity and inflammation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158610</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE EFFECTS OF EARLY LIFE UNDERNUTRITION ON LONGEVITY AND ASPECTS OF AGEING OF THE RODENT BRAIN</field><field name="creator">Partadiredja, Ginus</field><field name="description">Diet restriction has been widely acknowledged among gerontologists as a method to delay or retard ageing, and extend the lifespan of many organisms. A considerable and growing number of studies have been dedicated to reveal the effects of diet restriction on factors that may be involved in the ageing of a given organism. Despite this, a comprehensive explanation of the exact mechanisms that may be involved remain largely uncertain. The hypothesis that has gained the most support is the &#147;reduced oxidative damage hypothesis&#148; although even this hypothesis needs further research to confirm or deny its validity. The present project aimed to examine (1) the effects of relatively short periods of undernutrition at differing stages of early life (i.e. pre- and post-weaning) on the lifespan of mice, (2) the effects of these periods of undernutrition on the oxidative stress status of the brain of rodents, and (3) to investigate whether any alterations in this status correlate with changes at the cellular and behavioural levels in the animals. The oxidative stress parameters investigated included the levels of mRNA and activities of major anti-oxidant enzymes (i.e. manganese superoxide dismutase [MnSOD], copper/ zinc superoxide dismutase [Cu/ZnSOD], catalase, and glutathione peroxidase 1 [GPx 1]), as well as measures of reduced glutathione (GSH), and lipid peroxidation. Further studies estimated the effects of undernutrition during different stages of early life on the cell numbers in the hippocampal formation and on spatial and motor coordination behaviours. The present study found that there were no differences in the maximum, mean, and median lifespan between mice undernourished during either the pre- or postweaning periods and well-fed controls. However, some long-term changes in body weight and the reduced incidence of pathological disorders were observed in some of the undernourished groups of animals. There were some long-term alterations in the levels of mRNA of Cu/ZnSOD in both the forebrain and cerebellum of the mice and rats that had been undernourished during the pre-weaning period. In addition, there were some transient increases in the levels of mRNA of MnSOD in the cerebellum of the mice and catalase in the forebrain of the undernourished rats. These alterations in gene expression, however, did not correlate with the activity levels of the enzymes in most instances. This finding suggests that pre-weaning undernutrition may regulate the anti-oxidant enzymes at the transcriptional level differently from the posttranscriptional, translational, or post-translational levels. Another observation in this set of experiments was the long-lasting increase in the levels of GSH in the forebrain of mice following pre-weaning undernutrition. The exact significance of this change on the ageing process of an animal remains uncertain at present. Pre-weaning undernutrition did not affect the total number of CA2-CA3 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus of the rats. However, such undernutrition did cause significant long-term alterations in the behavioural performance of the mice in the learning tasks used in this study. These effects on behaviour were not observed in mice undernourished during the post-weaning period. The significance of these results to the various hypotheses on the effects of diet restriction on an animal&#146;s ageing is discussed in detail.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158401</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A 25 000-year record of aeolian sedimentation from eastern Australia: A proxy for climate variability</field><field name="creator">Petherick, Lynda Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a high resolution record of aridity in eastern Australia for the past 25 000 (ka) calendar (cal) years developed from aeolian dust archives to determine the position and strength of the Australian south east dust transport pathway through this period. Aeolian dust archives were extracted from a lake sediment core collected from the exposed lake bed of Native Companion Lagoon in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Native Companion Lagoon is rain fed and all mineral sedimentation was believed to result from aeolian processes alone. The sediment core was sampled at 5 mm intervals, then dried and ashed. Sixteen AMS radiocarbon dates revealed a sedimentation rate of approximately 1 m 10 ka-1, resulting in a temporal resolution of circa 50 years. Aeolian sedimentation (ash record) and moisture content showed an inverse relationship, with periods of high aeolian deposition corresponding to low moisture content, and vice versa, for the majority of the 25 ka record. Phases of increased aeolian sedimentation are considered to represent periods of increased aridity and drought in central and eastern Australia, and disturbance of the local sand dunes which impound Native Companion Lagoon. The highly coherent nature of both the aeolian sedimentation and moisture content records suggests that both proxies are sensitive indicators of climate variability. Key palaeoclimate events shown in the record include the Last Glacial Maximum, Heinrich I, the Antarctic Cold Reversal, an early Holocene climatic optimum and the Neoglacial. Seventy three of the ashed samples underwent ICP-MS geochemical analysis using 44 trace elements. The results of the geochemical analysis were used for two purposes: a) to separate local and continental fractions of the aeolian sedimentation record, and then b) to provenance the far traveled dust content to source areas in eastern and central Australia. This was achieved by developing a model for separating local and continental dust fractions using five trace elements as proxies for continental dust. This five-element average approach is a unique technique for accurately defining the fartraveled component of the dust record. Once determined, the continental component of the aeolian sedimentation record was provenanced to source areas using a ternary mixing model. Fifteen trace elements were selected as suitable for use in the ternary mixing model, which mixed a south east Queensland sediment sample and two potential continental dusts. Variations in dominance of various central and east Australian dust source areas through time revealed significant variability in the position and strength of the south east dust transport corridor. Changes in the dominance of continental source areas were directly related to changes in local palaeoclimatic and environmental conditions in response to large scale global forcings of climate, and in turn changes in regional synoptic scale circulation patterns. Importantly, the Australian landscape is shown to respond quickly to changes in climate. This insight is essential for understanding both past and future impacts of a changing climate on the most arid inhabited continent other than Antarctica.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158289</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydatid infection in macropodids</field><field name="creator">Barnes, Tamsin</field><field name="description">Echinococcus granulosus is thought to have been introduced to Australia at the time of European settlement. Parasite transmission occurs in both a domestic cycle, between sheep and dogs, and a sylvatic cycle, in which many macropodid species and feral pigs serve as intermediate hosts and dingoes as definitive hosts. Infection with the larval stage of the parasite results in the development of hydatid cysts; in macropodids, cysts are usually found in the lungs. Fatalities, primarily due to pulmonary impairment, have been reported in some of the smaller threatened species, and this raises the question whether the parasite is contributing to the decline of these hosts. However, no extensive studies investigating the prevalence, risk factors and pathophysiology of infection in macropodids have been undertaken. The overall aim of this thesis was to determine the potential significance of hydatid infection to small macropodids. In doing so, the prevalence of hydatid infection in both commercially harvested kangaroos and a small, threatened rockwallaby species was estimated. Possible risk factors associated with infection were investigated and attempts made to develop an immunodiagnostic test. The pathology associated with natural infection in kangaroos was described and the pathophysiology following experimental infection of tammar wallabies monitored. The overall prevalence of hydatid infection in 2998 commercially harvested macropodids (predominantly eastern grey kangaroos), from 21 properties in south Queensland, was 2.4%. This survey revealed a marked clustering of hydatid infection by property, with prevalences varying from 0 &#150; 12%. Multilevel models were used to investigate putative risk factors at both kangaroo and property levels. At the kangaroo level, females were twice as likely to be infected as males, but no property level risk factors were identified. A survey was undertaken to establish baseline health data for the threatened brush-tailed rock-wallaby. Thoracic radiography, validated as a diagnostic technique in experimentally infected tammar wallabies, was used to estimate the prevalence of hydatid infection in three wild colonies of this macropodid in south-east Queensland. The overall prevalence was 15.3%, with 20% of adult animals infected. This survey also determined the burdens/prevalence of various endo- and ectoparasites and their xi associations with time of year, age of the animal, its condition and blood values. The seroprevalence of antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, another parasite that is potentially fatal to macropodids, was 4.7%. As a serological test would be useful as a rapid, convenient means of diagnosis of hydatid infection, attempts were made to modify serodiagnostic tests validated in humans for use in macropodids. Both crude hydatid cyst fluid (HCF) antigens and the recombinant protein, EpC1, were optimized using sera from post-mortem positive and negative animals. HCF antigens had a very low specificity (20.8%) and rEpC1 a very low sensitivity (41.2 &#150; 47.9%), indicating that neither test was suitable for diagnosis of infection in individual macropodids. Post-mortem examinations of the commercially harvested macropodids revealed that all infected animals had cysts in the lung tissue, but two also had cysts in the pleural cavity and one animal had a liver cyst. The number of cysts in infected animals ranged from one to 17, with the majority of animals having one to three cysts. Estimated total cyst volume varied from 0.2 to 1,075cm3. In some animals, cysts resulted in a 55 &#150; 80% loss of functional lung capacity that is likely to have impacted significantly upon respiratory function. The pathophysiology of infection following experimental dosing of captive tammar wallabies with doses of 1000, 2500 and 8000 E. granulosus eggs was monitored for up to 16 months using thoracic radiography and a final post-mortem examination. The infection rate was low (11/33, or 35.5%). The number of cysts per animal varied from one to ten, with the majority (36/40 or 90%) of cysts establishing in the lungs. Cyst development was more rapid than has been reported in sheep, and this pattern was also observed in the naturally infected brush-tailed rock-wallabies. Cyst growth resulted in loss of functional lung capacity, up to an estimated 28% within 14 months of infection. Complications associated with lung cyst development included fatal anaphylaxis, pneumothorax and atelectasis. Seven of the eleven infected tammars died or were euthanased as a result of infection during the experiment. The onset of cyst fertility occurred early, from nine months onwards, compared to previous observations in sheep (2 - 6 years), suggesting that the importance of the sylvatic cycle to the epidemiology of E. granulosus in Australia could be far greater than previously thought. The histology of cysts from experimentally infected tammar wallabies and sheep was compared. Cysts of similar age had a thicker germinal membrane with greater nuclear content and a thicker laminated layer in the tammars. The hostproduced adventitial layer differed; the layer of degenerate collagen prominent in ovine cysts was absent in those from the tammars. These features underlie the rapid cyst growth and early onset of fertility seen in the tammars. Hydatid infection is widespread in macropodids and may be prevalent in colonies of the small threatened species. This thesis has demonstrated that rapid cyst growth results in loss of lung capacity that may have adverse effects on survival within a year of infection. Other potentially serious consequences of infection are also seen. Thus, hydatid infection is an important consideration in the development of conservation management plans for threatened macropodids and further work is required to determine effective control measures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158611</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pointing, perception and pain: the effect of changes in head position on upper limb movement</field><field name="creator">Knox, Joanna Joy</field><field name="description">Changes in the position of the head are known to introduce errors when pointing to the remembered location of a visual target. Pointing to a visual target requires the integration of visual information and proprioceptive information about the position and movement of the body. Errors introduced when pointing to a visual target may be introduced either through misperception of sensory information or through errors in the transformation of information between visual and proprioceptive systems. It is proposed that proximal body segments such as the head, the eyes, or the trunk may act as a frame of reference during this transformation of sensory information, and therefore changes in the position of these body segments may introduce error. Previous studies that have investigated changes in head position during pointing tasks hypothesised that errors are primarily introduced in the perception of target location. One of the aims of this thesis was to assess the potential for changes in head position to introduce error in the proprioceptive component of the planning and performance of upper limb movement. A second aim was to disentangle the mechanisms behind the effect of head rotation on pointing to a visual target. A third aim was to investigate the accuracy of upper limb proprioception and pointing, following changes in head position, in people with chronic neck pain following a whiplash injury. The first series of studies (I to IV) investigated the accuracy of upper limb movement towards a proprioceptive goal. The effect of real and illusory changes in head position on elbow joint position error (JPE) was assessed in healthy subjects. In addition, the effect of changes in head position on elbow JPE was assessed in people with whiplash associated disorders (WAD). In these studies, error in the elbow proprioceptive task was present, but the pattern of error was dependent on the range of head movement and the modality used to introduce illusory changes in head position. Elbow proprioception was affected by smaller ranges of head rotation in people with WAD than in healthy people. These studies demonstrated that changes in the head position influence movement to a proprioceptive target and suggest that head position is used in sensorimotor transformations for upper limb movement even when the task does not involve visual cues. The second series of studies (V to VII) aimed to explore the mechanisms behind the observation that rotation of the head induces a contralateral bias in pointing. The studies measured the accuracy of pointing towards the remembered location of three visual targets after rotation of the head and/or the eyes. Experimental conditions included full and mid range head rotation and tasks that aimed to dissociate between the relative contributions of head position, eye-in-head position, and gaze deviation to the bias in pointing. The accuracy of pointing with head rotation was also assessed in people with WAD, who displayed the same pattern of error as healthy subjects. As in previous studies, head rotation induced contralateral deviations in pointing, which was dependent on the location of the target. These studies demonstrated that errors in pointing were present with mid range head rotation, and that the errors could not simply be explained by changes in gaze direction. The studies of this thesis demonstrate that changes in head position are important in the planning and performance of goal oriented movement. Knowledge of head position is not only important for the perception of target location but also for the accurate perception of upper limb position, particularly in people with WAD. In healthy subjects, errors in upper limb movement following changes in head position can be introduced within a functional range of head motion and cannot be completely explained by the changes in gaze that are associated with head rotation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158290</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BECOMING SCHOOL-LITERATE IN CHINA: HISTORICAL, SEMIOTIC AND INTERACTIONAL ANALYSES OF YUWEN TEXTS</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Bette Ray Bin</field><field name="description">The research reported in this thesis began with a curiosity about the contents of the reading materials that Chinese students are given in their first year of formal schooling, and with the notion that reading, literacy and yuwen (literally meaning language-and-literature) are not equivalent. It examines the constructions of &#147;the literate person&#148; in various social and cultural milieux. In the West, reading has traditionally been treated as an essential and objective phenomenon, a set of individualised cognitive abilities, technical skills, with cultural variations. To counter this view, literacy oriented theories, approaches, and pedagogies have argued for and documented the fact that literacy activities are cultural phenomena, pertinent to institutional practice and social order (Barton &amp; Hamilton, 1998; Luke &amp; Freebody, 1997; Street, 1984). This embedded-ness of literacy activities has often been observed in anthropology-oriented studies. In this thesis, the embedded-ness of literacy activities (events) in social macrostructures is observed from the construction of Chinese subject yuwen, and documented from the first year school reading textbooks, yuwen texts. This research first demonstrates that constructions of the school subject of reading in China involve a discursive practice resulting in a change away from the centuries-long Confucian texts, toward literary texts in the invented &#147;vernacular&#148;, putonghua. Reading as a situated social practice in current social context is then examined in the site of the two first year Chinese yuwen textbooks in use nationally. Beginning school reading materials are seen as venues for and documentations of the processes of literacy activities, through which versions of social reality and &#147;the school-literate&#148; are constructed (Baker &amp; Freebody, 1989a; Luke, 1988). By applying detailed semiotic and semantic analysis of social reality, and by applying membership categorisation analysis to the social interactions displayed in the text corpus, this research shows that the Chinese first year yuwen texts display characteristics of constructions of explicit thematic topics - thought, science and humanity; hybridity - mixing themes of modern, tradition and revolutions, modes of multiplicity, and hybrid genre &#150; all within a &#147;pedagogical universe&#148;. The argument is developed that these characteristics present Chinese school children with a distinctive textually mediated literate world.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158402</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HyShot scramjet testing in the HEG</field><field name="creator">Gardner, Anthony Donald</field><field name="description">A study of the suitabiiity of ground-based faciiities for simulating the iiow and combustion in scramjets has been carried out. A wind tunnei model was developed for the HEG from the HyShot flight test model, which recreated the internal geometry at a scale of 1 : 1. The model was split into two engines, which were instrumented with pressure transducers and thermocouples. A fuei injection system injected cold gaseous hydrogen into the flow through portholes in the wall of one combustion chamber. The model was tested at various angles of attack and equivalence ratios and testing with a nitrogen freestream was used to quantify the effect of fuel injection without combustion. in this study, ZFD and shock tunnel experiments have been performed, these then being compared with the flight test data from the HyShot I1 flight. Two new conditions for the HEG were designed analytically and refined using the one-dimensional Lagrangian code i i D and experimentally-determined efficiency coefficients, aiiowing the dennition of a new condition with a maximum of two tests in the HEG. A new Mach 7.8 contoured nozzle was calibrated and a new piston with a braking system to prevent reverse movement after diaphragm burst was designed and tested. -1 I ne engine pressures without combustion in the HEG agreed well with theory and CFD. Measurements with thermocouples in the HEG showed boundary layer transition in the combustion chamber between Reynolds numbers of 6 12000 and 782000. ivieasurements of the position of the initiation of combustion in the HEG showed that it was a function of mixing only and was independent of the combustion kinetics. Formation of a stable boundary layer separation on the cowl in the combustion chamber was observed for tests at higher equivalence ratio and angle of attack. The size of the separation was observed to increase with increasing equivalence ratio, angle of attack and wall temperature, and with decreasing freestream pressure. The expansion corner attached to the cowl reduced the size of the subsonic region, allowing separation to occur without choking the engine. The flight data was analysed at 27.5 km and 32.4km altitude, corresponding to the experimental conditions in the HEG. In the HyShot I1 flight, the combustion chamber pressures without combustion were 30% and 40% higher than expected at 32.4 km and 27.5 km altitude respectively. It has been shown that failure of the top and bottom tips of the combustion chamber was not responsible, but that failure of the side tips of the combustion chamber or a hysteresis in the iniet from higher altitudes couid not be ruled out as the source of the pressure discrepancy. The fuel-on flight data at 28 km altitude had a large separated region and the data at and 3.53" angle of attack agreed well with that taken in the HEG at Condition XI and 6.0" angle of attack. Experiments suggested that the fuel-on fiight data at 33 km altitude had only small separated regions, but the elevated pressure in the combustion chamber before combustion, prevented good agreement with the HEG data. -1 I nis work has demonstrated that the supersonic combustion and boundary iayer separation in a mixing-limited scramjet can be accurateiy simulated in a shock tunnel at an enthalpy of 3 MJIkg.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158612</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anxiety in the Foreign Language Classroom: An empirical study of foreign language anxiety experienced by a group of Australian university students studying spoken Chinese</field><field name="creator">Liu, Shu-Fong Shirley</field><field name="description">Foreign Language Anxiety is a complex phenomenon that has been found to be a predictor of foreign language achievement. Many researchers have studied the proposed notion of language anxiety in the second language classroom. MacIntyre (1995) maintained that language anxiety can play a significant role in creating individual differences in both language learning and communication. In Young&#146;s Interviews (1992), Krashen, Young, Omaggio Hadley, Terrell, and Rardin acknowledged that speaking in the foreign language probably produces the greatest amount of anxiety in language learners. Horwitz et al. (1983) developed the FLCAS (Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale) from their research and empirical studies in order to capture the specific anxiety reaction of a learner to a foreign language learning setting. The main purpose of this study was to test Horwitz et al.&#146;s construct of foreign language anxiety by validating an adapted FLCAS for students of Chinese. Most published research has focused on anxiety in learning Western languages, such as Spanish, French, and German. It was hoped that the results of this empirical study using a non-Western language would shed new light on the concept of foreign language anxiety and would expand its scope and implications. This study investigates and examines students&#146; perspective on speaking in the Spoken Chinese classes at different levels (Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced classes) over two consecutive semesters during 2004 at The University of Queensland. Objectives of the study include: (1) investigate and compare the perception of first and second semester students&#146; foreign language anxiety in Spoken Chinese classes at Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced levels; (2) assess the reliability of the FLCAS when it is applied to a non-Western language; (3) compare the contributions of the different factors associated with Foreign Language Anxiety; (4) correlate the results obtained from foreign language anxiety and students&#146; performance; (5) investigate the role of anxiety contributing to student attrition in foreign language courses at university; and (6) identify the educational implications of the findings with the aim of creating a less stressful language classroom environment. More generally, the results of this empirical study of second language anxiety in learning Chinese should further elucidate the concept of foreign language anxiety established in studies of Western languages and expand the scope and implications of these concepts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158403</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE CONTRIBUTION OF NUMBERS OF SIBLINGS AND PARENT VARIABLES TO PRESCHOOL CHILDREN&#146;S THEORY OF MIND AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT: TESTING THE DOMAIN SPECIFICITY OF EFFECTS</field><field name="creator">McAlister, Anna Rachel</field><field name="description">Research indicates that children develop the ability to engage in mental perspective taking, interpret the intentions of others and to understand false beliefs between the ages of 3 and 5 years. Referred to in the research literature as &#147;theory of mind&#148;, this combination of abilities is a focus of the present research. Numerous prior studies have linked sibling influences to individual differences in typical children&#146;s theory of mind development. While there is some inconsistency among prior findings, a number of studies have shown that a child&#146;s theory of mind development is enhanced as a function of the number of child-aged siblings. Previously, this relationship has been argued to be direct, however, there have been recent suggestions that this is not the case. Using a sample of 127 children (and their mothers) who were tested on theory of mind, executive functioning, and academic performance tasks with longitudinal follow-ups of the same measures over 12 months, one issue addressed in this thesis is Cole and Mitchell&#146;s (2000) mediation hypothesis. According to this view, a child&#146;s executive functioning capacity mediates the relationship between number of siblings and theory of mind performance. Results from the first study lend support to the mediation hypothesis, but are not sufficient to eliminate a possible alternative model. From the first study, it is possible that the relationship between theory of mind and executive functioning occurs in the opposite direction to that predicted. Potentially, the relationship between number of siblings and executive functioning is mediated by theory of mind. Study 2 uses longitudinal data to thoroughly assess the direction of the relationship between executive functioning and theory of mind. Time 1 theory of mind is found to predict Time 2 executive functioning, after the effects of Time 1 executive functioning have been accounted for. These results speak against the proposed mediation model of Cole and Mitchell (2000), in which the relationship between number of siblings and theory of mind is mediated by executive functioning. A more parsimonious interpretation of present and previous findings is that the relationship between number of siblings and executive functioning is mediated by theory of mind. Theory of mind development is compared to preschoolers&#146; academic performance on counting tasks, for the purpose of determining whether variables which influence theory of mind development are specific to socio-cognitive development or generalise to academic-cognitive development also. For each analysis conducted in Studies 1 and 2, parallel analyses are run with academic performance substituted for theory of mind. The results indicate that both forms of development show the same pattern; academic performance is predicted by a child&#146;s number of siblings and is also found to mediate the relationship between number of siblings and executive functioning. The mediation of the siblings&#150;executive functioning relationship by both theory of mind and academic performance is interpreted as an indication that development of higher order, abstract capacities such as executive functioning cannot be readily acquired through social interactions, whereas social competence (i.e., theory of mind skills) and culturally valued practices (including academic tasks such as counting) may be more readily enhanced by influences arising from a child&#146;s social environment. Using a parent-report questionnaire, Study 3 assesses further family variables as predictors of children&#146;s developmental outcomes. Again, the domain specificity of effects is tested by comparing the effect of each independent variable on children&#146;s socio-cognitive development as well as their academic-cognitive development. Findings show that the amount of weekly shared time between a mother and child bears no significant impact on children&#146;s development in either area. However, the frequency with which mothers teach their children about different topic areas is relevant to developmental outcomes. Children whose mothers teach academic topics more frequently than social topics demonstrate more advanced academic abilities than children whose mothers teach social topics more frequently, or who teach both topics with equal frequency. Children&#146;s social development shows no relationship to maternal teaching. Further analyses are conducted to explain variance in mothers&#146; frequency of teaching each topic. Results show that there is a significant positive relationship between the extent to which mothers value their child&#146;s academic development and the frequency by which they teach that topic area. No such relationship exists in relation to maternal teaching of social topics. Mothers&#146; education is found to explain a significant amount of variance in the value mothers place on their child&#146;s academic development. This relationship is negative, and is interpreted as an indication that mothers who perhaps struggled to perform academically or were deprived of opportunities to advance academically during their own childhoods may try harder to ensure success for their children, as opposed to mothers who achieved well academically and might therefore be more blas&#233; about assuming that their children will succeed at academic tasks. The failure of maternal inputs to affect children&#146;s social development is linked to arguments put forward in interpreting the results of the first two studies and is consistent with prior research which suggests that theory of mind development is enhanced by uniquely childish interactions that cannot be simulated during interactions with adults. It is concluded that, despite the first two studies showing strong similarities between children&#146;s social and academic development, the two areas are fundamentally differentiated in terms of the impact of adult influences. Overall, these studies contribute substantially to the extant literature by providing a thorough analysis of the mediation hypothesis of the theory of mind&#150;sibling link and by comparing two forms of development to further substantiate prior claims that preschool children&#146;s social development is linked to uniquely childish influences in a distinctive manner.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158291</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examination of surface-recorded motor units and a new approach to motor unit number estimates</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Robert David</field><field name="description">A motor unit comprises an anterior horn cell, a motor axon and its terminal nerve branches, and the muscle fibres supplied by that axon. The number of motor units in each muscle is not known and has been a research area for 30 years. An ability to measure the number of motor units is needed for the assessment of progression of diseases of the motor unit such as motor neuron disease (MND). Tests to determine the number of motor units by electrophysiological means are termed &#147;motor unit number estimates&#148; (MUNE). A number of MUNE methods have been devised. All of the MUNE methods have limitations, the most important being the need to allow for all of the variables affecting motor unit responses to electrical stimulation. The first aim of this project was to assess motor unit responses by evaluating the data collection parameters used in the Poisson statistical MUNE method in a normal and MND population. Different methods of collecting the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) responses following a fixed stimulus were studied. The problems associated with sampling of a portion of the motor units and the increasing influence of large motor units with progression of MND was found to be important limitations of the Poisson statistical method. This study identified the importance of the stimulus-activation curve, and showed that a large number of data points can be collected. Technical issues with data collection were found, and importantly the presence of large steps in MND subjects. This study also identified small motor units with low variability. The second aim was to assess the features of the whole stimulusactivation curve obtained by stimulating motor nerves with increasing stimulus intensity and recording the CMAP in normal and MND populations. The size of motor units within the stimulus-activation curve was determined. In normal subjects, there is a pattern of electrical activation from smallest to largest motor unit. A third aim was to use the stimulus-activation curve and the collection of a large number of data points to assess the variability in the size of surface-recorded motor unit responses following electrical stimulation in normal and MND subjects. MUNE methods can be misled by the inherent variability in single motor units. This is particularly true in disorders with unstable motor units, such as MND. A value of 100 &#181;Vms was an approximate size for the variability arising from surfacerecordings of individual motor units. The fourth aim was to examine the reduction in size of the CMAP that occurs with repetitive electrical stimulation. This needs to be understood as a cause of variability of motor unit firing that could be important in the development of MUNE techniques. The study showed that a maximal CMAP decrement of 10% with train-of-four repetitive stimulation occurs in a small subset of MND subjects and is probably related to disease severity. From studies of individual motor units, the decrement in MND arose from a reduction in the size of components of individual motor units rather than loss of firing of entire motor units. The reduction in size was probably due to conduction block in terminal axons of individual motor units. The final aim was to use a new MUNE method, developed by uniting the stimulus-activation curve with understanding of the causes of variability in a Bayesian statistical model to estimate motor unit numbers in normal subjects and subjects with MND. Using this Bayesian statistical method, the number of motor units was reduced in MND compared to normal subjects and showed progressive loss over time in MND subjects. The method had the advantages of applicability to all stages of MND and simplicity of the data collection.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158404</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acupuncture Management of Frozen Shoulder</field><field name="creator">Lee, David Robert Kittak</field><field name="description">Background: Frozen shoulder or idiopathic adhesive capsulitis is an enigma of musculo-skeletal medicine. It is a difficult condition to treat and its etiology is still unknown. Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate whether acupuncture has a role in the management of frozen shoulder. Objectives: An in-depth literature review was conducted on all aspects related to the current concepts and treatments for frozen shoulder. Although there were discussions on associated conditions and possible causes of frozen shoulder, there is currently no consensus on its management. Acupuncture has been used successfully as a treatment for frozen shoulder by many eastern practitioners. Unfortunately, their claims could not be substantiated due to a lack of properly conducted clinical trials. An acupuncture treatment protocol for the management of frozen shoulder was designed based on both Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Anatomical principles. This protocol was then tested with a clinical trial. Methods: A pilot study, using a prospective case series of 20 patients suffering with the &#147;adhesive phase&#148; of frozen shoulder, was conducted to test the effectiveness of the acupuncture treatment protocol. This study included specific selection and exclusion criteria; an objective assessment of the range of movement and subjective assessments on the quality of life and pain. All data were collated and analysed with SPSS version 12. The pretreatment and post-treatment data were tested using both parametric paired sample t test and non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results: The patients&#146; profile confirmed the affected age group and gender distribution to be similar to those in the literature search. Unfortunately, due to the small sample size, there were no significant associated conditions demonstrated. There were twice as many cases of primary frozen shoulder than secondary frozen shoulder in this study. These analyses suggested that there were significant changes in all three areas of assessment &#150; range of shoulder movement, quality of life and visual analogue pain scale (p&amp;lt0.001). At completion of treatment, the result revealed that the acupuncture treatment protocol was successful in 60%, and moderately successful in 15%, of the 20 cases tested. This outcome was compared with the study by Omari and Bunker which showed only 12% success with conservative western medical treatments, suggesting that acupuncture may be better than conservative western medical treatments. Conclusion: Acupuncture treatment is less costly and has minimal side effects. It should be part of the non-procedural modalities offered to patients suffering with frozen shoulder. For patients who have failed western conservative managements, a trial of acupuncture treatment should be considered prior to embarking on the more invasive interventions..</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Frozen shoulder</field><field name="subject">adhesive phase</field><field name="subject">acupuncture</field><field name="subject">pilot study</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158292</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of strategies to teach word processing skills to young adults with intellectual disabilities</field><field name="creator">Lloyd, Janette Mary</field><field name="description">This research project had two aims. The first aim was to develop guidelines to assist in the selection and evaluation of computer software packages for use in a literacy program for young adults with intellectual disabilities. The second aim was to develop, implement, and evaluate strategies to enable learners with intellectual disabilities to work independently with a word processing program. Three studies were undertaken to achieve these aims. The first was the preliminary study, the second was the main study, and the third study was an extension of the main study to a larger classroom context. The preliminary study was conducted to develop guidelines that could be used to gather information about three commercial educational software programs that were available at the time and were being promoted as effective tools in the teaching of literacy. A range of characteristics and qualities of effective programs was identified from a review of the literature and these findings were used to develop checklists to assess available software. Findings from the preliminary study revealed a need to further explore the learners&#146; needs and skills when using software packages such as Microsoft Word 98 in classroom settings. These findings formed the basis for the main study. The aim of the main study was to develop, implement, and evaluate teaching strategies to enable students with intellectual disabilities to work independently with word processing using Microsoft Word 98. Action research was adopted as the research design for the main study. The participants in the main study were 11 young adults with intellectual disabilities ranging in age from 18 to 25 years. In the Initial Reconnaissance Phase, a combination of formal standardised assessments, informal researcher developed instruments, and informal assessments were used to collect data about the participants&#146; computer skills, comprehension skills, vocabulary, interests, attitudes and behaviours. Using the findings from these assessments, a General Plan was developed to teach a specific computer skill - saving and retrieving documents from a specific folder. A pre-test was administered prior to the commencement of the teaching sessions and then readministered as a post-test at the conclusion of the sessions. The participants were then observed in their regular classroom to determine if the skill had been retained after a 10-week period. The findings from the post assessments showed positive results for all participants in the study. The study was then extended to a larger group of learners in a classroom setting. The classroom study included all learners in the group (n=10). The General Plan was revised but as it proved to be successful in its original format, few changes were made. In the classroom study, the post-tests revealed that seven participants were able to save and retrieve documents independently from a specific folder, and three participants were not able to save independently. The study indicated a range of strategies that could be used to help the remainder of the learners build towards gaining the targeted computer skills. The results from this investigation add to the current body of knowledge about software evaluation and teaching strategies that can be used to enhance the computer skills of young adults with intellectual disabilities. These findings have important implications for the design of literacy programs and how technology can be used as a teaching tool to create a richer teaching environment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158405</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selective transport of attached particles across the froth phase</field><field name="creator">Seaman, David Richard</field><field name="description">Over many years, researchers in the field of flotation have developed an in-depth understanding of processes occurring in the pulp phase of flotation machines. Until recently, however, the froth phase has received little attention. The froth phase serves to separate bubble-particle aggregates from suspended slurry in a flotation cell. The mechanism of recovery by entrainment, its relationship to water recovery and particle size dependency is well understood. Froth recovery, (the fraction of particles entering the concentrate launder that entered the froth phase attached to air bubbles), is not well understood. Up until now, there has been doubt over whether this property is dependent on particle size and hydrophobicity. Difficulties in measuring froth recovery had previously prevented researchers from gaining a deeper understanding of the transport of attached particles across the froth phase. A novel device was designed and tested to measure froth recovery by isolating bubble-particle aggregates in the pulp-phase of flotation machines through the determination of the bubble loading in the pulp phase (mass of particles attached per unit volume of air bubbles). This technique can be used with other measurements to investigate froth selectivity by directly comparing these captured particles to those found in the froth phase. Evidence was collected at Red Dog Mine, Alaska and Newmont Golden Grove Operations, Western Australia which showed that the froth phase selectively transported more hydrophobic and smaller sized particles across the froth than less hydrophobic and larger particles. Particles collected in the device were compared to those found in the concentrate stream on a size by mineral by liberation class. Froth recovery was also calculated on a size by mineral by liberation class for two valuable sulphide minerals in a continuous 3m&#179; flotation cell. These results show that the froth phase is responsible for the upgrading of attached particles across the froth phase as well as for the separation of bubble-particle aggregates from suspended slurry. The pulp phase is responsible for creating bubble-particle aggregates through the attachment of hdyrophobic mineral particles to air bubbles. Many complex factors affect the extent to which this occurs including the size and hdyrophobicity of the particles, the size and number of air bubbles produced by the flotation machine, the rate of collisions between particles and bubbles and the overall chemistry of the system. This measurement of bubble loading presents an opportunity to measure the impact of all these factors on the successful creation of bubble-particle aggregates. Based on a literature review suggesting that there was a high probability of particles being detached at the pulp-froth interface due to the aggregates change in momentum, a three phase description of a flotation cell was proposed. The three phases were: pulp, pulp-froth interface and upper froth zones. A second froth recovery measurement technique (changing froth depth) was used in combination with the bubble load technique to determine the recovery across each of the two froth zones. It was found that the pulp-froth interface appears to be responsible for the selectivity observed across the froth phase as a whole. These findings will enable more in-depth research into the sub-process of the froth phase as well as assisting flotation cell design through a better understanding of the roles of the pulp-froth interface and the upper froth region.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290702 Mineral Processing</field><field name="subject">640300 First Stage Treatment of Ores and Minerals</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158293</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Framework for Statistical Testing of Software Components</field><field name="creator">Shukla, Rakeshkumar Yogendrakumar</field><field name="description">The term &#147;statistical testing&#148; is used when statistics is applied to software testing. Statistics provides sampling theory, a sound theoretical foundation for statistical testing. However, two difficult and important issues must be addressed in statistical testing. The first issue is determining an accurate operational profile. Statistical testing of a software component from a user&#146;s point of view depends largely on the manner in which the component is used. Characterisation of the population of expected use is referred to as an operational profile. An operational profile is a set of input events and their associated probabilities of occurrence expected in actual operation. The test cases that are executed during a statistical test are a sample from the operational profile. As such, accurate operational profiles are a critical part of statistical testing. Determining an operational profile for the generation of test cases that are representative of actual usage is still a difficult issue despite the considerable research in this area in recent years. Developing an accurate operational profile for software is difficult in general and it is very difficult for many software components because it requires anticipating the future use of the component. The usage behaviour is typically modelled by either Markov models or finite state machines. Previous work has focused on exploring the occurrence of operations and has ignored parameters for operations. This thesis presents a systematic method for deriving operational profiles for software components that uses probabilistic statecharts to model operational profiles and that addresses the issue of parameters for operations. The second issue is development of a test oracle for output evaluation. Test output evaluation is also a difficult and important problem for statistical testing. Most of the potential benefits of testing will be lost if the success or failure of test cases is not assessed. An expected result is needed for each test case to check the test output. The mechanism used for test output evaluation is called a test oracle. A test oracle is an essential part of statistical testing, because a large number of test cases is required to represent the operational usage and the behaviour must be checked for every test case. Test result evaluation using a test oracle is widely acknowledged in the software testing literature as a critical aspect of the testing process. Several methods for developing test oracles, such as those using specifications and documentation, have been reported. Unfortunately development and maintenance of such resources may require considerable effort. A limitation in using such a resource is that the test oracle is only as good as the resource from which it was derived. To address these issues, this thesis presents a technique to develop a test oracle that uses the component to check its own behaviour for test output evaluation. While a number of proposals for statistical testing of software have been made, the execution of test cases and test output evaluation are often not addressed in these proposals. This thesis presents a conceptual framework for statistical testing of software components that supports both test case execution and output evaluation. The framework proposed in this thesis is supported by a prototype tool for test case generation, test case execution and output evaluation. The tool supports a wide range of operational profile approaches for test case generation and a variety of test oracles for output evaluation. This thesis demonstrates the practical viability, flexibility and scalability of the framework and tool support by applying them on several case studies, including a third-party component. Experience with the framework indicates that it can be used successfully for small to medium-sized components, including third-party components such as COTS components. The overall effectiveness of the statistical testing process depends on both the accuracy of the operational profile and the effectiveness of the test oracle to detect and report the errors encountered during testing. This thesis presents an empirical evaluation of different types of operational profiles to determine how accurately the test cases generated from the operational profiles represent the actual usage of the component and different types of test oracles to determine their fault-detection ability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158406</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CREATING CROSS-SCALE LINKAGES BETWEEN REGIONAL AND PROPERTY LEVELS: Toward Coordinated Natural Resource Management Decisions in Australia&#146;s Tropical Rangelands</field><field name="creator">Acton, Adele Renee</field><field name="description">Natural resource use and management occur over diverse temporal and spatial scales through the decisions and activities of institutions and individuals that are operating at a number of levels including international, national, state, regional and local. Collectively, these decisions and activities shape the landscape and influence the sustainability of natural resources. Within Australia, regional level planning approaches have become a prominent focus for implementing regional and higher level policies related to natural resource management. However, implementation is highly dependent upon the decisions of many individual property managers operating across the landscape, whose focus may or may not be completely in accordance with the regional plan. The coordination of property level decisions is thus a key element for the sustainability of large scale ecological systems managed under regional institutional arrangements. This research focuses on natural resource management within Australia&#146;s tropical rangelands. It examines how linkages between regional planning and property level decisions can be improved to support the sustainable use and management of natural resources across these scales. The research combines case study inquiry and soft systems analysis to provide an interdisciplinary investigation of cross-scale linkages. Case studies were conducted at two scales within the northern Gulf region in northern Queensland. One major case study focused on the regional level natural resource planning and management of the northern Gulf. Eight smaller case studies on property level natural resource management in the northern Gulf were conducted to represent the property scale. The case studies build a detailed picture of the goals, actions and motivators for natural resource decisions at each scale and the interactions between these factors and scales. The two scales of case studies were used to conduct a comparative, systems-based analysis of natural resource management decision-making between the regional and property scales. The purpose of these analyses was to show potential opportunities and barriers for enhancing cross-scale links between the regional and property levels. The findings show that major issues currently limiting cross-scale linkages and interactions within the northern Gulf region are inadequate information exchange between and within levels; limited capacity of individuals and institutions to adapt to change; limited trust, rapport and reciprocity between and within levels; the complexity of ecological systems; and conflicting actions between and within levels. Five corresponding opportunities are identified where there is potential to enhance the linkages between regional and property decisions for natural resource management. These opportunities are coordination mechanisms, connection of regional and property planning, mapping of system components, collaborative learning and participation, and flexibility in decisions. Change is a central element of all of the major opportunities identified for improving crossscale linkages. The ability of institutions to adapt constantly to the changes occurring across scales within both human and ecological systems will strongly influence the future sustainability of Australia&#146;s natural resources.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158294</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Journey of the Queer 'I': Spirituality and subjectivity in life narratives by gay men.</field><field name="creator">Marsh, Victor</field><field name="description">As represented by conservative religious discourse, homosexuality is often constructed as mutually opposed to spirituality, but in this project I suggest how marginalised subjectivities might be liberated from toxic, homophobic discourses by seeking out transformational tools from other traditions that open alternative pathways for recovering differently ordered senses of being and becoming. I develop the notion of self as a constructed narrative and examine the extent to which the emerging genre of gay spiritual autobiography in particular takes up the projects of renarrativising the self and disrupting authorized versions of male identity, spirituality and sexuality. I examine this both through my own memoir writing and a re-examination, long overdue, of the work of Christopher Isherwood, a precursor in the genre, to delineate how the positioning of self is re-negotiated in gay spiritual autobiography. Asking: Who is a 'homosexual' when he is not having sex, I take up the issue of spirituality in relation to gay identity formation. In Foucault's analysis, 'in the space of a few centuries, a certain inclination has led us to direct the question of what we are, to sex' (Foucault 1978:78). I have to question what has been occluded by the practice of seeing things only through that lens, what other knowledge sources denied. There is a great deal of evidence that many gay men have active spiritual lives, but rather than following arguments developed by others for uniquely queer forms of spirituality, I suggest how the experience of marginalisation can precipitate a search for an 'authentic' selfhood which marks the beginning of spiritual inquiry, as I define it. For the purposes of my discussion I separate the term 'spirituality' from 'religion'. I see the term 'religion' as referring to a sociological phenomenon, entailing inclusion in &amp;frasl; exclusion from socially and politically valorised faith communities. I follow an Eastern model to deploy a usage of 'spirituality' as concerned particularly with a searching enquiry into the nature of being. I pick up on the post-structuralist analysis of a de-centred self and follow the lead of Stephen Batchelor, Peter Conradi and others to show how other spiritual traditions - notably Buddhism and the non-dualist Advaita tradition of Vedanta - are very familiar with this notion of a de-centred personal identification. In contrast with the Western therapeutic pursuit of a functioning, discrete 'self, spiritual practice in the East is often concerned to demonstrate the illusory nature of this construction, repositioning the small 's' personal self within a more broadly-based context ('Self, 'Ground of Being', 'Tao', etc.) In my own memoir, The Boy in the Yellow Dress, I trace a narrative journey into and out of shame. Confronted with a ready-made, marginalised identity shaped by hostile discourses emanating from Family, Medicine, the Church, and the Law, a sissy boy struggles to recover the lost parts of self. With the help spiritual practices taught by a young guru he is able to reclaim a subjective positioning which heals his alienation and re-aligns him into a continuity of being with all that is. In the exegesis (titled: "Searching for the 'Home Self: The Narrativisation of Subjectivity in Christopher Isherwood's life writing"), I have chosen to focus on the narrative repositioning of the self in texts by BritishIAmerican writer Christopher Isherwood as exemplary of a range of issues surrounding the question of gay spirituality. In the process, I go some way towards recuperating parts of Isherwood's work which are mostly ignored or seriously misunderstood. Isherwood's encounter with a guru figure from the non-dualistic tradition of Advaita Vedanta, his study of key texts in that tradition, and his continuous practice of meditation over several decades, allowed him to re-position and integrate his sexuality with his creative and spiritual life. The various autobiographical texts that are the literary analogue of his journey, record a history of multiple displacements and reveal a subjectivity which is constructed, performative and in process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158407</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the underlying biochemical and genetic mechanisms that control gender and fertility in the Kuruma shrimp, Marsupenaeus japonicus (Bate)</field><field name="creator">Sellars, Melony J.</field><field name="description">Centuries of experience with terrestrial agriculture have demonstrated the value of domestication and selective breeding to improve production efficiency, profitability and sustainability. Compared to terrestrial agriculture there are remarkably few aquaculture industries that have progressed beyond the use of wild or unselected genotypes. This presents a major opportunity for the global aquaculture industry to capitalize on the benefits of domestication and selective breeding. However, there is a parallel need to ensure that a balance is achieved between optimizing genetic gains and conserving the biodiversity of the captive and wild stocks from which they are derived. In progressing towards domestication and genetic improvement, one of the key areas of interest includes the factors that control gender and fertility. Gender is of particular interest in species that are sexually dimorphic, with one gender being more attractive from a production point of view. Fertility is of broad interest as a key aspect of reproductive performance. Controlling fertility is also one method of protecting unwanted or unlicensed breeding of elite genotypes and preventing escapees from mating with wild stocks. For most aquacuculture species there is a fundamental lack of knowledge of the underlying biochemical and genetic mechanisms that control gender and fertility. The focus of this study was on developing methods for controlling gender and fertility in the Kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus (Bate). This high value species has been farmed for several decades using the progeny of wild broodstock and, more recently, progeny of domesticated, selectively bred captive broodstock. The biological, biochemical and genetic processes that control gender and fertility in M. japonicus are of direct commercial interest and of wider interest to science. Commercial interest is for two reasons: First, M. japonicus are sexually dimorphic with females growing 30% larger than males and second, recent success in the genetic improvement of M. japonicus has prompted farmers to seek ways to protect superior genetic stocks from unlicensed breeding and to prevent escapees from genetically contributing to natural fishery populations. Thus, the knowledge and technology that could permit farmers to cost-effectively produce all-female, sterile stocks could be of significant commercial value. More broadly, research directed towards this goal could provide new insights into the underlying biological, genetic and biochemical processes that control gender and reproduction in penaeid shrimp. Previous studies on inducing sterility have demonstrated that this can result in altered gende r ratios in the target species. Accordingly, the approach adopted in this study was to investigate these traits simultaneously. There were three principal research components in this project, each of which focused on a different approach to achieving gender and/or fertility control in M. japonicus. The three components were; (1) the potential of ploidy manipulation to control gender and fertility; (2) the effect of ionizing radiation on fertility; (3) the potential of genetic engineering to control gender determination and germ cell specification. PLOIDY MANIPULATION Previous research on M. japonicus has shown that triploids produced by preventing polar body (PB) II extrusion are always female and sterile, however, induction rates never result in 100% triploid progeny. Therefore, experiments in the present study focused on developing a technique to produce triploids with a 100% induction rate. As mating of tetraploids and diploids is the only documented technique that has achieved 100% triploids in other cultured species, the present study investigated methods to induce tetraploidy in M. japonicus. First I attempted to prevent the first division in mitosis using temperature and chemical shocks. Second I attempted to inhibit extrusion of PBI and both PBI and II using chemical shocks only. I was successful at stopping the first mitotic division, preventing the extrusion of PBI and preventing the extrusion of both PBI and II in M. japonicus by applying different shocks at different times post-spawning for different durations. Tetraploid M. japonicus embryos were produced by stopping the first division in mitosis, however, they were not viable and did not hatch. The most suitable treatment regime for inducing tetraploidy, giving frequency (number of spawnings induced that result in some polyploids) and induction rate (number of individuals within a spawning induction which are tetraploid or triploid) equal importance, was a 36&#176;C shock administered 23 min post-spawning for a 5 or 10 min duration. Preventing the extrusion of PBI and both PBI and II using 150 &#181;M 6-dimethylaminopurine at 1 to 3 min post-spawning for either a 4 to 5 min duration (timed to stop PBI extrusion) or a 16 min duration (timed to stop both PBI and II extrusion) consistently resulted in the production of viable triploid M. japonicus embryos, which hatched into nauplii. No tetraploids were produced by preventing the extrusion of PBI or both PBI and II. This is the first report of successful PBI, and PBI and II prevention in shrimp, and production of triploids using the reported treatment regimes. These findings indicate that manipulation of the ploidy level may not be suitable for producing 100% all-female, sterile M. japonicus, as all tetraploids produced to-date are not viable and all known triploidy induction techniques never result in 100% triploid progeny. There may, however, be commercial value in utilising the PBI triploidy induction methods of the present study in an attempt to improve productivity as: - PBI triploids are believed to have increased heterozygosisty over PBII triploids and diploids, and possibly better growth performance, and - Stocking of ponds with spawnings that have received shocks to prevent PBI extrusion would result in a greater proportion of females to males (as the frequency of induction is always 100%), therefore resulting in improved farm profit based on greater total harvestable product in terms of weight, and the fact that females attract higher prices per kilogram due to their larger size class. IONIZING RADIATION Ionizing radiation (IR) has been successfully used to prevent reproduction in a wide range of organisms and can be effective at sterilizing 100% of treated individuals. IR also plays a role in producing monosex populations through gynogenesis and androgensis in a range of aquatic species. Despite this, there is no information on the effects of IR on penaeid shrimp reproduction. Experiments in the present study assessed the capacity of IR to confer sexual sterilization in female and male M. japonicus. Initial experiments were focused on optimizing IR dose ranges. For these experiments, harvest age shrimp were treated with 0, 10 or 20 gray (Gy) of IR and their ability to produce viable offspring was assessed by performing rigorous reproductive evaluations. Later experiments assessed the reproductive performance of 10 month old M. japonicus treated with IR at postlarval stage 15 (PL15) (15 days since metamorphosis from mysis to postlarval stage 1). Initially, a lethal dose curve of IR for PL15 M. japonicus was established. Based on these results, PL15 shrimp were treated with IR at 0, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 Gy to examine the effect of IR dose on their reproductive capacity at 10 months of age. IR was found to impair the reproductive performance of M. japonicus when treated at harvest age and when treated as postlarvae and reared to reproductive maturity. IR was, however, not 100% effective at preventing the production of viable offspring at the reported doses. Harvest age male shrimp were more sensitive to IR, being reproductively impaired at 10 Gy as compared to 20 Gy for harvest age females. PL15 females treated with 0 Gy of IR matured and spawned more frequently than PL15 females treated with 10, 15 and 20 Gy of IR. There were, however, no other significant effects of IR observed on M. japonicus reproductive performance when treated at PL15. IR doses higher than 35 Gy resulted in 100% mortality (i.e. lethal dose rate) of PL15 M. japonicus within 30 days after treatment, whilst doses of 25 and 30 Gy significantly reduced postlarval survival compared to controls. From preliminary research, dose rates of 25 Gy or more resulted in 100% mortality of harvest age females, whilst 20 Gy significantly reduced harvest age male survival. These findings indicate that IR doses that do not result in 100% mortality of harvest age and postlarval M. japonicus can reduce their reproductive capacity, however, these doses of IR can not confer 100% sterility. GENETIC ENGINEERING The combined use of molecular biotechnology and genetics to investigate mechanisms of gender and fertility determination in numerous animal phyla has gained increased research attention over the last decade. However, to-date there is only one known penaeid shrimp gene for which the complete coding sequence has been isolated (but not functionally characterized) that is known to be involved in gender and fertility determination of other species. The present study assessed the potential of using genetic engineering methodologies to control gender and fertility of M. japonicus using a multi-step approach. Initially this study attempted to identify one or more candidate genes in M. japonicus that had been previously selected from a comprehensive literature search (sex-lethal, transformer, double-sex and vasa), and subsequently characterize their complete coding sequence. Expression profiles of the isolated genes were then determined throughout embryonic, larval and postlarval development, and in female and male gonad tissue to identify key periods during early development when their expression is naturally up-regulated. Using an RNAi approach, this study then attempted to silence the candidate genes from being expressed during these key developmental periods and assess the resulting loss-of-function genotypes. In addition to these experiments, this study also investigated the suitability of different real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay methodologies for the studied diverse morphological sample set (relative vs absolute quantitation) and investigated different methodologies to deliver nucleic acids into shrimp embryos (electroporation vs a polyethylenimine (PEI) transfection reagent). A partial coding sequence for a dsx-like gene homologue, DMRT2, and a complete coding sequence for a PL10 vasa-like gene was isolated from M. japonicus. The PL10 vasa-like gene was named Mjpl10. Both genes were differentially expressed during embryonic, larval and postlarval development, and in female and male gonad. Using absolute qRT-PCR, I demonstrated that dsx-like gene transcripts were present at low levels throughout the first 5 h of embryogenesis after which transcript abundance increased significantly by the time embryos were 6 h old, suggesting a functional role for dsx transcripts at this developmental stage. Expression of the dsx-like gene was consistently high but variable throughout the remainder of embryogenesis and during larval and postlarval development up until PL48 at which point dsx transcripts were no longer detectible. This expression pattern indicated a functional role for the isolated dsx-like gene from 6 h post-spawning until PL30. Transcripts of the dsx-like gene were also detected in testes at low levels and were close to undetectable in the ovary of mature adults. Using absolute qRT- PCR I also demonstrated that Mjpl10 transcripts were present in the first developmental stage sampled (2-cell embryos) onwards, suggesting it is maternally expressed, and continually at low levels throughout embryogenesis. Mjpl10 expression increased significantly in the first 25 h after hatching (nauplii IV) and then decreased in a linear fashion by 316-fold over the next 52 day period. Its continued expression throughout embryonic and larval development is compatible with a conserved role in early germ cell specification. Transcript levels of Mjpl10 were also detected in the ovary and testes of mature adults. To silence expression of the identified candidate genes in vivo, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) DNA expression vectors were constructed that were capable of in vivo transcription of a dsxlike and Mjpl10 shRNA molecule. These shRNA molecules would theoretically trigger the RNAi pathway and result in gene-specific silencing of the target dsx-like gene and Mjpl10 gene transcripts. The white spot syndrome virus immediate early 1 (WSSV IE1) promoter was chosen to drive expression of the shRNA molecules. The WSSV IE1 promoter was initially isolated and cloned into a vector to drive expression of a luciferase mRNA. WSSV IE1 promoter function was found to be &gt;56% as efficient as the Orgyia pseudotsugata (Douglasfir Tussock moth) multicapsid nucleopolyhedrosis virus immediately-early 2 (OpIE2) promoter when compared in Fall Army worm, Spodopterea frugiperda (Sf) 9 insect cell culture. The vector containing the WSSV IE1 promoter was subsequently used to construct three recombinant DNA vectors capable of in vivo expression of a shRNA fragment of either the dsx-like gene, Mjpl10 or a placebo control luciferase gene. Three additional recombinant vectors were constructed with each containing a fragment of either the dsx-like gene, Mjpl10 or luciferase gene (identical to the sense strand of the shRNA fragments) that was inserted behind coding sequence for a green fluorescent protein and before the polyA tail. These three GFP fusion vectors were co-transfected with their corresponding shRNA expression vectors in Sf 9 cell culture. Theoretically mRNAs expressed by the GFP fusion vectors would be silenced and unable to express GFP if the corresponding shRNA expression vector was transcribing shRNA molecules that were capable of cleaving the GFP fusion mRNA polyA tail off the molecule through the RNAi pathway. Using this approach all three shRNA expression vectors constructed in this study were shown to be functional and capable of inducing a gene-specific silencing response in Sf 9 insect cell culture. Relative to a positive control, treatments transfected with the dsx-like shRNA expression vector had a reduced percentage of insect cells expressing GFP (i.e.18.07 &#177; 0.38% and 8.75 &#177; 0.15% compared to 100% in two independent experiments). Treatments transfected with the Mjpl10 shRNA expression vector also had a reduced percentage of cells expressing GFP relative to a positive control (i.e. 14.63 &#177; 0.59% and 9.19 &#177; 0.02% compared to 100% in two independent experiments). Similarly, treatments transfected with the luciferase shRNA expression vector had a reduced percentage of cells expressing GFP relative to a positive control (1.64 &#177; 0.02 and 0.47 &#177; 0.06% compared to 100% in two independent experiments). From these experiments it was evident that the WSSV IE1 promoter was functional, and that the shRNA fragments of the recombinant vectors were being expressed, folding and initiating a specific RNAi response. The three shRNA expressing recombinant DNA vectors and the positive transfection control luciferase mRNA expression vector were transfected into 1-cell M. japonicus embryos using the commercially available jetPEITM transfection reagent. Using qRT-PCR I demonstrated that jetPEITM DNA complexes were successfully transfected into 1-cell embryos as evidenced by the presence of in vivo transcribed exogenous luciferase mRNA in the positive transfection controls. Using qRT-PCR I then demonstrated that the Mjpl10 shRNA molecules were able to induce a small, but significant non-specific gene silencing response in vivo. The number of Mjpl10 mRNA copies detected per ng of total RNA was 14,108 &#177; 1,763 in the control compared to 6,701 &#177; 494 in the placebo shRNA treatment and 8,151 &#177; 1,151 in the genespecific Mjpl10 shRNA treatment. In comparison, the dsx-like shRNA molecules did not result in a non-specific silencing response. No specific gene silencing response was observed for either of the shRNA expression vectors. Given that the Mjpl10 and luciferase shRNA expression vectors were capable of reducing the total number of Mjpl10 mRNAs but no specific gene silencing was observed; the fact that the two endogenous targets, the dsx-like homologue and Mjpl10, are known to be expressed in specific cell types (i.e. the genital ridge and the germ cell lineage respectively) and a measurable gene silencing result would therefore require that large numbers of shRNA be in vivo transcribed in these specific cell types; and that the shRNA expression vectors had been demonstrated to be functional in Sf 9 cell culture, these results indicate that the WSSV IE1 promoter was not strong enough to drive in vivo expression of suitable quantities of shRNA molecules to induce a measurable gene silencing response. Future research should isolate alternative shrimp specific constitutive promoters such as &#946;-actin which are highly active at all life-history stages in the majority of cell types. The use of such promoters instead of the WSSV IE1 promoter would ensure a high level of expression of recombinant DNA vectors that are transfected in vivo. Comparison of the relative and absolute qRT-PCR quantitation approaches revealed significant differences in transcript level profiles between the two procedures for both target genes, the dsx-like gene and Mjpl10. When 18S rRNA was used as a reference, target gene expression was more similar to that of the absolute method than when &#946;-actin was used as a reference. Variability between the relative and absolute procedures occurred for a greater Percentage of the embryonic stages compared to later developmental stages. This study indicates that the use of 18S rRNA or &#946;-actin as reference genes for studying gene expression patterns in M. japonicus embryonic, larval, postlarval and gonad samples will give significantly variable results, and illustrates the proposition that housekeeping genes are not necessarily appropriate references for qRT- PCR data normalization. Until suitable reference genes are characterized, gene expression experiments using the studied M. japonicus tissues of different morphological developmental stages should use absolute quantification procedures. Finally, comparison of electroporation and the polyethylenimine (PEI) transfection reagent procedures demonstrated the jetPEITM transfection reagent was the most suitable means by which to transform 1-cell M. japonicus embryos. Electroporation was not found to be suitable for delivering nucleic acids into 1-cell M. japonicus embryos at quantities greater than what is detectible from nucleic acids attached to the outer embryo surface after DNase or RNase treatment. However, the commercially available jetPEITM transfection reagent was able to deliver nucleic acids into 1-cell M. japonicus embryos when soaked in the transfection media for between 50 min to 4 h post-spawning. Transfection was most successful when complexation was performed for 15 min in a sodium chloride buffer, followed by a 3 to 4 h incubation in sterile seawater prior to the addition of embryos. Greatest transformation rates (as measured by the number of exogenous mRNA template copies per ng of total RNA) were achieved when 1 mL of seawater and embryos were added to complexation mixtures within the first 5 min of spawning.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158613</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Association Between Endophytic N[subscript]2-Fixing Bacteria and Australian Sugar Cane</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Suzanne Kay</field><field name="description">The Australian sugar cane industry is under increasing pressure from global competitors and environmental groups to achieve a more economical and sustainable production system. Sugar cane production in Australia has a large N fertiliser input and has potentially serious downstream environmental consequences. The use of N fertiliser in Australian sugar cane increased significantly over the last 50 years with more than 100 000 tonnes of N fertiliser now applied annually (Taylor and Brodie 2002). Fertiliser use efficiency of sugar cane has remained low with only about a third of plant N being derived from the current annual N fertiliser application (Vallis et al. 1996). The remaining fertiliser N is either added to the soil mineralisable N pool or lost from the production system through the processes of leaching, denitrification and to a lesser extent volatilisation. Large N fertiliser applications and low N fertiliser use efficiency are a major constraint to achieving a more economical and environmentally sustainable sugar cane production system in Australia. Current research into N fertiliser use in Australian production systems has concentrated on tailoring N fertiliser recommendations to soil type and crop N requirements, placement and timing of N fertiliser applications and identifying alternative plant N sources. This thesis addresses the potential of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) by endophytic N[subscript]2-fixing bacteria to provide sugar cane within the Australian production system with an alternative N source. The endophytic N[subscript]2-fixing bacteria G. diazotrophicus, Burkholderia spp. and Herbaspirillum seropedicae and H. rubrisubalbicans have been isolated from sugar cane in Brazil where they have been attributed as the organisms responsible for contributing fixed N[subscript]2 to sugar cane. Isotopic [superscript]15N dilution and N balance studies have shown positive N contributions to sugar cane from BNF. BNF in Brazilian sugar cane was variety dependent and reliant on adequate P, K and Mo nutrient additions and year round water conditions conducive to good plant growth. N[subscript]2-fixation by endophytes has advantages over rhizosphere fixation systems in that the N[subscript]2-fixing organisms are located within the plant where they are provided with a microsite that has potentially less competition for substrate than in the rhizosphere, and allows a more direct transfer of fixed N[subscript]2 product to the host plant. This thesis examined the key issues for the diazotroph sugar cane association in Australia: - are natural populations of N[subscript]2-fixing endophytes present within Australian sugar cane varieties; - what is their distribution within the plant, and the effect of variety, season and cane growing region; - are they influenced by N fertiliser and what BNF contribution can they make to Australian sugar cane. Natural populations of the endophytic N[subscript]2-fixing bacteria G. diazotrophicus, Burkholderia spp. and Herbaspirillum spp. were isolated from Australian sugar cane. These bacteria were identified by a range of biochemical, physiological and morphological traits when compared to type strains. Populations were found to be largest within the root and upper sugar cane stem regions. Root populations ranged from 10&amp;sup2 to 10[superscript]6 cells g/d.w. and stem populations ranged from 10&amp;sup2 to 10[superscript]5 cells g/d.w. G. diazotrophicus and Herbaspirillum spp. populations did not vary across growing season, Burkholderia spp. were larger prior to harvest than during the main vegetative crop growth phase. Populations of these diazotrophs varied between sugar cane varieties and across cane growing regions of Australia. There was limited variation in N[subscript]2-fixing bacteria populations between two sugar cane varieties Q135 and Q138 within regions and considerable population variations across regions. Nitrogen fertiliser had a significant effect on N[subscript]2-fixing bacteria populations. Annual applications of 150 kg N/ha or larger were found to significantly decrease populations however these rates had the largest sugar cane yields (cane and sugar t/ha). A [superscript]15N enriched pot trial conducted over two crop cycles showed positive BNF contributions to five Australian and two Brazilian sugar cane varieties. Although the pot culture system restricted sugar cane growth, BNF contributions of 5 to 16% were estimated. Brazilian sugar cane varieties SP70-1143 and SP71-1406 had 10 to 14% nitrogen derived from the air (Ndfa) while Australian sugar cane varieties had an estimated 5 to 16% Ndfa. [superscript]15N natural abundance measures within field grown sugar cane plants and associated reference plants indicated some N fixation was occurring, but the delta [superscript]15N values for both sugar cane and reference plants was so variable that the method was considered unreliable as a survey method. A planted field trial with carefully designed juxtaposition of selected reference and sugarcane plants was recommended as the only way to satisfactorily use this method. This study measured large natural populations of endophytic N[subscript]2-fixing bacteria within Australia sugar cane varieties across the cane growing regions of Queensland. These populations were strongly influenced by large N fertiliser additions. The demonstration of small, positive BNF contributions to Australian sugar cane highlights the potential of BNF and the importance of variety selection. A better understanding of the conditions and requirements for endophytic N[subscript]2-fixation will allow the system to be optimised. Quantification of the contribution of BNF to sugar cane in the field is required and can be achieved through careful design and planning of field or large lysimeter [superscript]15N enriched N balance and natural [superscript]15N abundance experiments. BNF by endophytic diazotrophs has potential to contribute to the N requirement of Australian sugar cane. Such a supply of an N via BNF to sugar cane has important economic and environmental benefits.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158295</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selection for sugar content at different times of the year in final stage trials in sugarcane breeding programs</field><field name="creator">Rattey, Allan Rodney</field><field name="description">Commercial sugarcane in Australia is harvested and subsequently crushed over a 20- 24 week period, typically between June and November. Increases in cane supply placed a strain on mill capacity, which is expensive to increase. Consequently, extension of the harvesting period was required. Earlier initiation of the harvesting period is the favoured industry option to alleviate mill capacity constraints. However, commercial cane sugar (CCS) levels are usually low very early in the harvesting season, and this reduces profitability at this time of the year. Therefore, low CCS early in the harvesting period and immediately before that reduces profitability and is regarded as an industry wide impediment to an earlier initiation of the harvesting period. Various crop management options could assist in addressing low early CCS, but genotypes are expected to play a pivotal role. Breeding research has identified high levels of genetic variation for early CCS, with measurable gains from targeted recurrent selection realised in early stage selection trials. However, current selection systems in industry breeding programs may not fully exploit these gains, particularly in final stage trials. Data on CCS were collected from different series of final stage trials at various predetermined times over random locations and crop-years (Central region), and predetermined times and N rates and random crop-years (Burdekin region). Additionally, cane yield (TCH) was measured twice per year for each location. These data were used to determine if selection systems focused specifically on early (before or during early-July) and mature (after early-July) periods would maximise genetic gain in each of these two sub-target periods (early and mature), as opposed to selection across both sub-periods for broad adaptation. Further, genotype x environment interaction effects, where environments included combinations of sample time, locations, N rates, crop-years, and crop ages, were quantified and their impact on selection decisions within and across the sub-periods established. Genotypes utilised in this research were considered representative of those undergoing assessment in final stage selection trials, after selection from original seedling populations across two previous selection stages. The experimental design involved numerous repeated measures datasets being collected, with the same plot sequentially sampled without re-randomisation. Analyses on such data in sugarcane research published to date have not evaluated alternative covariance and correlation structures between times in the residual matrix of such data. Thus, novel (to sugarcane) covariance structures to model the residual matrix of repeated measures datasets were examined to ensure application of the most appropriate statistical model. However, the choice of covariance structure to model the residual matrix did not impact on estimated best linear unbiased predictors and variance components or their accompanying standard errors. Further, the most parsimonious covariance structure does not estimate pooled residual variance across environments, which is essential for subsequent estimation of heritability and other key breeding parameters (e.g. response to selection). Therefore, a model following a split-block in time ANOVA, assuming a simple covariance structure to model the residual matrix, was considered satisfactory for CCS data collected within and across crop-years, and yield data collected across crop-years. Genotype x time interaction effects on CCS were small compared with genotype main effects, leading to high genetic correlations between times within each sub-period (early and mature). However, genetic correlations for sample times &#8805;16 weeks apart were considerably lower, and sample times within locations generally clustered according to sub-period (early vs. mature). However, genotype x sub-period interaction effects on CCS and TCH were not important across random locations and crop-years in the Central region, or fixed N rates and random crop-years in the Burdekin region, because a large portion of total genotype x environment interaction effects were retained within each sub-period. Therefore, subdivision of a selection program into two components, focused on early (pre-July) and mature (July and after) would not significantly enhance genetic gains. However, as genetic variance and response to selection were greatest during the early sub-period, an advantage in overall genetic gain would be realised if final stage trials were assessed early in the harvesting period. For the Central region, the results indicated that final stage trials should be assessed over multiple locations and crop-years, but with only one sample time per crop-year required for measurement of CCS and TCH. In the Burdekin region, significant genotype x N rate interaction effects influenced selection for TCH (especially in ratoon crops), but not CCS. Some of the genotype x N rate interaction effects were attributed to increased lodging, which increased with applied N. The genotype x N rate interaction effects were mainly due to divergent genotype performance for the lowest compared to recommended (or higher) N rates. These results are of practical significance in that they highlight the importance of maintaining adequate levels of N in selection trials, with the medium N rate (corresponding to current industry recommended rates of application) providing optimal growers&#146; returns. Direct selection for genotype performance at recommended rates of N fertilizer was found to be optimal. Construction of managed environments by lowering N rates to reduce lodging and possibly decrease error variation would be inappropriate because the genetic correlation between the low and medium N rates was near zero. However, the combination of small genotype x time interaction and unimportant genotype x crop age interaction effects on CCS indicated that effective selection for CCS in final stage trials could occur early in the year at a young crop age, prior to lodging. Overall, the results indicated that final stage trials do not have to be conducted in each of two sub-periods (early and mature) to optimise gains from selection. However, selection gains would be maximised by selection based on CCS measured relatively early in the harvesting season. Conducting final stage trials across multiple locations and crop-years is important because of large genotype interactions with these factors. Recommended rates of N fertilizer should be applied with particular care to avoid sub-optimal levels of N.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158614</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into the Cellular and Molecular Origins of BRCA1-Breast Cancer</field><field name="creator">Smart, Chanel Elisha</field><field name="description">Tumours arising in BRCA1-mutation carriers are frequently classified as basal-like although the cellular and molecular basis for this phenotype is unknown. It is possible that BRCA1- tumours, in contrast to other breast tumours, may originate in the basal cell compartment thought to contain mammary stem cells. Alternatively this phenotype may be the consequence of a partial epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, disruption of functional BRCA1 levels causes aberrant mammary gland development and differentiation. We have previously shown that functional disruption of Brca1 using a dominant negative mutant causes abnormal epithelial morphogenesis and impaired milk secretion. This raises the possibility that disruption of BRCA1 results in a disruption of epithelial characteristics, such as cell polarity, which are lost during EMT. It is also possible that BRCA1 plays a special role in the fate determination of basal cells and that the effects of BRCA1 disruption may be specific to the compartment in which they occur. In this study, these possibilities are investigated by examining the initial changes that occur in mammary epithelial cells after BRCA1 disruption. The expression, localisation and function of several proteins critical to normal epithelial polarisation is assessed in human mammary epithelial cells transfected with a dominant negative BRCA1 mutant. Assessment of E-cadherin, &#226;-catenin, ZO-1 and Scrib did not reveal any evidence of any abnormalities in these polarity markers. The acquisition of basal and/or mesenchymal characteristics in mammary cells was also assessed. A significant induction of vimentin expression with a concomitant reduction in cytokeratin (CK5) expression was observed in the SVCT mammary epithelial cell-line transfected with dominant negative BRCA1. It is interesting that this effect is observed in cells of mixed basal/luminal phenotype, and not in those of luminal lineage. This may suggest that BRCA1 disruption prompts a compartment specific partial transition towards a mesenchymal phenotype. Furthermore, to determine the initial molecular events incurred by Brca1 disruption in the mammary gland, microarray analysis was performed on two independent murine models which exhibit Brca1-mediated mammary development defects. Whilst biological variation at this stage is a confounding factor, changes to genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and the actin cytoskeleton were shown to be significantly altered in the two independent models. These results may have implications for understanding BRCA1-mediated tumourigenesis and the phenotype of BRCA1-associated tumours.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158408</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women&#146;s Artistic Gymnastics: An (Auto-)Ethnographic Journey</field><field name="creator">Barker-Ruchti, Natalie</field><field name="description">Breathtaking circus-like performances, perfectly shaped lean bodies, ponytails and glittering leotards: the present-day ideals of women&#146;s artistic gymnastics are narrow. Competitive success is only possible if gymnasts satisfy distinct bodily characteristics and appearances and produce particular gymnastics performances. In order for gymnasts to achieve success within this selective gymnastics model, they have to coerce their bodies towards detailed technical requirements and specific aesthetic standards, undergo a repetitive and timeconsuming training schedule from a young age, and submit to an authoritative coach. How do present-day female gymnasts experience their sport? How do they deal with its idealistic pressures to form their selves? This thesis examines gymnasts&#146; subjectivities using a range of Michel Foucault&#146;s and feminist concepts. Foucault argues that the modern subject constructs identity through an agonistic tension between external pressures that aim to train individuals in particular ways and personal agency that allows self-regulation and selfstylisation. Contextual factors are powerful in inscribing our bodies, directing our lives and who we see our selves to be. Women, feminist scholars argue, have limited agency in constructing their subjectivities and lives. In being controlled by external pressures, mainstream female subjectivities maintain and reinforce patriarchal discourses of femininity and masculinity. This thesis begins by exploring my own passion and experiences in artistic gymnastics, interweaving these with the field notes and interview data I collected from a number of elite gymnasts and coaches. The ethnographic and self-reflective accounts illustrate how this sport creates particular gymnasts, performances and identities. While these may be experienced differently, the dominant gymnastics model coerces its athletes toward homogeneity, yet individuality. Gymnasts strive to force their bodies to achieve the sport&#146;s regulatory and idealistic requirements. These standards provide meaning and feelings of competence and identity. Any sense of empowerment, however, is counter-productive as it reinforces feminine ideals of corporeal discipline and control, pleasing others through appearance and subordination from and dependence on others. Further, the normalisation process individualises as less able or unsuitable gymnasts are identified, isolated and penalised. The (auto-)ethnographic focus of the thesis extends to a genealogical exploration of women&#146;s artistic gymnastics. In particular, the thesis presents historical information to shed light on how the modern form of gymnastics has been able to develop. It does this through descriptive analyses of two eras relevant to gymnastics: Swedish gymnastics in 19th Century Victorian England and the changes gymnastics experienced during Communist politics. Using critical feminist Foucauldian interpretations, the thesis positions artistic gymnastics as a case of female identity formation and conduct. The analyses illustrate how the external pressures today&#146;s women face have controlling effects, which limit their agency to self-stylise their selves and lives. Liberation from such forces, as in Foucault&#146;s notion of an &#145;aesthetics of the self&#146;, may only be achieved through critical self-reflection. My personal journey from indoctrinated gymnast to a feminist critic of this sport illustrates how women may be able to interpret patriarchal forces.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158616</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patient Perspectives on Treatment Compliance: Balancing Survival with Quality of Life</field><field name="creator">Howells, Janet Barbara</field><field name="description">Patients&#146; lack of compliance with their prescribed treatment regimen is a significant issue in the management of end stage renal (ESRD) disease. Low rates of compliance persist and have serious consequences for many patients in the form of medical complications and mortality. Compliance is thus a contentious issue as conflict arises from the differing expectations of health care staff and the practices of patients in relation to the management of their treatment regimen. The practices and experiences of patients in accommodating their prescribed treatment for ESRD have predominantly been understood through the lens of the biomedical discourse. Within the health care context compliance is one of the major conceptual conduits for this discourse. Research on patient compliance with their prescribed treatment has primarily focused upon compliance rates, factors predicting non-compliance and intervention strategies to raise compliance. Such a strong focus on one facet of the efficacy of treatment regimen has left significant gaps in knowledge and understanding. Despite the centrality of patients in the success of any treatment plan, their perspectives regarding treatment are under-represented in the research literature and clinical care context. This thesis explored and documented the perspectives of ESRD patients in regard to compliance with the aim of enriching the understanding of the impact and experience of compliance with the prescribed treatment regimen. The conceptual framework underpinning the research was influenced by an understanding that issues of power and control are inherent in the notion of compliance, a patient centred approach to health care delivery and social work approaches that value holistic understandings of human experiences and promote self determination and autonomy in dealing with health care contexts. Capturing the patient perspective of ESRD and its treatment required a methodology that allowed for an in-depth exploration of patients&#146; views and experiences. The research design was qualitative and exploratory. Ten participants were purposively sampled and invited to participate in an in-depth interview. A thematic analysis identified the perspectives and experiences of patients currently undergoing treatment for ESRD. Participants within this study described their experience of negotiating a relationship with ESRD and treatment as an ongoing effort to manage living with a chronic disease and balance the necessities and limitations of treatment and disease with their needs and expectations and their quality of life. In this management, compliance was not the primary focus of participants. This study demonstrated that participants had many other legitimate, equally important demands and competing priorities to negotiate within their lives with ESRD. Modifying the standards of compliance to more readily suit the demands of their lives and quality of survival was a way in which participants could exert control over their illness experience. Participants reported that frequently these modifications were negatively labelled by health professionals. This thesis argues that the concept of compliance too narrowly defines the illness experience and makes it difficult to understand why patients select a particular degree of compliance with their prescribed treatment regimen. Whilst the biomedical perspective continues to be systematically applied in the chronic illness arena to the exclusion of other perspectives it will limit other ways of thinking and talking about patient&#146;s treatment experience. The primary aim of this thesis was to raise awareness of alternative voices to the dominant biomedical discourse in this context, one of which is the patient perspective.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158296</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">STRUCTURAL AND DYNAMIC STUDIES OF THE CYCLOTIDES AND THEIR PRECURSORS</field><field name="creator">Barry, Daniel Gordon</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on an unusual family of plant proteins termed the cyclotides. The cyclotides are distinguished from most other proteins with an amide head-to-tail cyclized backbone. They comprise 29 to 37 amino acids and have three disulfide bonds arranged in a specific cross-bracing pattern within the core of their compact structure. The combination of these structural features confers a range of biological benefits that include increased thermal stability and resistance to exoproteases and, in some instances, endoproteases. Since the unusual structural features of the cyclotides are accompanied by biological benefits, there is the potential to develop protein therapeutics which have similar biological advantages. The cyclotides are not widely distributed throughout nature but more than 50 cyclotides have been found in plants from the Rubiaceae and Violaceae family. Far fewer cyclotide precursor proteins are known with less than ten reported to date. The discovery of three cyclotide precursor proteins from Viola hederaceae, previously unscreened for precursors is discussed in this thesis. The sequence variation of the precursor proteins provides clues to the processing of linear cyclotide precursors. Such precursor sequence comparisons offer important insights into the maturation of cyclotide precursors, however, the deductions are limited by the number of sequences known. A complete understanding of cyclotide precursor protein processing requires mutagenesis studies. Accordingly, the application of intein technology to cyclotide precursor production was tested, showing that intrinsic properties of the cyclotide precursor proteins limit the production of soluble precursors with this system. Subsequent investigations centered on the mature domain of the cyclotides. The structure and dynamics of the largest cyclotide, palicourein, which was discovered in an anti-HIV screen of Amazonian plants is reported. The solution structure of palicourein indicates that an increase in intercysteine loop size does not alter the core structure of the cyclotides. Natural abundance 13C NMR relaxation was used to determine the microdynamic parameters of the backbone of palicourein. Order parameters near unity for the majority of the backbone, particularly over core residues, supports the results from structural analysis that despite having extended loop regions, palicourein maintains a highly rigid scaffold, which is unusual for proteins of this size. It indicates that the cyclotide scaffold presents an exciting opportunity to produce an alternative binding scaffold that is amenable to loop mutagenesis. Previous studies looked at the combined contribution the cyclic backbone and cystine knot make to the structural stability of the cyclotides. To investigate the contribution of the cyclic backbone, the structure of a synthetic linear cyclotide, des-(24-28)-kalata B1 was determined. The linear derivative exhibited high structural similarity to its cyclic parent kalata B1, which suggests that the cystine knot motif is sufficient to maintain the rigid structure of the cyclotides. It is also shown that des-(24-28)-kalata B1 has none of the hemolytic activity observed for kalata B1, suggesting that although the cyclic backbone is not necessary for maintaining the structure of the cyclotides, it does mediate hemolytic activity. A large part of the structural integrity of the cyclotides can be attributed to the cystine knot motif. This motif is common amongst small proteins where stability is important, such as defense peptides and toxins. However, it is not the only disulfide bonding motif observed. The distribution of disulfide bonding patterns in nature was determined for proteins in the Protein Data Bank, showing that disulfide pattern formation is a directed process with a few patterns preferred over others. An analysis of the topologies using graph theory shows that properties of the planar graphs, which are two dimensional representations of a protein, are correlated with favored disulfide bonding patterns. It is suggested from this that the development of disulfide bond-containing alternative binding scaffolds should begin with proteins that display a favored disulfide bonding pattern. While a key aim of this thesis was to further understand the cyclization mechanism of cyclotide precursors, the primary aim was to further understand the structural and dynamic characteristics of the highly stable structure of the cyclotides, in an attempt to suggest the amenability of the scaffold for development of alternative binding proteins for therapeutic applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158409</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Competitive Ability of Chickpea with Sowthistle: A Canopy Architectural Modelling Study</field><field name="creator">Cici, Syedeh Hosseini</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to use a three-dimensional (3D) architectural plant modelling approach to simulate possible ways to improve the aboveground competitive ability of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) with sowthistle (Sonchus oleraceus L.). It is now widely accepted that the best approach to manage weeds in field crops is through the development and implementation of integrated weed management (IWM) approaches. Such approaches should make use of the competitive ability of the crop canopy and the application of other cultural practices that ultimately reduce the dependence on herbicide use. To help understand the complexity of the different IWM choices available, computational models can be used by the agronomist, plant breeder or agricultural practitioner to simulate and visualise these different cultural practices in weedy situations to evaluate the possible ways to enhance crop competitiveness to the common weeds of that crop. In order to demonstrate the feasibility and value of such an approach, research experiments and modelling techniques have been used to develop architectural models for chickpea and sowthistle. These models were then used to simulate how changes in crop canopy architecture could modify chickpea&#146;s competitive ability with sowthistle. In order to determine the potential of using canopy manipulations of the crop to improve its competitive ability with sowthistle, an experiment was conducted in which sowthistle plants were grown under two densities of chickpea and in full sun light (as a control). While the phyllochron and bolting time of sowthistle increased when the light availability decreased, the number of branches, number of capitula and consequently seeds in sowthistle were significantly decreased under reduced light availability. To capture the 3D architecture of the chickpea and sowthistle, plants were grown separately in a sandy, well watered and fertilized soil. A sonic digitizer system was then used to record a number of chenges in plant morphological, topological, and geometrical changes in a non-destructive way over time. The resulting data sets were analysed and used to develop a realistic, dynamic architectural model for each of the two species. Plant architectural (virtual) models were created using the mathematical formalism of Lindenmayer Systems. The virtual plant models were verified for growth and development, using an independently produced data set. A quasi-Monte Carlo ray tracing program was employed to estimate the light availability under different architectures of the virtual chickpea plants in a &#147;chickpea-light environment&#148; model. Since the aim was to simulate the effect of the chickpea canopy manipulation on sowthistle morphogenesis, observation of the effect of light availability on sowthistle were used to calibrate the morphogenesis of virtual sowthistle and then this lightsensitive virtual sowthistle was incorporated into the chickpea-light environment model. The key point is that the entire development period and changing light environment is considered. In the final &#145;chickpea-light environment-sowthistle&#146; (CLES) model the virtual chickpea plants were modified to replicate the architecture of five different cultivars (Macarena, Bumper, Jimbour, 99071-1001, and 96033-1014). The models were run over time and both visualizations and numerical output were produced to examine their competitive ability with sowthistle. To validate the results of the CLES model, an experiment using the same five chickpea cultivars with a sowthistle growing under their canopy was conducted. The simulation results were found to be in good agreement with the empirical data. The growth of sowthistle, in both in silico and empirical experiments was reduced most by 99071-1001 a cultivar with short phyllochron and early branching feature. The second rank of competitive ability in both simulated and observed data belonged to Macarena and Bumper while Jimbour and 96033-1014 were the least competitive. Both the simulation and experiment results supported the hypothesis that morphogenesis of a weed can be suppressed under specific canopy architectures of crops. Some practical applications of the developed model are discussed and it is shown that the developed model can be used to explore a number of different agronomic practices such as choice of cultivar and seeding rate in weed management systems. The practical implication of these simulation studies is how a management system that uses quick canopy closure can provide sufficient suppression of weeds in chickpea.

Did this reflect some of the unintended impacts of major attractions which are regarded as so significant in tourism destination appeal? In the search for an explanation this dissertation aims to provide a better understanding of the rise and influence of a dominant attraction in a regional destination. This research also sought to explain the poor performance of the destination&#146;s secondary attractions and whether this was influenced by the presence of the dominant attraction. The study examines the rise of tourism in the Australian heritage city of Ballarat with a particular focus on its dominant attraction, the outdoor heritage museum, Sovereign Hill and its relationship with the destination over time. Commencing with a review of destination development it became apparent that there was a lack of understanding about how destinations with a dominant attraction evolve, develop and regenerate themselves for ongoing sustainability. In seeking a useful framework for analysis, the life cycle concept, concerned as it is with development and change over time, emerged as a robust and applicable concept. In a subsequent review of life cycle research, lack of historical context in analysis emerged as a major gap. In response to these findings the thesis applies the historical method to strengthen and deepen its application of the life cycle concept. The literature review also established that while the life cycle concept has proven a useful framework for destination analysis in tourism, its application had not been extended to a concurrent analysis of attractions and their individual product management as a mechanism for understanding impacts and relationships which emerge over time. The literature review also revealed that the role of management actions, in affecting the turning points, shape and direction of life cycles was under-researched. The research confirmed that the concurrent application of the life cycle concept to three domains of destination, attraction and product while proving a useful, additional application highlighted problems with an absence, overabundance, consistency and/or reliability of data. These problems were offset to a large degree by applying the historian&#146;s technique of using both the panoramic camera, to track the course of the life cycles, and a telephoto lens to focus on idiosyncratic vignettes which provided the rich contextual detail needed to understand critical points within the cycles. Analysis of the destination&#146;s life cycle revealed that the development of Sovereign Hill triggered Ballarat&#146;s take off and growth phases. Lack of strategic response to the rise of Sovereign Hill, however, saw Ballarat skip the development phase and proceed instead into stagnation and remain there. By tracking the actions of local government and tourism managers from 1970 the causes of Ballarat&#146;s inertia until 1995 were revealed. By 1995 the dynamics of Sovereign Hill&#146;s dominance had become entrenched. No amount of action on the part of the destination from that time could shift the perception that Ballarat tourism was Sovereign Hill. Sovereign Hill&#146;s life cycles, by contrast, saw two classic bell shaped cycles evolve, demonstrating the importance of tactical and strategic management in directing the course of the cycles at both the attraction and product level. Impressive revival phases were generated by new sources of income and sustained by a masterfully managed night time son illuminare, Blood on the Southern Cross. The research confirmed positive economic and socio-cultural benefits of dominant attractions on destinations, primarily positive multiplier benefits and the conferring of valuable bragging rights through the strength of the attraction&#146;s branding. These positive benefits, however, served to mask significant negative outcomes for the destination. Local tourism industry complacency and dependence, in addition to strategic inertia of the destination, saw the attraction disengage as it sought new markets and sources of income. The extent of the disengagement was exhibited by differences in visitation pattern and type between Ballarat and Sovereign Hill. The study identified factors in destination and attraction success and failure. The presence of a successful dominant attraction is no guarantee of success at the destination level. The lessons learned from this analysis contributes to destination development theory by providing cautionary evidence that there are negative impacts associated with the development of dominant attractions as triggers for destination development. The findings in turn should serve as a caution to local government and place planners in general about the potential adverse impacts of the rise of dominant attractions and the need for a greater level of strategic intervention on the part of tourism area managers when this dynamic evolves in a regional setting. In contributing to a better understanding of the role of management in directing the course of an attraction&#146;s life cycles relative to the destination, despite equally volatile and competitive conditions, the research has presented a clear demonstration of the need for a much higher level of skill for tourism operators, area managers and local government, in order to sustain viable tourism enterprises and places. While we have business policy in Australia wedded to an ideology of self regulation, alternative voices calling for a more critical examination of this issue have difficulty being heard. The failure of the tourism industry in general to address the skill base of its operators or product renders much product unsaleable and place marketing redundant. The establishment and enforcement of a clear, international standard for all operators on the other hand, might see a much smaller, though more viable industry, far more capable of realising its full potential.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158297</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#147;When you&#146;re black, they look at you harder&#148; Narrating Aboriginality within Public Health</field><field name="creator">Bond, Chelsea Joanne</field><field name="description">While there is a clear investment within public health upon race, ethnicity and culture in identifying and explaining health inequalities experienced by those populations who are racially, ethnically and culturally othered, there remains scarce attention given to the meaning of such identities by those who proclaim them. Epidemiological and health behaviourist applications of identity often produce portraits of Aboriginality that convey illness, disease and dysfunction as inherently Aboriginal conditions. The aim of this study was to enable an urban Aboriginal community to articulate their own narratives of Aboriginality beyond those contained within the medical narrative. This study incorporated a Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach, utilising research methods of participant observation, key informant interviews and photo voice. The action phase of the study was informed by a Community Cultural Development (CCD) framework, in which local Indigenous arts workers and organisations collaborated to develop initiatives which simultaneously explored and promoted the cultural identity of this community from a strength-based perspective. The seven key themes that emerged within Aboriginal narratives of identity emphasised Aboriginality as expressions of; (1) stories (2) relationships to people and place (3) difference, (4) marginality, (5) bloodlines (6) pride, and (7) negotiation and interrogation. The common thread throughout each of these, at times, competing narratives is that the proclamation of an Aboriginal identity is a vital resource for living rather than a determinate of premature death, disease and dysfunction. The opportunity to articulate one&#146;s identity narrative was found to be an empowering action in its own right, but it also enabled &#145;new truths&#146; of Aboriginality to emerge that allow strength, survival and health to be very real conditions for Aboriginal people. This study demonstrates the need for a more contextualised understanding and application of the identity concept within public health practices generally and a more rigorous debate and reflection upon the use of ethnic, racial and cultural identity (concepts) particularly within the Australian public health research literature. It also strongly suggests the need to engage with and understand Aboriginality in a way that complements and supports Indigenous constructions of identity, health and well-being rather than compete against them.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158618</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel peptides from Conus planorbis, Terebra subulata, and Hastula hectica</field><field name="creator">Imperial, Julita Salabao</field><field name="description">Using assay-directed fractionation of the venom from the vermivorous cone snail Conus planorbis, a new conotoxin designated pl14a, was isolated with potent activity at both nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and a voltage-gated potassium channel subtype. pl14a has an amidated C-terminus, an elongated N-terminal tail (6 residues) and two disulfide bonds (1-3, 2-4 connectivity) in a novel framework distinct from other conotoxins. The peptide was chemically synthesized, and its three-dimensional structure was demonstrated to be well defined, with an &#225;- helix and two 3(10) helices present. The prepropeptide precursor of pl14a has a novel signal sequence, indicating that pl14a defines a new gene superfamily, the J-conotoxin superfamily. Five additional peptides in the J-superfamily were identified. pl14a and other J-superfamily peptides: pl14a FPRPRICNLACRAGIGHKYPFCHCR-NH2 pl14.1 GPGSAICNMACRLGQGHMYPFCNCN-NH2 pl14.2 GPGSAICNMACRLEHGHLYPFCHCR-NH2 pl14.3 GPGSAICNMACRLEHGHLYPFCNCD-NH2 fe14.1 SPGSTICKMACRTGNGHKYPFCNCR-NH2 fe14.2 SSGSTVCKMMCRLGYGHLYPSCGCR-NH2 Intracranial injection of pl14a in mice elicited excitatory symptoms that included shaking, rapid circling, barrel-rolling and seizures. pl14 inhibited both a K+ channel subtype (Kv1.6, IC50 = 1.59 &#236;M), and neuronal (IC50 = 8.7 &#236;M for &#225;3&#226;4) and neuromuscular (IC50 = 0.54 &#236;M for &#225;1&#226;1&#229;&#228;) subtypes of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expressed in oocytes. Similarities in sequence and structure are apparent between the middle loop of pl14a and the second loop of some &#225;-conotoxins. This is the first conotoxin shown to affect both voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels. Results of initial experiments on structure and activity relationships are presented. Other novel peptides were isolated from C. planorbis venom including peptides resembling conotoxins belonging to the P gene superfamily. pl9b was chemically synthesized and was shown to be active by microinjection in the nematode C. elegans. Intracranial injection in mice, however, did not produce symptoms. C. planorbis peptides resembling P-superfamily conotoxins: pl9a WCGGYCTDNL&#227;CDMDCRCRSGYCKH pl9b WCGGYCTANL&#227;CDMDCYCRSGYCKY pl9c WCGSDCAID&#227;HCGS&#227;CYCYVNWNSCLRK Peptides belonging to a novel family, the Conopeptide Y family, were identified using a bioassay-guided fractionation of C. planorbis venom. The preponderance of tyrosine residues as well as basic and hydrophobic residues is striking, characteristics similar to Neuropeptide Y and related peptides. CPY-Pl1 was chemically synthesized and bioassays demonstrated a potent excitatory effect on mammals. Initial tests on Xenopus oocytes expressing K+ channels revealed activity on some Kv1 isoforms. C. planorbis peptides belonging to the novel Conopeptide Y family: CPY-Pl1 GTYLYPFSYYRLWRYFTRFLHKQPYYYVHI CPY-Pl2 ARFLHPFQYYTLYRYLTRFLHRYPIYYIRY Novel peptides belonging to the O gene superfamily of conotoxins were identified from cDNA clones from C. planorbis and C. ferrugineus, a closely related cone. One peptide, pl6.1, was chemically synthesized; intracranial injection in mice failed to elicit symptoms. No effect was observed on the complex action potentials of mouse skeletal muscles and assays on Xenopus oocytes expressing the Kv1.2 isoform were negative.

The three polypeptide venom components, augertoxins s6a, s7a and s11a, are 40-41 AA in length with 3-4 disulfide linkages. The arrangement of Cys residues is reminiscent of certain conopeptide superfamilies, but molecular cloning failed to show the highly conserved sequence features diagnostic of the conopeptide gene superfamily with a similar arrangement of Cys residues. One of the purified peptides, s7a, elicited an uncoordinated twisting syndrome when injected into the nematode C. elegans. Augertoxin s7a was chemically synthesized and intracranial injection of relatively large amounts of the peptide produced excitotoxic symptoms in mice.

Unlike the augertoxins from T. subulata, the sizes of the H. hectica augertoxins are comparable to those of conotoxins. Posttranslationally modified amino acids were not found in the augertoxins from the two Terebridae species. The precursor sequence for one of the H. hectica peptides extended the observation in T. subulata of an absence of overlap between augertoxins and conotoxin gene superfamilies. The biological activity of Hhe7a was demonstrated in C. elegans and Hhe7a was chemically synthesized. Relatively high doses of Hhe7a caused excitatory symptoms in intracranially injected mice.

Both poets have a significant creative relationshp with the writing of Rainer Maria Rilke, and in this study my aim is to read Boyle's and Beaver's poetry in the light of this influence in order to both evaluate its effect on their writings and to arrive at a deeper understanding of that writing itself. The methodological shape of this thesis stems from this dual aim. In place of the methods often involved in an influence study, this investigation is based on close readings of all three poets, and the tracing of thematic and technical sympathies between Beaver and Rilke, and Boyle and Rilke. Following an introduction that focuses on the way in which influence is itself figured in the work of the Australian poets, the two thematic chapters of this thesis are loosely subdvided into individual discussions of their writing. The first addresses the topic of sight. In all three poets' work, the awareness of ways of seeing and degrees of attention motivate their poems in significant and varied ways. In Beaver's work, sight is often connected to processes of poetic 'ingestion', to the creation of both internal topographies and external totemic landscapes. I suggest, in this chapter, that these poetic processes are generative forces behind his (traditionally Rilkean) modes of celebration and lament. Sight in Royle's poetry is involved with shaping and expressing his poetry's acute awareness of human suffering, and is a crucial aspect of what I have called his 'empathic' mode of writing. This mode of Boyle's is explored further in the second chapter, whch focuses on questions of lyric address. In it, I draw on Rilke's well-acknowledged emphasis on poetry's 'you', its turn to the second person, to evaluate how this aspect of poetry's communicativeness functions in the work of both Beaver and Boyle. Underlying this discussion, as well as the first, is an acknowledgment of the importance of space in the work of all three poets. Space, from Rilke's concept of Weltinnenraum - 'world inner space' - to Boyle's 'Museum of Space' and Beaver's awareness and transformation of place, is an overarching concern crucial to understandmg Rilke's presence in the work of the Australian poets.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158299</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moderate Temperature Ageing of High Pressure Die Cast Mg-Al Alloys</field><field name="creator">Bowles, Amanda L.</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with the effects of long-term ageing at moderate temperatures on the mechanical properties of high pressure die cast magnesium-aluminium alloys, AZ91 and AM60. High pressure die castings are used predominantly in automotive applications and, as such, are required to maintain stable mechanical properties throughout a vehicles' lifetime, but exposure to the environment or to engine heat can result in changes to the microstructure and, therefore, to the mechanical properties. Reports on the magnitude of these changes are contradictory and this study attempts to resolve the controversy. An attractive feature of using AM60 and AZ91 alloys for high pressure die casting is the ability to produce thin wall sections. Importantly, the mechanical properties are reported to vary with wall thickness, although the trends reported are often contradictory and, indeed, structure-property relationships in high pressure die cast magnesium alloys are, in general, not well understood. A second aim of this work is, therefore, to address this issue. Tensile specimens of AZ91D and AM60B were cold chamber high pressure die cast. Three types of specimen were made: 2 mm and 5 mm thick rectangular cross-section specimens and 6.4 mm diameter cylindrical specimens. The specimens were directly aged (no solution heat treatment) at temperatures between 100&#186;C and 160&#186;C for up to 10 000 h. The room temperature tensile properties were measured and the microstructure characterised by a range of techniques including optical, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, electron back scattered diffraction, x-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance. The as-cast microstructure consisted of primary &#945;-grains and precipitates of Mg17Al12, the &#946;-phase, which forms a loose network of large discrete particles around the grain boundaries. The &#945;-grains had a bimodal grain size distribution with the large &#945;-grains (&gt;12 &#181;m); as often reported, predominantly occurring towards the centre of the castings. However, contrary to previous reports, the size of the small &#945;-grains did not vary with position below the surface, being a constant 4-5 &#181;m throughout the casting. It is commonly reported that high pressure die castings have a surface "skin" characterised by a fine grain structure and its existence is thought to explain the effects of section thickness on the mechanical properties. Efforts were made to define a skin thickness using microhardness profiles and a number of quantitative metallography techniques. No clear definition of skin depth was possible and it is shown why previous authors have reported contradictory skin depths. Non-equilibrium solidification during high pressure die casting results in a significant amount of solute (aluminium and zinc) remaining in solid solution, with the solute content increasing towards the grain boundaries. Direct ageing of AZ91 and AM60 at temperatures between 100&#186;C and 160&#186;C results in the decomposition of the solute-rich &#945; phase by discontinuous and continuous precipitation of the &#946;-phase. The solid state precipitation reactions occur exclusively in the solute-rich regions, namely the grain boundaries and interdendritic regions; the grain centres are free of precipitates. The precipitation reactions are accompanied by changes in the mechanical properties. In general, the ductility decreased and the yield stress increased with ageing time. During ageing, the precipitates decorate the grain boundary and interdendritic regions and it is suggested that the loss of ductility is associated with cracking of the large grain boundary &#946;-phase particles. The various possible microstructural contributions to the yield stress are considered and a model is proposed to explain the ageing effects. The increase in yield stress described above was not observed in one batch of castings, although these castings did show a similar decrease in ductility as the other castings. The lack of an ageing response in this anomalous set of castings is explained by the presence of continuous precipitates in the as-cast condition, which alter the size and distribution of precipitates during the subsequent ageing, thereby reducing the strengthening.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158411</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE STRUCTURAL DETERMINANTS OF QUALITY IN RESIDENTIAL AGED CARE</field><field name="creator">Richardson, Beverley Frances</field><field name="description">Within the residential aged care field, all providers have implemented a quality system consistent with the regulatory requirements of The Aged Care Act (1997), and have completed two cycles of Accreditation. The variation in assessed resident outcome ratings suggested it may be of value to explore possible causative factors of influence, in an attempt to identify the determinants of quality. Avedis Donabedian (1980:82-83), an acknowledged leader in quality in health care, proposed in his quality framework that organisational structure influences process, and process is directly related to outcomes. Further, he theorized that structural characteristics may have a direct influence on outcomes. This study chose to test Donabedian&#146;s theory by investigating the impact of organisational structural components on resident outcome ratings, and to explore relationships between those structural elements to determine their relative levels of influence in order to identify whether there was predictive validity for an optimal structural model of care. The defined scope for the research was a population study of the residential aged care field in Queensland. The study design employed a time-series data collection approach involving secondary data analysis of accreditation reports for the first and second accreditation cycles. Structural elements for investigation were aligned to Donabedian&#146;s structural framework, and included levels of centralization or decentralization within the governance structure; provider size in terms of the number of facilities under its control; facility size in terms of numbers of beds; ownership by sector; geographic region of operation; mix of resident dependency ratios; and accessibility by special needs groups. Statistical analysis found that for both the first and second accreditation cycles, provider size had the greatest predictive power of the structural variables in determining ratings compliance, with the large provider category having the greatest effect. Large providers managing 15-25 facilities, including those from public, private and nonprofit sectors, were found to adhere to a theoretically-based structural efficiency model, and also to achieve the highest levels of total compliance with the Accreditation Standards. Plaudits on the particular success of large providers in demonstrating both efficiency and effectiveness need to be tempered by concerns about the balance between efficiency and equity. The research findings demonstrated that when structural design was directed by technical and allocative efficiency decisions, barriers to access were created for residents who were regionally or culturally disadvantaged, as operations in remote areas, and in planning and delivering culturally appropriate services, incur greater costs. Donabedian (2003:64) submits that the degree to which standards are specified can be perceived as a continuum, and that not all standards measurements are explicitly stated. It is implicitly understood that the regulations do not require demonstrated effectiveness of outcomes compliance for select segments of the resident population, but rather for the total resident population. Therefore the low incidence of response by large providers to residents living in remote areas, and those with culturally-specific needs, led to exploration of an alternative optimal structure. In addition to the predicted success of large providers in achieving high effectiveness ratings, the logistic regression equations also predicted small providers managing 2-4 facilities had a statistically significant influence in determining total ratings compliance. Only a small differentiation in the Mean compliance ratings was found between these two most effective provider-size categories. However, the resident benefits offered by small providers included their success in addressing equity of access barriers for residents experiencing regional or cultural disadvantage. Examination of their structural characteristics suggested that in contrast with the efficiency model adopted by large providers, small providers tended to adhere to a structural equity model. The research findings confirmed that structural design choices do have the capacity to directly influence effectiveness in terms of outcomes, thus validating Donabedian&#146;s theory of outcome-structure dependence. Moreover, an organisation&#146;s structural characteristics also influence the scale and scope of its operations, which have a subsequent impact on efficiency and equity. While both large and small provider sizes were found to be highly effective in compliance with the regulated outcome standards, large scale operations with limited scope were more likely to be efficient, while small scale operations with a broad scope were more likely to be equitable. Although the latter model most strongly aligns with regulatory and policy instruments, which are inclusive of principles of equity and access, it is the former model that appears to have garnered greatest political favour. Analysis of the implications of the research findings confirmed the existence of a policy tension between efficiency drivers and equity principles, and concluded that the regulatory and policy frameworks are currently exerting contradictory pressures on the institutional operating environment of the residential aged care field. The research found that in the pursuit of increased industry efficiency, equity of access is sacrificed. The structural design choices of the most effective service providers focus on either breadth of scale or of scope. Policy makers are therefore faced with the choice of which model should be promoted &#150; one that is efficiency-driven, or one that is equity-driven.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158300</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">WOMEN OF THE HUNGER YEARS : Surviving the Normalisation of American-Occupied Nuremberg, 1945-1948</field><field name="creator">McTavish, Catherine Anne Gillian</field><field name="description">When the war in Europe ended with Germany&#146;s surrender on 8 May 1945, the country was divided into zones of occupation by the four Allied armies. Due to the millions of men killed in the war or captured by the Allies, the German population was overwhelmingly female and women were forced to take on male roles, often for the first time. Most families were now headed by women who were responsible for the provision of food, shelter and money, and this was a difficult prospect in the chaotic postwar period. Despite the dominance of Nazi ideology which called for the confinement of women to a primarily maternal role, women rose to the challenges created by the war and the defeat, and effected the survival of themselves and their dependants. Women filled positions within society, industry and the family which had previously been occupied by men, and broke away from the traditional female roles that had been a part of German society for centuries. Yet, this shake-up of the social order failed to translate into a push for gender equality or female rights during the 1950s, and the opportunity provided by the postwar years became a &#147;lost chance&#148; for German women as they returned to roles within the home and the family. This thesis investigates the situation in the city of Nuremberg between the years 1945 and 1948 and the manner in which locals struggled to rebuild their lives. Conditions within the city, which was occupied by the American army, were profoundly affected by the Nazi period and the war, and disorder remained for years after the defeat. In order for the American Military Government and the fledgling German authorities to operate effectively, they needed to impose some kind of &#147;normality&#148; upon the city. Their attempts to do so and the place of women within this process are examined in five different areas: denazification and democratisation; housing; food; crime; and sexual relations. In some of these areas, women occupied an important part of the reconstruction of Nuremberg society, yet in others they played only a minor role, even though they comprised the majority of the population. By examining the normalisation process in Nuremberg, it is possible to analyse the role of women and relations between the sexes during the first three postwar years. This thesis will show that, despite the demands of the postwar period which required women to take on new and unfamiliar responsibilities, thereby demonstrating that they were capable of much more than domestic duties, by the late 1940s it was already clear that women were beginning to return to traditional gender roles.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158412</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Competing demands on the trunk muscles: effects, consequences and mechanisms</field><field name="creator">Smith, Michelle</field><field name="description">Stability of the spine and pelvis is dependent on activity of the trunk muscles. However, as these muscles are also involved in other tasks, such as continence and respiration, their contribution to lumbopelvic stability is complicated. As such, the central nervous system (CNS) must coordinate the contribution of the trunk muscles to many diverse functions to maintain homeostasis. In the presence of pain or dysfunction, such as during low back pain (LBP), urinary incontinence or respiratory disease, the ability of the CNS to coordinate these multiple tasks may be impaired and dysfunctions in the other systems may develop. There is preliminary epidemiological evidence of an association between back pain, incontinence and respiratory problems. However, interpretation of previous studies is limited due to lack of consideration of possible confounding factors, use of cross-sectional analysis and exclusion of representative populations. The first aim of this thesis was to investigate the relationship between incontinence, respiratory disease and back pain using cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses that considered the effect of confounding factors. Self-report, postal survey data from three age cohorts of women included in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women&#146;s Health were used to analyse the association between these variables. In both cross-sectional and longitudinal multivariate analyses, incontinence, breathing problems and allergy (including the respiratory disorders hay fever and sinusitis) were associated with back pain. Furthermore, longitudinal analysis revealed a strong inter-relationship between these factors, in that the presence of one condition increased the risk for the development of another. The second aim of this thesis was to determine whether postural control of the trunk muscles is altered in women with incontinence, and men and women with respiratory disease. Electromyographic activity (EMG) of the pelvic floor (PF) (women with and without incontinence only), obliquus internus abdominis (OI), obliquus externus abdominis (OE), rectus abdominis (RA) and erector spinae (ES) muscles was recorded with surface electrodes during expected and unexpected addition of load to the trunk (continent and incontinent women only), and rapid shoulder flexion and extension. A force plate and inclinometers were used to measure centre of pressure (COP) displacement and trunk movement during static balance tasks. Studies were performed with an empty and moderately full bladder for continent and incontinent women, and before and after participation in exercise to increase breathlessness for people with and without respiratory disease. Women with incontinence had increased amplitude of OE (women with more severe incontinence) and PF (women with mild incontinence) muscle activity during addition of load to the trunk; earlier activation of the OE muscle, but delayed activation of the PF muscles during rapid arm movement; and increased abdominal, ES and PF muscle activity during quiet stance. When the bladder was moderately full, PF EMG decreased and abdominal EMG increased for both continent and incontinent women. During rapid arm movement, people with severe respiratory disease had increased activity of the OE and RA muscles at rest, and people with less severe disease had increased OE and ES muscle activity following mild exercise. Static balance was decreased (i.e. increased range and root mean square COP displacement) in both women with incontinence and men and women with respiratory disease compared to control subjects. In people with respiratory disease, balance was further decreased following exercise. The studies in this thesis demonstrate that people with incontinence and respiratory disease have increased activity of the superficial trunk muscles. Similar changes in control of the trunk muscles have also been reported in people with LBP. These changes may have negative consequences for spinal health, continence and respiration because of increased spinal compression, increased demand on the PF muscles to maintain continence, and restricted ribcage expansion and diaphragm descent during inspiration. Thus, altered control of the trunk muscles may help to explain the increased risk for the development of co-morbid problems, such as LBP, incontinence and respiratory disorders, in these populations. This thesis highlights the importance of the assessment and management of co-morbidities in people with LBP, incontinence and respiratory disorders. These findings suggest opportunities for future research to assess the effect of modulation and coordination of trunk muscle activity on improvement of symptoms and prevention of co-morbid problems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158619</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Theosophy of Jacob Boehme, German Protestant Mystic, and the Development of His Ideas in the Works of His English Disciples, Dr. John Pordage and Mrs. Jane Leade.</field><field name="creator">Harris, Brian</field><field name="description">This thesis, in the spirit of the History of Ideas, seeks to bring together in one work the basic ideas contained in the theosophy of the German Protestant mystic Jacob Boehme, and to subsequently trace how his ideas were developed and changed in the works of the English disciples, Dr. John Pordage and Mrs. Jane Leade. Recent studies have shown the pervasive influence of Jacob Boehme&#146;s writings in the early modern period, especially in England; Charles I, John Milton, William Law, and later, William Blake, were some of the important figures who came under its spell. Because of the radical nature of Boehme&#146;s message, that God had personally revealed universal secrets to him, Boehme&#146;s life in Germany became marred by persecution from the established religious hegemony. Religious radicals in England were also harried and pursued. During the interregnum, the Presbyterian and Anglican authority tried to uphold their power against a disintegrating political circumstance. They attacked with vigour any religious movement they deemed to be heretical and subversive to their authority. Under such pressure many religious groups sought refuge from the dictates of any religious jurisdiction. During the periods of intense political upheaval they looked for security in their own interpretations of the scriptures, and especially in the quietude of turning away from the world to the impulses given by the inner spirit. Overall, mystically inclined religious dissidents tended to long for some pansophic revelation that would rise above the worldly tumult and provide a resolution to long unanswered questions and aspirations. Boehme, for example, experienced the political and religious upheaval in Germany which led to the 30 Years War. He meditated upon the question of the cause of evil in the world. This endeavour led him to examine fundamental Christian questions, about what is God? What is the nature of God? How does God cause the things that are to come into existence? He sought to know these truths before he could answer the puzzle of why evil obtains. Because he could not find answers to these questions in orthodox canons he trawled far and wide - even to the works of antiquity, to bring in many topics he thought relevant into the pansophic net. Consequently, in his eclectic reach we will find reference to Neoplatonism, Alchemy, the Kabbalah, Astrology, Magia and Angelology, subjects that were always an undercurrent to the mystical in religion, now in Boehme&#146;s theosophy brought to the fore. This thesis will identify and draw out from the mass of Jacob Boehme&#146;s works the core ideas which underpin his theosophy. In bringing these subjects to the foreground the thesis points to the source, or tradition, of the core idea. Once we have established Jacob Boehme&#146;s core ideas and pointed to his sources it is contended that it will be possible then to approach and understand the doctrines of Dr. John Pordage and Mrs. Jane Leade in a clearer light. The thesis is divided into 6 chapters, but following the pattern set by the preceding remarks, the basic framework of the thesis is in three parts. Part one examines some detail of Boehme&#146;s life where it is deemed necessary for a framing exposition. The thesis is not concerned with an encyclopaedic reach of Boehme&#146;s biographical story but gives many details relevant for an understanding of his theosophy. Similarly, the thesis looks at the life and doctrines of former writers on mystical topics who are known to have been influential and it notes what aspect of their work was taken up by Boehme. Thus, armed with enough biographical detail and with an exposition of the major influences upon him, the thesis moves on to examine the core ideas of Jacob Boehme&#146;s theosophy. In part two, once the main planks of Jacob Boehme&#146;s are clearly delineated, the thesis moves on to discuss the reception of Boehme&#146;s theosophy in England, and how it impacted on the life and works of Dr. John Pordage. Pordage would go on to champion aspects of the Boehme canon to his own detriment. For a time he was able to combine his duties as an Anglican Rector with his preference for religious experimentation of a mystical nature. Unable to achieve the spontaneous theophanies encountered by the mentor Boehme, Pordage sought divine revelation in encounters with mediums, in trance-inducing rhythmic singing and dancing, in the rigours of self-deprivation, and in the company of eccentric characters who pretended to divine preference. These pursuits were obviously outside the scope of his Anglican duties and brought ill repute to him when such &#147;experiments&#148; were made known to the ecclesiastic authority. He was brought to book and sacked from the living of the Rectory at Bradfield. After exile from the church, Pordage continued on to live in seclusion, gathering about him a small number of devotees who were drawn to him by his undoubted personal magnetism and by the power of his preaching ability. As he got older he began to shun the world and to spend many days in introspective journeys where his spirit soared from his body in mystical flights of fancy. The thesis details biographical events relevant to an understanding of Pordage&#146;s thought and then moves on to discuss the main ideas presented in Pordage&#146;s work, the Theosophia Mystica, published by Jane Leade and her associates, three years after his death. The discussion seeks to establish the core ideas of Pordage&#146;s theosophy. Another aim of the thesis is to ascertain to what degree Pordage took up Boehme&#146;s ideas, and alternately, to show where he parted from them and why. In the third section of the thesis there is an exposition of Mrs. Jane Leade&#146;s works. After Pordage was rusticated he remained for a time in the vicinity of Bradfield, but thereafter moved to London. It was in London that Jane Leade was drawn to his little band of private worshippers. Mrs. Leade was destitute following the death of her husband. She had decided that her future lay in promoting God&#146;s works. As a chiliast she was especially concerned with the advent of the New Jerusalem. She believed that such an event was imminent and God&#146;s kingdom would be established on Earth. Eventually she was invited to join the Pordage household and she cast her lot with them. Together they worked upon a religious manifesto and eventually decided to publish their exhortations to the world under the banner of what they called the Philadelphian Society. The Philadelphian Society was a loose-knit federation of like minded people in England and on the Continent who were interested in Jacob Boehme&#146;s theosophy and the mystical in religion in general. When Pordage died Mrs. Leade assumed the leadership. She published many tracts of a religious nature during this time. Her purpose was to exhort those of lesser religious experience to strive to become of higher standing in the Lord. She wrote that she had achieved numerous preferments from God. She even contended that she had stood before God&#146;s presence in order that she might understand His purpose. In this way she thought she had become like a General. Her duties sought to martial the righteous armies back to their spiritual home. The thesis will notice her drive towards a thoroughgoing Neoplatonism as she eschewed all worldly gifts, honours and riches - counting them as of nothing compared to the glory of spiritual life. Her other-worldly encounters were often induced by what she called &#147;daily dyings&#148;, which meant, in practice, a regime of austere asceticism; meaning that the body was denied the comforts of repose, sleep and sustenance. She put into practice the extreme negative aspects of a Neoplatonic doctrine that the body and the things of this world were worthless. In similar fashion to the elder Pordage, she was never happier than in the state when she thought her spirit left her body to prepare for her return to the eternal spiritual home. Accordingly, the thesis discusses the major planks of Mrs. Leade&#146;s ideas as she extolled them in her writings. The exposition shows how she followed in the steps of her mentor John Pordage and where she added emphasis here and there with her own stamp. Overall, it is noticed how the framework of her ideas was compiled through her association with John Pordage; and how, through his mentorship, she reached back to the maker, Jacob Boehme.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440209 Philosophy of Religion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158301</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Participative Assessment and Reflection on Learning Among First Year Medical Students</field><field name="creator">Papinczak, Tracey Ann</field><field name="description">Given the nature of medicine as an academic discipline, with its high conceptual difficulty and content-heavy curriculum, it is likely that some students struggle to achieve success. Problem-based learning (PBL) represents a novel educational environment for many first-year students and their skills in learning self-regulation are challenged. This research investigated an intervention program of cognitive and metacognitive exercises and alternative assessment formats among first-year medical students in a PBL curriculum with the purpose of enhancing learning. Trends in approaches to learning and self-efficacy were measured over the duration of the firstyear course. The ability of the intervention to improve three specific learning outcomes was determined, including adoption of deep, strategic learning, selfefficacy, and satisfaction with learning in PBL tutorials. In addition, the ability of students to accurately undertake participative assessment of PBL performance in tutorials was investigated. First year students (N = 213) enrolled in the graduate-entry Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery Program (MBBS) at The University of Queensland were recruited to participate in a study of metacognition and participative assessment during 2004. A pre-test, post-test design was implemented with intervention (N = 125) and control (N = 88) students, with intervention students experiencing a program of cognitive and metacognitive activities within their PBL tutorials of at least 6 months duration. Control students experienced PBL in its unmodified format. All students completed the Medical Students Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) at the commencement, and completion, of the study to gather data on three specific learning outcomes. The intervention program consisted of reflection on learning in PBL coupled with tutor, peer- and self-assessment of PBL performance within the tutorial setting. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Students&#146; self-efficacy was lower at the conclusion of the study (p &lt; 0.001). A significant reduction in the adoption of deep and strategic learning approach, matched by a corresponding increase in the use of surface learning, was demonstrated (p &lt; 0.001). This shift from deep, strategic learning to more surface approaches and decreased self-efficacy did not differ significantly between intervention and control students. Metacognitive and cognitive activities failed to positively impact on the three learning outcomes. There was a statistically significant association between high self-efficacy and deep learning approach (0.003 &#8804; p &#8804; 0.005). Older students (26 &#150; 44 years) were over-represented in the group of efficacious deep learners. The results revealed low correlation between scores derived from tutor and selfassessment (0.31 &#8804; r &#8804; 0.41), with students consistently under-marking their own performance to a substantial degree. Students with greater self-efficacy scored their PBL performance more highly. Peer-assessment was a more accurate measure, with peer-averaged scores correlating moderately with tutor ratings (0.40 &#8804; r &#8804; 0.60). Students consistently over-marked their peers, particularly those with casual or sceptical attitudes to the peer-assessment process. Peer over-marking led to less divergence from the tutor scoring than under-marking of one&#146;s own work. First-year medical students in a PBL curriculum were better able to assess the performance of their peers compared to their own performance. Students appear either unwilling or unable to accurately self-assess their performance in PBL tutorials. Over the course of their first-year studies, students lose self-efficacy and move away from deep, strategic approaches to learning and towards surface, apathetic approaches. The program of metacognitive activities failed to reverse this trend. The substantial swing towards surface learning raises timely questions about the perceived capacity of PBL curricula to promote deep learning in time intensive courses, and reinforces the importance of personal and contextual factors, such as life experience, heavy workload and challenging assessment formats, in determining individual approaches and idiosyncratic responses to learning situations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158413</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GENERATING TEST ORACLES FROM OBJECT-ORIENTED FORMAL SPECIFICATIONS</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Jason</field><field name="description">The purpose of software testing is to determine whether or not the software meets its specification. Conventional software testing techniques rely heavily on the tester to interpret the specification and the test results, and to use them to make a decision about the correctness of the software. The testing process is thus subject to significant potential for human error to hide test failures or to signal false failures. A variety of software development and testing processes have been defined with the aim of reducing the scope for human error, but the potential for faults to go undetected cannot be entirely eliminated when there are manual processes involved. Formal specifications are one technique used to reduce the scope for human error in the software development process. A formal specification provides a precise, unambiguous and usually mathematical description of the required behaviour of a software system. Another way to reduce the likelihood of human error occurring during testing is to automate the checking of test outputs. This is usually done using a device called a &#147;test oracle&#148;. We define two types of test oracle: active oracles and passive oracles. An active oracle provides some kind of alternate implementation of the expected behaviour. This is most often a simplistic implementation, covering only the test cases and/or being too inefficient for use in a delivered system. An active oracle can also be produced by executing (or &#147;animating&#148;) the specification. A passive oracle checks the actual behaviour against some representation of the expected behaviour, such as a list of expected outputs for each test case. A passive oracle can also consult the specification directly. This thesis reports on the systematic derivation of executable test oracles from formal object-oriented specifications. Using a number of specifications of container classes for illustration, we introduce six translation methods from Object-Z specifications to C++ test oracle classes. We then introduce &#147;Warlock&#148;, a prototype tool that automates the generation of one of these oracle types. The generated oracles are usable in most automated test execution frameworks without significant effort on the part of the tester. To demonstrate our approach and to address the question of scalability, we describe a significant case study involving testing of the ANSI C++ Standard Template Library container classes. In this case study, we first use conventional testing techniques to produce a test suite for these classes. We then replace the test oracles for two of those classes with test oracles generated from a formal specification using the techniques presented in this thesis. While the hand-written and generated test oracles detect the same set of errors in the container classes, the generated oracles allow the test driver code to be significantly simplified.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158302</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GEOCHEMICAL AND ISOTOPIC CONSTRAINTS ON HIMU MAGMATISM: EVIDENCE FROM MOUNT CAMEROON AND MOUNT ETINDE (CAMEROON, WEST AFRICA)</field><field name="creator">Wembenyui, Emmanuel</field><field name="description">Mount Cameroon and Mount Etinde volcanoes are located at the passive continental margin of the West African coast. They are interpreted to represent the transition of volcanism from the oceanic to the continental part of the 1600 km volcanic province known as the Cameroon Volcanic Line (CVL). This study is aimed at constraining the source of the HIMU or &#181; (where &#181; = 238U/204Pb) feature in these volcanoes and in evaluating their geochemical and isotopic evolution from prehistoric activities to recent. Mount Cameroon and Mount Etinde volcanoes have been chosen for investigation because unlike the classical HIMU volcanoes, which are located on oceanic crust, these volcanoes cut the Sub-Continental Lithospheric Mantle (SCLM) but still possess the chemical and isotopic signatures that characterize HIMU lavas. It is geodynamically significant that none of the other volcanoes that define the continental part of the (CVL) appears to be HIMU in character. Mount Cameroon and Etinde thus, provide a natural laboratory in which to assess the transition from none-HIMU magmatism on continental crust, to HIMU magmatism on oceanic crust, with the potentials of contributing to the understanding of HIMU magmatism in the entire CVL belt. To arrive at this objective, samples collected from both the modern (1959, 1982, 1999 and 2000) and prehistoric flows of Mount Cameroon, including samples obtained from the flanks of Mount Etinde are being investigated. In this regard, mineral chemistry, major/trace element, including 208Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 206Pb/204Pb, 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd isotopic data for these samples are being reported. Major element chemistry shows that Mount Cameroon lavas are nepheline-normative with MgO contents ranging from 4-9 wt% and SiO2 from 43-48 wt%, which classify as silica undersaturated, mafic alkaline tephri-basanites. Chondrite normalized Rare Earth Element (REE) arrays show extremely tight abundance ranges with no possibility of distinguishing between the different eruptive episodes. They exhibit enrichment in the light REE (LREE). The absence of Eu anomalies indicates the minimal role of plagioclase fractionation in the evolution of the lavas. Compatible trace elements versus MgO relationships show trends which indicate evolution through the fractional crystallization of olivine, clinopyroxene and Cr-spinel. With the exception of a few Mount Cameroon lavas, which show more primitive compositions (for example Ni &gt; 145 ppm, Cr &gt; 400 ppm and Mg# &gt; 57) suggesting possible equilibrium with lower mantle mineralogy, the remaining lavas show significant degrees of fractionation, shown by Mg# ranging between 45 and 51, Ni=29-87ppm and Cr=28-144 ppm, indicative of lower pressure fractional crystallization. Olivine compositions in Mount Cameroon lavas vary from Fo59-87 with predominant composition between Fo78-87. For Mount Etinde volcano, the majority of samples have Ni = 4-95 ppm and Cr = 0.4-257 ppm and only few samples show trends of typical primitive mantle liquids; Ni = 120-140 ppm and Cr = 258-381 ppm. Olivine compositions range from Fo65-87. However, a presumed parental sample in Etinde has Fo66-87. Canonical trace element ratios ratios for both volcanoes e.g. Nb/U (46-48), Nb/Th (12-14) and chondritic Nb/Ta values (16.9-17.6), rule out the possibility of significant melt/crust interactions. Although the &#145;modern&#146; and prehistoric flows of Mount Cameroon are geochemically variable, they are isotopically homogeneous, indicative of a common mantle source, which has remained unchanged for &gt; 10 Ma. Geochemical differences in these lavas must therefore represent the effects of variable degrees of partial melting and crystal fractionation. By contrast, isotopic variations and trace element systematics suggest a relatively heterogeneous mantle source and or high degree of fractionation for Etinde lavas leading to the occurrence of basalts and differentiated nephelintes. Pb-Sr-Nd isotope compositions show the following ranges for Mount Cameroon lavas: 206Pb/204Pb=20.19-20.46, 207Pb/204Pb=15.63-15.69, 208Pb/204Pb=40.02-40.30, 87Sr/86Sr=0.70322-0.70335 (-21.37 to -19.47) and 143Nd/144Nd=0.51276-0.51284 (PNd = +2 to +4). Mount Etinde lavas are characterised by 206Pb/204Pb=20.16-20.55, 207Pb/204Pb=15.64-15.68, 208Pb/204Pb=40.04-40.32, 87Sr/86Sr=0.70324-0.70348 (PSr = - 21.04 to -17.63) and 143Nd/144Nd=0.51273-0.5129 (PNd = +1.77 to +5.19). The results show that Etinde lavas not only cover the entire range of Mount Cameroon isotopic compositions but extends towards more radiogenic Pb and Nd compositions (PNd = +1.77 to +5.19). The wide range in PNd in Etinde melts reflects the influence of a heterogeneous source with variation in Sm/Nd or that the lavas entrained DMM (asthenospheric) signature during ascent. The restricted range of PNd in Mt Cameroon lavas suggests that the mantle source is OIB-like, possibly the lower mantle and that these lavas ascended without significant entrainment of DMM material. The overall isotopic compositions indicate that lavas from both volcanoes are derived from the mantle reservoir known as HIMU, suggestive of high time-integrated Pb enrichment resulting from U+Th/Pb fractionation. The HIMU signature for both Mount Cameroon and Etinde has previously been attributed to the influence of the St. Helena plume. The results of this study however suggest that although St. Helena is also HIMU in character, it is geochemically distinct from the Cameroon Line volcanoes. A new model is therefore proposed suggesting that the HIMU feature in both Mounts Cameroon and Etinde lavas is supplied by lower mantle upwellings that have been seismically imaged beneath the Atlantic, extending through the Mount Cameroon region to the East African Rift System.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158620</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ECONOMICAL COLD-FORMED THIN-WALL STEEL CROSS-SECTIONS</field><field name="creator">Li, Xilai</field><field name="description">In Australia, the use of cold-formed thin-wall steel sections as house framing members has gained an increasing acceptance in residential construction market. Cold-formed thin-wall steel members have been widely used in commercial and industrial applications. In this study, currently used cold-formed thin-wall cross-sections are analysed and the results obtained used to develop more economical and stronger sections. In order to achieve a rational analysis model for roof truss system, semi-rigid and full-hinge models of typical residential roof truss are compared. Analysis results have revealed that the bending moment of chord members in the truss system is as important as the axial force. This shows that a semi-rigid model must be used in analysing the roof truss system. Furthermore, the critical load cases for the roof truss of different roof pitches are obtained after a comprehensive analysis. The internal member forces and moments under the critical load cases are then used in later buckling analysis and cross-sectional optimization. Finite strip method software CUFSM is employed to perform the elastic buckling analysis of current chord, web and wall stud sections. Based on the sophisticated Direct Strength Method, the axial capacity and moment capacity of these sections calculated. The results suggest that currently used cross-sections are either not strong enough to resist load actions, or are overdesigned. Using the knowledge obtained from the analyses, two optimized cold-formed thin-wall steel cross-sections, one is symmetric and another is asymmetric that can be doubled, are developed. The buckling capacities of these two cross-sections satisfy the design loads derived from the truss analysis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158303</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RED CELL POLYMORPHISMS AND PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM</field><field name="creator">Chung, Wendy Young</field><field name="description">Malaria is an acute febrile illness caused by infection with parasitic protozoa of the genus Plasmodium, and is transmitted by the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. Severity and occurrence of malaria infection is dependent on the host and also many geographic and social factors. Currently, more than one third of the world&#146;s population live in malaria endemic areas and approximately one billion people are estimated to carry the parasite at any one time. In Africa alone there are an estimated 200-450 million cases of fever in children infected with malaria parasites resulting in at least one million deaths each year. While erythrocytes have traditionally been regarded as relatively inert cellular containers of haemoglobin, in reality evidence suggests they in fact bear numerous surface molecules that are active in a variety of physiological processes. The varied roles of erythrocyte antigens include membrane structural integrity, transport of molecules through the membrane and as receptors for extracellular ligands. A number of molecules postulated to play a role in the malaria invasion process have already been identified on the erythrocyte surface such as the glycophorins. Certain red cell polymorphisms exhibit a protective effect against malaria infection and this has been suggested because of epidemiological evidence linking the distribution of these polymorphisms to areas currently or historically endemic for malaria. For example, individuals with the Duffy blood group negative phenotype are completely resistant to P. vivax infection and those who are Gerbich negative exhibit resistance to P. falciparum infection. The scope of this thesis was to investigate the role of red cell polymorphisms and malaria invasion into specific erythrocytes. Analysis of parasite invasion has revealed a complex yet highly ordered process involving proteins on the erythrocyte surface as receptors for parasite ligands. To date, several erythrocyte surface receptors have been identified such as the glycophorins however, the specific molecular interactions between merozoite surface ligands and erythrocyte receptors still remain elusive and not well understood. The aim of this thesis was to examine the involvement of the ABO blood group antigens and the Rhesus blood group antigens in P. falciparum invasion in vitro. The relationship between ABO blood groups and malaria has been extensively investigated with often contradictory results. Examination of gene frequencies of the ABO blood group systems in man indicates that they fluctuate markedly from place to place. There are likely to be subtle changes in gene frequencies that may reflect either a slight selective disadvantage or advantage to the host. One such change is the reductions of individuals with blood group A seen in African populations. These changes in gene frequency may indicate that the oligosaccharides of the immunodominant ABO blood group play a role in parasite invasion. This is consistent with previous studies which have shown that patients with blood group A exhibit a significantly greater risk of severe malaria. We present evidence that P. falciparum parasites exhibit enhanced invasion into A1 erythrocytes when compared with invasion into A2, B and O erythrocytes. Previous studies have suggested that P. falciparum merozoites have lectin like proteins on their surface that bind to erythrocyte carbohydrate receptors. Such observations suggest the presence of a parasite lectin on the merozoite. Our observation that parasites exhibit enhanced invasion into A1 erythrocytes also suggests that the sugar residues of the immunodominant ABO blood group may have a role. This thesis aims to investigate a potential lectin binding protein which may be involved in the invasion process. This thesis also examines the role that null cells can play in the identification of previously undescribed receptors used by the malaria parasite. We investigate the role of the Rhesus blood group antigen by use of Rhesus null erythrocytes. Null erythrocytes provide a valuable tool for receptor identification. The findings presented in this chapter suggest that there is an alternative pathway that some P. falciparum parasites can utilise to invade the host erythrocyte. It appears that the use of the novel invasion receptor is selective, and it is utilised only when their primary receptors are absent or enzymatically removed on the Rhesus null erythrocyte. There are undoubtedly further complications in this story which are still to be elucidated, and it is likely that field isolates may manifest even greater variability than that found in the comparatively small number of laboratory isolates in which these pathways have been identified. Further investigation into the role of erythrocyte polymorphisms as receptors is warranted to elucidate the full repertoire of receptors that exist for parasite invasion. It is envisaged that by investigating erythrocyte proteins that this will provide invaluable information in regards to the invasion mechanism of P. falciparum parasites. Such insights are likely to open and close many avenues of research and assist in the development of a sound and rational basis for the identification of vaccines and drug targets.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158414</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behaviour-Based Methodology for Fault Tree Generation</field><field name="creator">Rae, Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a new theory of fault trees for complex systems, and a method for their generation. The theory treats faults as behaviours, and fault-tree gates as operations on those behaviours. Fault tree analysis is an important and widely used technique for understanding the behaviour of safety-critical systems. The development of new technologies with more sophisticated interactions between components, and hence more complicated causal relationships between failure modes, has made traditional methods of fault tree synthesis difficult if not obsolete. Consequently, this thesis addresses a matter of ongoing concern in the safety analysis community. The thesis argues that it is feasible and effective to automate the generation of fault trees by describing systems using hierarchically structured models, with component interactions described in terms of behaviours. A detailed methodology for generating fault trees is presented. The methodology includes consideration of design faults, hardware failures, and operator errors. A prototype tool called Eucalypt is used to demonstrate the methodology on four realistic case studies. Eucalypt provides semi-automated support for system modelling and fault generation, and fully automatic fault tree synthesis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158621</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERISATION OF BCOR-L1, A NOVEL COREPRESSOR PROTEIN</field><field name="creator">Pagan, Julia Kate</field><field name="description">The DNA-damage response signalling pathways mediate checkpoint arrest to allow repair to occur or cell death when damage is severe. BRCA1 coordinates key aspects of DNA-damage response via its interaction with numerous proteins involved in transcription regulation and DNA double-strand break response and repair. We have identified a novel BRCA1-interacting protein which we have named BCoR-L1. We have found that BCoR-L1 is a corepressor protein that functions through CtBP and possibly class II HDACs, to mediate chromatin repression. BCoR-L1 functions together with BRCA1 in the canonical BRCA1 DNA-damage response pathway. Like BRCA1, BCoR-L1 is phosphorylated in response to DNA damaging agents, including ionising radiation and UV radiation. The kinase responsible for this phosphorylation is ATM, the upstream kinase activated in response to DNA double-strand breaks. Cells depleted of BCoR-L1 by siRNA show signs of spontaneous DNA damage and activation of DNA-damage response signalling, in the absence of any external DNA damage. Furthermore, depletion of BCoR-L1 by siRNA sensitises cells to ionising radiation, indicating that BCoR-L1 is required for cellular survival following DNA damage. The localisation of BCoR-L1 is dynamic through the cell cycle. BCoR-L1 localises to late S-phase replication foci and is found on the condensing chromosomes during mitosis. Possibly its localisation on the condensing chromatin is required for the phosphorylation of the mitosis-specific chromatin-mark, phosphohistone-H3 Ser-10. Phosphorylation of Ser-10 is correlated with chromosome condensation. Our hypothesis is that BCoR-L1 is involved in transcription repression/chromatin silencing during the cell cycle and following DNA damage. Therefore, BCoR-L1 is involved in processes that maintain the correct number and the proper structure of chromosomes throughout the cell cycle and after exposure of cells to DNA damaging agents and is therefore a key regulator of genetic stability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158304</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cultural landscapes : a history and analysis of the drivers of landscape change in the southern brigalow belt, Queensland, 1840-2004</field><field name="creator">Seabrook, Leonie Marguerite</field><field name="description">Human-induced modifications to the Earth&#146;s surface are important in driving landscape change over wide areas, with agriculture affecting the greatest area. Landscape change is of concern due to the cumulative impact it has on local, regional and global ecosystem functions and components. Research often focuses on tropical forests but, since 1950, vegetation clearing in the Southern Brigalow Belt bioregion of Queensland has occurred at rates comparable with the Amazon Basin, threatening landscape health and biodiversity. Halting or reversing this threat almost certainly requires landscape revegetation but as a pre-requisite we need to understand the historical causes, constraints and patterns of change across a range of spatial and temporal scales. This project aimed, therefore, to develop a historical perspective of landscape change in the Southern Brigalow Belt since 1840, focusing on the clearance of native vegetation for agriculture, and the cultural and environmental factors driving this change over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Knowledge gained from this project will inform vegetation management and landscape restoration in the Southern Brigalow Belt and may apply to other regions of Queensland and other parts of the world where conversion of land from native forest to agriculture continues. Quantitative and qualitative data were integrated with temporal and spatial models at regional (1,000,000s ha), sub-regional (100,000s ha) and property (100s ha) levels, across a timeframe of decades to centuries. At the regional level, I developed a conceptual framework linking biophysical characteristics and the social, economic, technological, cultural and policy drivers of regional landscape change in four phases of settlement since 1840. Local and regional histories, state legislation, government reports and parliamentary records, and statistics relating to agricultural production and population were integrated with pre-clearing and remnant regional ecosystem mapping to identify the drivers and trends of vegetation loss in each settlement phase. At the sub-regional level, a similar methodology was combined with mapping of vegetation loss since 1945 using aerial photography to quantify in more detail the temporal aspects of vegetation change in two Southern Brigalow Belt shires, Tara and Taroom. In addition, the effect of regional drivers of deforestation were tested against present day patterns of vegetation at a property level using regression trees and generalised linear models. I used a predictive modelling approach, combining partial least squares regression and generalised linear models, to analyse data from structured questionnaires and explain the relationship between the economic, demographic and cultural characteristics of landholders and retention of woody vegetation at a property level. Finally, I used semistructured interviews to gain an understanding of vegetation management issues faced by landholders in the Southern Brigalow Belt in the light of Queensland&#146;s recently introduced vegetation management regulations. I found that the drivers of landscape change operated in synergy with each other, and although one could assume more importance at a particular time, they were, in general, interrelated both within and across the scales of human operation, from local to global. In the Southern Brigalow Belt, environmental constraints significantly slowed agricultural development until technology, policy and economic drivers combined in the mid-20th century, leading to extremely rapid landscape change. Temporal trends of deforestation followed a sigmoidal curve, with initial slow change accelerating though the middle phase then slowing in recent times, with intensification rather than new development. Although regional drivers, including land tenure, roads and agricultural intensification were important instigators of deforestation, soil infertility had the most significant influence on the proportion of native vegetation retained at a property scale, followed by property size. Landholders generally retained more native vegetation if they valued it for aesthetic reasons or if it provided production benefits, with higher education and training having some additional influence. Landholders highlighted a range of issues facing them as a result of Queensland&#146;s new vegetation management policies. These included: loss of income from future development; lower land values for land covered by native bushland; and the need for compensation or cost-sharing when landholders are providing a public benefit through vegetation management, by halting the loss of biodiversity and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I identified future policy directions to address these issues and encourage vegetation recovery in the region towards recommended minimum ecological thresholds of 30% vegetation cover. Research results identified the processes which drove deforestation and agricultural development in the Southern Brigalow Belt, and how these varied over time. They indicated that a historical understanding of the drivers of change is critical in explaining current landscape patterns. Drivers of landscape change were strongly tied to the creation of cultural landscapes that stemmed from European origins, and land management has still not been fully adapted to Australian conditions. These results have implications for future vegetation management in the region, indicating that a holistic approach is required that is tailored to the specific regional situation of the Brigalow Belt. A better understanding of cultural influences affecting landholders&#146; decisions about woody vegetation retention is fundamental to targeting landscape restoration. To encourage revegetation in agricultural landscapes, vegetation management policy should reward those landholders who have retained significant native vegetation and encourage revegetation through flexible incentives and policy instruments. I suggest that future research be targeted particularly at landscape restoration, identifying appropriate socio-economic and policy incentives that might be applied to encourage revegetation in the region. Application of the conceptual framework of economic, demographic and cultural values to a wider cross section of landholders in the Southern Brigalow Belt would confirm whether factors influencing vegetation retention in this research are robust enough to be applied elsewhere in Australia and in other parts of the world. If so, these factors may assist in developing more ecologically sustainable landscapes in areas where change has adversely affected landscape health.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158415</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of p75 neurotrophin receptor-mediated neuronal death through post-translational modifications</field><field name="creator">Underwood, Clare</field><field name="description">The neurotrophin family of growth factors has a well characterised role in neural survival and death during development and adulthood. While specific neurotrophins bind to members of the Trk receptor family differentially, they all bind the p75 neurotrophin receptor (NTR). Neuronal death signalling through p75NTR occurs during developmental programmed cell death, and has been implicated in mediating neuronal death in several neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer&#146;s and motor neuron diseases, and following traumatic injury such as ischaemia. However, p75NTR can also assist in Trk signalling to mediate neuronal survival. The aim of this thesis was to determine a mechanism that resolves the paradox that p75NTR can activate both cell death and, in conjunction with Trk, cell survival signalling pathways. In addition to the interaction of p75NTR with coreceptors, post-translational processing may also determine the signalling outcome. p75NTR undergoes regulated intramembrane proteolysis, in which p75NTR is cleaved extracellularly by a metalloprotease, producing a membrane-associated C-terminal fragment, and subsequently by &#947;-secretase, producing a membrane-free intracellular fragment. In addition, the &#147;Chopper&#148; domain, previously shown to be responsible for cell death when attached to the membrane, is palmitoylated, a characteristic that promotes protein receptors to be incorporated into cholesterol-and sphingolipid-rich microdomains within the cell membrane. Thus the hypothesis was that both regulated intramembrane proteolysis and receptor palmitoylation would play a role in the initiation and regulation of p75NTR-mediated neuronal death. The experimental results presented within this thesis demonstrate that regulated intramembrane proteolysis can be ligand activated, and that extracellular cleavage is required for intracellular cleavage to occur. In addition, the results presented provide evidence that &#947;-secretase intracellular cleavage of p75NTR is promoted when both the C-terminal fragment of p75NTR and active &#947;-secretase translocate to lipidrich microdomains of the plasma membrane. This translocation and cleavage event are dependent on palmitoylation of p75NTR within the juxtamembrane intracellular domain and dissociation of the C-terminal fragment from activated TrkA. Furthermore, findings presented within this thesis also demonstrate that the inhibition of &#947;-secretase activity, which leads to the accumulation of the p75NTR Cterminal fragment in lipid-rich microdomains, promotes neuronal death in motor neurons in vitro. In contrast, blocking extracellular cleavage of p75NTR or disrupting membrane cholesterol inhibits the nerve growth factor induced p75NTR-mediated death of cultured motor neurons. Together, the results presented suggest that alterations in the balance of normal regulated intramembrane proteolysis and/or altered membrane lipid integrity due to disrupted cholesterol metabolism, as occurs in neurodegenerative conditions, are key factors in promoting the p75NTR-mediated death signal. These results further enhance our understanding of how neuronal degeneration is mediated. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which neuronal death is regulated through p75NTR may enable the development of new clinical treatments that improve the prognosis of a range of neurodegenerative conditions. The findings presented point to several possible targets for treatment, including the development of compounds that either specifically regulate the cleavage of p75NTR or maintain a normal balance of cellular membrane cholesterol.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158622</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antifungal pharmacodynamic relationships in experimental invasive candidiasis and invasive aspergillosis: implications for antifungal therapy</field><field name="creator">Hope, William Winima Denbeigh</field><field name="description">Invasive candidiasis and invasive aspergillosis are both leading causes of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Pharmacodynamics is the study of concentration-effect relationships. In recent years, there have been significant advances in the pharmacodynamics of antibacterial and antiviral agents. In contrast, less is known about the pharmacodynamics of antifungal agents. This thesis examines the pharmacodynamic relationships of antifungal agents for invasive candidiasis and invasive aspergillosis as a means for studying a range of clinically relevant questions which are difficult to resolve using other experimental platforms. The common themes are as follows: (1) the development of novel experimental pharmacodynamic models are required for an understanding of concentration-effect relationships; (2) innate immunological effectors, in combination with antifungal agents play a crucial role in determining the outcome of invasive fungal infections; (3) a delay in the administration of antifungal agents is potentially detrimental to the host; (4) critical events in the invasion of Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. occur within the initial 24 hour period post infection; (5) mathematical models can be used to further understand and predict system behavior; and (6) population pharmacokinetics and Monte Carlo simulation provide a mechanism to further explore the clinical implications of experimental data. An introduction to the microbiology and pathogenesis of invasive fungal infections, along with the pharmacology of antifungal agents and modeling techniques used are reviewed in Chapter 1. The pharmacodynamic models of invasive candidiasis, developed in Chapter 2, which were then used to study: (1) the antifungal effect of neutrophils, and (2) the effect of a delay in the administration of antifungal agents on the exposure-response relationships. The findings were placed in a pathological context, by defining the histological appearances in the kidney. These studies demonstrated that neutrophils exerted a significant antifungal effect independent of antifungal agents. The antifungal effect of neutrophils was quantified using a mathematical model. A progressive delay in the administration of antifungal agents resulted in a diminishing antifungal effect. The data underscores the importance of adequate numbers of neutrophils and the administration of antifungal agents at the earliest possible point in time to maximize the probability of a favorable therapeutic outcome. Chapter 3 investigates the utility of combining the antifungal agents amphotericin B and 5- fluorocytosine (5FC) for the treatment of invasive candidiasis. Using a surface response methodology, the combination was shown to be additive. The clinical implications of this finding were explored using population pharmacokinetics and Monte Carlo simulation; this approach showed that the currently recommended dosage of 5FC is significantly in excess of that required to produce near maximal effect, and therefore unnecessarily exposes recipients to the risk of drug related toxicity. In Chapter 4, a unique molecular mechanism of resistance of C. albicans to 5FC was defined. In Chapter 5, a definition of a drug-exposure breakpoint for 5FC was sought (i.e. a value which separates individuals into groups with a satisfactory versus a suboptimal outcome), and the clinical implications of this finding were explored. Isolates in which the molecular mechanism of 5FC resistance had been defined in Chapter 4, were used. These experimental data were then bridged to humans to predict a susceptibility breakpoint of 5FC. Chapter 6 represents a synthesis of all of the skills acquired in previous chapters, to develop a novel in vitro model of the human alveolus. This model was used to study the pathogenesis of early invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and the pharmacodynamic relationships of amphotericin B against A. fumigatus. A long standing problem related to the measurement of the residual Aspergillus burden following antifungal therapy was resolved with the use of the Aspergillus cell-wall antigen, galactomannan. The invasion of Aspergillus was studied using confocal microscopy and an A. fumigatus transformant expressing green fluorescent protein. The growth of Aspergillus could not be suppressed with antifungal drugs alone; rather, a combination of amphotericin B and macrophages was required to suppress growth. A large mathematical model was developed to define the concentration of amphotericin B and number of macrophages required to suppress fungal growth. The clinical implications of the experimental data were explored using population pharmacokinetics and Monte Carlo simulation. In the concluding chapter, the advantages of a pharmacodynamic approach and the future challenges are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158305</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">OPENED IN BRAZIL</field><field name="creator">Beesley, Luke Alexander</field><field name="description">Opened in Brazil is a collection that includes 30 lyric and prose poems, and six short short fiction pieces. This writing intermingles in the manuscript, which is carefully divided by two pauses. The title is taken from a line in the Brazil poem &#147;The Cliffs&#148;, and, along with providing an image of movement, was chosen to hint at what might be generalised as a type of imaginative South American fiction. The writing in Brazil is particularly visual, and attends closely to the quickly changing weather of the Blue Mountains where most of the writing was drafted. Brazil also attends to the movement of sunlight on a surface as a way of uncovering an aesthetic truth, and as a way of sensually illuminating the complexity, colour and delicacy of intimacy (particularly an intimacy with books and reading). Beneath the surface of love, silliness, cinema and colour, Brazil also focuses on visual and text aesthetics, and the art of making. I elaborate on these subtle, ambiguous and idiosyncratic aesthetics in a reflective critical essay called &#147;Mark Rothko, Marquez, Motion and the Mooncalf: Metaphors for an Idiosyncrasy of Aesthetic Influence on the Manuscript Opened in Brazil&#148;. The writing of David Brooks (in particular), including his fragmented story &#147;The Mooncalf&#148;, and the cover of his book Black Sea, surprisingly offer metaphors for the nuances involved in Brazil&#146;s genesis. There seems a sunlight quality to my writing, which is an opposite of what might be described as a light-absence quality in Brooks&#146;. I expand on this using a shared interest in the paintings of Mark Rothko. Brooks and Rothko are two examples of a number of idiosyncratic influences which range from a writer&#146;s voice, a range of images, the shape of text itself and a complex intermingling of image, voice and text.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158416</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TAROT: AN EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY</field><field name="creator">Farley, Helen Sara</field><field name="description">This thesis will constitute a cultural history of tarot, tracing the changing patterns of use and the symbolism displayed on tarot cards from the deck&#146;s first appearance in Early Modern Italy until the present day. It begins with a description of the structure and the origins of tarot and the ordinary playing card deck from which it evolved. Some popular theories of tarot&#146;s origin are briefly examined, including the hypothesis that grants tarot an Egyptian provenance. An investigation of the documentary sources detailing tarot&#146;s first appearances follows, pinpointing its beginnings to Milan in the first quarter of the fifteenth century. An accurate time and place of origin, and a knowledge of the prevailing attitudes and beliefs current in Early Modern Italy, help to determine the significance of the symbolism at that time. The imagery of the three Visconti-Sforza decks which constitute the oldest extant tarot cards is examined. The trump sequence and the symbolism displayed on the trump cards come under particular scrutiny. The symbolism displayed elsewhere in Italian Renaissance art is considered in order to determine the significance if any, of that symbolism. Many scholars have ascribed an esoteric significance to tarot imagery but such conclusions are unjustified and in fact, the symbolism on the cards was common in Renaissance art and can be readily explained without referencing esoteric currents operating in Early Modern Europe. I will show that during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, people were primarily concerned with natural divination as a means of knowing the mind of God; hence the popularity of astrology, chiromancy and oneiromancy. Tarot was not considered a suitable tool for divination. It was not until the end of the eighteenth century in France that tarot was used as an esoteric and fortune-telling device. The factors surrounding the change of function of the deck and how this change influenced tarot symbolism will be outlined. Antoine Court de G&#233;belin, Etteilla, &#201;liphas L&#233;vi and Papus were significant authors in the development of occult tarot. Their theories of tarot origin and interpretation of its symbolism will be considered. Significant influences included the French fascination with all things Egyptian and the rejection of traditional Christianity. &#201;liphas L&#233;vi was the first to ascribe correspondences to tarot, linking the deck with other occult systems particularly those of astrology and kabbalah. Tarot was no longer known as a game and the modifications of the deck by esotericists made it unsuitable for such a purpose. The next significant development of esoteric tarot occurred in England under the influence of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn which counted among its members William Butler Yeats, Aleister Crowley and Arthur Edward Waite. Waite&#146;s deck became the most popular deck ever in the history of tarot. Noteworthy contributions added by the English authors included revised lists of correspondences which remain in use today and the association of the deck with the Grail legends erroneously ascribed a Celtic provenance. Under the influence of the Golden Dawn, the positions of trump VIII and trump XI were exchanged in order to better facilitate the trump correspondences with the kabbalah. Also, Waite was responsible for illustrating the minor arcana cards in order to facilitate divination; the first time this had ever been attempted. The final part of this thesis will look at the uses and depictions of tarot in the New Age. The New Age is syncretistic and eclectic; its thought derived from several different streams of religion and culture. Again, tarot reflects this syncretism in its symbolism with decks utilising imagery of a diverse range of cultures and esoteric streams. In the true nature of the New Age, tarot also combines several different ideas so that astrological tarot packs or feng shui tarot packs are common. Tarot divination has shifted in nature from simple fortune-telling and use in ritual magic to divination facilitating self-development through healing and transformation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158417</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RULES AND DISCRETION IN FAMILY LAW A Study of the Exercise of Judicial Discretion in the Family Court of Australia</field><field name="creator">McManus, Peter</field><field name="description">It is sometimes said of family law that it has either no rules or too few to be useful. This gives it a sense that it is not &#145;really law&#146; at all. The thesis argues that, contrary to the belief that the exercise of jurisdiction under the Family law Act 1975 is largely discretionary, it is actually characterised by the development of guidelines that perform a function similar to precedent in other civil courts. The thesis examines, from the perspective of American Legal Realism, the growth of guidelines in family law. It concentrates on their development and their effects on children, the division of property and the procedural law. It assesses the growth of guidelines and the rule-making that has taken place in family law, both in statutory changes and judicially. The thesis examines the judicial techniques that have been used to formulate guidelines and the way in which they are supervised by the Full Court of the family Court. The thesis considers whether judicial decision-making within a legislative structure with few rules is a satisfactory method of developing a consistent and disciplined family law. My conclusion is that this is not appropriate and that it leads to a family law that appears, arbitrary, uncertain and lacking in clarity. I then argue that legislative provisions that allow parties to a dispute to negotiate according to rules best meet these problems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158306</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Looking for Hidden Order: A Multi-level Analysis of Antipsychotic Prescribing to Adults with Intellectual Disability</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Nicole S.</field><field name="description">Background: Adults with intellectual disability are one of the most medicated groups in society (Aman, 1984), and it is the antipsychotic drugs that are commonly prescribed (Ahmed et al, 2000; Wressell &amp; Rinck, 1998). This group often behaved &#145;differently,&#146; therefore they have been feared, considered ineducable and not amenable to therapeutic treatments (McCormack, 1991). They were often thus sedated with antipsychotic and other medications, and hidden from society behind asylum walls (Barr. 1973). The research explores multi-level perspectives of antipsychotic medication use by adults with intellectual disability living in community-based accommodation in Queensland. Using an ecological perspective, the research examines prescribing of antipsychotics and its use through multiple lenses of key individuals, actors and agencies involved. An ecological perspective emphasises both individual and contextual systems and the interdependent relations between the two (McLaren &amp; Hawe, 2005). Drawing on the literature and an in-depth case study, an explanatory model for antipsychotic medication is developed. Using this ecological model as a conceptual guide, the thesis triangulates data sourced from multiple perspectives of the prescribing process, in order to gain some insight into causal influences on antipsychotic prescribing to adults with intellectual disability. Methods: The research incorporates quantitative and qualitative methods, drawing upon five studies conceptualised as a programme of inquiry. Study A is an individual case study, providing in-depth insight into antipsychotic prescribing to an adult with intellectual disability. Use of antipsychotic medications by 68 adults with intellectual disability is analysed in Study. Study C considers Queensland psychiatrists&#146; views about use of antipsychotic medication, and their mental health care of adults with intellectual disability. Study D addresses the broader context of antipsychotic use by adults with intellectual disability through analysis of data from community service providers providing support and assistance to the population of interest. Study E captures perceptions of key stakeholders through in-depth interviews, and focus groups. Results: The ecological model of prescribing has potential to assist with the organisation of thinking about the phenomenon, development of research agendas, and may contribute to the design and implementation of service evaluation. There is quantification of evidence that challenging behaviour has a very strong influence upon the process of prescribing antipsychotic medication to people with intellectual disability, living in community settings. Communication, competence, chemical restraint and complexity clearly dominated the concrete needs of all stakeholders: the person with intellectual disability, their carers and family, clinicians and professionals (including psychiatrists), community service providers (including disability and mental health services), and others (e.g. managers and administrators). Limitations No &#145;perfect scientific tool&#146; exists with capacity to describe, or capture the total reality of any phenomenon. This certainly holds very true for the topic addressed here, more so than for straight-forward biological or physical systems. The research efforts contribute to a particular understanding, in a specific point of time, under certain circumstances, but it can not profess to provide &#145;full&#146; or &#145;objective&#146; understanding of antipsychotic prescribing to adults with intellectual disability. The five studies illustrate a variety of approaches to capturing snapshots of the relevance of different layers of the phenomenon. Individually, none are terribly sophisticated, but utilised and constructed under the &#145;auspices&#146; of the model, their value in building up a layered appreciation of major dimensions of the phenomenon, is apparent. Each study itself has raised many ideas as to additional data elements to expand, and the need to deepen knowledge at the individual levels. The model itself, which demonstrates considerable utility for aiding conceptualisation and evaluation of the problem at hand, lacks specificity in many regards. Refinements may be expected on it, as it is further tested. Conclusion: Seventeen multi-level recommendations are provided, aiming to improve antipsychotic prescribing to adults with intellectual disability, specifically to enhance their quality of life in community settings. Implementation priorities are framed within the ecological model of prescribing, and are linked to the four key themes that emerged from the research: communication, complexity, chemical restraint, and limited skills and expertise. The selection reflects strategies that are immediately viable given the Queensland and Australian context, providing funding and commitment are obtained. For the many individuals and agencies involved in the daily lives of people with intellectual disability, whether untrained paid carers, clinicians making diagnostic decisions or those developing policy at international level, there is a clear message arising from the research: eyes need to be kept wide open to the apparently mundane characteristics and every-day details of people with intellectual disability. In combination, proximal and distal factors combine to exert powerful influences upon antipsychotic prescribing to people with intellectual disability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158623</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design guidelines for indoor comfort in row houses in hot-humid climates.</field><field name="creator">Takkanon, Pattaranan</field><field name="description">Many countries in hot-humid regions cope with rapid urbanisation. Land cost becomes higher especially in high-density areas. There is a demand of residential and commercial buildings due to the economic growth in the cities. Row house became a popular building type since it combines both functions in one place. A large amount of row houses are found in Bangkok, Thailand. Despite their versatility, they are not properly designed for the climate and urban conditions. The occupants adopt air conditioning systems to control indoor comfort whereas row houses are not properly designed for the installation of the airconditioners. This increases the energy demand. This research aims to establish appropriate design guidelines and recommendations to ensure indoor comfort in urban row houses in hot-humid climates. Thermal comfort is the main concern apart from others such as visual, acoustic and indoor air quality. Thermal stress should be minimised by primarily passive means as long as possible and the building design should also provide the flexibility for operating active systems whenever they are required. To achieve this aim, it is important to assess indoor conditions in existing row houses to provide a basis of comparison. A case study in Bangkok has been selected for a field investigation during the hottest month of the year to examine how the case study responds to the critical condition. Flow visualisation tests have been conducted to compare the results of indoor air velocity to those of the field investigation. Computer simulations have been carried out to investigate and compare the performance of design variables affecting indoor comfort such as orientation, zone location, roof and wall materials, aperture schedules, and shading devices. Two blocks of 4-level row houses have been simulated and three units: an intermediate and two units at the both ends of the row have been examined. There are two sets of the simulations: naturally ventilated and air-conditioned cases. Then, the design guidelines and recommendations are developed based on the results from the two series of simulations. Results from the 3-day field investigation show that indoor conditions of the case study are overheated. The indoor temperatures are slightly lower than To during the day while they are higher than To during the night. These results correspond to those of simulation runs for a verification study. The wind tunnel test shows low indoor air velocities. It is recommended to install ceiling fans to increase the wind speed enough to generate cooling effect. The level of interior illuminance drops with distance from the window. It should be improved by installing artificial light sources in the area far from the opening. The sound levels exceed the noise control limit at all times. Results from the simulations for the naturally ventilated and air-conditioned row houses show some similarities. In the former, internal conditions of the occupied units are above the comfort limit almost all day. Orientation is a crucial factor affecting the indoor thermal condition. The front of a row house should face either north or south and the end unit with east-facing side wall performs better than that with west-facing side wall. The worst orientation is generally west but the east could be worse for the end unit with south-facing side wall at such an orientation. The effect of zone location is also related to the orientation. The intermediate unit is more sensitive to design variables since it generally shows the biggest T difference between the variants with the best and the worst design factors. Aperture schedule has a great effect on indoor conditions for naturally ventilated cases. Closing windows during the day could keep the zone cooler than opening the windows which would admit the hot air from the outside. Concrete flat roof with ceiling insulation gives the best results while metal sheet roof gives the worst. Concrete block with acoustic board performs best for both naturally ventilated and air-conditioned buildings while the worst wall type is aerated concrete in cases of the naturally ventilated buildings and common brick wall in cases of the air-conditioned ones. However, the results from the effect of roof and wall material study show that adding insulation could improve the indoor condition more effectively than changing the roof and wall materials. An additional height from the mezzanine floor only affects the thermal performance of the room on ground floor. In comparison to the row house without mezzanine floor, the presence of mezzanine slightly increases indoor temperature in naturally ventilated cases while increases cooling load of the room on the ground floor drastically in air-conditioned cases. Shading devices should be designed particularly for each orientation since their effects are tremendous once applied to the opening to protect it from solar radiation. The limited distance between the front of row houses and the street as allowed in the existing building regulations should be extended for the devices to provide enough shading for the building.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310201 Building Science and Techniques</field><field name="subject">680200 Design</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158307</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PREFERENCE AND UTILITY IN ECONOMIC THEORY AND THE HISTORY OF ECONOMIC THOUGHT</field><field name="creator">Mitchener, Kerrie</field><field name="description">The concept of utility has a long and complex history, and may be traced back to Aristotle. In modern (neoclassical) economics, utility is generally taken to be a number that represents an individual&#146;s preferences. Despite this definition (or perhaps because of it), the notion of utility remains one of the most debated economic concepts of our time; after centuries of discussion, there is still no consensus among economists about the precise definition of the term &#147;utility&#148;. In contrast to this wealth of debate regarding utility, the economic literature contains very little discussion about the meaning and significance of the corresponding and equally important concept of preference. In particular, the literature mentions nothing about the origin and development of this concept. How then can we say that we have defined utility if we do not know what is meant by preference? In Part I of this thesis it is shown that the neoclassical heavily-circumscribed conception of preference, as it pertains to utility theory, is merely an abstract representation of the Utilitarian notion of pleasure. This is accomplished through an examination of the works of the principal contributors to the historical development of the utility concept, namely Jevons, Edgeworth, Fisher and Pareto, and the post-1900 contributions of economists such as Wicksteed, Hicks, Wold, Debreu, Samuelson and Chipman. It is demonstrated that the Utilitarian notion of pleasure implies a form of &#147;moralistic hierarchy&#148;. This conception of pleasure, as described by Bentham and JS Mill (which the Utilitarians had adapted from the philosophical conception of pleasure propagated by the ancient Greeks and the Scholastics), was adopted by Jevons and Edgeworth as the starting point of their respective theories of utility measurement. Both limited the Utilitarian definition in order to produce a model that could &#147;measure&#148; pleasure. Successive generations of economists then progressively reduced the pleasure concept from a broad psycho-philosophical notion to the bare construct of preference that we see today. The contemporary preference concept is largely due to Wold, who formally defined preference by deriving conditions that a preference relation must satisfy in order that a continuous utility function may exist, and Debreu, who provided the definitive distinction between the concepts of preference and utility by showing that there can be preference without utility. In Part II of this thesis, we present a series of essays on concepts central to preference and utility theory, including the &#147;measurability&#148; of utility, and the meaning of &#147;indifference&#148;, &#147;ordinal utility&#148; and &#147;cardinal utility&#148;; we also look at how the concepts of preference and utility are applied in other disciplines outside the realm of economics. We find that, for the early utility theorists, the measurability of utility was not an issue; the theoretical possibility of measurability was accepted as given. However, their respective interpretations of &#147;measurability&#148; differ. We examine why most economists unquestioningly assume that utility is a real number, and show that this view is due to Jevons, and that it has come about because of the particular structure of Jevons&#146; utility functions. We examine the competing views of preference and indifference, and find that although these concepts have appeared in the literature since the time of Edgeworth, they largely remained undefined, their meanings taken as given, until the late 1930s; during the midtwentieth century the meanings of these concepts began to be questioned. We investigate the origin and evolution of the concepts of &#147;ordinal utility&#148; and &#147;cardinal utility&#148;, and find that the economic interpretations of the concepts of &#147;ordinality&#148; and &#147;cardinality&#148; bear no resemblance to the mathematical definitions of these terms, and further we conclude that attempting to categorise the early theories of utility as either ordinal or cardinal in nature does little to aid our understanding of these theories. We show that Edgeworth was the first to distinguish between &#147;ordinal&#148; and &#147;cardinal&#148; utility, although he made use of an entirely different nomenclature, differentiating instead between the terms &#147;quantitative&#148; and &#147;numerical&#148;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158624</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CHARGE TRANSPORT IN DYE-SENSITISED SOLAR CELLS</field><field name="creator">Blake, David</field><field name="description">In this thesis we report a study of the transport dynamics of dye-sensitised solar cells (DSCs). The work is motivated by a desire to better understand the operation of the DSC in order to realise improved power conversion efficiencies. Specifically, we focus on charge transport in these devices and the elements of DSC operation that either assist or impede this transport. We confirm that the transport in the DSC is dispersive under virtually all operating conditions (particularly around the maximum power point). We also describe a new technique for probing transport dynamics - namely transient photocurrent measurements coupled with an adapted equivalent circuit model. This technique has allowed us to calculate for the first time critical parameters such as the equivalent recombination resistance. We have also demonstrated the correspondence between a commonly accepted open circuit photovoltage decay measurement technique and a leading equivalent circuit model. This correspondence validates both our own method and the model from which it extends.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158625</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading Roman Masculinities. Sexual Invective Discourses and Constructions from Augustus to Elagabalus</field><field name="creator">Tunny, Ricky John</field><field name="description">Studies of ancient sexualities and masculinities has increased since the publication of Foucault&#146;s first volume of The History of Sexuality in 1976, Dover&#146;s Greek Homosexuality in 1978 and Richlin&#146;s first edition of The Garden of Priapus in 1981. Modern scholars have identified points of difference between modern categories that are based on the gender/sex of the sexual object-choice and the ancient emphasis and importance of status and issues of penetration. This study aims to modify some of the previously held beliefs on Roman masculinities and sexualities, and argue that there are many different discourses and constructions, which are often manipulated to suit the purpose and context of the author. Illustrative of these shifts in sexual discourses are the constructions of the emperors from Augustus to Elagabalus, who are targeted with invective ranging from sex with slaves (or freedmen), citizen boys, being penetrated, performing oral sex, committing adultery and/or having incestuous sex. Sometimes these acts are constructed as sexual transgressive behaviours, but in other contexts, they are considered part of everyday norms. While issues of penetration are significant to Roman sexual discourses and constructions of masculinities, it was not the only qualifier to being a dominant man. Penetrators could be targeted with invective for certain sexual behaviours that were considered to have transgressed social and legal conventions. Although ancient discourses did not primarily categorise sexual behaviour based on the sex of the object-choice, there were preferences for certain objectchoices based on status, age and the sex of the sexual object-choice. The stereotypes of cinaedi and the emperors of the late first century BCE to the early third century CE demonstrate that some discourses constructed men with preferences for males, females or both sexes; and that preferences for certain status and age groups or certain sexual acts were also significant to Roman sexual discourses. One of the central aims of this thesis is to examine the shifts and manipulations in Roman sexual discourses, particularly in satire, epigram and comic genres and biographical and historical genres, to identify common or varying topoi. We find that each text asserts ideologies about the emperors, and employ inconsistent and conflicting attitudes about sexual acts in different genres and contexts. Notionally, Roman men were limited to certain acceptable status- and age-appropriate groups, and perhaps more importantly restricted to gender-appropriate sexual acts. The level of hostility in discourses and constructions can often vary, depending upon the purpose of the author, which should caution us against making definite conclusions about Roman masculine sexual identities. On re-evaluating and re-interpreting the evidence, it seems misleading to state that Roman gender and sexual constructions and discourses are totally alien and incomparable to modern discourses, particularly with regard to some mainstream characterisations of the penetrated male in same-sex sexual behaviours. Ideally, Roman men fulfilled the dominant masculine role and familial duty of marrying and begetting heirs. Within this environment, we find that homoerotic relationships were placed outside this norm, excluded from concepts of Roman marriage, adultery and incest. Our sources focus rather on male-female relationships when they discuss marriage, adultery and incest and construct a notional ideal that men should be discreet about their extra-marital affairs, whether with males or females and irrespective of status and age or social conventions that placed certain restrictions on masculine sexualities. When the sexual invective against the emperors is considered, it becomes clear that men could be targeted for all sorts of sexual behaviours, which in some contexts are considered part of the norm and in other contexts part of deviant sexualities. Ultimately, the context is important for reading discourses of Roman masculinities and sexualities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158418</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY IN OLDER ADULTS</field><field name="creator">Shaw, Kelly Anne-Marie</field><field name="description">The high prevalence of overweight and obesity among older Australian adults and their strong association with an increased risk of ill health, functional limitation and disability, are well documented. This thesis examines the assessment and management of overweight and obesity in older adults. Meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials were undertaken to assess the effects of psychological interventions and of exercise on body weight and health. A series of analyses were then undertaken using data from the 1053 participants enrolled in The Tasmanian Older Adult Cohort Study, an ongoing prospective cohort study whose aim is to identify the environmental, genetic and biochemical factors associated with the development and progression of a number of chronic diseases. The purpose of the analyses was to investigate changes in body composition (measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) that occur with age, the most accurate field methods for assessing body composition in different age groups, the influence of lifestyle risk factors on body composition, and the complex interrelationships between age, lifestyle, body composition and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Results demonstrate that body fat increases and lean body mass decreases with increasing age in older adults. The most accurate field methods for assessing body composition in older adults are body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. Lean body mass is predominantly influenced by age in older adults and decreases as age increases. Body fat, however, is predominantly influenced by lifestyle risk factors. Physical activity levels, smoking and alcohol consumption in females are associated with lower body fat, whereas the presence of chronic pain and alcohol consumption in males are associated with higher body fat. In younger and middle aged adults, meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials demonstrate that exercise is an effective weight loss intervention, particularly when combined with low fat or low calorie diets. Exercise also improves factors commonly associated with cardiovascular disease, even in the absence of weight loss. Meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials also demonstrate that adults who are overweight or obese can reduce weight with psychological interventions, particularly behavioural and cognitive behavioural interventions. In older adults, observational data demonstrate that higher levels of pedometer-determined physical activity are associated with lower body fat, supporting the efficacy of physical activity or an active lifestyle as a weight loss intervention in this group also. The greatest impact of physical activity on body fat is observed when participants increase activity levels to greater than 7 500 steps per day. However, higher levels of physical activity are not associated individually with improved blood pressure, lipids or fasting serum glucose. Instead, higher physical activity levels are associated with a lower total number of cardiovascular risk factors, suggesting that in older adults, physical activity reduces the likelihood of multiple cooccurring cardiovascular disease risk factors. The studies within this thesis provide an evidence base for the continued development of an understanding of the assessment and management of overweight and obesity in older adults. A number of research priorities have also been highlighted. These include the need for long-term randomised controlled clinical trials in older adults in order to: assess the efficacy and safety of multi-component weight loss therapies (diet, physical activity and psychological therapy); determine the combination of physical activity and dietary therapy that will maximize loss of body fat while maintaining lean body mass in older adults for whom weight loss therapy is appropriate; and assess the effect of weight loss, diet and physical activity on clinical outcomes, particularly chronic disease end-points and risk factors in older adults. Longitudinal studies are required to: explore the interrelations between ageing, physical activity levels, body composition and cardiovascular disease risk in older adults; determine the causal relationships that exist between lifestyle risk factors, body composition and chronic disease in older adults; and better assess the effect of alcohol consumption on body composition using sensitive measures in older adults.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obesity</field><field name="subject">overweight</field><field name="subject">older adult</field><field name="subject">body composition</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158308</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Privacy-Preserving Data Mining of Classification Rules</field><field name="creator">Natwichai, Juggapong</field><field name="description">Data sharing among collaborators is a common practice. On the one hand, shared data can be analysed by data mining techniques to provide useful patterns or knowledge for the collaborators. In the business domain, a new company may use shared data to discover the customer&#146;s behaviour and thus improve their operations. While in the medical domain, epidemics can be determined more accurately when using the shared data from many hospitals. On the other hand, data sharing can pose a privacy threat for the data to be mined. With regard to data mining, there are two types of privacy of concern. Firstly, there could be sensitive or personal data which should not be disclosed. Secondly, some discoverable patterns being mined from the shared data could be considered as sensitive patterns. These sensitive patterns can be used to disclose personal data or give the other collaborators excessive information. These patterns should not be disclosed, or they should be &#147;hidden&#148; before data sharing takes place. Generally, to hide sensitive patterns in the data sharing scenarios, the data set to be shared needs to be modified until the interestingness of the sensitive patterns falls below the specific threshold. The modifications can cause damage to the statistical characteristics of the data set. This poses a challenging task, that is, how to preserve the characteristics of the modified data set required by the data recipient or &#147;data usability&#148; while the sensitive patterns are hidden? In this dissertation, our research focuses on the problem of sensitive pattern hiding, particularly for an important pattern type: classification rules. We propose algorithms to hide the sensitive rules while preserving the data usability; this can be categorised into two approaches: data reconstruction and data reduction. When shared data are to be used for the classification rule discovery and real data are not required, data reconstruction is a suitable approach. The approach introduces less side effects, that is, only non-sensitive rules are likely to be derived. We propose a data reconstruction framework to hide gain ratio-based classification rules. In this framework and to preserve the data usability, a set of remaining non-sensitive classification rules and gain-ratio information are used to reconstruct a new data set. For scenarios which real data are required, we address the problem through a data reduction approach, that is, by removing the selected records to hide the sensitive rules. Through this approach, the shared data are real data, although a subset of the original data. To preserve data usability, we investigate the impact on the data usability of the removals on a geometrical model. Observations of the impact are made in the model. By using the observations, the impact of a removal can be shown precisely without re-applying any classification algorithms on the data. We propose a number of algorithms by using the observations to hide sensitive associative classification rules in which they are categorised by data type - non-duplicate and duplicate data sets. Our proposed works are evaluated by standard real data sets with various characteristics. The evaluations are conducted both in terms of the effectiveness and the efficiency. For the effectiveness, sensitive rules with different features are randomly selected to be hidden. The hiding successfulness and the usability are evaluated. For the efficiency, our works are evaluated when sizes of the problem are scaled up, that is, higher interestingness of sensitive rules, higher number of sensitive rules, and larger size of data sets. From the evaluation results, our proposed works are not only effective - sensitive classification rules are hidden while data usability is well preserved - but also perform efficiently.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158626</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Franck's Violin Sonata in A Major and Saint-Saens's Violin Sonata in D Minor, op. 75 no. 1 : Context and Comparison</field><field name="creator">Oostenbroek, Neridah Anne</field><field name="description">This commentary provides an insight into instrumental and chamber music of latenineteenth- century France through the discussion of Franck's Violin Sonata in A Major and Saint-Saens's Violin Sonata in D minor, op. 75 no. 1. The historical and social events that occurred in France during this time had a significant effect on the style and aesthetics of musical compositions. The court of Napolbon I11 was mainly uneducated in "serious" aspects of musicianship, and thus, favoured a more frivolous style of music. However, the influence of Wagner and German Romantic music developed a desire in many young French musicians to compose in a more learned musical style. Franck and Saint-Saens were both composers to whom this new style appealed and they were both involved in the Sociit4 Nationale de Musique, one of many instrumental and chamber music societies that emerged in the latter half of the nineteenth century. However, as is evident through the examination of their representative violin sonatas, Franck and Saint-Saens composed from different musical aesthetic approaches. Franck was undoubtedly greatly influenced by Wagner. The harmonic language, texture, rhythm and references to Tristan und Isolde in his sonata are reflective of the style identified with the New German School of music. In contrast, Saint-Saens adopted a more classical aesthetic in his work. His sonata avoids compositional traits commonly associated with the music of Wagner and Franck and, instead, his work is clear and direct, reflective of an earlier musical aesthetic. The significant compositional differences evident in these two sonatas are representative of the diverse styles of music that emerged in France in the late Romantic period.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158419</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SOIL FERTILITY as a FACTOR AFFECTING the PRODUCTION of YAMS (Dioscorea spp.) in VANUATU</field><field name="creator">Melteras, Marie-Vianney</field><field name="description">Yam (Dioscoreae spp) is one of the major root crops cultivated in tropical regions, and particularly in the Pacific islands. Production of yam normally involves clearing a bush fallow and planting yam first followed by other root crops including sweet potato and cassava. Fallowing is the only practice used by farmers to sustain the production and soil fertility. The recent increase in population may impact on the soil fertility as the fallow periods have been reduced and farmers claim a decrease in yam production. The effects of fertilizer on yam production have been studied in West Africa and Caribbean but little has been done in the Pacific Region. Understanding the plant response to fertilizer would help farmers to improve production under more intensive farming conditions. The objectives of this study were: (i) to determine nutrient deficiencies in selected sites with pot experiments and (ii) use the result as a guide to test the response of yam to fertilizer application in the field. Pot and field experiments were conducted in Vanuatu. Leaf and soil samples were sent to the University of Queensland for chemical analysis. Soil from seven sites covering four different islands were collected for glasshouse experiments using sweet corn as the test plant. Nutrient omission pot experiments indicated that all seven soils were deficient in phosphorus (P) and bimass yields in six soils were &amp;lt 50 % of the &#147;all nutrients&#148; control treatment (&#147;All&#148;) when no P was added. Nitrogen (N) was limiting to growth in four soils with yield in minus N treatment at between 54 % and 78 % of &#147;All&#148;. Potassium (K) was deficient at two sites, with yield in minus K treatment yields of approximately 70 % of &#147;All&#148;. Sulphur (S) was found to be limiting to growth at two sites and iron (Fe) deficiency was detected at one site. Single nutrient rate pot trials using six levels of supply of each deficient element were used to confirm the deficiency and estimated approximate fertilizer rates for field trials. Fourteen pot rate trials were conducted. In nine of these, the highest yield was obtained at the highest fertilizer rate, but in all except two cases, the next highest was not significantly lower, indicating that a response plateau had been reached. As most of the soils were known to be strongly P-fixing, three P-rate trials compared the response with fertilizer mixed throughout the pot to that were it was banded in a 2cm layer half-way down the pot. Banding resulted in a greater response at low fertilizer rates, but did not alter the optimum rate. Optimum N rates varied from 25 to 400 kg N/ha, P rates from 120 to 600 kg P/ha, and K from 150 to 200 kg/ha. The S rate trial did not detect a significant response to added sulphur. Field trials were conducted at six sites over three yam growing seasons with three yams species commonly grown in Vanuatu: D. alata, D. esculenta, and D. rotundata to test their response to fertilizer. Despite the deficiency found in pot experiments at each sites, the results of field experiments were not conclusive. Most of the trials showed no significant responses of yam to the application of fertilizer. The few significant results recorded did not generally follow a trend. There was one exception, in which a P rate trial at Valeteruru showed a significant and consistent response, with yield approximately 60 % higher with 240 kg P/ha than without P. Leaf analyses were conducted to assist evaluation of field trials at four sites. At Tagabe, all nutrients suspected of potential deficiency (N, P, K and S) were found to be adequately supplied. At Teouma N and K concentrations were below adequate range. At Valeteruru, the nutrient concentrations in D. nummularia cv Maro were in the adequate range. However, in the D. alata experiment, the concentrations were below adequate range. At Malo, only P was found to be deficient on the basis of pot experiments, but N, P and K were in the deficient range in leaves. In all sites except one, no change in nutrient concentrations was found in responses to fertilizer treatments. The exception was Tagabe, where N concentrations in both leaves and tubers of D. rotundata and D. alata increased with N fertilizer rate. In response to the poor field trial results, an experiment was conducted in the final season with D. esculenta to study the development of the plant root system. Ten plants were excavated each month from 2.5 to 12 months after planting. It indicated that yam developed an initially shallow root system which radiated over a wide area during the early stage of development. The root system of D. esculenta developed on the surface at 7-10 cm, descending to about 30 cm only after reaching near maximum length. Two months after planting, the shallow roots reached an average length of 123 cm. The longest root recorded was 436 cm at four months. At this time, 70 % of plants had at last one root exceeding 3 m in length. Tubers also appeared first at four months. Conducting field experiments with yam presents many challenges. Variability among plants is high, while the wide plant spacing (one per m2), limited size of farmers&#146; fields and very limited availability of uniform planting material necessitated small plot sizes, in most cases with 12 datum plants per plot. Variations in weight, moisture content and stage of dormancy of planting setts all influence plant vigour and yield. Steps were taken to unify setts size, stratify setts among plots, force breaking of dormancy, and reserve planting material from a single known source for next season&#146;s trial. The placement of fertilizer was also varied in response to observations on early root growth pattern. However, these measures did not improve field trial results measurably. Given the nutrient deficiency status indicated by nutrient omission pot trials, the nonsignificant responses to fertilizer application might be the results of either: 1) poor access by roots to the nutrients applied as the spot placement was not placed where the feeder roots proliferate or 2) proliferation of roots across guard rows to access higher nutrient treatments in adjoining plots. A root development study showed that roots rapidly spread beyond the planting mound, and that most branching occurs some distance from the mound. The method of fertilizer application after crop establishment, by burying it around the base of mounds, may damage many primary roots, which lie close to the surface at that point. For future experiments, banding midway between yam rows may be preferable. To separate treatments adequately, it is suggest that installation of root barriers around the plots might be necessary. An alternative would be to align the treatments in the field from low to high treatments instead of using a randomized design. From there, even though the root system would cross to the next plot, it won&#146;t get much advantage as the rate would be not much different from its own plot. The field experiment which showed the greatest response to P application was laid out in this way. While this study did not advance our knowledge as far as hoped with respect to nutritional limitations to yam production in Vanuatu, valuable information was generated on the morphology of yam and the requirements for yam field trials, which will assist further studies in this area.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158309</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of laminar jet break-up to the preparation of monodisperse poly(ester) microparticles</field><field name="creator">Rahman, Mohammad Mizanur</field><field name="description">Poly(ester) drug-loaded microspheres are most commonly prepared by emulsion solvent evaporation/extraction in which the polymer is dissolved in an organic solvent which is dispersed in an aqueous continuous phase. Typically, the o/w or more complex w/o/w (required for encapsulation of hydrophilic actives) emulsions are produced by homogenization, sonication or high speed stirring which yield microspheres with wide size distributions. Standard deviations of 25-50% of the mean diameter are not uncommon for microspheres prepared by such technologies. This lack of control and predictability are limitations of the current technologies. Particle size is a primary determinant of drug release and particle deposition following in vivo administration. Any variation in the size of particles will lead to sub-optimal delivery in which release kinetics are difficult to control. A long-sought after goal in particulate drug delivery technologies has therefore been to precisely control the size of the particles. Many theoretical and experimental studies have shown that uniformly sized liquid-liquid dispersions can be formed by laminar jet break-up. However, to date nobody has used the resulting dispersions for the preparation of drug loaded polymeric microparticles. The aim of this project was therefore to investigate the application of laminar jet break-up for the preparation of o/w dispersions for the fabrication of monodisperse biodegradable microparticles of controlled and predictable size. In this study, poly(@-caprolactone) was used as the polymer and was dissolved in an organic solvent (initially and mainly, dichloromethane). The organic polymer solution was loaded into a high precision syringe pump and pumped through orifices of different diameters into an aqueous phase containing poly(vinyl alcohol) as surfactant. The dispersions were subsequently stirred to facilitate solvent removal leading to polymer precipitation and microparticle formation. Resulting microparticles were characterized by optical microscopy and low angle laser light scattering. In the first series of investigations (Chapter 2), the effect of orifice diameter, flow rate (particularly within the laminar jet region), type of organic solvent and polymer/surfactant concentrations on the size and polydispersity of the microparticles were investigated. Uniformly sized microspheres (polydispersity index &lt; 0.5) were observed to form in both the dripping and laminar jet flow regions. Microspheres formed in the laminar region were however smaller and there was a trend of decreasing particle size and polydispersity upon approaching the flow velocity resulting in maximum jet-length. In the dewaving region, polydispersity of the particles was found to increase. Consequently, all further studies were undertaken in the laminar jet region using the flow rate yielding maximum jet length. Polydispersity as well as size of micrparticles was influenced by concentration of poly(vinylalcohol) in the continuous aqueous phase (used as viscosity modifier and surfactant). A concentration of 0.91 % w/v poly(vinylalcohol) was found most suitable with higher/lower concentrations resulting in increased polydispersity as a result of viscosity and interfacial effects. Size and polydispersity of microspheres was found to be also influenced by the organic solvent used to dissolve the poly(ester) with dichloromethane yielding the smallest and most uniformly dispersed microspheres. Size of microspheres produced from dispersions prepared by laminar jet break-up not surprisingly increased with both the size of the orifice used for jetting and the concentration of polymer. In chapter 3, a factorial designed study combined with mathematical modelling was used to investigate whether a relationship existed between the response variable of particle size and these two independent process variables (nozzle orifice diameter and polymer concentration) for microspheres prepared under conditions based on the results of chapter 2 (namely jetting at a velocity yielding maximum jet length, using dichloromethane as the organic solvent and using a poly(vinylalcohol) concentration of 0.91 % w/v in the aqueous phase). Based on the results of four trials (22 factorial design), a linear, algebraic first-degree polynomial correlation was predicted to describe the effects of nozzle orifice diameter, polymer concentration and their interaction on the mean particle size of microspheres. The model was validated by 11 experimental results within the factor space. It was found that the predicted values of ten experiments (means, n=3) were within &#177;5.5% of the calculated values. Only one experimental result deviated by greater than 10% from that predicted. The model thus allows a prescribed size of particles to be prepared by selecting the appropriate nozzle orifice size and polymer concentration.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158627</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The past is a foreign country: A history of the Church of England in the diocese of Brisbane, 1950-1970</field><field name="creator">Holland, Jonathan Charles</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">2202 History and Philosophy of Specific Fields</field><field name="subject">Anglican Church of Australia.

Despite considerable interest in the cultivation of A. balloti, there have been many factors limiting the development of A. balloti aquaculture or stockenhancement programs. One limitation is access to scallop juveniles, as wild spat collection is difficult for this species. To date, breeding of A. balloti using standard hatchery techniques has had limited success. The overarching objective of this research, therefore, is to understand the early life cycle biology of A. balloti and apply this knowledge to improve hatchery and culture methods and technology. The successful and efficient cultivation of A. balloti from fertilised egg through to juvenile should provide the foundation to develop future aquaculture and stock-enhancement programs. Systematic experimental analysis of different diets and culture water temperatures allowed the identification of conditions that promoted high survival and growth rates of A. balloti larvae. Seven algal species were evaluated as mono-species diets or as combinations over a seven-day trial. As mono-species diets, golden-brown flagellates (Isochrysis aff. galbana (Tiso) and Pavlova lutheri) promoted the highest larval growth and survival compared with other algal diets and the unfed controls. Diatoms (Chaetoceros calcitrans, C. muelleri and Thalassiosira pseudonana) supported reasonable growth and survival, whereas a diatom (Skeletonema costatum) and a green alga (Tetraselmis chuii) were not suitable for A. balloti larvae. Multi-species diets were better than mono-species diets, which supported better larval growth and survival. Of the seven rearing water temperatures tested (14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24 and 26&#176;C), the optimum water temperature range for A. balloti larvae was between 18 and 20&#176;C, where there was 50 to 95% survival and 14 to 23 &#181;m growth in 11 days. These water temperatures were similar to ambient seawater temperatures of the Central Queensland waters during the peak spawning season for this species (July to August). To precisely define settlement competency in A. balloti larvae, and to determine the ideal period to induce settlement and metamorphosis, larval development and growth was characterized cytologically and morphologically. The nervous system development of larvae, postlarvae and newly-settled spat was assessed by detecting serotonin expression using an anti-serotonin antibody. Serotonin expression was first detected in the apical ganglia of two-day old larvae (48 h after fertilization). This expression appeared to be transient and ceased during metamorphosis. In the later (eyespot) larval stage all three major adult ganglia (cerebral, pedal and visceral) expressed serotonin. Based on immunocytochemical staining patterns, these ganglia appeared to progressively assemble throughout metamorphosis and postlarval development. There was no obvious change in the serotonergic nervous system at competency. The development of larvae and postlarvae and newly-settled spat musculature was assessed by phalloidin staining of myofibrillar F-actin. In early D-veligers, the muscular system was well developed, with the present of the anterior adductor, a number of velar retractors (VR) and posterior retractors (PR). With progressive larval growth, the myofibril mass and complexity of VR and PR increased significantly, and new muscles such as mantle retractors, anterior and posterior body retractors, posterior adductor, and foot gradually formed. After metamorphosis, A. balloti lost the VR and PR but retained anterior adductor and other muscles. The foot retractors were developed after metamorphosis. There were no apparent myogenesis events that correlated with competency. While no obvious change in the central nervous system or muscle architecture of A. balloti larvae was detected that correlated with acquisition of competence, it was observed that larval eyespot appearance was closely linked to competency. This might, therefore, be a useful marker to artificially determine when to induce metamorphosis in the hatchery. To improve the speed, synchrony, and survival through metamorphosis, various cues, previously shown to be effective in inducing settlement and metamorphosis in a range of invertebrates, were tested both in terms of efficiency of inducing metamorphosis and for assessing the acquisition of larval competency. The results demonstrated that no settlement substrata tested in this study were effective inducers of settlement and metamorphosis. However, biofilms, 10 and 20 mM KCl-elevated seawater, 10&#150;4 M epinephrine and 10-5 M L-DOPA were effective metamorphosis inducers. Potassium chloride was the most effective (15% to 37% higher than controls). However, higher concentration of KCl (e.g. 40 mM) was toxic to A. balloti larvae. These studies again confirmed that the presence of eyespots was the most reliable and prectical morphological indicator of larval competency in A. balloti. Traditional scallop settlement and nursery systems, which use fibrous substrata to collect larvae, did not promote a high rate of settlement for A. balloti, possibly because of the lack of long-term byssal attachment in A. balloti spat. A downweller screen nursery system was evaluated for settlement of A. balloti larvae and culture of A. balloti spat. Compared to a traditional settlement and nursery system, the downweller screens greatly improved the rate of metamorphosis for A. balloti larvae and the survival of the spat. A mean yield of 57% was achieved in the downweller screens, compared to 3% using a traditional settlement and nursery systems. Continuous aeration enhanced A. balloti larval metamorphosis in the downweller screen nursery system, with a mean spat yield of 50% achieved, compared to 10% using intermittent aeration and 15% with no aeration. Previous reports indicated that A. balloti either lacks the ability to produce byssal threads, or could do so only briefly. As the byssal attachment is crucial to the settlement process in many other scallop species, this was examined in detail. Specifically, it was demonstrated that in the early spat stage, A.balloti does secrete a byssus. The first byssal attachment was detected only after A. balloti developed to spat (indicated by the presence of dissoconch shell). By contrast, the newly-metamorphosed postlarvae crawled over the substratum using their foot, and for immobile postlarvae, byssal attachment was not detected. Although spat remained byssally attached for most of the time, they commonly changed position, moving a mean of 17 mm/day. A gentle water jet and 40&#137; hypersaline bath were effective in detaching spat, with the majority rapidly reattaching. Byssal attachment was shown to persist until the spat reached 4 - 5 mm, around the stage they first develop an ability to swim. Large-scale post-hatchery nursery culture and growout could not be included in this study due to outdoor culture facilities being unavailable. However, a proof of concept trial was conducted to compare juvenile A. balloti growth and survival in suspended culture and bottom culture under laboratory conditions. The results showed that preventing juvenile A. balloti from recessing into the sand (suspended culture) may stress the animals and does affect their growth rate. Also, A. balloti is sensitive to high stocking density. Using photographic images can be a valid method to measure shell size in scallops. These results will provide valuable information to develop a post-hatchery nursery culture technique for A. balloti. Together these data - effects of water temperature and diet on larval growth and survival, identification of the development of larval competency, understanding of external factors controlling settlement and metamorphosis, analysis of postlarval and spat development and behaviour, comparison of suspended cage culture and bottom culture of juveniles and a practical method fro rapid, mass shell measurement - allow for the beginnings of an efficient cultivation system for A. balloti on a commercial scale. The application of this study to stock-enhancement and mariculture programs is discussed, particularly in regard to the further development of culturing A. balloti in Queensland and Western Australian.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">0704 Fisheries Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158628</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Empirical Studies in Trade, Foreign Investment and Economic Performance</field><field name="creator">Iyer, Krishna G</field><field name="description">Although the theoretical literature suggests that countries with a strong outward orientation register a faster pace of economic progress relative to those that are inwardly oriented, the empirical evidence is mixed. This thesis re-examines the empirical relationship between outward orientation and economic growth using innovative methodologies drawn from the production frontiers literature and timeseries econometrics. Outward orientation is defined as openness to trade and foreign investment. A key difference between this thesis and the current literature is that the former distinguishes between technology and efficiency externalities of outward orientation and also considers the potential linkages between various channels of outward orientation. The thesis is organized as a collection of three independent empirical studies. In the first study, the efficiency component of productivity growth is isolated, and the effects of trade and inward and outward foreign investment on efficiency is examined; different forms of foreign investment &#150; direct, portfolio and other foreign investment are distinguished. A sample of 20 OECD countries covering the period 1988-2000 is applied in the analysis. In the second study, &#145;inefficiency free&#146; measurements of technology gap are computed. Through second stage regressions of the technology gap measure on trade and foreign direct investment, the effects of outward orientation on technology are gauged. A larger panel dataset of 63 countries covering the period 1982-2000 is applied in this study. The third study, using quarterly data from Australia over the period 1988-2003, evaluates the growth effects of outward orientation while providing for systematic interactions between various types of trade and foreign investment. In addition to the empirical studies, the thesis also includes two literature review chapters: one on the linkages between trade, foreign investment and economic growth, and the other on the use of production frontier methods in macroeconomic applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158310</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#145;White on White&#146;: A Transformative Analysis of Whiteness and Diversity Education</field><field name="creator">Hambel, Sabrina Michelle</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the intersection of whiteness and diversity education in Australia is investigated through a transformative analysis aimed at fostering social change. Primarily, the examination focuses on challenging whiteness and transforming white student identities through education policy and practice, issues that have not been widely explored previously in the Australian context. Thus, this thesis has not only been developed to contribute to the scope of research-based knowledge but to (re)construct research as a form of social action. Many researchers in the area of critical race and whiteness studies assert that whiteness, as invisiblised through race hegemony and a focus on racial, ethnic, and cultural &#145;others&#146;, has played a significant role in the development of &#145;mainstream&#146; Australian culture, including the education system. However, some researchers and educators have begun the process of challenging and transforming schooling practices that reproduce whiteness. Most notably, critical / critical race frameworks of diversity education, which centre on dialogue, identity transformation, and social action that visibilises and displaces whiteness, have been advocated. Through focusing on these more critical frameworks, this thesis investigates how issues of race and whiteness are reproduced and / or challenged through policy documents and classroom practices described, in the context of interactive interviews, by mostly white primary school teachers of mostly white students. The first three chapters introduce and frame the thesis through a discussion of current literature on race, whiteness, and diversity education, particularly in Australia. Chapter 1 explains why the study is significant and defines the main constructs of the thesis. It also includes a more extensive outline of the layout of the thesis. In Chapter 2, the theoretical framework is described, including constructionism and ethics, critical race theory, and whiteness studies. Chapter 3 then applies the &#145;lens&#146; of the theoretical framework to reviewing diversity education research through a socio-historic discussion of various frameworks. In this chapter, critical race / critical approaches to diversity education are given more attention. Next, Chapter 4 describes the methodology of the thesis, and impact of the theoretical &#145;lens&#146; on both the research methods and analysis. Key in this chapter is the discussion of critical discourse analysis as adapted for the purposes of this study. Through focusing on how language patterns in the policy documents and descriptions of classroom practices by teachers reflect various ideologies, this analytical approach is useful in understanding how race and whiteness hegemony is reproduced and / or challenged. In Chapters 5 through 8, the data are analysed. Chapter 5 examines the policy documents, mostly through investigating policies in the State of Queensland, which is where this study has taken place. This chapter addresses the question of how and for whom policies describe and explain diversity education. Chapter 6 builds on the previous discussion by analysing the language patterns and ideologies evident in teachers&#146; descriptions of their classroom practices. This chapter addresses two research questions: how teachers describe and explain diversity education; and how the teachers&#146; descriptions / explanations coincide with those in the policy documents. Then, Chapter 7 expands the study further through examining how diversity education is applied to the teaching of white students, addressing the question of for whom do teachers describe and explain diversity education. Next, Chapter 8 hones in on issues of whiteness, through addressing the question of how teachers address whiteness through diversity education. Lastly, Chapter 9 summarises and concludes the thesis, describing the limitations of the study and directions for future research. In all three of the chapters that examine the teachers&#146; descriptions / explanations as evident in interactive interviews, particular excerpts were selected partly to illustrate the scope of teachers&#146; language patterns but mainly to demonstrate instances of ideological transformation. Often through using critical race / critical discourse, these teachers described strategies that aim to encourage students to understand the impact of race and whiteness in their own lives and in their larger communities. From media analyses about whose views are dominant / marginalised in reports of refugee detention centres to conversations about the impact of white privilege on renting a house, they discuss a variety of practices supported by current researchers. Additionally, some teachers explained that they actively challenge white privilege through social justice projects and involvement in the community. Although the educational practices described by these teachers could be enhanced through more extensive understandings of whiteness, they form an important step toward a transformative future in Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158421</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantum Electromechanical Systems (QEMS)</field><field name="creator">Utami, Dian Wahyu</field><field name="description">Much interest has been shown lately in the physics of the electrical and mechanical interplay within a Quantum Electro-Mechanical System (QEMS). This thesis presents the study of the interaction between electrical and mechanical degrees of freedom in various Quantum Electro-Mechanical Systems, in particular the C[subscript]60 system, the shuttle system, the magnetic shuttle system and the cantilever-ion system. These systems are treated as open quantum systems. The possibility to use these systems in various setups such as an ultrasensitive displacement detector and spin detector is investigated. We describe each system by quantum master equations and derive coupled equations of motion for the electron occupation number, vibrational degrees of freedom and thermo- mechanical noise. We use the Quantum Optics Toolbox[1] to compare and contrast the well known semiclassical predictions to the full quantum dynamics. In particular, we compare the picture of ensemble averaged dynamics of various moments with a `quantum trajectory'[2] simulation of moments. Within the C[subscript]60 system, we derive the observed quantities such as conductance through the system and compare this to the experimental results previously obtained. We follow this with the analysis of the shuttle system as proposed by Gorelik [3], where a dependance of the tunnel rate on the position of the island is added. Again we include descriptions of the local system dynamics. We also look for the correlation in the current fluctuations. Adding a spin degrees of freedom, we describe the magnetic shuttle. The conductance across the junctions differs for each orientation of the spin. Here the feasibility of the application of the system as a single spin measurement is explored. By coupling a cantilever to a trapped ion, we examine the possibilities to transfer phonon excitations in a cantilever to a trapped ion with the aim to read out these phonon excitations by reading the electronic state of the ion as the phonon modes in the ion are coupled to its electronic state by a laser. The conditional evolution of the cantilever is also presented. We show that within these various system, the dynamics contains a lot of interesting physics which can be usefully employed in various applications including position sensing, spin detection and cantilever cooling.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158311</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pleasure Learning: Enhancing Understanding of Affective Conditioning Processes and Modulation of the Startle Reflex Through Assessing the Acquisition of Likes in the Picture-picture Paradigm</field><field name="creator">Mallan, Kimberley</field><field name="description">Affective learning is a process by which likes and dislikes are formed through an association learned between a neutral stimulus (conditional stimulus; CS) and an affective stimulus (unconditional stimulus; US). This thesis presents an investigation of affective learning of positive valence. The acquisition of positive valence was assessed to further investigate: (a) the theoretical implications of key characteristics of affective learning, and (b) physiological indices of learning and emotional processes in conditioning. The aim of Experiments 1 and 2 was to condition positive valence in a picturepicture conditioning procedure and to assess whether acquisition of positive valence would occur in the presence of concurrent affective learning of negative valence. Demonstration of affective learning of positive valence in Experiment 1a and 1b was weaker and less robust than predicted, thus the salience of the US pictures was increased in Experiment 2. Clear evidence of positive affective learning in Experiment 2 was reflected in the pleasantness rating data and was not affected by concurrent acquisition of negative valence. Affective priming was used as an indirect measure of pleasantness but no effects were observed. A follow-up study indicated that the trial timing of the priming task needed to be modified slightly in order to produce a robust affective priming effect. Experiment 3 compared the strength of affective learning in the picture-picture paradigm using forward, backward and simultaneous pairings of neutral and valenced pictures. According to the temporal coding hypothesis of associative learning, forward, backward and simultaneous associations should be equally strong. The results provided strong support for the prediction of the temporal coding hypothesis that associations are learned equally well with forward, backward, and simultaneous arrangements of stimuli. Experiment 3 also provided support for the use of the modified version of the original affective priming task as an informative index of valence changes in a picture-picture affective learning experiment. A pilot study investigated emotional modulation of the eyeblink startle reflex and the post-auricular muscle reflex in a picture-viewing task. Although no modulation of the post-auricular reflex was found, the suitability of the eyeblink startle reflex modulation as an index of picture valence was confirmed &#150; the reflex was potentiated during unpleasant pictures relative to pleasant pictures. In the context of conditioning, eyeblink startle responses are facilitated during a cue that predicts an aversive event. Experiment 4a replicated the fear-potentiated startle effect in a differential conditioning procedure with a neutral picture as a cue for an unpleasant electrocutaneous stimulus. Experiment 4b investigated eyeblink startle modulation during anticipation of pleasant or unpleasant pictures. Facilitation of eyeblink startle was found during cues that predicted a pleasant or unpleasant stimulus, thus potentiated startle during anticipation of a salient stimulus appeared to reflect attentional rather than emotional processes. Experiment 5 aimed to replicate the findings of Experiment 4b in a picturepicture affective conditioning procedure in which positive and negative valence were conditioned concurrently. The pattern of eyeblink startle modulation during cues in the acquisition and extinction phases was not congruent with an emotional or attentional account of reflex modulation. Experimental designs better suited to investigating modulation of eyeblink startle during affective learning were suggested for future studies. Overall, the present collection of studies consistently demonstrated significant affective conditioning of positive valence that was not affected by the concurrent conditioning of negative valence or the temporal sequence of the stimuli. In addition, no evidence for emotional modulation of the startle reflex during valenced cues was found &#150; in variance with the fear-potentiated startle interpretation favoured in previous aversive conditioning studies. Thus, by extending the scope of human conditioning analysis to include pleasure learning, this thesis provides new insights into emotional processes within associative learning paradigms.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158629</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population diversity, sources and evaluation of metalaxyl-based management of pythium damping-off of cucumber in Oman</field><field name="creator">Al-Sa'di, Abdullah Mohammed</field><field name="description">This study was undertaken to identify Pythium species causing damping-off of cucumber in Oman, to characterize diversity in Pythium species, to identify the potential sources of Pythium inoculum in greenhouses and to evaluate the efficacy of metalaxyl in management of damping-off disease. A survey in 2004 and 2005 characterized Pythium aphanidermatum (77% of isolations), P. spinosum (22%) and P. splendens (1%) to be the pathogens associated with damping-off of cucumber in Oman, with the latter two being first reports in Oman. P. aphanidermatum was isolated from all districts in Oman during different times of the year and was generally aggressive at 25 and 30JC. However, the P. spinosum distribution was limited to seven out of 13 districts surveyed, isolated more during cooler months of the year and was found to be more aggressive at relatively lower temperatures (25JC). The second part of the thesis dealt with characterizing genetic diversity using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP) fingerprinting in the predominant species P. aphanidermatum. Isolates of P. aphanidermatum from muskmelon in Oman and from different hosts in the USA and Norway were included in the study. The study revealed that P. aphanidermatum populations in greenhouses in Oman consist of a large number of different phenotypes with generally a high level of genetic similarity (mean = 96.6%), which suggested the introduction of P. aphanidermatum in greenhouses via multiple sources. A high number of identical phenotypes were recovered between muskmelon and cucumber fields in the same area compared to the small number of identical phenotypes recovered across different regions. Quantitative population analysis using AMOVA and FST values supported the hypothesis of frequent movement of P. aphanidermatum inoculum between fields in the same area compared to limited circulation between geographically separated areas. Variation was also found between different isolates in aggressiveness on cucumber and muskmelon, but no host specialization was found. Investigating genetic diversity in 24 isolates of P. spinosum from different regions in Oman revealed that the population consists of a small number of phenotypes sharing a very high level of genetic similarity (L 99%). This was suggested to be due to the recent introduction of P. spinosum in Oman via a common source. All P. aphanidermatum and P. spinosum isolates were found to be highly sensitive to metalaxyl (EC50 &lt; 1 Ng ml-1), which indicates that no resistance had developed among populations of these two species to metalaxyl. Further experiments into the potential sources of Pythium species in greenhouses in Oman revealed that Pythium species can be introduced into greenhouses via contaminated soil previously cultivated with crops other than cucumber on which greenhouses are established. Other avenues for the introduction of inoculum include uncultivated soil introduced into greenhouses, soil left in the greenhouse after excluding the top 30 to 60 cm of old soil, potting mixtures and soil adhering to irrigation pipes, growers&#146; shoes and cultivation equipment. No Pythium inoculum was detected in irrigation water or organic fertilizers. Correlation analysis based on existing field observations indicated that the practice of soil replacement is efficient in reducing inoculum density and damping-off levels in greenhouses (P &lt; 0.01). The final part of this thesis dealt with identifying factors associated with decreased efficacy of metalaxyl to manage damping-off of cucumber. The study evaluated the contribution of three main factors to the problem: development of resistance to metalaxyl in the pathogen population, timing of metalaxyl application by growers and the rate of metalaxyl biodegradation in greenhouse soils. A survey over six growing seasons showed that growers lost up to 14.6% of seedlings under the use of metalaxyl, with mortality being high in the warmer seasons compared to the cooler seasons. All Pythium isolates were found to be highly sensitive to metalaxyl (EC50 &lt; 1 Ng ml-1). Over 57% of growers in Oman were found to delay metalaxyl application in greenhouses until up to four days following transplanting; this action significantly increased seedling mortality during the first week following transplanting compared with metalaxyl application before transplanting. Pre-transplanting treatment with metalaxyl was found in greenhouse experiments to be superior in reducing seedling mortality during this period compared to application following transplanting. However, the re-appearance of damping-off symptoms 9 to 14 days after initial suppression at the time of transplanting was found to be associated with a rapid rate of metalaxyl biodegradation in greenhouses experiencing re-appearance of damping-off symptoms. The half life of metalaxyl in soil was found to have a negative correlation with the number of seasons of metalaxyl use, where the half life of metalaxyl dropped from 93 days in greenhouse soil with no previous history of metalaxyl use to 14 days in greenhouse soil in which metalaxyl was used for eight consecutive seasons. Following up the first treatment of metalaxyl at the time of transplanting with a second treatment eight days after transplanting was found to reduce the appearance of the second phase of damping-off in greenhouses suffering from enhanced rate of metalaxyl biodegradation. Information generated from these studies helped to understand the nature of dampingoff of cucumber in greenhouses in Oman and provided the foundation for the development and implementation of management strategies which would enable growers to minimize the incidence of damping-off.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158422</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling thickness in a stratiform deposit using joint simulation techniques</field><field name="creator">Eggins, Ronald George</field><field name="description">The estimated economic value of a stratiform mineral deposit is often very sensitive to the modelling of thickness in a conformable sequence of beds. A coregionalisation model of thickness expresses the assumed underlying spatial relationships of bedding thickness on a regional scale. Joint simulation of thickness directly models the cross-correlation of bedding thickness in such a model. Many of the current techniques of joint simulation are limited in the number of variables that can be simulated due to the multiplicative increase in processing times, based on the number of variables and number of samples simulated. To minimise processing times some methods make use of simplifying assumptions on the coregionalisation model. For example the Markov model, in which the dependence of one variable on the other is limited to the collocated data, would be unlikely to apply to the thickness of conformable bedding in a stratiform deposit. Transforming the thickness variables to remove correlation, simulating, and then back transforming to original data space offered a possible solution. The Minimum/Maximum Autocorrelation Factor (MAF) technique was chosen as one most likely to successfully decorrelate numbers of thickness variables, if the assumptions regarding a two-structure linear coregionalisation model were reasonably satisfied by the sampled data. The assumptions are that a simple intrinsic model of coregionalisation can represent both a lower correlation (&#145;noise&#146;) component and a higher correlation (&#145;signal&#146;) component of the modelled data. This implies that the final coregionalisation model (noise plus signal) is made up of linear combinations of a single basic structure at different spatial scales. In a number of previous applications, this had not proved to be a particularly restrictive requirement of the model. The decorrelated variables can be independently simulated, and back transformed twice; firstly using a MAF back-transformation to obtain correlated Gaussian variables, and finally to original data space. The McArthur River silver/lead/zinc stratiform deposit in the Northern Territory of Australia was chosen as the case study because it had many of the characteristics needed to test and evaluate the MAF technique in a typical stratiform deposit. The orebody model contained seventeen (17) mineralised units forming a conformable sequence which had varying thickness and degrees of mineralisation, and which had good continuity across the deposit. Cross-correlation between the thicknesses of the seventeen stratigraphic units was significant. The deposit was heavily folded in certain areas and true thickness of the bedding was calculated from drillhole log data, and used for the simulation studies. A simple unfolding algorithm was utilised to effectively flatten the deposit to allow the application of 2-D simulation techniques. Drillhole intersections often did not contain the full stratigraphic sequence of beds due to a series of normal faults criss-crossing the deposit. Therefore, incomplete data in the drillhole would need to be removed from the data set, or the number of beds in the joint simulation would need to be reduced, to utilise the MAF technique. A method was developed and validated for the generation of missing thicknesses at a sample point which removed the requirement to delete real incomplete sub-sets of the data when utilising MAF. Sequential Gaussian Simulation (SGS) was used to simulate the MAF decorrelated variables under the assumption that the multi-Gaussian assumptions held. Bedding surface simulations were generated by the addition of true thickness perpendicular to a basal reference surface. The 2-D joint simulations of thicknesses and surfaces were considered successful within a domain of the deposit where drillholes were approximately perpendicular to bedding after unfolding. The univariate, bivariate and spatial statistics of the original thickness data were reproduced accurately in the joint simulation model, including the crossvariograms of original thickness; especially compared to those obtained using independent simulation of thickness. It was concluded that the techniques could be successfully applied to other stratiform deposits if the recommended validation steps were carried out. No further difficulties should be encountered in applying the method to 2-D joint simulation of grades in a stratiform deposit. The full 3-D joint simulation of variables in any deposit using MAF would be assisted by the technique to generate missing variables at a point.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260100 Geology</field><field name="subject">780104 Earth sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158312</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The efficiency and effectiveness of microfinance: evidence from programs of non-governmental organisations in Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Nghiem, Hong Son</field><field name="description">Financial services have long been recognised as having an important role in economic development. However, more than one billion poor people in the world are still excluded from the formal financial systems because they are considered to have a high default rate and because the transaction costs associated with servicing them are high relative to the expected return. Economic theories that relate to this outcome include the information asymmetry between borrowers and lenders and the diseconomies of scale in providing small loans. Microfinance services mainly address this issue by using jointliability lending and peer monitoring to replace physical collateral and to reduce the delivery and monitoring costs. Since the mid 1970s, microfinance has emerged from a grassroots movement to become a global industry, serving about 70 million clients in 40 countries in the world (Harris, 2005). The industry has attracted attention and support from major development agencies such as the United Nations and even private investors such as the Citibank Group. Despite the rapid development of the microfinance industry, many poor people still lack reliable access to financial services. One way to increase the outreach of microfinance on a sustainable basis is to improve both effectiveness and efficiency of financial service delivery. However, in the context of microfinance, there is an absence of comprehensive research on these two issues - a gap which this study aims to address. This thesis contributes to the literature by introducing a conceptual framework of efficiency and effectiveness analysis that describes the relationship between components of microfinance programs and the operating environment. Regarding the efficiency aspect, this study suggests using the production frontier approach to efficiency measurement in preference to the traditional accounting ratio approach, which is unable to properly accommodate the complex nature of microfinance services. In addition, the former approach represents a total factor productivity measure whilst the latter provides only a partial measurement of productivity. The concept of effectiveness analysis in this study is based on an assessment of direct and intended effects of microfinance, rather than measuring the more distant changes that are often included in microfinance impact studies. In addition, it is practical for effectiveness assessment to focus on examining effects at household and individual levels because it may take some time for effects at wider levels to occur. It is emphasised that rural households play both roles of consumers and producers, therefore one should examine microfinance effects under various aspects (e.g., income, consumption and poverty reduction), given the fungibility of money. An institutional survey of microfinance programs and a household survey of client and non-client households were conducted to shed light on those issues. Also, semi-structured interviews and other participatory rural appraisal techniques such as group discussions were also conducted with key stakeholders. Empirical results regarding efficiency show that there remains some potential for microfinance programs to improve, as their average technical efficiency score is 75 per cent. That is, they can reduce the input quantity by 25 per cent while maintaining the current level of outputs. The second stage regressions suggest that the efficiency of microfinance programs decreases as they become more mature, which is in contrast to the conceptual expectation. It is hypothesised that the departure of clients to other financial institutions as they escaped poverty and the difficulties associated with serving extremely poor clients may contribute to this outcome. In terms of effectiveness, the econometric analysis of household welfare revealed that access to microfinance provides insignificant contribution to the income and consumption of member households. However, microfinance programs contributed positively to poverty reduction using the both national and international poverty lines. In addition, participating in microfinance programs is likely to improve the skills and confidence of members in using financial services with an increase in both frequency and volumes of transactions. In addition, the contribution of microfinance to household welfare is modest when compared to the contribution of other important factors such as productive land, physical capital and education. This study proposes three main policy recommendations. Firstly, given the insigmfkant contribution of microfinance in comparison with other factors, better coordination between microfinance schemes and other development programs is needed. This also suggests that extremely poor people should be covered by a social safety net while microfinance programs continue to be required to operate on a sustainable basis. Secondly, there is a need for the Vietnamese government to define clearly the role they see microfinance playing in the future. At present, policies appear as an awkward mix of objectives, some of which are mutually exclusive. Thirdly, the promotion of experience sharing among NMPs is beneficial for the improvement of their operational efficiency.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158630</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the Effectiveness of the Forest Nursery Industry in Leyte Province, the Philippines</field><field name="creator">Gregorio, Nestor-Onting</field><field name="description">The decentralized management of forest resources has been viewed as the best alternative to the much criticized government-initiated resource management approach. In the Philippines, policies and programs geared towards the sustainable development of forest resources currently focus on promoting the people-based, multiple-use oriented small-scale forestry. Nonetheless, the pace of scaling up the smallholder forestry is hampered by several constraints, one of which is the shortage of planting stock and use of low quality planting materials. The aim of this research has been to identify potentially sound alternatives that would be instrumental in improving the availability of high quality planting stock for a wide range of tree species to smallholder tree farmers. To address this aim, a study was undertaken on the forestry nursery industry of Leyte Province in the Philippines. The research process was carried out with the focus of: (1) understanding the production schemes and management systems adopted by individual, communal and government nurseries and the operational effectiveness of each nursery group in supplying the planting stock requirement of smallholder tree farmers; (2) identifying the factors that influence the production of the nursery industry and the extent that these factors influence the effectiveness of operation among the three major nursery groups; and (3) designing alternatives to improve the operational effectiveness of the nursery industry to ensure a sustainable supply of high quality planting materials of various species to smallholders. The study applies the systems approach and findings are based on qualitative and quantitative data that were derived through various methods, including personal interviews of nursery operators and other stakeholders, survey and observation, actual measurements of seedling quality parameters, focus group discussions and archival research. A Bayesian Belief Network of the Leyte nursery industry was developed based on the data set that was generated and from the result of data analysis. The model was used to simulate and analyse the operational effectiveness of the nursery industry system to provide insights of the system behaviour to inform policy makers about measures for improving the operational effectiveness of the nursery industry. The model was refined and validated to ensure the reliability of the result of the system analysis. The nursery industry in Leyte Province is not well-organized and the operation is hampered by a combination of social, economic, technical and extension constraints. The individual nursery group which occupies the greatest proportion of the nursery sector in terms of population and probably the volume of seedlings used in small-scale forestry, is operating with scarce resources and only a low level of assistance from supporting agencies. Support measures have been focused on nurseries managed by community organizations; however, the support has not encouraged the community organizations to become self-supporting. In general, few of the community organizations have sustained their nursery operation in spite of the obvious need for planting stock. Government nurseries provide seedlings to smallholders but the uptake has been hampered by factors including high transportation cost, inappropriate species choice, and the requirement of documentation proving land ownership in accessing the free seedlings. Scaling up the operational effectiveness of the nursery industry requires a coordinated operation among the three nursery groups. Each nursery group possesses the attributes that complement the shortcomings of the other nursery categories. While decentralized nursery management is widely perceived as the best alternative of reaching smallholders with planting stock, transferring the seedling production to smallholder nurseries needs a strong collaboration with the government nursery group. Further, a close coordination between nurseries within the same group is essential to facilitate the flow of resources from one nursery to another. Recognizing the current operation scenario of the nursery system, it is imperative for the government nursery group to refine its objectives, operating schemes, types of assistance provided to smallholders and means of extending the support and make it attuned to the needs and constraints of the smallholder nursery group. Provision of training, which is normally the form of assistance provided by supporting agencies to the smallholder nursery group, may help sustain the operation of smallholder nurseries, however, a continuous supply of germplasm and a favourable seedling market condition are found to be highly important for sustaining the operation and improving the effectiveness of smallholder nurseries.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158423</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial abuse and older people with impaired capacity: A secondary analysis of Tribunal files</field><field name="creator">McCawley, Anne-Louise</field><field name="description">The management of the financial assets of older people is of increasing concern to researchers, practitioners and policy-makers as older people seek to self provide for long periods of retirement, conserve assets for user charges and ensure choice in accommodation, health and lifestyle. This research is part of a broader research project funded by the Australian Research Council that explores and describes the prevalence and practices of non-professional asset management for and on behalf of older people. This thesis focuses upon abusive asset management practices in relation to a vulnerable group of older people with impaired capacity. Despite the vulnerability of this particular group of older people to financial abuse, research in the area is still under-developed. The exploratory and descriptive research design is based on an analysis of data from 234 cases heard by the Guardianship and Administration Tribunal in Queensland, Australia in 2002/3. Access to the Tribunal files enabled an exploration of a usually hidden form of elder abuse and afforded a rich source of data. The research questions explore the nature and extent of financial abuse processes; the concerns that bring financial abuse of older people with impaired capacity to the attention of the Tribunal; the characteristics of the older person that makes them vulnerable to financial abuse; the processes of asset management associated with such abuse and the characteristics and practices of the abuser. The analysis identifies two types of case &#150; suspected financial abuse and non-financial abuse cases. Bi-variate and multi-variate analysis (logistic regression) seeks to determine statistically significant differences between the two types of case and the relationships between the ranges of variables identified from the elder abuse literature. The text in the Tribunal files is used to illustrate aspects of the quantitative data. Suspected financial abuse was identified in about 26% (n=60) of the Tribunal cases sampled. It was noted that financial abuse could occur inadvertently from lack of knowledge about proper asset management practices as well as intentionally. Abuse cases were commonly referred to the Tribunal after financial abuse had occurred and the abuse was noticed usually as a result of some unusual behaviour or conflict that made the application-maker pay closer attention to the older person. Financial abuse happened, irrespective of gender, age, type of impaired capacity, marital status and location (community/care facility) of the older person with impaired capacity. Having access to the older person&#146;s assets, not access to the older person was of primary importance for financial abuse to occur. Close family, particularly adult children, were the predominant financial abusers. Formal arrangements to manage assets such as the Enduring Power of Attorney did not protect the older person from financial abuse and in fact, was the means used to perpetrate the financial abuse in some of the financial abuse cases. Care is taken to limit generalisations to the population of interest: older people with impaired capacity who come to the attention of the Tribunal. These findings challenge some current understandings in the literature about such abuse and highlight the limitations of existing policies, practices and theoretical approaches. Routine Activities theory is proposed as useful for theorising this type of elder abuse and for developing appropriate interventions. A multi-level framework of individual, structural, legal and social responses that cater for the prevention, detection and, if needed, the deterrence of financial abuse is suggested. Recommendations for such policy and practice interventions focus upon the three levels of preventing financial abuse, detecting it and responding to it. Different recommendations are suggested for the different types of financial abuse that emerged from the Tribunal data. Some strategies proposed include raising community awareness about good asset management practices and clarifying who owns the older person&#146;s assets; encouraging family asset managers to use appropriate asset management practices by providing easily accessible education and training; the development of consistent and collaborative protocols and training for aged care workers in relation to preventing, detecting, monitoring and responding to suspected financial abuse; the proposal for the establishment of dedicated protective service workers; encouraging financial institutions to become engaged in monitoring for financial abuse and reviewing current policies in relation to the lack of safeguards surrounding the Enduring Power of Attorney.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158313</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Query Answering for Multiple Complex Resources: Description Logic in the Semantic Web Context</field><field name="creator">Pothipruk, Pakornpong</field><field name="description">The Semantic Web is a collection of many different data pages. It is still unclear how to answer a query posed on the Semantic Web using formal methods. Currently, the main approach to the above problem is addressed by description logics. However, description logics treat the Semantic Web as a single assertional knowledge base, based on a single ontology. In general, many web pages are irrelevant for a given query. Consequently, data retrieval services in description logic systems can be inefficiency if straightforward retrieval algorithms are chosen. In this work, we propose a space reduction methodology to address this issue. In particular, we develop techniques aimed at the reduction of the search space a description logic reasoning algorithm needs to take into account for answering a query. To reduce the search space, we need to be able to identify: 1) the dependency between pairs of Semantic Web data sources in order to maintain soundness of reasoning, and 2) the data sources which are fully irrelevant. Thus we need a way to determine whether a data source is relevant with respect to a query. Consequently, each data source must be associated with its source description. We propose a specification of source description and show how it can be used to reduce the reasoning search space. It has been argued that reasoning on the Semantic Web will benefit from the addition of rule systems to description logics. Accordingly, we specify how to combine rule systems, in particular defeasible logic, to description logics, and compare the expressivity of the rule system and the description logic system. We choose defeasible logic since, to the best of our knowledge, it is the only nonmonotonic reasoner that can operate in PTime. A nonmonotonic rule system gives us the ability to handle incomplete information in an easier way than description logic systems. We also extend the proposed space reduction method to the logic resulting from the combination of defeasible and description logic, defeasible description logic (DDL). The results from this PhD research allow one to find the answer of a complex query from a description logic-based, single ontology, Semantic Web system. Furthermore, the efficiency of description logic-based query answering also benefit from this research, and so the efficiency of rule-over description logic-based query answering.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158314</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Obesity and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy : associations with immediate pregnancy outcomes and long term maternal health</field><field name="creator">Callaway, Leonie</field><field name="description">Maternal obesity is associated with a wide range of maternal, neonatal and obstetric complications, and is arguably the leading factor associated with high risk pregnancies in the developed world. In particular, there is a strong relationship between obesity and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). The mechanisms underlying this relationship have not been fully elucidated, but our understanding of this relationship has been assisted by examining the long term prognosis of women with HDP. Given the importance of obesity as a risk factor for HDP and other complications, preconception care is a critical element in addressing this major public health issue. A detailed review of the literature relating to these issues is presented in Chapter 1 of this thesis. The aims of this thesis were to: 1. Describe the prevalence and impact of overweight and obesity in an Australian obstetric cohort. 2. Examine the relationship between HDP and obesity, by examining the changes in body mass index (BMI) over time comparing women who did or did not have HDP in an index pregnancy. 3. Examine the relationship between HDP and obesity - associated disease, by examining the long term risk of diabetes in women with and without HDP. 4. Identify potential barriers to the preconception management of overweight and obesity, by assessing, in early pregnancy, women&#146;s knowledge regarding the risks of overweight and obesity in pregnancy and associated health care behaviors. The prevalence and impact of overweight and obesity on maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes in an Australian obstetric population is presented in Chapter 2 (1). This retrospective cohort study of 14 230 women based on the obstetric database at the Mater Mother&#146;s Hospital in Brisbane found that 4809 (34%) of these women were overweight or obese. Overweight and obese women had an increased risk of HDP, gestational diabetes, prolonged hospital admission and caesarean section. Neonates born to obese women had an increased risk of birth defects and hypoglycaemia. Neonates born to morbidly obese women were at increased risk of intensive care nursery admission, premature delivery prior to 34 weeks gestation and jaundice. This study confirmed that overweight and obesity are common in the Australian obstetric context, and that this has important implications for the delivery of obstetric care in Australia. Next, the long term association between HDP and obesity was examined. This work is presented in Chapter 3 (2). Although obesity is an important risk factor for HDP, most cases of HDP occur in women of normal weight. It was hypothesized that women who developed HDP might have a propensity to gain weight, despite being of normal weight at the time of their affected pregnancy. Change in BMI over time was assessed in a cohort of women with and without HDP. Data was obtained from 3,572 women who received antenatal care at the Mater Mother&#146;s Hospital in Brisbane and who were followed for 21 years, as part of the prospective longitudinal Mater University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy (MUSP). This study showed that HDP are associated with increased weight gain over 21 years and raised the question of whether insulin resistance is a key mechanism underpinning the relationship between obesity and HDP. Given the potential role of insulin resistance in the relationship between obesity and HDP, the longitudinal relationship between HDP and self reported diabetes 21 years postpartum was examined. This study is described in Chapter 4(3). Data was obtained from a cohort of 3639 women who were followed prospectively as part of the MUSP. This study confirmed that HDP are associated with an increased rate of reported diagnosis of diabetes 21 years postpartum. Based on the work presented in Chapter 2 and the importance of obesity in pathogenesis of HDP, addressing overweight and obesity prior to conception is an important issue. To identify potential barriers in dealing with the problem of overweight and obesity prior to pregnancy, a survey of 412 consecutive unselected women in early pregnancy was conducted. The results of this work are presented in Chapter 5. Several issues were identified. Overweight and obese women tended to rate their BMI in a lower category. In addition, there was poor adherence with routine preconception health recommendations, inadequate uptake of preconception health checks and failed attempts at weight loss. This survey identified that there is potential to improve the advice that overweight and obese women are given regarding weight loss prior to pregnancy. In conclusion, obesity is a common and important problem for pregnant women and their offspring both in Australia and globally. It is associated with a broad range of serious complications. A clear causal relationship between obesity and HDP has not been definitively established, although longitudinal studies such as those presented in this thesis suggest a strong association between the two conditions and will hopefully assist in broadening our understanding this relationship. Identifying barriers to dealing with overweight and obesity prior to pregnancy is an important first step towards reducing the adverse health impacts of this condition, both for mothers and their babies. 1.

The findings of that project, together with subsequent government policy initiatives, focused attention on a need to enhance intellectual &#145;demandingness&#146; in education and on ways to improve the quality of teaching, learning and assessment in schools. One of the most significant government responses to those findings has been the Productive Pedagogies initiative, the principles of which are now well established in the Queensland state education system. While music teachers were not involved in the joint research project, they are expected to address the issues raised by the reform process. The place of music in Productive Pedagogies is problematic, however, especially in the area of intellectual quality. Productive Pedagogies is based on a theoretical rationale that identified four dimensions and 20 elements of productive pedagogy to provide a model for classroom teaching and learning practice. It is uncertain whether that model takes into account the essential nature of learning in music or supports the processes and behaviours that may enhance intellectual quality and higher-order thinking in music. The purpose of this study was to investigate intellectual &#145;demandingness&#146; in music and the extent to which the beliefs, assumptions and pedagogical practices of classroom music teachers may foster the development of higher-order thinking in music students. The study used a methodological framework based on two separate studies: a survey to seek the opinions of Queensland classroom music teachers on aspects of music education, with a particular focus on pedagogy and higher-order thinking in music; and a classroom observation project that was closely aligned with the materials and methodology used in the Queensland School Reform Longitudinal Study. The classroom observation project involved 20 teachers of music classes from Year 6 (students aged 10-11 years approximately) to Year 10 (students aged 15-16 years approximately). These teachers were interviewed, asked to complete a survey about their pedagogical goals, and were observed in their classroom music lessons. The survey and the classroom observation project were connected through reference points and key issues that were drawn from a review of research literature in the fields of child development, educational psychology, cognitive psychology and music cognition. This study identifies a need for education policy documents that embrace both domain-specific and domain-general knowledge and skills in the pedagogical models that are promoted for use in schools. It advocates the development of music curriculum documents that recognise and support the thinking skills that are essential to music. The study also identifies a gap between research and teaching practice in knowledge about higher-order thinking and how it may be developed. It highlights the importance of developing strong links between researchers and classroom teachers in order to gain a clearer understanding of the relationship between the development of higher-order thinking and teaching practice in the acquisition of music literacy and the development of aural musicianship skills. This has significant implications for teacher training and professional development programs. Findings of this study identify a pressing need for further investigation into effective pedagogical practices in music that are informed by research from the fields of music cognition and developmental psychology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158424</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">STRATEGIES OF CULTURAL TRANSFER IN SUBTITLING AND DUBBING</field><field name="creator">Ramiere, Nathalie</field><field name="description">This dissertation investigates the notion of cultural transfer in film translation. It offers a detailed analysis of the strategies used for the translation of culture-specific references (CSRs) in two contemporary French comedies both subtitled and dubbed for several English-speaking markets (the U.S., the U.K. and Australia): Ast&#233;rix et Ob&#233;lix contre C&#233;sar (directed by Claude Zidi and released in 1999) and Le d&#238;ner de cons (directed by Francis Veber and released in 1998). Particular emphasis is placed on the role played by various contextual factors in influencing the choice of translation strategies and the audience&#146;s process of interpretation with a view to challenging standard approaches to the question of cultural references in translation. Developing a better understanding of the cultural issues at stake in the transfer of a film to a foreign audience is of crucial importance to ensure that this process is successful &#150; a growing concern in an era when more and more money is invested in the production and international distribution of films. The objective of this study is to analyse the way in which culturally bound references are dealt with in audiovisual translation (AVT), a particular mode of translation characterised by specific technical constraints as well as the interplay of various verbal and nonverbal signs. Whereas a relatively large body of research exists on the translation of CSRs in fictional and non-fictional texts, the issue has not been explored in depth in the particular context of AVT. One of the objectives of this dissertation is therefore to determine whether the models proposed in the literature to describe the relations between &#145;source culture&#146; and &#145;target culture&#146; in translation (particularly the influential foreignisation/domestication model) are applicable to the context of the present corpus and, by extension, to that of AVT. Given the specificities of subtitling and dubbing, both in terms of semiotic nature and their representation of &#145;the Foreign&#146;, particular consideration is given to the way(s) in which these two modes of screen translation differ in their treatment of CSRs. Moreover, by comparing various versions of two films which can be contrasted with regard to their target audience, type of humour, historical/geographical setting and overseas reception while both belonging to one of the most culturally embedded genres &#150; comedy &#150; the study aims to explore the complexity of the contextual factors at stake in the cross-cultural transfer of film and to determine whether certain translation procedures are used with more regularity than others. The methodology used to carry out this study consists in a close comparative analysis of the strategies used for the translation of CSRs and their textual effects in the original, subtitled and dubbed versions of the two comedies. As a result of a decision to ensure the multi-level contextualisation of each example, the analyses of only these two films are presented in the thesis although the project initially involved four comedies. Particular attention is given to contextual factors such as the linguistic co-text and polysemiotic context, but also broader factors such as the film genre, target audience, distribution issues, etc. with a view to highlighting the nature of the problems that CSRs present in context. This approach also makes it possible to avoid microlevel and decontextualised analyses which have proved unproductive in other studies on the translation of culture-bound material. Finally, an overall semiotic approach is adopted to stress the relationships between the various filmic signs (rather than simply between the &#145;source film&#146; and the &#145;target film&#146;) and the multidimensional nature of what is commonly referred to simply as &#145;the context&#146;. The analyses indicate that a certain number of regularities can be observed in the way that CSRs are translated in subtitling and dubbing. In particular, three priorities which appear to be set by screen translators were identified: humour, coherence and comprehensibility. However, striking inconsistencies with regard to hypothetical correlations between the translation strategies used and certain specific factors were also revealed. This paradox is discussed in the conclusion of the thesis. The second finding concerns the complexity of contextual factors at play in AVT (e.g. technical and semiotic constraints, but also polysemiotic feedback provided by the various filmic signs, coherence between the scenes, film genre, audience targeted, and so on), forcing screen translators to adopt a pragmatic approach consisting in weighing up competing constraints on a case-by-case basis. The foreignisation/domestication model, which has been acclaimed as a powerful tool in Translation Studies, is also shown not to apply convincingly to the translation of culturally bound references in AVT, nor to reflect the way in which CSRs are dealt with in, respectively, subtitling (commonly described as &#145;foreignising&#146;) and dubbing (seen as &#145;domesticating&#146;). More specifically, the multidimensional contextualisation of the examples carried out in the analyses reveals that the notion of context, or rather &#145;contexts&#146;, is key in influencing translators&#146; decision-making process and viewers&#146; process of interpretation, particularly in the case of culture-specific references. This research highlights that, instead of focusing on &#145;losses in translation&#146; as is still often the case in the academic literature and in viewers&#146; comments, it is far more productive to take compensation issues into account and to emphasise that cultural transfer in cinema involves in fact a sophisticated process of recontextualisation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158633</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Ultraviolet Radiation in Molecular Pathways to Melanoma</field><field name="creator">Hacker, Elke</field><field name="description">A great deal of cancer research is aimed at describing the precise mechanisms that allow cells to become transformed. Many genes have been associated with melanoma and the majority of the functions of these genes pertain to three pathways Ras/Raf/MAPK, Ink4a/Cdk4-cyclin/pRb and ARF/Mdm2/p53. Over-expression of Hras in melanocytes, combined with a single neonatal UVR dose is sufficient to induce melanoma in pigmented mice. These lesions were small in situ cutaneous melanomas. To assess the role of the pRb pathway in melanoma mice, over expressing Hras were combined with activated Cdk4 mutants. These animals develop melanoma spontaneously, with a penetrance of 58%, which rose to 83% after neonatal ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Furthermore, the entire UVRtreated cohort that developed melanoma had multiple cutaneous lesions and 92% had metastatic tumours. In this model Hras activation alone is sufficient to predispose melanocytes to UVR-induced transformation, while mutant Cdk4 is more important for tumour progression, producing larger more aggressive, metastatic melanomas. To further assess the Ink4a/Cdk4-cyclin/pRb pathway in this disease a melanocytespecific deletion of the Rb1 gene was constructed. This model allowed for the culturing of Rb1-null melanocytes. Rb1-null melanocytes were studied and found to proliferate more rapidly than controls and to have a decreased requirement for mitogens. Expression arrays were performed to identify differences between the small in situ TPras lesions and those more aggressive Cdk4[superscript]R24C/R24C/TPras melanomas. We observed up regulation of Tcfeb, Ednrb, Tcfap2b and Gpr155 and down regulation of Plagl1 in Cdk4[superscript]R24C/R24C/TPras lesions. The overlay of expression and aCGH analysis showed dysfunction of various genes that are involved in regulating p53 and DNA repair pathways in the Cdk4[superscript]R24C/R24C/TPras tumours (Plagl1, Abcc10, Hsp90aa1 and Htatip). We also observed aberrations of several genes that regulate p21 (E2F2 and Htatip) and identified several potential markers of melanoma progression (Pax7, Dpp3, cdc42, Fgf22, Nme2, Esm1, Ednrb, Mum1 and Notch4). We also identified several genetic changes in Cdk4[superscript]R24C/R24C/TPras tumours that were specific to either UVR-induced or spontaneously derived lesions and identified a number of candidate genes (Hsp90aa1, Gzmk, Esm1, Bop1, Rapgef3, Htatip and Dpp3). This study has identified numerous novel candidate genes and also confirmed the importance of various melanoma-associated genes in this disease.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158315</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Froth recovery measurements in large industrial flotation cells</field><field name="creator">Alexander, Daniel John</field><field name="description">The role of mathematical models and simulators in describing the performance of mineral processing applications have had a large impact in optimising existing industrial plants and designing new plants over recent years. Before the development of sophisticated computer simulators, the design engineer used industrial &#8220;rules of thumb&#8221; to estimate the size and layout of plants. However, newly designed plants after commissioning, often do not meet the design product specification requirements and quite often years of &#8220;trial and error&#8221; optimisation is required. This process can be very costly especially with froth flotation processes where the complexity of the various stages of treatment makes &#8220;trial and error&#8221; optimisation very difficult to quantify and assess the benefits. Over the past 10 years, advances in the modelling of the flotation process have been conducted by many authors. The most significant flotation modelling advances in recent years have been provided by the AMIRA (Australian Mineral Industry Research Association) P9 project, whereby a new modelling methodology has been proposed. Within this methodology, the flotation response can be represented by a number of sub-processes including parameters describing the hydrodynamic, froth and ore characteristics. Although these parameters have been proposed, methods for measuring these parameters in large flotation cells are still developing, especially in the areas of the froth zone recovery and entrainment. In the light of this it was felt that the literature on froth recovery determination should be investigated to determine the most appropriate method for measuring froth recovery in large industrial flotation cells. It was found after the investigation of the literature that three techniques for measuring the froth recovery parameter stood out as potential methods for measurement within a large scale flotation cell. These were the methods decribed by Gorain et al (1998), Vera et al (1999) and Savassi et al (1997). It was decided that all three methods should be assessed on a quantitative and qualitative basis from data collected at the Mount Isa Mines (now Xstrata) Copper flotation circuit. In this assessment, all three methods were extensively trialed in a 2.8 m3 flotation cell which was operated in parallel to the main copper rougher flotation circuit. The cell could be operated at numerous operating conditions which allowed sufficient data to be collected. The conclusions from this work were that although the method proposed by Vera et al (1999) required significant amounts of data, the method appeared to be reliable in this scale of cell. The main recommendation from this work was to further test the Vera methodology in larger industrial flotation cells. A 100 m3 Outukumpu tank cell at the Mount Keith Nickel Concentrator was chosen for the further assessment of the Vera et al (1999) methodology and its applicability to large scale cells. This flotation cell was one of the largest flotation cells operating on a production scale at the time of the testwork. Numerous tests were conducted and data collected from this investigation showed that the Vera et al (1999) technique was applicable to this scale of flotation cell. Since the work at Mount Keith was conducted in a rougher flotation cell, it was decided to test the methodology with numerous cells of various sizes and duties at the Kambalda Nickel Concentrator. As with the previous investigation at Mount Keith, it was observed that the Vera method was able to measure froth recoveries in all cells measured at Kambalda (within typical operating ranges). However, the technique was not applicable at shallow froth depths since it does not take into account the effect of the pulp-froth interface within the froth recovery parameter estimation. The pulp froth interface and close to it is where a significant proportion of dropback occurs within the froth zone. In addition to this problem, the methodology required large numbers of samples and disturbed downstream processes which made the technique unpractical for operating industrial flotation plants. Hence, a new technique for measuring froth recovery in large flotation cells was required. For the technique to be successful on an industrial scale it required the following: &#8226; minimum disturbance on the process, &#8226; take into account the pulp froth interface within the froth recovery parameter, and &#8226; require a minimum amount of samples. To meet these needs a new technique was developed based on the Savassi et al (1997) technique and combining it with recent work by authors including Vera et al (2003). The methodology involves taking samples of the feed, concentrate and tail as per a typical flotation survey and combining them with two new samples: the air hold-up sample and the top of froth sample. With the addition of these samples, a mass balance across the pulp and froth phase could be conducted and the froth recovery parameter derived. In addition, the new method provided measurements of the pulp zone average bubble load and the amount recovered by the entrainment mechanism. The proposed method has a simple procedure which allows the technique to be used by academics and mill operators alike. The proposed froth recovery measurement technique was tested in numerous cells of various types (i.e. Wemco, Outokumpu, Dorr-Oliver etc), various sizes (up to 150 m3 in size), various duties (rougher, scavenger, cleaner, recleaner, etc) and various plants. In most cases the methodology proved to be a reliable measure of the froth recovery parameter. In addition, at the Century Zinc Operation, the methodology was compared directly with the original Vera et al (1999) technique and the results showed that there was a good comparison between the results with the off-set of the pulp-froth interface. A number of contributions to both the research and industrial areas have been provided from the outcomes of the thesis. The main contributions include: &#8226; A full assessment of the three current methods for measuring the froth recovery parameter within large flotation cells. With recommendations of developing a new technique. &#8226; The development of a froth recovery measurement technique which can be used in large cells to understand the impact of the froth zone in an individual cell, use within the AMIRA P9 modelling methodology and plant diagnostics. &#8226; The new method also allows the estimation of the average bubble load and quantifies the amount of material recovered by the entrainment mechanism which is invaluable to metallurgists in assessing the performance of a flotation circuit (plant diagnostics). Finally, the results of this thesis will provide practising metallurgists both within the research and operating fields, techniques to improve the profitability of flotation circuits worldwide. Metallurgists can quickly assess the performance of large flotation cells in terms of froth performance, bubble load and entrainment which has not been available before. In addition, the results from this thesis will also allow metallurgists to mathematically represent their plant through flotation models better and improve their understanding of their flotation circuits.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">091404 Mineral Processing/Beneficiation</field><field name="subject">840399 First Stage Treatment of Ores and Minerals not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158425</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frontline Service Workers&#146; conceptualisation of their Client&#146;s Anger and how it shapes their Practice.</field><field name="creator">Bosly, Fiona Ruth</field><field name="description">Workers in the frontline of practice often work with vulnerable people and are therefore more likely to be exposed to the expression of that vulnerability. As workers they are often dealing with the powerful emotional states of their clients, of which anger is one. How they conceptualise client anger and how it shapes their practice has important implications both for themselves and their clients. This thesis explores these questions and seeks to understand how frontline workers manage client anger and how they use that information in their practice. This exploratory and descriptive piece of research is based on eight interviews with frontline service workers from Centacare, a non-government community agency. Respondents were drawn from a range of services offered by Centacare which included family violence prevention programs, counselling, relationship education and employment services. Frontline workers understanding of client anger is varied and complex and is consistent with the literature on current understanding about anger and its purpose. Workers could also distinguish between client&#146;s abusive or respectful use of anger. However, a number of implications for practice emerged from the research. When working with client anger, the need for supervision was highlighted as a means of assisting workers to debrief and professionally develop their skills. Some workers who did not have access to these processes experienced a rise in their levels of anxiety, for a variety of reasons. Some workers were better able to self care in the face of client anger and were able to manage their own emotional state in ways that enhanced their practice and assisted their clients. These findings have implications for supervisors and managers who manage frontline service workers. It can provide them with an understanding of what workers may be struggling with in their role as professional helper when working with angry clients. It also had implications for educationalists in that more emphasis can be placed on focusing on the possible complexity that vulnerable clients bring to frontline human service workers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158634</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optically Induced Substrate Uptake in Giardia duodenalis</field><field name="creator">Ross, Justin Andrew</field><field name="description">A light-mediated transport pathway has been identified in the trophozoites of the human intestinal parasite Giardia duodenalis. It is manifested experimentally by the uptake of the cationic fluorophore Rhodamine 123 (Rh 123) from the background solution when exposed to intense near ultraviolet (UV) or blue-light illumination. Dye uptake was shown to be reversible, with trophozoites effluxing the dye when the illumination was removed. Efflux occurred via two main mechanisms: sequestration into vesicles which were expelled intact; and ATP-dependent direct efflux. The kinetics of the uptake and efflux of the dye were determined, with uptake being linearly dependent on the incident optical power and the extracellular dye concentration. The addition of the ATP synthetase inhibitor iodoacetic acid resulted in decreased efflux efficiency and confirmed that the dye uptake was indirectly energy-dependent through the maintenance of the membrane potential and other cellular functions. The light-mediated uptake was governed by two competing processes: charge-dependent uptake and direct efflux of the dye that could be modulated by illumination. The charge de- pendence of the uptake was illustrated by reduction of the uptake rate caused by membrane potential depletion, cellular surface charge shielding and the dramatically reduced uptake of the zwitterionic dye Rhodamine 110 (Rh 110). The effect of varying the extracellular pH resulted in an asymmetric pH profile about the optimum value of pH 6.8 due to the intrin- sic relationship between pH and membrane potential in Giardia trophozoites. Preliminary experiments into the effect of the extracellular solution were made using microfluidic flow cells. The optical activation spectrum of the uptake was determined using a custom modified single-photon and multi-photon confocal microscope. This apparatus provided simultaneous and independent activation of the light-mediated uptake and excitation of rhodamine fluo- rescence. The activation spectrum of the uptake of Rh 123 featured two peaks, at (382 &amp;#177 4) nm and (502 &amp;#177 5) nm. The position of these peaks was consistent across three drug-resistant and two drug-sensitive Giardia strains but the relative amplitudes of the maxima varied from strain to strain. The activation spectrum of the uptake of Rhodamine 6G was found to be similar to that of Rh 123 but with lower amplitude. Therefore, the light mediated uptake was not dependent on a resonant energy transfer process to, or from, the dye molecule. The presence of two significant peaks in the near UV and blue was consistent with a flavin moi- ety as the chromophore, but the peak at 502 nm is red-shifted from previously investigated flavin-based chromophores. A facile method was developed to synthesise esters of Rh 110 and Rhodamine B (Rh B) with increasing lipophilicity as determined using the modified shake flask method. An assay of the uptake of these dyes with drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains showed differences in the membrane permeability of the different strains. Esters of Rh B, and Rh 110-octyl ester were not accumulated in response to light but were strongly localised within the cells in the absence of illumination. The presence of two ethyl groups attached to the amines in Rh B appeared to alter the affinity of the efflux transporter for the dye such that Rh B and its esters were not effluxed. Photoaffinity labelling using a synthesised photo-active Rh 123 derivative was applied to the trophozoites with the aim of isolating the protein responsible for the light-mediated uptake. The photoaffinity label was accumulated in response to light in the same manner as Rh 123. The photoaffinity labelled cellular fractions were investigated using steady state and time resolved fluorescence polarisation spectroscopy. The synthesised label proved to be troublesome because of its interaction with detergent micelles in solution. The unambiguous labelling of the target protein could not be confirmed but the data obtained was consistent with photoaffinity labelling membrane protein(s).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158316</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improved Yield and Application of Bacterial Cellulose Synthesized by Gluconacetobacter xylinus from Kombucha</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Vu Tuan</field><field name="description">Gluconacetobacter xylinus (Ga. xylinus) is a Gram negative bacterium which can produce an extracellular polysaccharide called bacterial cellulose. This material potentially has a wide range of applications in the food industry and other fields. In addition to fresh fruits, Kombucha, a Chinese traditional beverage fermented from tea and sugar, is also known to be one of the habitats of Ga. xylinus. Despite this, almost all previous studies on bacterial cellulose production have used Ga. xylinus strains isolated from fresh fruit sources and Kombucha strains of this species have not been extensively characterized for bacterial cellulose production. It is hypothesized that as is the subject of long-term sub-culture under static conditions, Ga. xylinus strains from Kombucha may have different cellulose producing characteristics than those typically encountered from other sources. Although bacterial cellulose has been applied in various fields, the use of bacterial cellulose thus far remains unexploited in the area of active package production. We, therefore, have undertaken this study to (i) characterize and improve cellulose production by a strain of Ga. xylinus (K3) previously isolated in our laboratory from Kombucha, (ii) develop a new application of bacterial cellulose as an active food packaging material and (iii) investigate the occurrence of spontaneous mutations in cellulose synthesis in Ga. xylinus K3 as this may impact on cellulose production. In order to characterize cellulose production by Ga. xylinus K3, cellulose yield in tea medium with both black tea and green tea, and in Hestrin-Schramm (HS) medium under both static and agitated culture, was initially compared. In tea medium the highest cellulose yield was obtained with green tea (~0.20 g l-1) rather than black tea (~0.14 g l- 1). The yield in HS was higher (~0.28 g l-1) but did not differ between static and agitated incubation. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy indicated that the cellulose produced is pure (free of acetan) and has high crystallinity, respectively. A time course study of cellulose production showed that no cell-density dependent effect was present. Subsequently, cellulose yield was improved by changing types and levels of carbon source in HS medium under static culture. An improved yield of ~2.64 g l-1 was obtained with mannitol at 20 g l-1 and corn steep liquor (CSL) at 40 g l-1 in combination. In tea medium, tea at a level of 3 g l-1 gave the highest cellulose yield and the addition of 3 g l-1 of tea to HS medium increased cellulose yield to ~3.34 g l-1. The improvements in the culture medium were directed at producing a high yield of bacterial cellulose for development of a new application of this material in the active food packaging field. In order to produce an active packaging material, bacterial cellulose pellicles produced by Ga. xylinus K3 in the improved medium had nisin incorporated in them. The active bacterial cellulose films were used in a proof-of-concept study to attempt to control Listeria monocytogenes and other bacteria on the surface of vacuum-packaged Frankfurters. Nisin incorporation studies using bacterial cellulose membranes at various moisture conditions showed that nisin bound well to wet cellulose films, but not to dried cellulose films. It was also determined that the lowest nisin concentration required was 625 IU ml-1 and shortest time needed was 6 h for production of effective active cellulose films. The active cellulose films produced in these conditions did not, however, significantly reduce (P&gt;0.05) L. monocytogenes populations on Frankfurters during refrigerated storage. As this finding was thought to be due to low concentrations of nisin, a higher concentration of nisin (2500 IU ml-1) was used and cellulose films were exposed to this nisin solution for 6 h. The resulting films significantly decreased (P&lt;0.05) L. monocytogenes counts in Frankfurters by nearly 2 log units over 14 day of storage. Both the above mentioned films showed the similar effectiveness in reducing spoilage bacteria, as measured by a Total Aerobic Plate Count (TPC), on Frankfurters. In both cases TPC levels were observed to be approximately 3.3 log units lower than in control samples after 14 day of storage. The presence and nature of spontaneous mutations in cellulose production by Ga. xylinus K3 was subsequently studied because this phenomenon has lead to a reduction of cellulose yield in other Ga. xylinus strains. Previous studies have found that spontaneous mutant formation is dependant on the growth conditions (agitated or static) of the media but not the media itself. In order to examine the presence of mutants, Ga. xylinus K3 was grown in HS medium and improved HS medium under both static and agitated conditions. It was observed that this strain generated spontaneous mutants with lower cellulose production in basic HS medium and not in improved HS medium, regardless of whether they were static or agitated cultures. This indicated that the spontaneous mutation of Ga. xylinus K3 seemed to occur depending on the type of culture medium used. Sub-culturing a colony of the mutated strain into HS medium showed that the mutants did not revert and produced a sinking pellicle of bacterial cellulose. NMR spectroscopy indicated that cellulose produced by the mutant and the parent strain had similar structural features, but the mutant cellulose had fewer fibrils as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Comparison of cellulose production of the mutant and parent strain in HS medium revealed that mutant grew faster than the parent strain but produced less cellulose, indicating that there was a trade-off between cell growth and cellulose production in the mutant. On the other hand, the mutant grew at a similar rate and produced a similar cellulose yield as the parent strain in improved HS medium. At the molecular level, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated that there were some differences in the protein patterns of the mutant and parent strains. Sequences of peptides derived from these proteins revealed that only the mutant produced deoxythymidine diphosphate (dTDP)-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5-epimerase. This enzyme is involved in acetan synthesis and thus may reduce the cellulose yield of the mutant. In conclusion, our studies extensively characterized cellulose production from a Ga. xylinus strain from Kombucha for the first time. The results indicated that this strain had independent cellulose producing characteristics which were different from previous described strains and these characteristics may be associated with its source of origin. The strain is suitable for cellulose production under static culture and cellulose yield can be improved by supplementation of the growth medium with tea. Bacterial cellulose was produced in an extremely pure form and thus shows high potential applicability. One of the potential applications of bacterial cellulose developed in this project is its use as an active packaging material for inhibition of pathogenic bacteria on the surface of food products, a potential use of this material which has so far not been exploited. It was also found that growth of Ga. xylinus K3 in nutrient poor media allowed the development of lower-cellulose-producing mutants, indicating that spontaneous mutation of the strain was different from that of previous described strains. This phenomenon was clearly related to a reduction in cellulose yield. Potential reasons for differences between mutant and the parent strains have been determined. These results provided helpful information for developing bacterial cellulose production at an industrial scale.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158635</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early prediction of outcome after hypoxic-ischaemic/reperfusion injury</field><field name="creator">Kecskes, Susanne</field><field name="description">Backaround: Moderate to severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy affects 2-4 per 1000 live babies at term and is associated with significant morbidity, such as cerebral palsy and cognitive impairment, and mortality. Potential neuroprotective strategies need to be implemented within a short time after birth. There is currently no single, reliable technique that will accurately identify babies at risk of brain damage within a few hours of birth. Much attention has been given to glutamate changes after hypoxia; however, GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system and its receptor is the target of most antiepileptic drugs. The effects of hypoxia on this important inhibitory system have not been assessed. It is important to examine whether hypoxia causes a change in neurotransmitters, as it may add to the knowledge in regards to the varying degrees of cerebral damage after a hypoxic insult. 1. To assess which combination of investigation methods are able to accurately predict outcome of asphyxiated babies within 12h of birth. 2. To determine the time course of SIOOB, NSE and IGFBPI after hypoxia in the neonatal pig model. 3. To examine the effects of hypoxia on the subunits of the neuroreceptor GABAA in neonatal pigs. Methods: a) Animal study: 24 newborn pigs were subjected to a period of hypoxia by decreasing the inspired oxygen and hypotension by decreasing the mean arterial blood pressure. Blood for IGFBPI, NSE and S100B was collected every 6h within the first 24h, and then every 24h until 72h of age. Outcome was determined at 72h by histopathology. In a subgroup of pigs, brains were collected and GABAA subunits a l , a2 and P2 measured in 4 different areas. Results of hypoxic animals were compared with those of control animals. b) Human study: 53 babies with a gestational age 235 weeks, &lt;12h of age, non reassuring fetal status, 5-minute Apgar score 5 6 or first arterial pH 57.15 and signs of moderate or severe encephalopathy were enrolled as study babies. EEG and evoked potentials were measured as soon as possible within the first 12h of birth and at 72h of age, and serum IGFBPI concentration was measured every 6h within the first 24h and then every 24h until 72h of age. In 38 control babies IGFBPI was measured with 12h and at 72h. Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed at 12 months. Results: a) Animal study: NSE and SlOOB measured in serum of hypoxic piglets increased significantly after 24 and 48h respectively and correlated with histological outcome. IGFBPI was significantly higher at 6 and 12h in hypoxic animals; the difference persisted to 72h. The distribution of GABAA subunits a l , a2 and P2 in newborn pigs showed significant regional differences. Six hours after an hypoxic insult an overall effect on isoform expression and a differential effect on expression in different regions was found. b) Human study: Twenty-five babies had adverse outcome (12 babies died, 13 babies had moderate or severe cerebral palsy). The EEG at either time had an excellent prognostic value with a high sensitivity and specificity. SEPs in term babies with perinatal asphyxia were of value, if done at &lt;12h of age and if found to be normal. SEPs had a good negative predictive value, and abnormal VEPs were highly predictive of abnormal outcome at either time point. IGFBPI at &lt;12h or 72h was not different to IGFBPI in control babies. Babies with adverse outcome had a sustained increase of IGFBPI until 24h of age, before the concentrations decrease to values comparable to healthy neonate. Multivariate logistic regression using a combination of forced entry and forward (likelihood ratio) methods showed that the combination of a delay in breathing for more than 3 minutes, a base deficit &gt;lOmEq/L and an abnormal EEG at &lt;I2 hours predicted outcome accurately in 93% of babies. Summary: A combination of established assessment tools to predict adverse outcome in asphyxiated infants has been found to be of value in this study. On their own, several risk factors were associated with adverse outcome; however, a combination of 3 tools reliably predicted outcome in 93% of babies, reinforcing the notion that it is possible to identify babies at risk of brain damage and those that may benefit from neural rescue therapies within a few hours of birth. Although serum markers of NSE, SlOOB and IGFBPI were associated with adverse outcome in newborn pigs, the increase occurred either too late for intervention or the results could not be verified in neonates. There are small changes in GABAA subunit expression after hypoxia in newborn pigs. It is unclear how these changes affect function of the GABA receptor but it may be hypothesised that hypoxia could result in aberrant neurotransmission, altered response to antiepileptic drugs and potentially altered brain function.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158426</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Dominant Discourse on News-Making Decisions in Indonesian Newspapers (A Case Study of News Coverage of the Bali Bombing of 2002)</field><field name="creator">Aziz, Syamsuddin</field><field name="description">This study is to evaluate the influence of dominant discourse on news-making decisions affecting the coverage of the Bali Bombing 2002 by the Indonesian newspapers KOMPAS, Republika, and Bali Post.

Solar keratoses (SK) are benign actinic skin tumours that are strongly associated with SCC and are thought to be precursor lesions. The main causal risk factor for both SK and SCC is ultraviolet radiation. Some researchers propose that there may be a role for HPV in skin carcinogenesis. Evidence is emerging from molecular, immunological and epidemiological studies, but to date is not conclusive. The main purpose of this thesis was to investigate the association between epidermodysplasia verruciformis associated human papillomavirus types (EV-HPV) and two types of actinic skin lesions; solar keratoses (SK) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Methods: Two parallel case control studies were designed to examine SK and SCC respectively. Cases for both studies were recruited from a large public hospital and community-based skin cancer clinics in Brisbane, Australia. Hospital-based controls were recruited from general medical and ophthalmology outpatient clinics. Controls were age- and sex-matched to cases. The SK study involved 126 cases with prevalent SK and 58 controls. The SCC study involved 64 cases with incident SCC and 65 controls. Epidemiological data on a variety of risk factors was collected by the investigator at the patient&#146;s study appointment and through the use of a self-completed questionnaire. Serum samples, normal skin biopsies and plucked eyebrow hair samples were collected from participants using standard sterile techniques. Where possible a sample of the SCC from SCC cases was also collected during surgery. Fresh tissue samples and eyebrow hairs were snap frozen using liquid nitrogen before being stored at -70&#176;C. DNA extracted from eyebrow and skin samples was amplified and tested for EV-HPV types 5, 8, 15, 20, 24, 36 and 38 using type-specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) primers. Serum samples were tested for antibodies against the L1 proteins of EV-HPV types 8, 15, 20, 24 and 38 using virus-like particle enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (VLP-ELISA). Results: A case-control analysis was performed to examine risk factors for SK and SCC such as pigmentary characteristics and UV exposure, independently of HPV status. Country of birth, propensity to sunburn and tanning ability were strongly associated with both SK and SCC after multivariate modelling. The prevalence and predictors of EV-HPV infection in a subset of healthy controls with no solar keratoses was examined. Antibodies against at least one of the EVHPV types tested were detected in 14% of the tumour-free population; EV-HPV DNA was detected in 16% of normal skin biopsies and 40% of eyebrow hair samples. Across all three biomarkers increasing age was associated with a decreased risk of EV-HPV infection. The associations between EV-HPV and SK; and EV-HPV and SCC were examined using serum antibodies, EV-HPV DNA in normal skin and EV-HPV DNA in plucked eyebrow hairs. Overall EV-HPV seropositivity was positively and significantly associated with both SK and SCC. Seropositivity against multiple EV-HPV types was also positively associated with both SK and SCC, although the association was stronger and significant for SCC. Non-significant positive associations were observed between overall EV-HPV positivity in normal skin and both SK and SCC. SK and SCC cases were slightly more likely than controls to have EV-HPV positive eyebrow hairs. Combination analyses revealed a strong synergistic relationship between EV-HPV and markers of sun-sensitive skin types (fair skin, high propensity to sunburn, inability to tan) to increase the risk of SK and SCC. The joint effect of EV-HPV and UV on the risk of SK/SCC was clearly apparent in serological analyses. This effect was greater for SCC than SK. Discussion: This thesis used a molecular epidemiological approach with multiple biomarkers to investigate the association between EV-HPV infection and SK; and EV-HPV and SCC. Further evidence to support previous literature and the hypotheses is presented. Limitations and advantages of the present project are discussed with reference to existing literature.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158317</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Awareness of multiple dimensions of insight into schizophrenia: A comparison of patients with their relatives and clinicians</field><field name="creator">Allan, John</field><field name="description">AIM: The aim of this thesis was to explore insight in schizophrenia from the perspectives of patients, relatives and clinicians. Insight scales were examined in order to collate items that were comprehensive with respect to key dimensions of insight but also sufficiently simple to allow use in everyday psychiatric practice. Background "Insight" describes the person's understanding of the nature of their mental illness. Assessment of insight for people with schizophrenia has always been an essential part of clinical practice. Often there are differences in understanding of the illness between patients, their relatives and their clinicians. Patients and relatives can feel that clinicians do not consider their views when making clinical decisions. Insight is multidimensional, more than just saying, "I have mental illness". It was postulated that the quality and range of what constitutes a lack of insight may vary according the viewpoint of the assessor. Another question was whether the scope of currently available insight scales was sufficient to encompass dimensions felt to be important to patients and relatives. The assessment of insight also has a transactional quality - the views of patients, relatives and clinicians interact in a dynamic fashion. There has been little direct assessment of the role of relatives in considering insight into psychosis, and limited consideration of the transactional nature of assessments of patient's insight. This study has a unique perspective. It looks at the assessment of patient's awareness of various dimensions of insight from three points of view patient, relative and clinician. STUDY DESIGN: Through consideration of the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of existing Insight Measures, conducting focus groups of patients and relatives, and seeking expert opinion, the candidate proposed six dimensions of insight into schizophrenia to be studied in this three-way comparison: Awareness of the presence of symptoms or a change Acknowledgement it is a mental illness Expressed intention to or acknowledgement of the need to do something about the mental illness Actively engaging in (appropriate) treatment for the mental illness Patient's awareness of effects of their mental illness on the self Patient's awareness of effects of their mental illness on other people As no existing Insight Measure catered for multiple views over all of these dimensions, a number of new measures to supplement existing measures were devised. In this study, patients (n=39) with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective disorder were assessed soon after admission to an acute psychiatry unit. They were invited to nominate a relative or significant other (n=28) who had close contact with the patient. Relatives were separately interviewed about the patient insight. The clinician's view of patient illness was assessed using Schedule for the Assessment of Insight Expanded Version (SAI-E), and the Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder (SUMD). The patient's view was assessed by the New Insight Measure for patients (New IM) and the self-rated Markova &amp; Berrios Scales. The SUMD and Markova &amp; Berrios Scales were adapted for the relative assessment of patient awareness (SUMD-rel and M&amp;Brel). Other measures assessed psychopathology (PANSS) and various clinical and demographic variables (Diagnostic Interview for Psychosis; DIP). In order to select appropriate measures for the clinician's view, the existing Insight Measures were also compared. A three-way comparison of views of patient awareness across the six dimensions was conducted. The clinical utility of all measures was considered. The measures were repeated at follow-up one year later. RESULTS: The new insight measures were generally easy to use and understood by the patients and relatives. There was some variation in scores for each of the six dimensions of insight reported by patients, relatives and clinicians indicating that they saw the dimensions as different. There was a high positive correlation for Acknowledgement it is a mental illness for all three reporters across time, but this was less consistent for the other dimensions. The key findings were that the patients and the clinician showed a significant positive correlation for Awareness of the effects of the illness on themself, while patients and relatives showed a significant positive correlation for Awareness of the effects of illness on others. These findings have relevance for clinical interaction and decision-making. There was limited change in overall insight scores or the pattern of correlations over the follow-up period, despite changes in psychopathology and mental health act status. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The study describes, for the first time, the similarities and differences in insight when assessed by patients, relatives and clinicians. When differences arise between patients, families and/or clinicians, these need not be dismissed as poor understanding on the relative's or patient's part. Family members have different views about patients' insights. The implications for clinical understanding of this are discussed. The proposed six dimensions of insight seen from the viewpoint of patient, relative and clinician are easily understood. The overall perspective developed in this thesis could inform a lexicon to describe aspects of clinical assessment and decision-making in areas such as compulsory treatment, compliance with treatment or understanding the effects of illness on self or others' all areas where insight into illness is usually considered.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Schizophrenia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158637</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">White Vanishing: A Settler Australian Hegemonic Textual Strategy, 1789-2006.</field><field name="creator">Tilley, Elspeth Nina</field><field name="description">This thesis conducts a discourse analysis of the &#145;white vanishing trope&#146;&#151;stories about white Australians who become lost or disappear&#151;in white Australian texts from 1789 to 2006. Working mostly from a basis of postcolonial theory, with a broader theorisation of bodies, time, and space where helpful, the analysis identifies four persistent semiotic commodities that have prevailed in these texts over this period. They are: a fetishised representation of indigenes that constructs them as a declining and landless race (I call this construct &#145;black displacements&#146;); a colonialist but also patriarchal and class-based representation of white characters that constructs&#151;and limits&#151;them as civil and legitimately landed white settler subjects (I call this &#145;white presencing&#146;); a linear rhetoric of chronology and progress that, while disrupted by the act of white vanishing, is ultimately restored and strengthened by the trope&#146;s teleological narrative structure (I call this &#145;temporal trouble&#146;); and a similarly monologic and Eurocentric construct of space that is likewise strengthened rather than subverted by the texts&#146; representations of the spaces of white vanishing as uncanny and unreliable (I call this spatial construct &#145;entering terra nullius&#146;). Together, these four repeated discursive categories shape the white vanishing trope as a strong and consistent meta-narrative of &#145;anti-conquest&#146;. That is, the white vanishing trope narrates a specific, and remarkably constant, relationship between indigenous bodies, white bodies, time, and space, in which white settlers are victims and survivors, whose occupation of Australia is constructed as inevitable and right. The white vanishing trope is, simply put, a hegemonic textual strategy of white settler mythmaking in which the ideological legacies of colonialism remain culturally pervasive and largely unrecognised.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158427</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE EFFECTIVENESS OF KIKUYU PASTURES IN THE CAPTURE OF NITROGEN FROM DAIRY EFFLUENT ON THE ATHERTON TABLELANDS</field><field name="creator">Silver, Bradley Allan</field><field name="description">Pressure on dairy farmers to remain viable since the industry was deregulated in July 2000 has accelerated the rate of production intensification. Milk is still produced on a year round basis in Queensland but now decreased milk price and increasing production costs are requiring farmers to intensify to a greater extent. The industry is still primarily pasture based but there is an increasing trend to feed larger numbers of cows in some form of purpose built intensive feeding system. Increased intensification results in an increased reliance on supplementary feeding, a greater need to ensure peak pasture production with fertiliser and more pressure on the waste management system. A common waste management system on the Atherton Tablelands of northern Queensland requires storage of all effluent in a single long term storage pond. This waste is then applied to pasture in the dry season through a sprinkler system. Alternatively effluent may be applied on a twice daily basis as yards are cleaned after milking. Although tropical grass can use large amounts of nutrient, potential loss of nutrients by run-off and leaching can occur in the wet season of tropical north Queensland when effluent is applied daily. This study was designed to test the management strategy of applying dairy effluent to a tropical pasture in summer when the pasture growth and therefore nutrient requirement is at its highest. The objective was to determine nutrient use efficiency of kikuyu and to determine leaching losses of nitrogen and therefore the potential environmental hazard. Stored dairy effluent was applied through the irrigation system at 0, 18.5, 42.4, 56.0 and 74.6 kg TKN ha&amp;oline;&amp;sup1 over the wet season to a kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestenin) dominant pasture which had been sown to annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) the previous autumn. Irrigation water was applied at rates which were in inverse proportions to dairy effluent. Pasture yield was measured every three weeks over a 107 day period. No significant difference in total pasture dry matter yield, pasture growth rate, plant nitrogen percent or total plant nitrogen yield was measured. Total pasture yields were 5243, 5808, 6213, 6035 and 5836 kg DM ha&amp;oline;&amp;sup1 over 5 harvests. Pasture growth rate ranged from 33.4 to 78.9 kg DM day&amp;oline;&amp;#185. Mean plant nitrogen yield was 161.8, 178.2, 194.2, 197.5 and 196.9 kg ha&amp;oline;&amp;#185. There was no significant difference in soil N and soil cation concentration (except sodium) to a depth of 80 cm at the completion of the trial period. At 50 to 80 cm soil depths treatments 1, 4 and 5 were significantly different to treatments 2 and 3 in sodium concentration. There was no difference in soil N levels to a depth of 20 cm prior to or after the treatment application. Following extensive measurement and sampling of leachate it was calculated that 29.1 and 86.8 kg ha&amp;oline;&amp;sup1 of total N was leached to 50 cm from treatments 1 and 5 respectively. Measurements of soil N, plant N and leachate N indicate that there was a gain of 20 kg N ha&amp;oline;&amp;sup1 in the N budget for treatment 1 and a gain of 55 kg N ha&amp;oline;&amp;sup1 from the system during the trial period for treatment 5. Possible reasons for these results are discussed. The results indicate that it is difficult to apply dairy effluent to pastures during the summer wet season on the Atherton Tablelands without nitrogen losses through leaching. However given the large amounts of organic N and the potential for high rates of mineralisation, substantial N losses can occur without any additional N application. The results also suggest that the yield of a tropical pasture, which follows a well fertilised annual temperate pasture such as ryegrass, is not enhanced by the application of dairy effluent during this time. However, pasture quality may be improved by the application of dairy effluent.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158318</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Depth in the Floating World: Western Realism and the Transformation of Traditional Space in Late Ukiyo-e Landscape Prints</field><field name="creator">Hickey, Gary James</field><field name="description">Throughout its history, the resilience of Japanese culture has allowed it to selectively absorb and transform outside influences, so that its own traditions are maintained and enriched. Of these influences, China and the West have been the most significant. This characteristic of Japanese culture is apparent in the traditional genre of landscape painting, of which late Edo period ukiyo-e landscape prints are a part. This thesis tests the hypothesis that the landscape prints of the ukiyo-e artists Katsushika Hokusai (1760&#150;1849) and Utagawa Hiroshige (1797&#150;1858) represent the synthesis of traditional landscape painting and Western realism into a reinvigorated Japanese expression, as these artists created what were in effect 3-D versions of traditional landscape scenes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158428</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genetics of uterine cervical conformation in tropically adapted beef cattle</field><field name="creator">Finch, Tricia Maree</field><field name="description">A large proportion of the beef industry in northern Australia is composed of tropically adapted cattle, due to their propensity for tick and drought resistance. It has been suggested that a large conical cervix is responsible for decreased fertility in these cattle where a conical cervix is defined as having a caudal to cranial cervical diameter difference of greater than 15 mm. Studies were conducted in order to ascertain the incidence of conical cervix and the heritability of cervical diameter in tropically adapted beef cattle in Queensland. An initial study was conducted on 246 Santa Gertrudis females from four properties. Caudal and cranial cervical measurements were taken with transrectal B-mode ultrasound using the Aloka SSD_500 scanner and a 5 MHz linear probe. Analysis of data was by AS REML, including the effects of sire, parity and property. Sire was included as a random effect, whereas parity and property were included in the analysis as fixed effects. Sire effects were significant. A sire model was used to calculate a heritability estimate of 0.60 &#177; 0.27 for uterine cervical diameter. An analysis of variance showed that parity had a significant effect on cervical diameter, with cervical diameter increasing as parity level increased. Property had no effect on cervical diameter A more detailed study was conducted on 850 cattle from five properties. Breeds represented were Santa Gertrudis, Brahman, Brahman Cross, Belmont Red and Belmond Red Cross. Caudal and cranial cervical diameter, sire, parity and breed were recorded for each animal. Once again, sire effects were significant resulting in a heritability estimate of 0.46 &#177; 0.15. An analysis of variance showed parity effects to be significant (&#945;=0.05) while property and breed effects did not influence cervical diameter. However property and breed were heavily confounded due to the practice of many stud breeders of running one breed per property. Breed and parity were also heavily confounded as Santa Gertrudis breed cattle were the only cattle available that had already produced one or more calves. In order to examine the relationship between cervical diameter and liveweight, a subset of 568 cows from the above group also had their weight in kilograms recorded. Animals were chosen for this study based on the availability of scales at each property. A Pearson correlation test resulted in a correlation coefficient of 0.043 between uterine cervical diameter and animal liveweight. This demonstrates that there is a negligible linear relationship between cervical diameter and liveweight. The relationship between cervix diameter and calving outcome was not investigated in this study. Although calving records were obtained for a number of animals in this study, many variables affecting calving outcome could not be accounted for such as disease outbreaks, artificial insemination technique and other management factors. Previous studies have suggested a relationship between cervical diameter and infertility but the present study was unable to draw conclusions regarding this. Although this study has shown that uterine cervical diameter is a moderately to highly heritable trait, it is not recommended that producers cull animals based on their uterine cervical dimensions at this stage, as the relationship between uterine cervical diameter and fertility is still poorly understood.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">300402 Animal Reproduction</field><field name="subject">630103 Beef cattle</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158319</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Self-Mixing Imaging System Based on an Array of Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs)</field><field name="creator">Tucker, John</field><field name="description">In recent years, the field of sensing and imaging has become increasingly important due to the demand for accurate and reliable instrumentation for many important industrial and biomedical applications. Despite the plethora of measuring techniques available, optical techniques, such as the self-mixing effect, are often preferred in many applications due to their non-contact form of measurement. Unlike conventional optical techniques, the self-mixing effect uses the laser as both the source and detector of light, leading to a more compact and robust measuring system. With the advent of Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs), it is now possible to cost effectively manufacture a two-dimensional array of lasers, raising the possibility of a highly-parallel self-mixing imaging system which can be used for many exciting applications. The main contribution of this dissertation is the first demonstration of a parallel selfmixing imaging system using the self-mixing effect in an array of VCSELs. The concept of the system is demonstrated using a small-scale prototype to measure the velocity at different radial points on a rotating disk and the velocity profile of diluted milk in a custom built diverging-converging planar flow channel. It is envisaged that a massively scaled up version of the small-scale prototype will be extremely useful in many industrial and biomedical applications, where remote real-time surface profiling, vibrometry and velocimetry are required. Another important contribution of the dissertation is the demonstration of the effect of co-existing transverse modes on the operation of self-mixing sensors based on VCSELs. Simulations and experiments were performed for both single-mode and multimode VCSEL-based self-mixing displacement and distance sensors. For displacement measurements, the presence of multiple transverse modes results in the accuracy and sensitivity of the system becoming periodic with target distance. Importantly, the small differences in the frequency-modulation coefficients of individual transverse modes allow the distance to the target to still be accurately determined with a high degree of sensitivity. Other secondary contributions consist of, firstly, an alteration of the rate equation model of the laser with optical feedback and current modulation, which correctly predicted the resulting signal for self-mixing distance sensors upon numerical integration. Secondly, a more comprehensive analysis to determine the signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) of a self-mixing sensor, which shows that the shot noise in the photodetector (PD) dominates at high injection currents while the thermal and amplifier noise in the receiver electronics and the relative intensity noise (RIN) of the laser have a similar value to the shot noise for injection currents near threshold. Thirdly, an alternative approach is developed to correctly model the velocity of rotating targets using the resonator model of the laser, which was performed by modifying the effective reflection coefficient of the laser instead of varying the actual distance to the target. Finally, an illustration of the influence of the optical setup on the spectral width of the signal in self-mixing velocity sensors, which shows that the spectral width of the self-mixing velocity signals are not just a result of speckle effects alone.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158638</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors Affecting the Learning Outcomes of Hill Tribe Students in Elementary School: The Case of Sahasart Suksa School, Chiang Rai Province, Thailand</field><field name="creator">Tengtragul, Anchalee</field><field name="description">Hill tribe people are a minority group living in Thailand. They have a strong traditional society, a unique way of life, culture and language. The Thai government is responsible for the provision of education for all Thai people, and hill tribe people have had access to education since 1935. The education of hill tribe people has also been supported by non-government organizations such as the American Baptist Mission. However, educational provision is not always effective and hill tribe students often experience high levels of school withdrawal and poor academic performance. Similar issues of underachievement have been identified amongst Indigenous students in Australia, and research in this field has been influenced by learning style theory (Harris, 1990) and socio-cultural theory (Vygotsky, 1978). These theoretical approaches have been adopted to inform the data analysis undertaken in this study. Focusing specifically on teaching and learning in the classroom in one private sector school, this study investigates factors that affect the learning outcomes of hill tribe students in Thailand. The study uses a case study approach, which employs qualitative research methodology and is informed by ethnography. Data was collected in Level 3 classrooms, the elementary level at the Sahasart Suksa School. The methods used to generate data were classroom observations and semi-structured interviews with teachers. This study identifies several key factors affecting the teaching and learning of hill tribe students in the aforementioned school. These include: 1. The language used as the medium of instruction (which is Thai). 2. The preferred learning style of hill tribe students. 3. Teachers understanding of hill tribe culture. 4. The inclusively and appropriateness of the curriculum. On the first count, hill tribe students speak their own language at home, but when they attend mainstream school they have to learn Thai language, which is used as a sole medium of instruction. This often obstructs hill tribe students from performing well at school as they are not as proficient in reading, writing and speaking in Thai as they are using their own hill tribe language. Secondly, hill tribe students learn better when learning tasks revolve around observation and imitation and when learning focuses upon real-life experiences and context specific activities. Moreover, they are not totally comfortable with verbal centered learning and assignments that can only be completed through the use of skills learnt in a previous lesson. Thirdly, teaching and learning approaches undertaken by the teachers are often not based on a sound understanding of students&#146; language needs, or their cultural backgrounds. Finally, the curriculum that teachers follow is not designed to meet the needs of hill tribe students, so even if teachers are aware of the issues listed above, they are often forced to follow curriculum directions, which many hill tribe students find irrelevant and difficult to understand. This thesis argues that attention to the learning style and socio-cultural background of hill tribe students will assist teachers and educators to develop units of work that meet the needs and interests of hill tribe students. Specifically, attention should be paid to: a) Respecting the cultural diversity of hill tribe students and recognizing the different contributions and experiences such students bring to the classroom. Teachers and educationalists need to understand the real life family circumstances of their students and use this knowledge as a basis to develop successful learning and achievement. b) The development of positive relationships between teachers and students. With hill tribe students this would of course be furthered by teachers learning about the cultural backgrounds of their learners, which is necessary if teachers and students are to develop mutual trust and respect for one another. c) Student centered pedagogy, which focuses on student learning and not just teaching. This would enhance the preferred learning styles of hill tribe students and allow them to learn at their own pace. d) The provision of a purposeful and relevant curriculum, which meets the needs and interests of all hill tribe students. Rationale Although the population of Thailand is relatively homogenous, with some 85 percent comprising of Thai speakers. The term &#145;hill tribes&#146; refers to ethic minority groups who live in the mountains of northern and northwestern Thailand. These groups are not one ethnic groups but comprise many different minority cultures. The largest groups of highland or hill tribe people are the Karen, Hmong (Meo), Yao, Lisu, Lahu, Lawa and Akha peoples. Each of these minority groups has a distinctive language, culture, religion and a unique way of life. The Thai Government has increasingly sought to administer and govern hill tribe people and in 1935 they initiated public education program aimed at educating all Thais, which included hill tribe people. In addition to government sector provision, education for hill tribe people is provided by the private sector by non-government groups such as the American Baptist Mission. Having said this, however, the provision of education for hill tribe students remains problematic and many drop out of school. In my role as the supervisor of student teachers located at one non-government school, I became aware of the poor performance of hill tribe students and the problem of student retention. I also noted the cultural mismatch between the teachers, school and students. It occurred to me that these were closely connected to one another and may even be the cause of poor student performance in the classroom. I also realized that this problem was not unique to Thailand but that similar conditions existed in Australia, where Indigenous students are also disadvantaged in the education system. These experiences and insights urged me to undertake this study and thus to provide information which would be useful for those teachers who want to engage effective teaching and learning activities with hill tribe students, as well as educators concerned with curriculum development and hill tribe education provision. The specific research question informing this thesis is: what factors affect the learning outcomes of hill tribe students in the classroom? Methodologically the thesis uses a case study approach which employs qualitative research methodology informed by ethnography. The two methods of data generation used in the research are observations and interviews. Classroom observations were undertaken over a period of three months in the class of Prathom Suksa 3 (Level 3) of the Sahasart Suksa School, Chiangrai Province, Thailand. Interviews were undertaken with five teachers after they finished teaching their classes. This study uses learning style theory (Harris, 1980; Hudsmith, 1992; Partington &amp; McCudden, 1992; McInerney &amp; McInerney, 1998) and socio-cultural theory (Vygotsky, 1978) to analyze the recurrent themes within the data. This study identifies several key factors as affecting teaching and learning in the Sahasart Suksa School including: a) The language used as the medium of instruction. b) The preferred learning style of hill tribe students. c) Teachers understanding of hill tribe students&#146; cultural background. d) Curriculum inclusively and appropriateness. In regards to first point, hill tribe students speak their own language at home, but when they attend mainstream school they have to learn Thai language, which is the sole medium of instruction. Often hill tribe students struggle to thoroughly familiarize themselves with the Thai language resulting in an inability to effectively utilize the language of instruction in the classroom. Obviously, this inability to speak, read and write proficiently in Thai has a profound impact on hill tribe student performance at school. Secondly, hill tribe students learn better when lessons enable them to use observation and imitation to complete tasks and when learning revolves around real-life situations familiar to the students. They are not automatically comfortable with verbal learning and using transferable skills commonly employed by teachers in mainstream schools. Thirdly, teaching and learning approaches undertaken by teachers of hill tribe students are not based on a sound understanding of students&#146; language needs, or their cultural background. Finally, the curriculum teachers follow is not designed to meet the needs of hill tribe students. Consequently, even if teachers do understand the issues listed above they are often forced to follow curriculum directions which are irrelevant and not immediately understandable by the students. This thesis argues that attention to the learning style and socio-cultural background of hill tribe students will assist teachers and educators to meet the needs of hill tribe students at the elementary level in Thailand. Specifically, attention should be paid to: a) Respecting the cultural diversity of hill tribe students which means teachers should be able to recognize the cultural differences between hill tribe and mainstream students from the low lands. Moreover, teachers must strive to understand the different contributions and experiences each hill tribe student brings to the classroom and use this knowledge to develop units of work, which aid successful learning and achievement. b) The development of a positive teacher/student relationship. This can be furthered by teachers developing an appreciation hill tribe culture in order to foster teacher/student relationships which is trusting, respectful and caring c) The adoption of a student centered pedagogy, which focuses on student learning, and not just teaching. This will enhance the preferred learning styles of hill tribe students and allow them to learn at their own pace. d) The provision of a purposeful and relevant curriculum, which meets the needs and interests of hill tribe students.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158320</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PHYLOGEOGRAPHY AND SPECIATION IN TROPICAL ABALONE, HALIOTIS ASININA</field><field name="creator">Imron, Doctor</field><field name="description">The tropical abalone, Haliotis asinina Linn 1758, represents an economically important gastropod mollusc. This has lead to intensive exploitation of its natural populations, despite the significant progress that has been achieved in the aquaculture of this species. In order to effectively manage natural stocks of H. asinina, and to improve production through aquaculture, a detailed understanding of its biology is required. I approached this problem by investigating phylogeography and speciation within H. asinina. Two main features make this species interesting for this kind of study: (i) it occupies a wide distribution across the Indo-Pacific region; and (ii) it has limited dispersal capacity owing to the short duration of its planktonic larval stage. The primary objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of speciation in this species by examining the species&#146; spatial distribution using a combination of both neutral markers [mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit II, (mtCOII) and microsatellite loci], and a selective marker which appears to be involved in abalone fertilization and speciation (lysin gene). Two geographical scales of genetic spatial structure were assessed. Large-scale assessment was carried out using mtCOII, involving samples from three major biogeographic regions across the Indo-Pacific, i.e. East Indian Ocean, Western Pacific Ocean, and Indo-Malay archipelago, while fine-scale geographic structure was examined using microsatellite loci focusing only on Great Barrier Reef (GBR) populations. In the large-scale analysis, partial length sequences of mtCOII (482 bp) from 206 individuals over 16 populations were subjected to an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), phylogenetic analysis, and nested clade analysis (NCA). The results showed that there is a significant phylogeographic break between major biogeographic regions across the Indo-Pacific, with sequence divergence ranging from a high of 3.7% and 3.0% between Indian and Pacific sites and Pacific and Indo-Malay sites, respectively, to a low of 1.1% between Indian and Indo-Malay sites. Despite no finer scale structure being detected within each biogeographic region, AMOVA and NCA analyses revealed a higher gene flow between geographic populations associated with major ocean currents. In the fine-scale analysis, four microsatellite loci were used to genotype five populations sampled from the GBR. One population was from the northern GBR, which is approximately 1000 km from the southern GBR, while the four southern GBR populations were separated from each other by less than 25 km. The results showed that genetic structuring exists not only among the populations that are geographically distant (Fst, 0.06 to 0.07, P&lt; 0.01) but also among those that are geographically close (Fst -0.06 to 0.03, P&lt; 0.05). Localized larval recruitment resulting from the short larval dispersal period coupled with local bathymetry and hydrodynamics within individual reefs may account for this observed pattern. Given the high level of sequence divergence in mtCOII between the Indian and Pacific H. asinina populations, it was of interest to investigate whether high divergence in this neutral marker was also reflected in the lysin gene, a selective marker, which is considered to be involved in abalone fertilization, contributing to species-specific fertilization boundaries and hence speciation. To gain insight into this, I cloned and characterized the lysin gene from H. asinina. A variety of tests for positive selection, which examines whether taxa are undergoing the process of speciation, were applied to both intraspecific and interspecific sequences of lysin. Despite high sequence divergence exhibited by the neutral marker (mtCOII) between Indian and Pacific populations of H. asinina, the lysin sequence particularly in the region where hypervariability characterizes interspecific comparisons- is highly conserved. Instead of positive selection, the lysin gene exhibits signs of negative selection, implying that disparate H. asinina populations have been advantaged by maintaining their current lysin sequences. These findings indicate that the highly structured populations of H. asinina are still of the same species. These findings are in contrast to those found in several congeneric species of temperate abalone, where lysin divergence exists despite the low divergence found in neutral markers. I discuss several explanations that may account for these observed phenomena including the differences in the rate of molecular evolution between tropical and temperate species, the effect of the geography of the species, i.e. whether they are in sympatry or in allopatry, and episodic evolution, whereby positive and negative selection occur episodically through the evolutionary course of species. Overall, this phylogeographic study using a combination of neutral and selective markers, has contributed to a better understanding of speciation in this species. Together with similar studies on other species, it contributes to the elucidation of the complexity of speciation in marine environment. Additionally, this study also provides practical information that is useful for effective and sustainable management of abalone resources, as well as for the improvement of aquaculture production as discussed in the General Discussion.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158429</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the mouse hnRNP A2/B1 gene and its protein isoforms</field><field name="creator">Hatfield, Jodie</field><field name="description">The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2/B1 gene participates in at least six cellular processes: telomere biogenesis and maintenance, packaging of nascent premRNAs, alternative splicing, mRNA stability, mRNA cytoplasmic trafficking and translation initiation. At the start of this project the mouse gene had not yet been described, however, the human gene was known to produce two protein isoforms, A2 and B1, but the functional boundaries between these two proteins were ill defined. The characterisation of the mouse hnRNP A2/B1 gene and its protein isoforms was, therefore, undertaken to facilitate research in mouse which would help to define functional differences between the protein isoforms. The mouse gene was found to be a 14 kb, single-copy gene located on chromosome 6 B3, comprised of 12 exons and 11 introns. This gene was regulated by a housekeeping-style promoter which was predicted to be affected by processes such as cell differentiation and maturation, cell cycle progression and stress responses. Transcription from this gene, and the human orthologue, gave rise to a number of RNAs that encoded four protein isoforms through alternative splicing of exons 2 and 9: B1, A2, B1b and A2b. In mouse, the expression and alternative splicing of the hnRNP A2/B1 transcripts were influenced by tissue-type and age. A subset of these transcripts also exhibited alterations to their 3&#146; UTRs such as retention of the 11th intron, alternative polyadenylation and 3&#146; UTR extension. The extended 3&#146; UTR region, intron 11 and sequence flanking the alternatively spliced exons were highly conserved between mouse and human (over 90%) and were predicted to contain regulatory motifs that governed post-transcriptional modifications to the RNA messages. The mouse genome was also shown to contain at least six processed pseudogenes derived from the hnRNP A2/B1 gene, five of which were unlikely to be functional due to frequent variations from the real gene sequence, including insertions, deletions and rearrangements. The remaining pseudogene, pseudogene 1, could give rise to an independent source of A2 proteins and its status is yet to be determined. To date, it is unclear what role each of the four hnRNP A2/B1 protein isoforms play in the cell. It was proposed that protein isoforms with a unique functional role would exhibit differences in subcellular localisation and expression patterns. In order to test this hypothesis, a number of biological tools were developed to distinguish between the highly similar proteins. In addition to two rabbit polyclonal antibodies previously raised in our lab that recognised all four protein isoforms (HA2) and isoforms B1 and B1b (HB1), another four polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits and chickens. These antibodies were raised to recognise the following combinations: all four proteins (chicken HA2), A2 and A2b (chicken Hx1/3), B1 and A2 (rabbit Hx9) and A2b and B1b (rabbit Hx8/10). These antibodies were demonstrated to be suitable for Western analyses and immunostaining studies, although antibodies Hx1/3, Hx8/10 and chicken HA2 will require further purification to reduce nonspecific signals seen in immunostaining experiments. A number of fluorescently tagged fusion proteins were also engineered for each of the A2/B1 protein isoforms. Western analyses showed that in mouse tissues and a number of immortalised cell lines, A2 and B1 were the major hnRNP A-type proteins present. Their abundance varied between tissue- and cell-type, but both were constitutively expressed. In contrast, A2b was only present in younger mouse tissues and was absent from most immortalised cell lines, while B1b was not detected in the samples examined. Localisation studies showed that in the immortalised cell lines, HaCaT and PC12, the expressed protein isoforms and related fusion proteins localised to the cell nucleus but were excluded from the nucleoli and exhibited distinct perinucleolar staining. Little difference was observed between the localisation patterns of the protein isoforms A2 and B1 in these cell types. Interestingly in oligodendrocytes, a cell type known to carry out A2-dependent mRNA trafficking, B1 was localised to the nucleus, A2 was predominantly nuclear but also exhibited some cytoplasmic localisation and A2b was distributed almost evenly between the nucleus and cytoplasm (M. Maggipinto and R. Smith, personal communication). Hence, differences were observed in the localisation of these proteins but were cell-type dependent. In conclusion, the hnRNP A2/B1 splice variants and their protein products were differentially expressed temporally and spatially, suggesting that these highly similar protein isoforms were likely to possess unique functional roles. Future research using the biological tools developed and described in this thesis, will be directed towards further defining the different roles each of the protein isoforms may have in the cellular processes associated with the hnRNP A2/B1 gene. Lastly, the hnRNP A2/B1 gene belongs to a sub-family of hnRNP genes that have arisen through chromosomal duplication events and include hnRNPs A1 and A3. Comparisons of their gene structures and subsequent RT-PCR assays have revealed that, in addition to the two previously described splice variants of the hnRNP A3 gene, A3a and A3b, the eighth exon of the A3 transcript was also alternatively spliced in humans and gave rise to two new variants termed A3c and A3d.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158639</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Production Functions in Australian Professional Team Sport: The Australian Football League</field><field name="creator">Nadarajah, Christopher</field><field name="description">This thesis examines sporting production within the Australian Football League (AFL), a matter not usually subject to microeconomic analysis. To achieve this objective, a stochastic frontier model of the sport is developed and used to analyse the technical efficiency of all 16 teams within the league over six consecutive seasons between 1996 and 2001. In addition to identifying the key play variables influencing the performance of AFL teams, the analysis shows that, over the six seasons, AFL teams operated with high levels of technical efficiency and that such high levels of technical efficiency are a necessary but not sufficient condition for on-field success. The efficiency analysis also demonstrated the existence of an inherent cyclicality in the technical efficiency of AFL teams. It is considered that a major underlying factor for this cyclical pattern are the difficulties concerning player adjustment, including those associated with the AFL's regulatory framework which chiefly comprises a salary cap and player draft. This thesis also presents a broader examination of the industry which is useful given the industry's highly integrated nature and the intrinsic linkage between competitive balance and the structural environment. In terms of a key policy implication, it is proposed there may be advantages for the league to examine options to reduce player adjustment costs as a means of facilitating greater technical efficiency for teams and enhancing competitive balance.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158321</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vivo and in vitro investigations of laser and nonlaser therapies in treatment of root surface erosion and root surface caries</field><field name="creator">Vlacic, Jelena</field><field name="description">Prevention of dental disease and conservation of tooth structure are integral principles of modern dental practice. With greater retention of teeth, the incidence of root surface erosion and root surface caries is on the rise, and is commonly seen in everyday clinical practice. There has been extensive research on the individual effectiveness of photo-activated disinfection (PAD), laser activated fluoride (LAF) therapy, and treatments with casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP). Despite the positive results from in vitro investigations, in vivo studies are required to demonstrate the true degree and extent of clinical effectiveness. It is only in such a setting that the therapy is placed in context of all of the biological, social and behavioural processes which may affect its outcome. Furthermore, no in vivo study has investigated the potential of combined use of these therapies in reducing root surface erosion-induced hypersensitivity or stabilising incipient root surface caries. This is of great clinical importance and relevance, if progress and advancement are to be achieved in clinical practice. For these reasons, this research study includes a randomised controlled clinical pilot study that investigates the therapeutic effect of combined CPP-ACP, LAF and PAD therapies in alleviating root surface erosion-induced hypersensitivity and stabilising root surface caries. The findings of the in vivo study clearly illustrate the great success and effectiveness of these combined therapies in alleviating hypersensitivity and stabilising root surface caries. This is further substantiated with SEM images clearly showing occlusion of the dentine tubules. The second part of the thesis investigates the potential of Laser Activated Fluoride (LAF) therapy as a protective therapy. Much of the previous literature on LAF therapy has explored its preventive effect on enamel against cariogenic acids, however with an increase in the incidence of erosive lesions, the potential of LAF therapy for use against a strong erosive challenge is a critical point. Consequently, this study includes an in vitro investigation of the protective potential of LAF therapy against a strong erosive challenge (hydrochloric acid). The results show that LAF therapy can be successfully utilised to provide protection to tooth structure against a strong erosive challenge. Moreover, while LAF therapy has been successful when undertaken with the Argon Ion laser wavelengths of laser light, the dependency of its success on a specific wavelength of laser light has not hitherto been investigated. It is essential to determine the influence of the wavelength parameter on the effectiveness of this therapy, and in particular the possible utility of this therapy when used with a broader (visible and near infrared) spectrum of light. Furthermore, this exploration should also extend to the application of a non-coherent source of light, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs). For these reasons, this research work includes in vitro studies investigating the importance of the wavelength and coherency parameters on the effectiveness, and success, of LAF therapy. These studies clearly show that LAF therapy can be successfully carried out with a wide spectrum of wavelength of laser light, with the coherency parameter crucial to its effectiveness. Finally, the exact mechanism by which the LAF protective effect is attained in dentine needs to be elucidated. An XPS analysis of dentine treated with LAF, under in vitro conditions, is also presented in the thesis. The results of this study clearly show phase transformation of hydroxyapatite to fluorapatite following treatment of dentine with LAF therapy. The first two chapters of the thesis presents an overview of the existing literature on root surface erosion, root surface caries, LAF, PAD and CPP-ACP therapies. Chapter 3 identifies the aims, objective and hypothesis, while Chapters 4 through to 9 present the findings of the in vivo and in vitro studies. Each chapter provides a discussion on the presented findings, while concluding remarks are provided in the final chapter, Chapter 10.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158430</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Embedding, Existence and Completion Problems for Latin Squares</field><field name="creator">Buchanan, Melinda Jayne</field><field name="description">This thesis contains three main results which relate to embedding, existence and completion problems for Latin squares.

The first results on this problem were obtained by Chaffer et al [12] who proved in 1975 that any partial totally symmetric quasigroup can be embedded in a (complete) totally symmetric quasigroup of finite order (exponential in n). In 1976 Lindner and Cruse [33] obtained much smaller embeddings, showing that any partial totally symmetric quasigroup of order n has an embedding in a totally symmetric quasigroup of order v if v &#8805; 6n and v &#8801; 0 (mod 6). In 1996 and 1997, Raines [42] and Raines and Rodger [43] improved this result by obtaining embeddings of order v for all even v &#8805; 4n + 4. In Chapter 2 we determine necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a quasigroup of order n having an automorphism consisting of a single cycle of length m and n &#8722; m fixed points, and having any combination of the additional properties of being idempotent, unipotent, commutative, semi-symmetric or totally symmetric. Quasigroups with such additional properties and symmetries are equivalent to various classes of triple systems. This result unifies several existing results on this problem (see for example [3], [13], [14], [37], [40] and [41]). The third main result of this thesis concerns the completion of partial Latin squares consisting of two filled rows and two filled columns. A complete solution to the problem is given. In particular it is shown that every partial Latin square of order at least 6 which consists of two filled rows and two filled columns can be completed. The completion of partial Latin squares is an NP-complete problem in general, and notoriously difficult problems arise in determining large families of completable partial Latin squares. The area includes several famous problems and results including the Evans Conjecture, which was settled by Smetaniuk [22] (see Theorem 3.1.2), Ryser&#146;s Theorem [44] (see page 87) and M. Hall&#146;s Theorem [27] (see Theorem 3.1.4). This result is interesting in that unlike most known Latin square completion results, the filled cells of the partial Latin square span both the rows and the columns.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158322</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EXPRESSION OF MARKERS FOR TELOMERASE AND APOPTOSIS IN PREMALIGNANT AND MALIGNANT ORAL EPITHELIAL LESIONS</field><field name="creator">Raiyon, Maria Leny</field><field name="description">The diagnosis of oral dysplastic and malignant disease has become more challenging than ever, even with the availability of advanced techniques and methods in molecular bioscience. Advances in molecular biosciences have made it possible for early detection of cancer cells before this can be noted histopathologically by morphological changes. As a concept in the progression of oral cancer (oral squamous cell carcinoma), the balance between proliferation and apoptotic cell death, as well as the regulators and interactions within these mechanisms, has become more important as our knowledge of these two processes increases. The current literature suggests that apoptotic cell death and telomerase activity in tumour cells may be used as indicators for early detection of carcinogenesis in oral lesions. Defects in apoptosis, among other molecular mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis, play a role in the pathogenesis and progression of oral cancer. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family inhibits signals in the apoptosis pathway and prevents cells from dying. Bcl-2 protein expression has been reported in many cancers, although this is equivocal, with some studies showing increased expression, while others have detected sporadic expression or a lack thereof especially in epithelium. Another protein expressed during the progression of carcinoma is telomerase. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex whose main active components are the catalytic protein subunit (human telomerase reverse transcriptase or hTERT) and the RNA template. This enzyme activity in cells has been known to allow cells to proliferate and avoid senescence. In affected cells, telomerase activity readily provides a unique marker of aberrant cell division. The hypothesis in this study therefore is that there is a correlation between the proliferation due to telomerase activity, and apoptotic cell death in the progression of oral cancer, and that the alteration of apoptosis and telomerase activity occur early in this progression pathway. Expression of Bcl-2 and TUNEL as markers for apoptosis, and telomerase hTERT as a marker of proliferation, were detected in archival formalinfixed paraffin-embedded oral tissue sections of epithelial hyperplasia, dysplasia and oral squamous cell carcinomas. Bcl-2 expression in this study was relatively static in epithelial hyperplasia, dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma, with no significant up- or down-regulation occurring, although there was a trend for Bcl-2 expression to be lower in epithelial dysplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma compared to epithelial hyperplasia. This correlates with studies showing a down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression, while it differs from others reporting an upregulation of Bcl-2 protein expression. Almost unaltered low expression of Bcl-2 protein observed during the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma in this study was unexpected based on results from other studies, in which a negative correlation with apoptosis was observed. The localization and variation of hTERT protein expression detected in this study was in agreement with previous studies on formalin-fixed human tissue samples. Basal layers of oral epithelium, where the early proliferative progenitor cells are located, showed more hTERT positive cells than in the suprabasal layer. hTERT expression was highest on average in epithelial dysplasia, although this difference was not significantly different compared to hyperplasia or OSCC. This suggests that at this stage of cellular proliferation, cells are at the critical point when telomerase reaches its highest activity and this promotes malignant transformation. In OSCC, hTERT positive cells were less in number than in oral dysplasia, but were more intensely stained, and more variable in presentation. Theoretically, expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 is inversely correlated with apoptosis demonstrated by TUNEL, and directly correlated with cell proliferation, as determined by hTERT expression. Under-expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 can encourage apoptosis and also support cell proliferation. The results of this study appear to support the notion, that at least in oral epithelium the expression of Bcl-2 is more closely correlated with apoptosis than with cell proliferation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158431</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Controlling Crystal Size by Drop-Based Microfluidic Crystallization</field><field name="creator">Dombrowski, Richard</field><field name="description">Crystallization is used to produce a number of solid products, ranging from common materials like sugar to high value products like pharmaceuticals. Control of crystal properties such as the size distribution, shape and polymorph is important in order to maintain product quality. Emulsion based methods have been demonstrated as effective means for producing polymeric and inorganic particles of controlled size. Previous studies of the control of organic or protein crystal size by solution crystallization in emulsions are complicated by polydisperse drop size distributions or the addition of a surfactant to stabilize the drops. This thesis investigated a drop-based microfluidic crystallizer as a new method for producing crystals of controlled size. In the microfluidic crystallizer, the mother liquor is dispersed as monodisperse drops and crystallization is confined to the drop domain. The maximum crystal size is limited by the amount of material in the drop. If only one crystal is grown in each drop, then the crystals will have a narrow size distribution near this maximum size. A new microfluidic system for producing monodisperse drops, the HPLC T-junction, was developed for use in the study of drop-based crystallization. The HPLC T-junction was capable of producing drops with diameters from 50 to over 300 &#181;m that were stable against coalescence without any added surfactant. The coefficient of variation (CV) of drop size was less than 3%, indicative of very narrow size distributions. The HPLC Tjunction had superior solvent resistance, more favorable wetting properties for producing aqueous drops and higher pressure tolerance compared with conventional PDMS microfluidic devices. The HPLC T-junction did not require the expensive and timeconsuming fabrication steps or the specialized fabrication equipment associated with the production of conventional PDMS microfluidic devices. Mathematical models of crystallization in monodisperse drops were developed using population balance and Monte Carlo methods to predict the crystal size distribution and number of crystals per drop and to identify the important factors that determine the product crystal size distribution. Model predictions indicated that the drop-based microfluidic crystallizer would produce the narrowest crystal size distribution when each drop contained one crystal and that crystal had grown to the mass balance limited size. Modeling showed that the crystallization behavior in drops was determined by the relationship between the nucleation and growth rates of the solute. Two dimensionless time scales, the dimensionless growth and nucleation times were proposed to quantify the relationship between the two rate processes. Rapid crystal growth led to a high fraction of drops containing only one crystal and a very narrow size distribution. If crystal growth was slow relative to nucleation, the crystallization in drops yielded many drops with more than one crystal and a broader size distribution. Experimental case studies of crystallization in monodisperse drops were conducted using lysozyme and lactose. The HPLC T-junction and a Teflon tubular crystallizer were used as the drop-based microfluidic crystallizer in the studies. Drop-based crystallization experiments were conducted by filling the tubular crystallizer with mother liquor drops and measuring the number and size of the crystals in each drop by image analysis after certain residence times. Lysozyme was crystallized by the addition of NaCl to induce supersaturation. Cooling crystallization was used to generate supersaturation in the lactose experiments. Lysozyme crystals grew rapidly and quickly depleted the supersaturation in drops, thereby preventing formation of a second crystal. It was possible to produce over 90% of drops containing single lysozyme crystals in the microfluidic crystallizer. Lysozyme crystals with a CV of crystal size as low as 14% were produced. A substantial portion of the spread in the measured size distribution was likely due to orientation effects of the plate-shaped crystals during observation. Unlike lysozyme, lactose crystals grew slowly in drops, leading to a maximum of 40% of drops containing one crystal and a substantial fraction of drops containing multiple crystals. The CV of crystal size was as low as 7% in those drops that contained one crystal, indicative of a very narrow size distribution. In a non-optimized, isothermal process, the CV the total crystal size distribution produced by the drop-based microfluidic crystallizer was as low as 16%, compared with 40% produced from bulk crystallization with common history seed. Nucleation rates for lysozyme and lactose were estimated from measurements of the fraction of empty drops over time using the drop-based microfluidic crystallizer and were correlated to an expression based on classical nucleation theory. Lysozyme nucleation rates measured in the microfluidic crystallizer showed good agreement with literature data. Measured nucleation rates were used to estimate the interfacial tension for primary nucleation in classical nucleation theory for each material. The interfacial tension of lysozyme was estimated as 0.65 mN/m, which agrees with literature values. The interfacial tension for primary nucleation of lactose was estimated as 5.9 mN/m, the first such estimate for lactose. The study of lactose crystallization in the microfluidic crystallizer showed that isothermal crystallization will not always lead to a high fraction of drops with one crystal. Two nonisothermal control methods, fines dissolution and nucleation-growth thermal cycling, were proposed. Fines dissolution increased the fraction of drops with one crystal, reduced the fraction of drops with multiple crystals and produced a narrower crystal size distribution. Nucleation-growth thermal cycling minimized the formation of more than one crystal in a drop, yielding a narrower crystal size distribution. The results of the lysozyme and lactose case studies indicate that the drop-based microfluidic crystallizer is an effective means for controlling the size distribution of organic and protein crystals. The mathematical models are useful for optimizing the microfluidic crystallizer and extending drop-based crystallization to control the crystal size of materials other than lactose and lysozyme.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158640</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The choice between rural living and agriculture: Implications for land use and subdivision policy</field><field name="creator">Anstey, Geoff</field><field name="description">In much of Australia and the United States, the almost universal right to have a house on rural allotments has resulted in rural living settlement in areas intended, by land use planning policy, to be used for agriculture. Such &#145;unplanned&#146; rural living has a range of potential adverse impacts, including, among other things, loss of agricultural production, land use conflicts with agriculture, land value constraints on farm restructuring, and changes to the rural landscape character. Given the strongly held community perception of a house as a development right, this research was motivated by the need to understand the effects of that right, in order to assess the potential value of any change in policy. An integral consideration was the influence of the size of allotments with any such right. The research was also driven by an interest in explaining the pattern of unplanned rural living settlement, i.e. why are particular allotments converted and others not? Largely in the absence of previous studies of unplanned rural living as a distinct phenomenon, there was scope for this thesis to make a contribution to knowledge in these respects. The research involved three stages of empirical analysis. Firstly, a Queensland-wide survey of land use conversion from sugarcane production supported the choice of the Bundaberg region as the study area. Contingency table analyses were then conducted into the current land use and other attributes of land in the study area that, in 1980, was used for sugarcane. Those analyses identified distinguishing attributes of the different land use sub-sets of allotments, and informed the selection of observation units for the third stage. The third stage provided the principal basis for fulfilling the research objectives. It focused on logit models of the choice, at the time of sale, between using a particular allotment for unplanned rural living or sugarcane production. Those analyses provided an indication of the role of individual land attributes while controlling for the effects of other attributes. It was found there had been limited conversion of suitable, productive sugarcane land to unplanned rural living. Compared to those allotments that remained in sugarcane production, allotments converted to rural living were, on average, much smaller, of less value, had lower agricultural production potential, and were situated in more undulating and forested landscapes further from Bundaberg. These clear distinctions between rural living and sugarcane allotments contributed to logit models with high explanatory power. The expected productive income of allotments had overwhelming weight and was highly statistically significant in explaining the land use choice between unplanned rural living and sugarcane. This is a notable finding, because some other studies have not shown such a strong relationship between land use and measures such as soil productivity. There was a degree of natural coincidence between more undulating and forested landscapes and lower productive potential. Notably, landscape attributes appeared to be of secondary importance in determining land use. The presence of a house at the time of sale was not a statistically significant explanatory factor for land use. This finding, together with that of limited conversion of suitable, productive land to unplanned rural living, meant there was a lack of evidence to support a change to the right to have a house on rural allotments. The findings did indicate that the allotment area required to avoid conversion to unplanned rural living was different to the area required for agricultural viability. In the circumstances of this study area and period, 20 ha would have been an acceptable minimum to retain suitable cropping land in productive use. This is compared to the 60 ha suggested as necessary for farm viability. However, the potential for changed economic conditions to reduce the productive value of agricultural land, and increase demand for rural living, makes it appropriate to be cautious about permitted allotment sizes. A detailed conceptual framework informed the selection of observation units and variables for the third stage of analyses. The framework helped to confirm allotment sales as the observation units, and provided the rationale for excluding the difficult to measure influences of a landowner&#146;s attachment to the land, and inertia, as explanatory variables. The high explanatory power of the logit models provides support for the approach, which may be useful in future studies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300804 Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">770905 Integrated (ecosystem) assessment and management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158323</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epigenetics and regulation of plant gene expression</field><field name="creator">Brosnan, Christopher Andrew</field><field name="description">Transgene expression is not only variable between independent transgenic lines but can also be completely switched off via the process of gene silencing. Gene expression can be modulated at the transcriptional, mRNA processing and translational levels. Transgene silencing, on the other hand, can occur at the transcriptional level where it is known as transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), or at the post-transcriptional level where is termed post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). Understanding transgene silencing and controlling transgene expression are two vital areas of both pure and applied plant science. In this study, several aspects of epigenetics and regulation of gene expression were investigated in plants. Although extremely high levels of transgene expression are sometimes desired, reproducible and consistent levels (whether low or high) of transgene expression can also be important. Previous work in mammalian cell cultures has demonstrated that the number of upstream Open Reading Frames (uORFs) within the 5&#161;&#175;-untranslated region (5&#161;&#175;-UTR) is inversely proportional to translation efficiency and levels of protein expression. In order to test if this is true in a stably transformed plant system, the same mammalian 5&#161;&#175;-UTRs were incorporated into a GUS expression cassette and transformed into Arabidopsis. Similar changes in translation efficiency were seen, but more severe effects were observed at the level of mRNA stability in the plant system. Inclusion of uORFs in modified Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) &#167;&#217; 5&#161;&#175;-UTRs also resulted in decreased GUS expression in a transient system. It was concluded that uORFs could be of use in transgenic plant systems to gain a range of protein expression levels. A reported feature of the two-component Ds/sAc transposon tagging system in transgenic tomato, is sAc transposase-mediated silencing of the nos:BAR selectable marker gene within the Ds element (Carroll et al., 1995; Reyes et al., 2004). The mechanism of this form of transgene silencing was further elucidated. The results indicated that histone modification occurs prior to DNA methylation, with the later potentially occurring as a form of maintenance silencing in most transposed Ds lines after the sAc has segregated away (Reyes et al., 2004). A silenced Ds was previously utilised to tag a chromosomal region of the tomato genome that appeared to have the potential to alleviate nos:BAR silencing (Reyes, 2002). The tomato sequences flanking this Ds insertion called UQ14 expression modulating sequences (EMS) were cloned and tested for their ability to enhance artificial viral resistance to Potato virus Y (PVY) conferred by a NIa hairpin in transgenic tobacco. Inclusion of the UQ14 EMS sequences in the transgene construct enhanced the frequency of immunity approximately two-fold over non-EMS controls. This demonstrated that the UQ14 sequences have the potential to be used in at least solanaceaeous plant species to modulate transgene expression. To study the mechanisms of long-distance movement of RNA silencing in Arabidopsis, transgenic lines containing a GF-specific hairpin targeting a full length GFP transgene were generated and used in grafting experiments. Using the GF hairpin silenced line as rootstock and a GFP expressing line as a scion, it was shown that once initiated, silencing occurred in all newly formed leaves but did not spread into pre-established older leaf tissue. No genes tested were found to be required for sending the mobile RNA silencing signal. However, there was a correlation between the level of 21-22 nt small interfering RNA (siRNA) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) levels in the rootstock genotype, and the speed at which silencing was transmitted to the scion. In addition to this, DCL3-dependent 24 nt siRNA species were found to play no role in the transmission of the silencing signal from the rootstock. Analysis of the genes required for the reception of silencing revealed that multiple RNA silencing pathways were involved. It was shown for the first time that a chromatin silencing pathway, involving RNA polymerase IVa, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2), DICER-like 3 (DCL3) and ARGONAUTE 4 is required for reception of long-distance RNA silencing. This pathway produces 24 nt siRNAs, and resulted in decapped RNA, a known substrate for amplification of dsRNA by RDR6. This dsRNA is then processed by DCL4 into 21 nt siRNAs, or in its absence by DCL2 into 22 nt siRNAs, and these guide the degradation of the target GFP transcript in a manner similar to anti-viral defense.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158432</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RNA loading of BDCA-1+ BDC for Application in a Clinical Immunotherapy Setting</field><field name="creator">Tracey, Christopher Bernard Michael</field><field name="description">The lack of effective treatments for metastatic prostate cancer with proven survival benefit has initiated the use of novel therapies, such as immunotherapy. The use of dendritic cell (DC) based immunotherapy to treat patients has been attempted at various centres, based on tumour associated antigen and peptides, with modest clinical responses. Use of peptides however, limits the therapy to a certain HLA subtype, present in only 40% of the population. RNA use however, may enable this therapy to be available to 100% of the population. This study examines the optimisation of RNA loading of blood DC, for potential future clinical use with RNA based, blood DC immunotherapy. The conditions for RNA loading of BDCA-1+ blood DC were optimised. Parameters assessed included optimum voltage and capacitance settings for electroporation of RNA, recovery temperature, RNA concentration and timing following blood DC isolation. The optimum electroporation parameters were assessed to be 250V and 150&#956;F at room temperature, with no difference seen between immediate electroporation after the BDC isolation compared with a 2 hour delay. The presence of up-regulation of DC activation markers CD40, 80, 86 and 83 was evaluated, demonstrating that electroporation up-regulates all of the markers compared with passive culture. Generation of tumour specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) following priming and re-stimulation with BDCA-1+ BDC electroporated with MART-1 mRNA was attempted without success. This was likely due to poor expression of the MART- 1/Melan A antigen on the blood DC (BDC) as evidenced by Western blot analysis. Further assessment of the effect of re-stimulation of CTL with peptide pulsed BDC versus peptide pulsed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) demonstrated no difference, evidencing the importance of DC in immunological priming but their reduced importance in effecting memory CTL responses.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158324</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Actions speak louder than words : accelerating national policies for obesity and related chronic illness</field><field name="creator">Gross, Paul</field><field name="description">In 2006, over 60% of adult Australians are obese or overweight as measured by Body Mass Index (weight in kilograms divided by height in metres squared). Adult and childhood obesity is growing at about one percentage point per year. A central tenet of this thesis is that with such prevalence and growth rates of the human girth, obesity is a major public policy issue that has a large direct cost in the burden of related chronic conditions and an even larger hidden cost of lost productivity that is not being addressed by governments in Australia. With yet another report on obesity imminent from the National Obesity Task Force, I argue that Australia needs to replace its reliance on talk-fests about obesity by government policies that redefine obesity as a national health priority area requiring immediate collective action by households, the food, drink and advertising industries, health insurers and the federal and state governments. The obesity epidemic requires embedding into Medicare and private health insurance the types of economic incentives that are now reducing the risks of unhealthy lifestyles in other parts of the world, emphasizing the role of personal responsibility in changing unhealthy lifestyles. While all these initiatives are, given the current chasm between federal and statelterritory governments, rather difficult to implement, I argue that policies are required to prevent obesity in all age groups, and complacency is not an option. This thesis makes six substantive contributions to the policy debate on obesity in Australia. First, it identifies the types of direct treatment costs and the hidden costs of workloss (absenteeism) and lost productivity while at work (presenteeism) that are generated by highly prevalent chronic disorders that are poorly managed in Australia. Second, it provides new estimates of the costs of obesity, overweight and physical inactivity in 2004105, identifying both the direct and indirect costs of chronic conditions associated with these three risk factors. Third, it analyses data from a small pilot study of weightloss in Australia using a new behavioural model, concluding that policies that buttress self-efficacy and intrinsic motivations should be considered in government policy for obesity. Fourth, drawing on the new discipline of behavioural economics, it concludes that regulation of advertising of food and drinks to children is unlikely to be as effective as economic incentives that enhance the sense of personal responsibility. Fifth, it proposes changes in the economic incentives within the Medicare and private health insurance systems, and it identifies gaps in workplace health promotion that should be remedied by gradual changes in workers' compensation insurance and new tax incentives to employers. Sixth, it recommends the creation of a new National Council on Obesity and Chronic Disease headed by a Parliamentary Secretary responsible to the Cabinet for the development of cross-portfolio strategies and the creation of public-private partnerships against obesity and chronic conditions. The last recommendation emerges as a preferred alternative to leaving all major decisions on obesity and related chronic conditions in the hands of politically-charged bodies such as the Council of Australian Governments (COAG). The thesis concludes with a set of recommendations on macro-environments that need to be considered in devising new policies to attack the obesity epidemic on both the demand side (i.e., the population) and the supply side (i.e., all providers of care, all payers for such care and all suppliers of dietary intakes who can influence weightloss behaviour), all influenced by new economic and behavioural incentives for healthier diets and physical activity rather than by government regulatory zeal.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158325</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Urban Design: Shaping Attractiveness of the Urban Environment with the End-Users</field><field name="creator">Kozlowski, Marek</field><field name="description">The rise of the global economy has sparked fierce competition and as a consequence a rapid physical transformation of major urban centres around the world. Urban design is one of the key instruments of physical transformation employed to enhance urban quality and achieve sustainable urban environments. Confined by environmental, economic and social realities and being part of the development process, urban design is largely influenced by the principal power brokers, including developers and public authorities. Local conditions, cultures and values often fall prey to the agendas and processes of these principal stakeholders. Notwithstanding recent measures to increase community participation, the views and aspirations of end-users, including residents, visitors and local entrepreneurs are still not the principal concerns behind the design and planning of their cities. The lack of direct end-users participation in the preparation of design solutions is one of the major shortcomings of contemporary urban design. Solving this problem is an important challenge to the contemporary urban design practice. This research develops an approach that identifies subjective views of end-users in any urban locality as to what constitutes, for them, attractiveness of the urban environment, and further determines how this information could be integrated into the urban design process. The concept of attractiveness of the urban environment, introduced to this study is based on the subjective views of end-users. The notion of attractiveness constitutes the basis to develop a universal checklist Evaluative Criteria for Attractiveness (ECA) of the urban environment. The ECA comprises 54 criteria addressing essential environmental, economic, socio-cultural and political aspects which determine the physical development of the cities. The ECA list provides the basis for developing an interactive operational method (IOM) aimed at obtaining subjective views of end-users and integrating this information into the urban design process. This can foster a better understanding of the proposed design solutions among the community as well as reduce the current gap between decision makers such as politicians, developers, designers and the end-users. The IOM should become a mandatory component of urban design practice and be applied in urban design frameworks, master plans, guidelines and briefs. Attainment of such a goal should substantially contribute towards increasing the role of urban design in shaping and enhancing attractiveness of the urban environment at the local level, and at the same time improve the level of satisfaction among the concerned end-users. This innovative concept of urban design will be more user friendly, reflect local values, cultures and conditions and also contribute to the creation of a more diversified sustainable urban environment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158641</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pore-Forming and Saposin-like Proteins from the Gut of Blood-Feeding Helminths</field><field name="creator">Don, Tegan Anita</field><field name="description">Blood-feeding parasites rely on the acquisition of amino acids contained within erythrocytes, namely haemoglobin (Hb), to meet their nutritional requirements for growth, reproduction and survival in the host. While the Hb degradation pathways have been partially elucidated in haematophagous hookworms and schistosomes, the molecular mechanisms by which these parasites lyse erythrocytes to release the Hb are still unknown. Despite earlier publications claiming that hookworms did not possess haemolysins, haemolytic activity in both adult and larval stages of Ancylostoma caninum, the common dog hookworm, has been identified. Activity was detergentsoluble and heat-stable, and was unaffected by the addition of protease inhibitors, metal ions, chelators and reducing agents. Trypsin ablated lysis, indicating that the haemolytic agent is a protein. A closely migrating doublet of A. caninum proteins (60-65 kDa) bound to erythrocyte membranes after lysis of cells, and in addition, chromatographic separation of detergent extracts resulted in the purification of similar sized proteins with trypsin-sensitive haemolytic activity. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe erythrocytes lysed with particulate, buffer-insoluble worm extracts. Red cell remnants (ghosts) remained, with pores approximately 100 nm in diameter forming in their cell membranes, suggesting that lysis is likely caused by pore-formation followed by osmotic disruption of the cell. Recently, cDNAs encoding proteins with haemolytic capacity were identified from the liver flukes Clonorchis sinensis and Fasciola hepatica. These fluke cytolysins share sequence homology with amoebapores, pore-forming peptides from the protozoan parasite, Entamoeba histolytica, and can be grouped within a family of distantly related saposin-like proteins (SAPLIPs). Two A. caninum expressed sequence tags (ESTs) encoding SAPLIPs were identified and full-length cDNA sequences were obtained from a cDNA library by PCR &#150; these were termed Ac-slp-1 and Ac-slp-2. Both mRNAs were expressed in all life stages studied, with Ac-slp-1 predominantly expressed in third-stage larvae (L3) before and after activation with host serum. Recombinant proteins were expressed in insect cells and used to raise specific antisera in mice. Both proteins were localised to small punctate organelles or vesicles within the intestinal cells of adult worms. There was also weak staining on the microvillar brush border of the intestine. Both proteins also localised to similar vesicles in the intestinal cells of L3 using transmission electron microscopy. Some SAPLIPs dimerise via a head-to-tail mechanism, but the purified recombinant hookworm proteins had C-terminal purification tags which might preclude them from undergoing dimerisation, therefore possibly interfering with the subsequent detection of membrane binding and haemolysis. Similarly, two cDNAs termed Sm-slp-1 and Sm-slp-2 were chosen for further analysis from the human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni. The latter cDNA encoded a double SAPLIP domain. Although recombinant proteins from the two cDNAs were successfully expressed in insect cells, only Sm-SLP-1 was produced at sufficient levels to warrant further investigation. Specific antiserum was raised in mice against Sm-SLP-1 and used in fluorescence microscopy to localise the anatomical expression site to the gastrodermis of both male and female adult worms. Again, and likely due to the inability to remove C-terminal tags from the recombinant protein, potential dimerisation could not be addressed. In addition, no haemolytic activity was observed, but a role in haemolysis cannot be excluded until Sm-SLP-1 is produced in recombinant form with a flush C-terminus. Sm-SLP-1 was considered a putative vaccine candidate due to its anatomic location and potential role in feeding. Vaccination of mice with recombinant Sm-SLP-1 did not result in a decrease in worm burdens or eggs in vaccinated animals. Although antibodies bound to the native protein in the gastrodermis of the parasite, they neither damaged the parasite nor did they interfere with critical physiological processes. However, mice infected with schistosomes did generate a specific antibody response to SLP-1. Similarly, sera from individuals residing in a schistosomiasis endemic area of Brazil also had serum antibodies that recognised Sm-SLP-1. The highest levels of antibodies were detected in subjects with moderate/heavy infections compared with subjects who were exposed to schistosomiasis but egg-negative. This indicates that Sm-SLP-1 could be developed as a biomarker to determine intensity of S. mansoni infection. These studies have identified novel intestinal molecules which potentially play key roles in host-parasite interactions and in the haemolysis of ingested red cells, and might aid in the immunodiagnosis of infections with blood-feeding helminths.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158433</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ovarian cancer: gene expression patterns and aetiological factors</field><field name="creator">Merritt, Melissa Amy</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to further our understanding of the pathway to development of the most common subtype (serous) of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). There is controversy surrounding how serous ovarian tumours develop. Some studies suggest that low malignant potential (LMP) tumours are distinct from higher grade malignant tumours (tumours of moderate (G2) or poor (G3) differentiation) while others have reported similarities in gene expression between LMP and malignant tumours. To learn more about serous carcinogenesis in the current study, gene expression profiles were compared in a panel of serous tumours exhibiting a range of invasive behaviours (benign, LMP and malignant (G2, G3) tumours) and in normal ovaries. Key findings were the identification of significant differences in gene expression between LMP/ malignant tumours and benign tumours/ normal ovaries (Chapter Three). Similarities in gene expression profiles of LMP and malignant tumours were also noted and these results suggest that LMP tumours may develop via pathways that are shared with their higher grade invasive counterparts. Several genes that may play an important role in serous tumourigenesis were also identified and the function of one gene (WNT7A) was examined further in Chapter Four. WNT7A was highly expressed in LMP and malignant tumours compared with little or no expression in benign tumours and normal ovaries. This result was of interest because studies in mice have demonstrated the involvement of Wnt7a during embryonic development of the female reproductive tract from the mullerian ducts. Therefore, it was hypothesised that activation of WNT7A may play a role in the development of EOC, in which the various histological subtypes resemble mullerian duct derivatives. The focus of Chapter Four was to learn more about the role of WNT7A in ovarian cancer by manipulating WNT7A expression levels in ovarian cancer cell lines. Transfection of the CI80-13S ovarian cancer cell line with a WNT7A overexpression vector allowed for the selection of several clones demonstrating overexpression at the mRNA and protein level. A distinct cellular morphology indicative of changes in cytoskeletal organisation was observed. Given the known influence of the actin cytoskeleton on migration capabilities in cancer cells, these results are relevant to tumour progression and further work is being undertaken to investigate these findings. It is also recognised that environmental factors play an important role in the causation of serous ovarian cancer. The aim of Chapter Five was therefore to determine whether established risk factors for ovarian cancer were associated with a gene expression signature in the patient&#146;s tumour tissues. Thus, microarray data from a homogeneous set of serous tumours (including LMP and malignant) were analysed. Key results were the identification of characteristic gene expression profiles associated with age, smoking and parity. This is the first study to look at the influence of environment on gene expression in ovarian tumour tissues and the issues addressed herein provide a methodological basis for integrating molecular biology with epidemiologic factors. In Chapter Six, a pure epidemiological approach was applied to study the role of chronic inflammation in serous ovarian cancer development, in an Australia-wide casecontrol study. In general, little evidence was found to support a major role for inflammation in malignant serous ovarian cancer development. However, consistent findings of increased serous ovarian cancer risk associated with use of perineal talcum powder provides convincing evidence that local inflammation could lead to tumour development in this subset of women. It is possible that LMP tumours may be more strongly associated with inflammation based on suggestions of increased risk associated with pelvic inflammatory disease and the protective effects associated with antihistamine use, although these results require further confirmation. The main aims of this thesis were to advance our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms and aetiological factors that may be involved in serous ovarian cancer development. Cancer is a complex disease, resulting from a combination of genetic events and influenced by environmental exposures. Therefore, future studies that apply a multidisciplinary approach will be essential to study the plethora of genetic and environmental factors that contribute towards cancer development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158434</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prediction of use of cannabis by young adults in an Australian birth cohort</field><field name="creator">Hayatbakhsh, Mohammad</field><field name="description">Cannabis is the most commonly used and abused illicit drug in developed countries, including Australia. Use of cannabis usually begins in adolescence and early adulthood, with the peak age of onset between 16 and 18 years. While cannabis use is widespread, relatively little is known about the family and environmental circumstances that may be implicated in the decision to use cannabis. Such information may provide a basis for developing causal hypotheses to understand better why some people use or become dependent on cannabis. The literature formally distinguishes between use of cannabis, abuse of cannabis and dependence on cannabis, grouping the latter two patterns together under the term &#145;cannabis use disorders&#146;. The investigations included in this thesis examine the relationships of selected family and individual factors with cannabis use and cannabis use disorders (CUD) in early adulthood. The specific objectives were to examine: 1) whether maternal marital status, changes in maternal marital status, and quality of the maternal marital relationship are associated with young adults&#146; cannabis use and use disorders; 2) whether a history of paternal arrest or incarceration predicts young adults&#146; use of cannabis; 3) whether maternal smoking and alcohol consumption are associated with the child&#146;s use of cannabis in early adulthood; 4) whether there is an association between mental health and behavioural problems in children and their later cannabis use and use disorders; 5) whether childhood sexual abuse predicts young adults&#146; cannabis use; 6) whether there is a relationship between childhood school performance and cannabis use in early adulthood; and 7) whether these associations are independent of other factors that may confound the link between the cited exposures. The data were taken from the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy (MUSP), a longitudinal study of mothers and children which began in Brisbane, Australia, in 1981. Some 7223 mothers and their live singleton children constituted the birth cohort. Data were initially collected when pregnant women presented for their fist antenatal visit (at an average of 18 weeks&#146; gestation). Mothers were re-interviewed 3-5 days after the birth of their child, and again when the child was 6 months, 5, 14 and 21 years of age. Children were also interviewed at the 14- and 21-year follow-ups. Written informed consent from the mother was obtained at all data collection phases and from the young adult at the 21-year follow-up of the study. Ethics committees at the Mater Hospital and the University of Queensland approved each phase of the study. Young adults&#146; cannabis use and CUD were assessed at the 21-year follow-up via a self-report questionnaire and the CIDI-Auto, an internationally standardised psychiatric assessment. The independent variables on interest &#151; maternal marital status, changes in maternal marital status, quality of marital relationships, history of paternal arrest and incarceration, maternal smoking and alcohol use, child mental health and problem behaviours, childhood sexual abuse, and childhood school performance &#151; were assessed between child age 5 and 21 years. Potential confounding and mediating factors were prospectively measured between the child&#146;s birth and the 14-year follow-up. Binomial and multinomial logistic regression were used to estimate the risk of relevant outcomes for each independent variable, with associations summarised as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The results of adjusted analyses showed that children whose mothers frequently (three or more times) changed their marital status during the child&#146;s development were more likely to report use of cannabis by early adulthood. In addition, adolescents who grew up in step-father families were more likely to report CUD in early adulthood, and a moderate association was found for those children who lived in a family with a high level of marital disagreement. The present analyses also indicated that frequent use of cannabis at age 21 was more likely among young adults with a history of maternal partner arrest. However, there was no significant association between use of cannabis at age 21 and either maternal partner incarceration or single motherhood. Further, maternal smoking at 14 years was associated with more frequent use of cannabis in offspring at 21 years, regardless of maternal smoking at 5 years. In regard to individual factors, attention problems, delinquency, and aggression were associated with both CUD and multiple substance use disorders in early adulthood, with delinquent behaviour being strongest predictor for CUD. In the present investigations, symptoms of anxiety and depression at 14 years were not associated with young adults&#146; cannabis use or CUD. The data also showed that age of onset and persistence of problem behaviour in children were associated with young adults&#146; CUD. Childhood sexual abuse was associated with use of cannabis in early adulthood, and especially with frequent use of cannabis. Finally, children who had lower school performance at 14 years were more likely to report use of cannabis in early adulthood. All of these patterns persisted after statistical control for a number of potential confounders and, where relevant, in sensitivity analyses that, for example, omitted individuals who had already begun to use cannabis by the time that the 14-year follow-up was conducted. In addition, both follow-up of the cohort and participation in the CIDI-Auto in early adulthood were incomplete, with demonstrable potential for selection bias and additional confounding related to it. However, the principal results described above were apparent even when selective attrition within the cohort was taken into account. What, then, has been learned about why some people use cannabis and others do not? Young adults who report use of cannabis or who have evidence of cannabis abuse or dependence at this stage by 21 years differ in a number of ways from those who have never used cannabis. If the demonstrated relationships with the independent factors examined in this study are causal, the temporal sequence and strength of these associations provide important implications for both treatment and potentially prevention. It is expected that prevention programs that effectively address these risk factors might help to reduce cannabis use and use disorders in adolescents and young adults. At the time this thesis was submitted, the bulk of the material it contains had either already been published or had been submitted for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The great part of the thesis is therefore presented in the format of manuscripts of scientific papers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158642</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF A MULTI-AGENT APPROACH TO TRAFFIC SIGNAL CONTROL USING TRAFFIC SIMULATION</field><field name="creator">Nigarnjanagool, Suphasawas</field><field name="description">This thesis is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of using recent software development techniques based on distributed agent technologies to develop a decentralised multi-agent traffic signal control system. The motivation for this work stemmed from a recognition of the limitations of existing traffic signal control methodologies and an acknowledgement that traffic control is a large-scale, complex, dynamic problem with highly nonlinear characteristics. A review of existing systems revealed a number of challenges and limitations and showed that the majority operated principally on pre-defined plans which were suitable only for pre-determined situations. As a result, they failed to control unexpected conditions when traffic flows changed rapidly. The performance of existing systems was also found to suffer during over-saturated conditions and the main challenge in this thesis was formulated as the need to shift from controlling near-saturated conditions to the requirement for traffic control during over-saturated conditions. This thesis adopted a traffic simulation approach for the evaluation of the proposed multi-agent traffic control system. It also introduced a number of contributions in the calibration and validation process using techniques for queue discharge headways collected from a field survey in addition to comparing the intersection performance measures obtained from the traffic simulator with those obtained from the well-known traffic signal optimisation tools such as the aaSIDRA software. The calibrated parameters were also evaluated and verified using macroscopic traffic flow theory which showed that the flow-density, speed-density and speed-flow relationships can be adequately reproduced using the calibrated and chosen parameters. The calibration and validation results showed overall model errors in the range of 10 to 14 percent, which was a very good result that provided a high level of confidence in the ability of the model to reproduce field conditions. In the multi-agent traffic signal control system, each traffic signal controller was modelled as an agent software and was equipped with two optimisation models: a signal timing optimisation model called &#147;Cycle Optimiser&#148; and a traffic signal coordination algorithm called &#147;Offset Optimiser&#148;. The agents were modelled as distributed systems with ability to collaborate and coordinate activities to achieve local and global goals. Each agent (intersection) was comprised of knowledge about intersection parameters, and had the abilities to generate the optimal control plans and collaborate with other agents through a traffic signal optimisation model. Each agent was also assigned a set of individual preferences or settings including objectives, a set of pre-determined plans and algorithms to generate plans. Each control agent received traffic flow data at the end of every cycle from vehicle loop detectors at the intersection&#146;s stop line and also received vehicle occupancy data from the same loops at the beginning of the cycle. Traffic flow data was then used by the signal optimisation model to generate the control plans based on real-time traffic conditions. The multi-agent control strategy was comparatively evaluated with a fixed time control system under two traffic conditions: recurring and non-recurring congestion. It was shown to be superior to fixed time control systems for isolated intersections. It increased the intersection flows by 11.64 percent and increased the travelling speed by 23.23 percent. In addition, it also reduced the number of stops by 43.36 percent and consequently reduced the intersection delay by 44.15 percent. The agent control system was also superior to fixed time control systems for coordinated intersections. It resulted in increasing the network flows by 5.05 percent and average travel speeds by 5.57 percent compared with a coordinated fixed time system. During incident conditions, it was also superior to fixed time control systems. Its performance was further enhanced by providing mid-block detectors. For minor incident cases, these benefits included increases of 3.64 and 4.14 percent in traffic flows and average speeds, respectively. These were accompanied by decreases of 10.50 and 11.70 percent in average delays and queue lengths, respectively. A comparative evaluation between the agent control system and SCATS-generated signal timing plans for a case study in Bandung, Indonesia, showed that for the AM peak, an unsupervised agent-based controller increased the overall network flows by 2.85 percent and the average travel speed by 3.23 percent. It also reduced the number of stops by 2.21 percent and the network delays by 4.84 percent, compared with the SCATS plans. Overall, the multi-agent control system was shown to reduce the average delay on the network by at least 25.74 percent when compared with the SCATS plans. The benefits were larger at 28.33 percent when the SCATS plans were compared with a coordinated multi-agent traffic signal control system. These combined findings clearly demonstrate the potential of agent-based traffic signal control systems in enhancing performance, reducing congestion and improving environmental air quality. This thesis has successfully achieved its stated objectives by demonstrating the feasibility of applying distributed systems of multi-agent algorithms to traffic signal control and by evaluating its performance and comparing it to optimised fixed-time control systems under recurring and non-recurring (incident) traffic conditions using microscopic traffic simulation tools. The study also successfully achieved a number of secondary objectives including advancing the state of knowledge in the calibration and validation of traffic simulation models; enhancing the procedures for signal coordination; improving the methods for reliable demand prediction and forecasting; and formulating general methodologies and frameworks that can be used for evaluating the performance of Intelligent Transport Systems. Finally, the thesis identified a number of issues as potential research areas in this field. These included the potential to improve the accuracy of the algorithm using additional real-time data such as vehicle occupancy from loop detectors; the need to use artificial intelligence approaches based on neural networks for speed estimation and short-term traffic forecasting; interfacing the agent system to an automated incident detection algorithm so that non-recurring congestion is more easily identified, and broadening the coverage of the road networks, testing a much large number of intersections and testing the computational efficiency of the multi-agent traffic signal control systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158326</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring and modelling threats to koala populations in rapidly urbanising landscapes: Koala coast, south east Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Preece, Harriet Jane</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Koala -- Ecology -- Queensland, Southeastern.</field><field name="subject">Koala -- Habitat -- Queensland, Southeastern.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158435</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of an analytical framework to explain how and why surgical errors occur</field><field name="creator">Joughin, Karen</field><field name="description">Surgical errors are costly to patients, surgeons and society. New strategies for reducing harmful errors would be valuable. However, currently little is known about how and why surgical errors occur. It is therefore difficult to know how best to tackle the problem. This work was undertaken to develop and assess a theory-based analytical framework for systematically explaining how and why surgical errors occur. The new framework was based on a means-ends analysis of performance of a surgical procedure, which reveals the mechanisms of error and constraints contributing to the error. Four criteria were used to assess the framework: &#147;fit&#148; (the product of analyses faithfully represented the error phenomenon), &#147;understanding&#148; (people in the field understand the results), &#147;generality&#148; (framework generic and flexible enough to be applicable to a variety of error types in different situations and could be converted into a form-based format for large-scale multi-centre studies) and &#147;control&#148; (results lead to the identification of strategies to reduce the harmful errors). In the first of four studies, the framework was used to study difficulties experienced by highly respected surgeons during surgical procedures. The explanations for the difficulties were judged by participants and an additional surgeon to be understandable, credible, valid and representative of the difficulties, demonstrating that the criteria of &#147;fit&#148; and &#147;understanding&#148; had been met. In the second study the framework was used to study difficulties encountered by clinicians from different fields performing chest tube insertion procedures under a variety of conditions. Clinicians who perform chest tube insertion procedures determined the explanations to be understandable and valid. The explanations were used to identify hypothetical strategies for preventing the difficulties demonstrating the potential of the framework to meet the control criterion. The ability of the generic framework to be adapted to the specific situations of chest tube insertion demonstrated &#147;generality&#148;. In the third study, the framework was used in a study of unintended injuries to anatomical structures during surgical procedures performed in the operating theatre. When incidents were analysed using the framework, further evidence was provided of the clinical value of the analytical framework and its &#147;generality&#148;. In the fourth and final study, a form-based data collection tool was developed from the framework to study ureter injuries during colorectal and gynaecological procedures, in a large-scale multi-centre study. Again, the &#147;generality&#148; of the framework and its ability to be adapted to produce new information regarding a clinically significant harmful error in a large multi-centre study was demonstrated. The model and analytical framework represent a new way of conceptualising how and why surgical errors occur. Rather than focussing on what the surgeon did wrong, the approach focuses on constraints that made it difficult for the surgeon to do what was required or intended. Also, the means-ends abstraction hierarchy, which is a tool used in engineering to represent physically coupled causal or intentional work systems for design purposes, has been adapted for use in understanding errors and designing errorprevention strategies. The modifications may be useful in understanding and designing error-prevention strategies in other fields as well. This work has medical-legal implications because it provides the means to understand errors more deeply and allows the assumption of negligence to be critically examined. Above all, this work has practical implications. A by-product of the studies conducted in this research program has been a better understanding of some clinically significant problems and direction regarding how to manage them. The analytical framework will allow harmful surgical errors to be understood and it will guide the development of new strategies for making surgical procedures safer for patients.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158643</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measuring Changes in Self-Reported and Observer-Rated Quality of Life Following Psychiatric Deinstitutionalisation</field><field name="creator">Drake, Suzanne Danielle Brigid</field><field name="description">Background Debate remains heated as to whether deinstitutionalisation as an international movement has impacted positively on the quality of life of the individuals that were relocated under this policy. The Queensland model (Project 300) involved collaboration between three government departments. The department of Public Works and Housing provided priority housing for the consumers discharged under the initiative, Queensland Health provided clinical case management services, and Disability Services Queensland oversaw the provision of lifestyle support for the consumers. It was hoped that this model would result in improvement in functioning and quality of life. Aims To document changes in reported quality of life at six, 18 and 36 months post-discharge for a cohort of psychiatric consumers who have moved from a tertiary psychiatric setting to the community. Measures of quality of life were obtained from both subjective (consumer) and objective (case manager) perspectives so that levels of agreement may be ascertained. Methods Of the 218 clients discharged under the Project 300 initiative over a six-year period, 181 (83%) consented to participate in the Evaluation of Project 300, and this study describes outcomes relating to this group. At six, 18 and 36 months post-discharge, consumers completed the Quality of Life Index - Mental Health (QOL-MH) (Diamond et al., 1993) with the assistance of a research officer. At six, 18 and 36 months post-discharge, case managers providing clinical services to this consumer group completed the Provider Version of the Wisconsin Quality of Life Scale. This scale provides both objective and subjective measures of quality of life. Results Clients perceived themselves to be performing in a favourable direction on each domain and overall, with all mean scores being positive (p&lt;0.05) at six months post-discharge. Few significant changes in quality of life were found for clients between six and 18 months, or six and 36 months post-discharge. Demographic variables were Source of Referral, Primary Diagnosis, Gender, Number of Readmissions, Number of Support Hours and Age at Discharge, and they revealed no consistent, overall significant effects on quality of life. Clients receiving up to 20 hours of lifestyle support per week were functioning at a significantly higher level on the Activities of Daily Living domain than were the clients that were receiving 20 hours or more of lifestyle support per week. Unlike the ratings made by the clients, providers did not rate their respective clients as performing as positively on each domain or overall score. Some of the scores were even in the negative direction, indicating that functioning on the respective domain was poor, and in some cases, significantly poor. Case managers identified significant improvement on two domain scores between six and 18 months post-discharge (Psychological Well-Being and Money/Economics), as well as for the total score. Only Psychological Well-Being remained consistent at the three years post-discharge. Their case managers consistently rated clients with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia as performing at a poorer level on the Physical Health domain when compared with those clients whose primary diagnosis differed. Case managers perceived that clients who had no history of readmission to an Acute Psychiatric Unit were performing at a significantly higher level than were those clients who did have a readmission recording. Clients receiving up to 20 hours of support per week were consistently identified by providers as having significantly higher scores for Activities of Daily Living than clients receiving greater levels of support. Clients rated themselves significantly higher than did providers on all domains except Physical Health for which the pattern was significantly reversed. Utility ratings made by both the clients and the providers about the Wisconsin Quality of Life Index as a measurement instrument were favourable. Conclusions Most importantly for this large cohort of clients suffering from severe and chronic mental illness, they were able to successfully make the transition from institutional care to community living with a minimal number of adverse events being evidenced, which is quite an extraordinary achievement. Further to this, clients discharged under the Project 300 model did not &#145;fall between the cracks&#146; (Talbott, 1979) as a consequence of both the number of stakeholders involved in supporting them in the community and the continuity of the care provided. Studies that have investigated outcomes of such intensive case management have indicated that significant improvements in symptomatology, functioning and quality of life should not be expected for this population (King, 2006; Killaspy et al., 2006). The Project 300 model appears to have met the criteria stipulated by authors such as Talbott (1979), Smith (1969), Bachrach (1978) and Wing (1990) when they offered the tenets upon which the process of deinstitutionalisation should be based.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158327</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wireless Communication System Performance Enhancement using Adaptive Array Antennas</field><field name="creator">Al-Ka'bi, Amin Hamdallah Othman</field><field name="description">The application of antenna arrays has been suggested in recent years for mobile communications systems to overcome the problem of limited channel bandwidth, thereby satisfying an ever growing demand for a large number of high bit rate mobiles on communications channels. It has been shown by many studies that when an array is appropriately used in a mobile communications system, it helps in improving the system performance by increasing channel capacity and spectrum efficiency. It also extends the range of coverage, reduces multipath fading, and co-channel interference. These benefits are achieved by adjusting the antenna radiation pattern for a given wireless environment. The main objective of the adaptive antenna array is to reduce the received interference by forming nulls towards the co-channel interference sources, while tracking the desired signal by steering a beam towards it. The sensitivity pattern of the array is adjusted to suit these requirements by combining signals from different antenna elements with appropriate weighting. Here, the knowledge of a reference signal, a training signal, or the direction of the desired signal source is necessary to differentiate the desired signal from the interferers. The term adaptive antenna is used when the weights (gains and phases) applied to the signals induced on the array elements, are regularly updated before combining. The adaptation/updating is used to control the radiation pattern of the array dynamically, according to the requirements of the system. There are many adaptive methods and algorithms to modify the array weights, and to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of the desired and interference signals, each with its advantages and disadvantages. In an optimal adaptive antenna array system the gain and phase of each antenna element is adjusted to achieve the optimal performance of the array in some sense. For example, in steered beam adaptive arrays, the basis for adjusting gains and phases of each element is to obtain maximum output Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) by cancelling undesired interferences while receiving the desired signal. Such an arrangement is referred to as &#147;optimal combining&#148; in the literature. This thesis aims at developing novel analytical and simulation models for assessing the performance of a steered-beam adaptive antenna array with an arbitrary number of variably spaced dipole elements operating with incident narrow-band signals of various bandwidths and powers. The outline of the thesis is as follows: Chapter 1 presents a general overview of the usage of adaptive array antennas in wireless communication systems, including their adaptive algorithms, advantages/disadvantages and performance comparisons. In chapter 2, the performance of the uniformly and non-uniformly spaced adaptive array antennas is investigated. Analytical expressions for assessing their performance are introduced and then computer simulations are performed to illustrate the performance of the array under various operating conditions. In this chapter, the presence of mutual coupling between the array elements is ignored. Chapter 3 presents a treatment of direction-of-arrival estimation algorithms covering a review of many existing direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation methods, including their capabilities and limitations. Chapter 4 presents theoretical and experimental investigations into performances of narrowband uniformly and non-uniformly spaced steered beam adaptive linear dipole array antennas that are subjected to pointing errors and mutual coupling. It is shown that the array's tolerance to pointing errors can be enhanced by controlling the inter-element spacing. Chapter 5 describes the effect of polarized signals (desired and interference) on the performance of uniformly spaced steered beam adaptive array antennas. A comparison between adaptive arrays with single dipole and cross-dipole elements is conducted to show the effect of polarization on their behaviour. It is shown that the cross-dipole array antennas have better performance in terms of the output SINR than the single dipole antenna array antennas if the polarization of the desired signal is unknown, while the single dipole arrays give better performance if the polarization of the desired signal is known. In chapter 6, a new method for computing the parameters of the mobile fading channel is introduced. Investigations into the effect of the mobile fading environment on the performance of the uniformly and non-uniformly spaced steered beam adaptive array are presented. In chapter 7, a novel method of incorporating steered beam adaptive arrays in Direct Sequence-Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA) spread spectrum systems is presented. The performance of the system is investigated in terms of Bit Error Probability (BER).

There has been relatively little promotion decision making research undertaken, with little known on the cognitive processes responsible for the decision. Additionally, no literature exists regarding the best way to train managers to make these decisions. With new data collection and analysis techniques emerging from the human factors field, an opportunity is now available to investigate expert promotion decision making on a cognitive level. The aims of the present research reflect this opportunity. The first aim was to examine how experts make promotion decisions. The second was to identify the decision making differences between expert (senior managers) and novice (junior managers) promotion decision makers. The third aim was to facilitate the development of junior managers&#146; experience through the design of a promotion training program. Three studies were carried out to address these aims. The participants in these studies comprised senior and junior managers from a multinational beverage company. The first study used the critical decision method to elicit knowledge from 16 expert promotion decision makers. The analyses examined the role of decision strategy, situation awareness, and decision evaluation. The findings supported the notion that senior managers make promotion decisions in a manner consistent with recognition-primed decision making theory. A cognitive model of expert promotion decision making was developed from the data obtained in this study. The model highlighted the role of recognition, situation awareness, expectations, verification, and visualisation. The second study was designed to identify the cognitive differences between expert and novice promotion decision making. A Lens Model analysis was conducted on both senior and junior managers within the company. This provided information regarding decision makers&#146; judgments, consistency, and information usage. A promotion decision simulator was developed which presented the managers with 80 hypothetical promotion candidates. The data from the first study provided realistic information to build a representative scenario for the study. The results suggested that senior managers&#146; decision making was significantly more intuitive than novices, who were more analytic. Promotion decision making experience was found to be related to this cognitive decision mode, with more experience being associated with a more intuitive cognitive mode. The final study aimed to accelerate the promotion decision making experience of the same junior managers from the previous study. A coaching program was developed using the information obtained from the previous two studies. The program was evaluated experimentally. Cognitive mode (analytic or intuitive) and coaching format acted as independent variables. The coaching format was either exemplar-based, where the focus was on providing a small number of highly domain-relevant and contextualised examples, or abstractive-based, where the focus was on the use of rules using a large number of decontextualised examples. The study found that the coaching program significantly improved overall promotion decision making skills of junior managers. Furthermore, there was evidence of an aptitude-treatment interaction, where the effect of training format depended on the trainees&#146; cognitive mode. The exemplar-based training format produced better results for junior managers applying an intuitive cognitive mode, while those junior managers applying an analytic cognitive mode performed equally well in both training formats. The research has a wide range of human factors applications, including training, decision aiding, interface design, and knowledge sharing. The thesis used new and more up to date methodology to contribute to the limited empirical literature on promotion decision making. It determined how expert promotion decisions are made in real management contexts, using managers exposed to the same real-world context and situation. The research also described how this expertise can be shared and ultimately transferred to more novice and junior managers. The current research was also able to contribute to the notion that naturalistic, complex, and experiential decisions can be investigated with similar empirical rigour to those more analytic and rational decisions. Organisational psychology will benefit from the application of cognitive and decision making theories to real-world issues and applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158329</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conserving and restoring wildlife in fragmented urban landscapes: A case study from Brisbane, Australia</field><field name="creator">Garden, Jenni</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">0502 Environmental Science and Management</field><field name="subject">Wildlife conservation -- Queensland -- Brisbane</field><field name="subject">Wildlife management -- Queensland -- Brisbane</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158436</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of New Technologies on Tourist Decision Making: The Young Consumers' Perspective.</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Debra Claire</field><field name="description">As the role of technology in society increases, so too does our need to understand how it impacts on our decision making and product choices. Buzz words such as &#145;e-marketing&#146; and &#145;new technologies&#146; highlight the need to keep abreast of new and emerging technologies and how they are adopted by consumers. Arguably the group within society most likely to be adopting these new technologies are our youth (people aged 18-35 years). Many young people have grown up in the &#145;age of technology&#146;, suggesting that they should be a group willing to utilise technology in their information search and decision making processes. Despite the growing importance of E-marketing and the use of new technologies in the tourism industry, little is known about their influence in the information search process; perceived risk in decision making; and the travel choices made. Therefore, the overall aim of this study was to explore the usage patterns and influence of the internet on young people when searching for travel related information and services. From a review of the literature on tourist decision making and destination marketing it became clear that tourist needs are changing, as are their motivations and desires for engagement. One part of this change is the influence of technology in their lives. Providing information about destinations via these new technologies is of little benefit if the target audience is not accessing and positively reacting to this information. Therefore the specific research questions addressed in this study were: 1. What new technologies influence young consumer&#146;s travel information searches? 2. To what extent are young consumers influenced by the use of a variety of online marketing tools during the external information search stage? 3. How trusting are young consumers with the information sourced from new technologies? 4. To what extent does the opportunity to take a virtual tour influence the decision making process? In particular, the perceived risk involved in the decision making process. To answer these questions, a quantitative self administered questionnaire was developed and administered to 550 respondents aged 18 to 35 years of age on location at The University of Queensland. The questionnaire asked young people to provide demographic information about themselves; information on the frequency of their internet usage, particularly in relation to holiday choices; their familiarity with, and usage of, various web site technologies (eg. online familiarity forms, imbedded search engines, virtual reality tours) and; the level of perceived risk associated with the different types of web site technologies when searching for and purchasing travel. Initially, the questionnaire was pilot tested with 50 students at The University of Queensland, and results entered into SPSS and tested for robustness and scale reliability. A Cronbach Alpha Score of .87 was recorded suggesting that the instrument was indeed a reliable and purposeful instrument. Nevertheless, and based on researcher efforts to ensure a high level of face validity for the survey instrument, minor modifications were made to several of the items before the questionnaire was distributed to the larger sample for completion. The purposive sample used for this study represented young people from a wide range of disciplines and nationalities, thereby providing insights into the use of new technologies from a global rather than a local perspective. A total of 511 usable questions were coded and a datafile created using SPSS Version 11.5. The study data was then analysed using frequencies, cross-tabulations, chi-squares with a scale reliability analysis also undertaken. While the adoption of internet usage varied slightly between respondents of different nationalities, the single strongest finding was that females were more likely to engage in planned travel on a more regular basis and they were also more likely to use the internet as an information gathering tool than males. Study findings supported the proposition that the internet is widely used today as a key information gathering tool by different age groups. Importantly, results indicated that no particular age group used it significantly more or less than any another. Subtle but discernible differences, based on gender, were found as to whether sources of information found were either trusted or mistrusted. Differences based on gender were also found in terms of the role such sources played in the decision making process when selecting a travel destination. The findings of this study support the argument that the internet is indeed a powerful and important tool used by younger people when searching for information and services related to the travel and tourism industries. In addition, the research provides some insight as to how travel agencies and web-based marketing operations might better service e-savy consumers looking for particular travel and tourism related services on the internet.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158330</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">LETTERS TO THE EDITOR IN THE LOCAL PRESS: GENRE AND DISCOURSE IN EVERYDAY TEXTS FROM AUSTRALIA AND CHILE</field><field name="creator">Rojas-Lizana, Isolda</field><field name="description">The genre Letters to the Editor (LTEs) in local newspapers brings forth a space in which people can express their daily concerns and interact within their own communities. This thesis studies the generic and discursive features of LTEs in the local press in Australia and Chile. To achieve the first objective of this work, I provide a theoretical overview of the main notions that frame this study, and then I develop the analysis chapters which are guided by three more objectives. First, I examine the characteristics that make LTEs an interactive and situated genre, studying the genre&#146;s components, communicative intention and structural moves. Second, I analyse the discourses found in LTEs from local newspapers of these two countries through a unique and integrationist approach to Discourse Analysis that combines the epistemological principles of Humberto Maturana&#146;s &#145;Biology of Cognition&#146; with analytic tools from the fields of Cognitive Linguistics and Discursive Psychology. Specifically, I analyse letters in which the addressers interact about a topic and take a stand with respect to the &#145;other&#146; in terms of political ideology, in the case of Chile, and sexual orientation, in the case of Australia. I state that the rejection, acceptance or tolerance of the other are linguistically expressed in discursive patterns that constitute the discourse of &#145;Alterspeak&#146;, or discourse about the other. Alterspeak contains strategies, arguments and keywords that ultimately reveal epistemological positions found in the paradigms of rationalism and postrationalism. These views construct realities in which it is considered legitimate to negate or accept the other in terms of the worldview of the letter writer. Third, I provide a comparative analysis of one type of letter present in the LTEs section of Chile and Australia &#150; Letters of Gratitude &#150; in which I contrast these corpora in terms of their formal patterns and the politeness strategies used in their discourse. The analysis demonstrates that this subgenre shares many features in these cultures, especially associated with the expression of emotions. It also elucidates that their differences do not depend solely on the addressers but on the generic and social context which frame their production. All these analyses demonstrate that language as action and as creator of reality emerges in the very features of the genre and its discourses. This allows for the generation of a space within which our many equally legitimate, though not equally desirable, explanatory realities connect and open different possibilities of human coexistence.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158645</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ROLE OF TRANSCRIPTIONAL CO-REGULATORS IN LEUKAEMIC TRANSFORMATION BY THE MYB ONCOGENE</field><field name="creator">Pattabiraman, Diwakar Ram</field><field name="description">The c-myb proto-oncogene and its product (Myb) are key regulators of haemopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation. Myb mRNA is expressed at high levels in most human myeloid and acute lymphoid leukemias. Both normal and activated myb genes encode transcription factors (myb) which bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner and transactivate reporter genes containing appropriate Myb binding sites. Transformation by myb is likely to reflect increased transcription of some of the same genes that are normally regulated by c-myb. Myb can repress certain promoters and potential target genes that may be repressed by Myb have been identified. It has also been shown that several known co-repressors and at least one co-activator (CBP/p300) interact functionally with the Myb protein suggesting that transformation by Myb may be mediated by the coordinate activation of some target genes and repression of others. The interactions of various co-regulators was studied through a series of mutants whose ability to transform haemopoietic cells was tested. These studies provide new information on the mechanism of transformation and leukemogenesis by myb and support our hypothesis that binding of co-factors could be essential for the transforming potential of Myb. Identifying an interaction between Myb and a cofactor that is essential for Myb&#146;s transforming activity provides a target for drug screening and could widen the therapeutic window for inhibition of leukemic cell proliferation. These studies also contribute to our understanding of the process of leukaemogenesis in general, because transformation by myb can be viewed as a model or paradigm that is amenable to experimental analysis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158646</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a Load-Bearing Nanocomposite Biodegradable Scaffold for use in Bone Tissue Engineering</field><field name="creator">Lutton, Cameron James</field><field name="description">The deficiencies of current bone graft substitutes have been a driving force in developing new and more effective bone substitutes. An optimal implant needs to possess the following features: mechanical properties that closely match those of bone, an interconnected porous network (allowing for cell and blood vessel ingrowth), and the capacity to induce a positive interaction with the surrounding tissue (bioactivity). Furthermore, an optimal implant would be absorbed by the body over time and replaced by native bone. To date, no graft alternative has been able to combine all of these aspects. The aim of this thesis was to develop new and improved materials as well as improving scaffold design and manufacturing techniques with the goal of producing a load-bearing bone substitute. In an attempt to mimic the structure of bone the research focussed on a bioabsorbable polymer/mineral composite. A novel process was developed in which poorly crystalline nano-sized hydroxyapatite particles could be distributed throughout a Polyhydroxybutyrate-valerate (PHBV) matrix by taking advantage of particle stabilisation and a dual solvent technique. PHBV was chosen as the polymer because of its mechanical properties, biocompatibility and slow degradation rate, whilst hydroxyapatite is a natural constituent of bone. The process produced a good dispersion of well-bonded, high aspect ratio nanoparticles in the polymer matrix as evident from high resolution TEM. The nanocomposites produced by this process were compared to traditional micronsized hydroxyapatite/PHBV composites. The incorporation of nano-sized hydroxyapatite improved the modulus of the polymer from 700MPa to 2GPa at a maximum concentration of 20% by weight, compared with 1.4GPa for the 20%microcomposite. The compressive yield strength of such a nanocomposite material increased from the 40MPa measured for PHBV and 85MPa for a 20%microcomposite, to 170MPa for the 20%nanocomposite. This figure is equivalent to the compressive strength of cortical bone and is the highest recorded to date for any fully biodegradable polymer composite. In order to produce a load-bearing scaffold it was necessary to improve upon current scaffold design methodologies. Most current scaffold designs rely on open-celled foam configurations, which are unsuitable for load-bearing applications. Since a scaffold requires strength and stiffness as well as interconnected porosity, anisotropic sandwich designs were investigated as possible implants options. By modelling these scaffolds using finite element analysis and adjusting variables such as the width of the porous and solid regions, and overall porosity, it was possible to predict the mechanical properties of these shapes and hence produce a scaffold with improved mechanical properties whilst still retaining interconnected porosity. The scaffolds most suited for this purpose contained 400&#181;m plates and struts 400&#181;m in length, providing a combination of interconnected porosity, 40%, and high axial modulus. This structure retained almost 50% of the stiffness of the solid material and had pore sizes within the biological constraints placed on the design process. To produce the types of structures modelled a novel manufacturing method had to be developed. An effective way to produce highly replicable scaffolds with controlled architectures is through the use of laser processing. By casting a sheet of dye-doped polyvinyl alcohol on polymer substrates it was possible to accurately ablate holes using an argon-ion laser. By controlling the power, dye concentration and exposure time it was possible to accurately and reproducibly create holes from 100&#181;m to 500&#181;m in the dye-doped polymer film. The film, to be used as a reverse mould, was then layered between nanocomposite powder and melt processed. The PVOH is then dissolved out using warm water, leaving a sandwich structure. The scaffolds produced using the nanocomposite materials were considerably stiffer and stronger than those produced using straight PHBV. The values of compressive strength and modulus for the reinforced strut design composite scaffold, 45Mpa and 750Mpa respectively, are the highest recorded values for a biodegradable hydroxyapatite/polymer scaffold. The modulus compares favourably to cancellous bone, with the scaffolds possessing a higher compressive strength. Preliminary in vitro biological testing was also performed on the nanocomposites and the scaffolds. The composite materials improved the osteoblast cell attachment compared with PHBV and tissue culture plastic, but no differences were seen between composite materials. However, the nanocomposite materials enhanced the proliferation of osteoblast cells compared with the microcomposites, indicating that nanomaterials not only improve mechanical properties but may enhance biological activity. The osteoblast cells attached and proliferated on the scaffolds and showed no preference for pore size (size range 200 - 500&#181;m) with all designs performing similarly. Subject to further testing, these fully biodegradable nanocomposite scaffolds have the potential to be used as load-bearing implants.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158437</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION OF THE c-fms PROMOTER BY THE ETS FAMILY OF TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS</field><field name="creator">Constantin, Myrna</field><field name="description">CSF-1, and its cognate CSF-1 receptor encoded by the fms proto-oncogene, controls the proliferation, differentiation and survival of macrophages. The c-fms gene has two promoters, separately directing expression in macrophage and trophoblast cell lineages. The macrophage c-fms proximal promoter is an archetypal myeloid-specific promoter. It lacks elements that normally determine the site of transcriptional initiation. Instead, the promoter structure consists of multiple purine-rich motifs near the multiple transcriptional start sites, which contribute to the different functions of transcriptional initiation. This study focuses on the role of the ETS family transcription factors as regulators, which bind purine-rich motifs as regulators of gene expression in macrophages. The first section of this thesis was concerned with the identification of ETS family transcription factors expressed in mouse macrophages. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that 17 of 24 ETS factors were expressed in macrophages grown from marrow in CSF-1. The macrophage-expressed ETS factors were tested for their ability to regulate the c-fms proximal promoter, via transient transfection analysis. In addition to known factors (PU.1 and ETS-2), ERG and FLI-1 were shown to transactivate the c-fms promoter; conversely NET and TEL trans-repressed activity. This study provides evidence towards ERG as the key factor regulating c-fms expression in embryonic macrophages before other ETS factors are expressed, namely PU.1 The second section of this thesis aimed at identifying the ETS protein-protein interaction network within the macrophage cell. This network was discerned from multiple data sets, including ETS protein partners identified from the modified version of the mammalian two-hybrid system, together with the integration of literature and public database searches. Furthermore, the mammalian two-hybrid system generated previously uncharacterized ETS protein partners. Parameter analysis of the macrophage-ETS-transcriptional network demonstrated the network&#146;s scalefree topology, in accordance with previously characterised protein-protein networks. ETS-2 was an example of a predicted hub within the macrophage-ETS-transcriptional network. ETS-2 is known to be phosphorylated on threonine 72 by CSF-1 regulated MAP kinase activation. These findings demonstrated that ablation of ETS-2 phosphorylation did not have a significant impact on the macrophage-ETStranscriptional network. In addition, ETS-2 phosphorylation was shown to be redundant in c-fms promoter signalling. An alternative ETS factor that may substitute for ETS-2 trans-activation of the c-fms promoter was identified to be NET. The results indicate that ETS factors constitute a transcriptional network within the macrophage cell, with the c-fms gene as one target for regulation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158331</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Grand Deception: Winston Churchill's Role in the Dardanelles Disaster</field><field name="creator">Curran, Thomas</field><field name="description">In 1945 Winston Churchill was acclaimed as a national hero in Britain, and rightly so, for his leadership throughout the Second World War, especially during the dark days of 1940. Thirty years earlier, however, it had been an entirely different story. In 191 5, according to many of his contemporaries, Churchill was reviled and mistrusted throughout Britain, as a dishonest, ego-driven political adventurer and a public danger to the Empire. Indeed his political career would appear to have been placed at considerable risk at this time. Winston Churchill's role in, and responsibility for the Dardanelles/Gallipoli disaster of 1 91 5 has remained a contentious issue ever since that tragic event. On the one hand an overwhelming body of popular opinion, supported by social historians, journalists and biographers of Churchill, has accorded his heroic status retrospectivity, and maintains that he was denied the spectacular victory his visionary strategy merited only by the weakness and irresolution of others - in particular, of Lords Kitchener and Fisher, heads of the British Army and Royal Navy respectively. The alternative, minority opinion, held by leading military and naval experts in 191 5, and supported by a small number of prominent military and naval historians in recent years, maintains that Churchill was almost entirely responsible for the Dardanelles fiasco himself. The primary source evidence necessary for a resolution of this matter is contained within the official documents of the British Cabinet, Admiralty, War Office and Foreign Office; within the private papers of the individuals concerned; and also within the evidence presented to the Dardanelles Royal Commission in 191 6-1 7. This material has been available for public scrutiny since the mid-1 960s with the expiration of the Fifty Year Rule on official secrecy. For some inexplicable reason, however, this evidence has never been subjected to an exhaustive investigation by Britain's scholars which could have determined the exact role played by Churchill in the unfortunate campaign and the extent of his, Lord fisher's and Lord Kitchenergs culpability. It is the purpose of this thesis, therefore, to conduct such an investigation in order to redress that deficiency. The major themes addressed herein will be: Winston Churchill's contempt for the expertise of the admirals, his usurpation of absolute control over naval operations and the consequent naval disasters during the early months of the war; Churchill's deception of everyone involved with his claims for the success of a purely naval operation at the Dardanelles; the various factors which contributed to the naval fiasco, especially Churchill's press release on 20 February, giving the Turks advanced warning of his forthcoming operation; and the central minesweeper problem, persistently ignored by Churchill. His claim that he was denied a spectacular success at the Dardanelles by the intransigence and irresolution of Kitchener and Fisher will be examined in detail. The thesis also documents the means adopted by Churchill to re-write the history of the Dardanelles campaign in order to extricate himself from any blame - in particular, his flouting of the Official Secrets Act and his Privy Councillor's Oath in order to publish official documents in his version of the events surrounding the campaign. The influence of the flawed Dardanelles Commission Report and the enduring impact of Churchill's apologia The World Crisis will be assessed together with the polarisation of opinion regarding Churchill's culpability, which persists to this day.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158647</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MODELLING DRIVER BEHAVIOUR UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF TRAFFIC INFORMATION</field><field name="creator">Panwai, Sakda</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the development of a new generation of dynamic behaviour models that can be used to describe drivers&#146; route choice decisions under the influence of traffic information. The new models can be incorporated in traffic simulation tools to help improve their accuracy in evaluating Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) applications that aim to influence driver behaviour through the use of traffic information and advice. The motivation for this research stemmed from a recognition of the limitations of existing route choice models which were found to lack the necessary features to allow for modelling the impacts of ITS and in particular modelling the behaviour of heterogeneous drivers and dealing with the vagueness inherent in driver decision making and the information received from ITS devices and the road environment. Existing models of drivers&#146; route choice assume that commuters have full knowledge about traffic and road conditions. However, commuters in the real world are highly heterogeneous and have imperfect or incomplete knowledge about traffic information. This research aims to address these limitations by using a relatively new software paradigm (based on agent technologies) which can be used to model drivers as heterogeneous individuals using artificial intelligence techniques based on neural networks and fuzzy logic. The models will be described using individual characteristics, preferences on route choice and attributes based on field surveys. The thesis first explores the potential for using binary choice and artificial neural network (ANN) models for describing driver route choice and compliance with traffic information. The performance evaluation results showed superior performance for the ANN models over the binary choice models in terms of classifying or predicting the categories of drivers most likely to comply (or not comply) with traffic advice. The accuracy of the ANN models was about 96 percent compared to 61 percent for the discrete choice models. Therefore, the ANN modelling approach was adopted and the resulting model was referred to interchangeably as the Neural or Neural Agent or &#147;Neugent&#148; Driver Behaviour Model. One of the main limitations of the Neugent model, however, was its inability to interpret the ANN results and derive behavioural rules. This was addressed in this thesis by developing a fuzzy-neural approach where the fuzzy logic provided a mechanism for representing precise and imprecise knowledge while the neural networks provided the learning capability by using examples of real-life behaviour. Given a set of training data, the neural network determines all the fuzzy rules relating input and output patterns. The fuzzy-neural method was shown to be a suitable approach for modelling route choice behaviour and resulted in the development of models that can be interpreted in terms of ifthen rules. The main contribution of this thesis was the development of the resulting models which were referred to interchangeably as Fuzzy-Neural or Fuzzy-Neural Agent or &#147;Fuzzy-Neugent&#148; driver behaviour models. The Fuzzy-Neugent models comprised a series of three components or separate models: a driver&#146;s compliance with traffic information model (to determine if a driver complies with or ignores the travel advice); a driver&#146;s delay tolerance threshold model (to determine how each driver responds to delays of different durations) and a driver route utility model (to determine how a driver selects between the alternative routes based on the driver&#146;s preferences, familiarity with road conditions etc). The route choice behaviour covered four categories: route attributes (e.g. travel time, travel distance, presence of tolls etc), personal characteristic (e.g. age, gender, education, familiarity with road conditions, income, work-related flexibility), trip characteristics (e.g. work or leisure trip), and road environment conditions (e.g. travel during peak hours under normal and incident conditions). To enable the development of the three constituent models, it was necessary to design a new survey instrument to collect additional information from driver behaviour surveys. The thesis presents the development of a web-based driver behaviour survey which produced a response rate of about 40 percent. Analysis of the reliability and validity of the survey showed a Cronbach&#146; alpha value in the range 0.7 to 0.74, indicating that the survey was reliable. The main advantage of the work reported in this thesis is that the survey sample size for a particular region does not need to be very large. This is due to the fuzzy logic formulations which basically allow for a much larger database to be generated from the sample collected in the field through the use of different membership function shapes which were developed in this thesis. This allows for generating data sets that reflect changes in driver characteristics and the environment without the need for collecting large amounts of new survey data. This guarantees that a large number of representative data sets are available for training the Fuzzy-Neugent models. The development of the Fuzzy-Neugent models involved testing a number of model architectures to predict route choice decisions including their calibration, refinement and validation based on a comparison between the models&#146; outputs and the web survey data. Classification rate (CR), which is a measure of the model&#146;s ability to correctly classify field observations, was used as the performance measure (a perfect classifier has a CR of 100 percent). The best performing models produced a CR in the range 88 to 93 percent for the drivers&#146; compliance models; a CR of 82 percent for the drivers&#146; delay tolerance threshold models; and a CR of 98 percent for the drivers&#146; route utility models. Model validation was undertaken using 72 different survey templates which described different route attributes between two alternative routes. Each respondent was randomly assigned a template and asked to indicate their most favourable route for the trip. The respondents&#146; socioeconomic and route attribute preferences (which they provided in the survey) were then used to estimate the route utility by using the Fuzzy-Neugent models. The actual real-life decisions were then compared against the predicted choices from the models. The model&#146;s aggregated results were excellent and showed a classification rate of 94-95 percent. The validation of the models was also aimed at learning how individuals think and make route choice decisions. A classification rate of 75-76 percent was achieved for the disaggregate model validation. These results indicate a very good degree of accuracy given the complexity of driver behaviour at the individual level. Finally, the thesis presented an application of the Fuzzy-Neugent driver behaviour models. The models were interfaced to the traffic simulator AIMSUN NG and used to evaluate the impacts of an ITS application on incident management. A large number of incidents were simulated with varying durations and severity. Drivers were simulated to receive traffic information advice about the incidents and the Fuzzy-Neugent models were implemented to describe the behaviour of drivers under the influence of the traffic advice. At the aggregate level, the Fuzzy-Neugent models were found to provide a 3 percent improvement in network speeds, 2-6 percent reduction in environmental emissions and more than 1 percent improvement in network travel time. Although some of these benefits appear small on the surface, their impacts in financial terms were found to be substantial. At the disaggregate level, the results showed that drivers who accepted the traffic information gained substantial benefits which included savings of 19&#150;34 percent in travel time, 43 percent saving in fuel consumption and around 58 percent reduction in environmental emissions. Furthermore, it was found that around 17&#150;25 percent of drivers accepted the recommended information; and 12&#150;17 percent complied because the delays exceeded their delay tolerance thresholds. These results clearly demonstrate the benefits of the Fuzzy-Neugent driver behaviour models in providing additional information about the impacts of ITS applications. This information would not have been readily available from current or existing models. The results also show that these new models have a very substantial practical role to play. Any road authority wishing to implement the models for a new region would simply complete a basic survey of driver behaviour (e.g. a web-based survey) and then use the model formulations presented in this thesis to generate the large databases required for training the Fuzzy-Neugent models. The simplicity and feasibility of this approach have been successfully demonstrated in this thesis and shown to produce substantial benefits.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158332</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">VERSATILE LAND-USE INFORMATION FOR LOCAL PLANNING IN INDONESIA: CONTENTS, EXTRACTION METHODS AND INTEGRATION BASED ON MODERATE- AND HIGHSPATIAL RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGERY</field><field name="creator">Danoedoro, Projo</field><field name="description">This research developed a versatile land-use information system (VLUIS) based on moderate- and high-spatial resolution imagery for supporting local planning in Indonesia. It was motivated by the fact that the existing land-use information contained by the Key Dataset for Local Development (KDLD) was not adequate to support environmental planning at local levels in Indonesia. This was due to its inconsistent mapping methods, contents/classification scheme, and inflexibility to be used as an input to local physical planning processes. Although the KDLD was developed by most local coordinating agencies for development planning (Bappedas), the land-use map was not used as a common reference by various local and provincial institutions in assessing the state of environment. Therefore, each institution had a tendency to develop its own land-cover/land-use information, resulting redundant works of land-cover/land-use mapping, which were incompatible to each others. With regard to that problem, the objectives of this study were: (a) to specify land-use related planning tasks at local level in Semarang-Salatiga area, Java, Indonesia; (b) to design a versatile landuse classification scheme for urban and rural environment at local level in Java in order to support various applications in the local planning context; and (c) to develop and verify the versatile land-use mapping methods based on moderate- and high-spatial satellite imagery. Semarang-Salatiga area was chosen due to its relatively complex land-use phenomena and data availability. In this study, two types of satellite image dataset were used, Landsat-7 ETM+ and Quickbird, representing moderate- and high-spatial resolution imagery respectively. To achieve the research objectives, a methodology comprising three stages of activity was developed. The first stage specified local physical planning tasks and their required land-cover/land-use information, based on literature study and interview with 36 stakeholders in the study area. In the second stage, versatile land-use information contents were specified in a classification scheme containing five land-use dimensions, i.e. spectral, spatial, temporal, ecological, and socio-economic. In the third stage, a set of image classification methods was developed for generating all land-use dimension maps with the specified classes. For each type of imagery, the study area was divided into northern and southern parts. The northern part represents more developed/urbanised area, while the southern part represents less developed or rural areas. Multi-spectral classification in terms of both standard and non-standard approaches were explored to derive the spectral-related land-cover classes, while visual interpretation and object-oriented image segmentation were compared to find most accurate method in generating the spatial dimension classes. The standard multi-spectral classification approach made use of original bands as input to the classification process, while the non-standard approach involved texturally filtered and texturally aggregated bands in addition to the original ones. The spectral-related land-cover and spatial dimension maps, supported by a terrain unit map, were integrated in a raster GIS environment to derive the temporal, ecological, and socio-economic maps in separate processing methods. After that, all derived maps were integrated into a single dataset of VLUIS, ready for query-based activation at will and translation to other classification systems. Based on the interview with the respondents, a list of variables related to land-cover/land-use information required by various local planning tasks was regrouped with respect to the developed five land-use dimensions. After that, a classification scheme containing five columns representing spectral-related land-cover, spatial, temporal, ecological, and socioeconomic dimensions were created. The specified classes under each dimension referred to the variables used in various local planning and to the existing, widely used, classification systems. The spectral-related land-cover mapping results showed that standard multi-spectral classification methods using the original spectral bands gave higher accuracy results (84.63% or Kappa=0.8276 for Landsat-7 ETM+ and 68.75% or Kappa=0.6813 for Quickbird) than non-standard classification methods involving textural filtering (80.55% or Kappa=0.7988 for Landsat-7 ETM+ and 66.45 or Kappa=0.6503 for Quickbird) and textural aggregation (66.68% or Kappa=0.6512 for Landsat-7 ETM+ and 63.91% or Kappa=0.6222 for Quickbird) approaches. This was due to the fact that the texture is closer to spatial rather than spectral concept, while the specified categories in the spectral-related land-cover dimension is purposively developed for spectral classification. For the same image coverage and number of classes, Landsat-7 ETM+ gave higher accuracies (84.63% or Kappa=0.8276 for 40 classes, and 87.05% or Kappa=0.8535 for 25 classes) than Quickbird&#146;s (82.81% or Kappa=0.8118 for 40 classes, and 83.23% or Kappa=0.8184% for 25 classes). In terms of spatial dimension mapping, the object-oriented image segmentation could not generate an accurate spatial dimension map in comparison with the visual interpretation, since the categories were specified using location/site and regularity criteria in addition to shape and density, which were not possible to recognise using the available software. However, by integrating the spectral-related land-cover dimension and the visual interpretation-based spatial dimension maps in a raster GIS environment, the temporal, ecological and socio-economic dimension maps could be derived in relatively accurate levels, i.e. with overall accuracies higher than 80%. For all land-use dimensions, the results obtained using Landsat-7 ETM+ and Quickbird imagery consistently showed that rural areas were more accurately classified than urban areas. This study demonstrated that a VLUIS could be developed based on moderate- and highspatial resolution imagery. In this VLUIS, a multi-dimensional classification scheme was developed first, with separate column representing spectral-related land-cover, spatial, temporal, ecological, and socio-economic dimensions. After that, the classification scheme was used as reference in extracting information and mapping each dimension into separate map layers. The five layers were then stacked into a single dataset. An example of querybased translation from the VLUIS to the Indonesian National Land Agency (BPN)&#146;s classification system was given to show its versatility. However, it was also realised that land-use is too complex to be mapped merely using remotely sensed imagery and be modelled simply based on the five dimensions. With its limitations, remote sensing should be put in the context of complementary and alternative approach, where field surveys often fail to generate comprehensive, efficient and rapidly provided information that is required in a planning process. This study also recommends future work for more effective impact of the results, i.e. (a) development of information extraction methods of versatile land-use information system (VLUIS)&#146;s dimensions using state of the art image and spatial data analyses, (b) development of translation system from the VLUIS to widely used landcover/ land-use classification schemes, and (c) demonstration of versatility in supporting several applications related to local planning tasks.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Land-cover</field><field name="subject">land-use</field><field name="subject">Versatile Land-use Information System</field><field name="subject">remote sensing</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158438</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PERIPHERAL MECHANISMS OF CD8+ T CELL TOLERANCE IN H-2b K14E7 TRANSGENIC MICE</field><field name="creator">Narayan, Sharmal</field><field name="description">The human papillomavirus (HPV) early protein 7 (E7) represents one of the major transforming proteins in HPV-associated epithelial malignances and as such is considered a potential target for T cell mediated activity against HPVassociated epithelial tumours. Nevertheless, patients with HPV-associated cervical carcinomas are reported to generate ineffectual E7-specific cellular responses to either endogenous or vaccine administrated E7. Previous studies have reported that HPV16 E7 expression in peripheral keratinocytes of H-2q transgenic mice (K14E7 transgenic mice) facilitates global downregulation of CD8+ T cell responses, suggesting that the E7 oncoprotein has the ability to actively tolerize components of the immune system. The aim of this study was to confirm the existence of peripheral CD8+ T cell tolerance in the newly generated H-2b K14E7 mouse line and to utilize this new mouse line to understand the underlying mechanism(s) behind CD8+ T cell tolerance in K14E7 transgenic animals. Downregulation of CD8+ T cell function were verified in H-2b K14E7 mice. Furthermore, immunologically H-2b K14E7 animals were shown to behave similarly to previously described K14E7 transgenic mice lines. To demonstrate peripheral CD8+ T cell tolerance in H-2b K14E7 mice, the function of adoptively transferred E7-specific and Ovalbumin (OVA)-specific CD8+ T cells were assessed in the periphery of these animals, with the hypothesis that these adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells would be rendered unresponsive due to inhibitory influences within the H-2b K14E7 peripheral environment. Short-term transfers of E7-specific and OVA-specific CD8+ T cells was shown to significantly enhance E7-specific and OVA-specific CD8+ T cell responsiveness respectively, in H-2b K14E7 mice. However, over time antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responsiveness in H-2b K14E7 transfer recipients declined, which at least in the E7-specific CD8+ T cell transfer situation correlated with a progressive reduction in transferred E7-specific CD8+ T cell numbers in the spleen of H-2b K14E7 mice. Further in vivo tracking experiments revealed that transferred E7- specific CD8+ T cells were not being deleted in the periphery of H-2b K14E7 animals over time but were preferentially accumulating in the skin. Consistent with these findings, accumulation of E7-specific CD8+ T cells was also evident in the skin of native H-2b K14E7 animals and furthermore these CD8+ T cells were found to be functionally E7 unresponsive. Interestingly, elevated numbers of CD4+ Foxp3+ cells were detected in the skin of H-2b K14E7 mice, with H-2b K14E7 skin-derived CD4+ CD25+ cells shown capable of suppressing E7- specific interferon-5 (IFN-5) production by in vitro activated CD8+ T cells. Increased percentages of Foxp3+ cells were also evident within the CD4+ CD25+ population found in the spleen and skin-draining lymph nodes of H-2b K14E7 mice. Moreover, elevated numbers of Foxp3+ cells within H-2b K14E7 skindraining lymph node CD4+ CD25+ cells correlated with increased suppressive ability. Depletion of CD4+ or CD25+ cells in H-2b K14E7 mice resulted in enhanced E7-specific and OVA-specific CD8+ T cell responsiveness following specific peptide immunization, thus confirming a role for CD4+ CD25+ cells in regulating CD8+ T cell tolerance in these transgenic animals. In addition, significant suppression of E7-specific IFN-F production by activated CD8+ T cells in C57BL/6 mice was achieved by adoptive transfer of H-2b K14E7 CD4+ cells. Dendritic cells (DCs) harvested from naive H-2b K14E7 skin-draining lymph node were shown to express lower levels of costimulatory molecules when compared to non-transgenic DCs. Moreover, incubation of E7-specific CD8+ T cells with E7 pulsed H-2b K14E7 skin-draining lymph node DCs resulted in reduced IFN-F production following T cell activation. In conclusion, this study highlights a role for CD4+ CD25+ cells and tolerogenic DCs in maintaining peripheral CD8+ T cell tolerance in H-2b K14E7 mice. These results provide some insight into how HPV16 E7 may influence the immune system of patients with cervical carcinomas and other HPV-associated epithelial cancers and may have implications for immunotherapies against such malignancies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158648</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cellular mechanisms of axon targeting in the regenerating olfactory system</field><field name="creator">Chehrehasa, Fatemeh</field><field name="description">Mammalian olfactory neurons reside with the olfactory neuroepithelium lining the nasal cavity and target specific regions of neuropil within the olfactory bulb in the brain referred to as glomeruli. Primary olfactory neurons in the mouse express one of ~1000 odorant receptors. The neurons expressing the same odorant receptor gene are typically restricted in their distribution to one of four broad zones in the olfactory neuroepithelium, and project to at least two topographically-fixed glomeruli, one each on the medial and lateral surfaces of the olfactory bulb. Throughout life, primary olfactory neurons undergo continuous cell turnover. Mature primary olfactory neurons have a limited lifespan and are replaced by proliferating progenitor cells within basal layers of the neuroepithelium. Unlike in other regions of the nervous system this means that new axons are continually growing along the olfactory and navigating to their target sites. A number of candidate guidance molecules have been identified within the olfactory system that contributes in guiding of olfactory axons within olfactory pathway; however the molecular interactions responsible for growth and guidance remain unknown. Furthermore the role of the target tissue, the olfactory bulb, in providing guidance cues to the olfactory axons is unclear. There were three principal aims of the present thesis. First, to investigate the sorting behavior of olfactory and vomeronasal organ axons during regeneration. Second, to understand the underlying role of the olfactory bulb in formation of the outer layers of the olfactory bulb. Third, to assess the role of the olfactory bulb in guiding axons to their glomerular targets during development. The first aim of this thesis was to understand how primary olfactory and vomeronasal organ axons target specific regions of the olfactory bulb. The sorting behaviour of these axons was examined following neonatal unilateral olfactory bulbectomy. Bulbectomy induced widespread ipsilateral death of the primary olfactory and vomeronasal organ neurons within the nasal cavity and vomeronasal organ, respectively. After four weeks, many new sensory axons had re-grown into the cranial cavity and established a prominent plexus with evidence of dense tufts that were similar in gross appearance to glomeruli. Axons expressing the cell adhesion molecule OCAM, which normally innervate the ventrolateral and rostral halves of the main and accessory olfactory bulbs respectively, were found to sort out and segregate from those axons not expressing this molecule within the plexus. Sorting was also observed for axon subpopulations which were expressing specific cell surface glycoconjugates. In addition, vomeronasal organ axons formed large discrete bundles that segregated from main olfactory axons within the plexus. The second aim of the thesis was to understand the underlying role of the olfactory bulb in development of the outer layers of the olfactory bulb. The olfactory bulbs in OMP-IRES-LacZ and P2-IRES-tau-LacZ neonatal mice were unilaterally removed and replaced with artificial biological scaffolds molded into the shape of an olfactory bulb. Regenerating axons projected around the edge of the cranial cavity at the periphery of the artificial scaffold and were able to form an olfactory nerve fibre layer and, to some extent, a glomerular layer. Our results reveal that olfactory axons are able to form rudimentary cytoarchitectonic layers if they are provided with an appropriately shaped biological scaffold. The third aim of this thesis was to understand the role of the olfactory bulb in the formation of the olfactory nerve pathway. A model was developed whereby the gross shape of the olfactory bulb in P2-IRES-tau-LacZ neonatal mice was disrupted without perturbing olfactory nerve connections. It was demonstrated that the topography of axons expressing the P2 odorant receptor was perturbed when the normal shape of the olfactory bulb was altered. P2 axons instead projected to multiple inappropriate glomeruli surrounding their normal target glomerulus. Our results support the hypothesis that local guidance cues in the bulb direct the final targeting of olfactory axons. In conclusion, the results of this thesis revealed that the sorting and convergence of axons occur independently of the olfactory bulb and are probably attributable either to inherent properties of the axons themselves or to interactions between the axons and accompanying glial ensheathing cells. The bulbectomy studies clearly revealed that the olfactory bulb does not provide any tropic substance that either attracts regenerating olfactory axons into the cranial cavity or induces these axons to form a plexus around its outer surface. However, to the shape of the olfactory bulb is important for directing olfactory axons to their appropriate topographic glomerulus. It is postulated that the surface of the olfactory bulb contains topographic guidance cues that direct the final targeting of olfactory axons. The nature of these cues remains to be determined.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158333</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of SOCS3 by growth hormone, prolactin and prostaglandin E2</field><field name="creator">Barclay, Johanna</field><field name="description">Suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) 3 is a negative regulator of cytokines and growth factors that signal through class I cytokine receptors, and as such, modulates the responsiveness of cells to cytokine stimulation. One of the dominant signalling pathways employed by cytokines is the Janus kinase/Signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, and SOCS3 is a product of this pathway, and specifically inhibits this pathway, in a negative feed-back loop. SOCS3 signaling contributes substantially to immune function and response to immune challenge, development and function of reproductive tissues in particular the mammary gland, and energy homeostasis. Deregulation of cytokine signalling has been implicated in numerous disease states, including tumourogenesis, making SOCS3 an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of such conditions. In order for SOCS3 expression to be manipulated for therapeutic use, it is crucial that the signalling pathways that are involved in its regulation in response to different ligands are elucidated. This thesis presents three models of SOCS3 transcriptional regulation. Chapter 2 details SOCS3 regulation in response to GH treatment in a pro-B cell line that has been stably transfected with the human growth hormone receptor, BaF3/hGHR cells. In this haematopoietic model, SOCS3 expression following GH treatment is dependent on JAK activation, and the phosphorylation of STAT5b, which binds to the proximal STAT response element (SRE) on the SOCS3 promoter. In addition, GH-induced SOCS3 expression is also dependent on Jun-activated kinases (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK), the recruitment of c-Fos and c-Jun to the AP1/CRE motif, and FKHRL to the overlapping FOXO regulatory element on the promoter. In contrast, CREB, which is constitutively bound to the AP1/CRE element on the SOCS3 promoter, is removed following GH treatment, although remains associated with the c-Fos/c-Jun complex. Finally, overexpression of SOCS3 protein in BaF3/hGHR cells causes decreased proliferation, whilst transfection with SOCS3 siRNA causes increased proliferation, and augments GH-induced proliferation. This study presents novel findings for the regulation of SOCS3 by GH. Chapter 3 is a study of PRL-induced SOCS3 expression in T47D breast cancer cells. Similar to the GH study, SOCS3 expression in T47D cells following PRL treatment is dependent on STATs binding to the proximal SRE on the promoter. However T47D cells possess constitutively active STAT3 and STAT5, and PRL treatment causes activation of STAT1 and further activation of STAT5. Gel shift assays reveal that STAT1, 3 and 5 are all capable of binding to the SOCS3 promoter depending on cellular conditions, although it appears that STAT5 is the most potent activator of the SOCS3 promoter. In addition, PRL-induced STAT5 activation is, in part, independent of JAK activation, as is SOCS3 expression. Finally, SOCS3 promoter activity in T47D cells is dependent on the GC-rich region, and mutation of this region reduces basal promoter activation and prevents further activation by PRL. Sp1 was found to bind to this region of the promoter in a protein kinase a (PKA)-dependent manner. This is the first study to show the involvement of Sp1 on SOCS3 regulation. Chapter 4 outlines the signalling pathway employed by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a lipid mediator involved in immune function and implicated in tumourogenesis, in the regulation of SOCS3 expression in T47D cells. In contrast to PRL- and GH-stimulated SOCS3 expression, PGE2 treatment causes upregulation of SOCS3 expression independently of STAT activation. Rather, PGE2 signals through the G-protein coupled receptor EP4 to cause PKA-dependent recruitment of Sp1 to the GC-rich region of the SOCS3 promoter, and this alone is sufficient for the initiation of transcription. Finally, overexpression of SOCS3 in T47D cells causes a significant reduction in STAT3 expression, whilst having little effect on STAT1 or STAT5 activation or expression. STAT3 plays an important role in the mammary gland during involution, where it induces apoptosis. However in breast cancer cells STAT3 is thought to be pro-oncogenic, and its expression and activation is associated with a proliferative and metastatic phenotype. Therefore it was surprising that overexpression of SOCS3 caused increased proliferation in T47D cells, given its effects on STAT3 expression. Together these three studies provide novel findings as to the regulation of SOCS3 expression, and indicate that this process is highly dependent on the cellular environment, which is influenced by the cell type in question, and the stimulating ligand. In light of this information, SOCS3 expression could be elegantly regulated in a cell- and ligand-specific manner, with obvious therapeutic potential.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158649</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The diffusion and social impact of online news: Studying the past and present to understand the future of the Internet as a news medium</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, An Duc</field><field name="description">This thesis attempts to fill in the general gap in scholarly research into the diffusion and social impact of online news both inside and outside Australia. Using historical and survey data, it explores the past and present of online news development to predict its future in both terms of online news production (a producer-centric perspective) and online news uses (a user-centric perspective). In particular, the thesis aims to investigate social and technological factors that influence the adoption and use of online news and online news technologies in the newsroom and among the general public, with a stronger focus on the latter. Beginning with the industrial context of the 1990s, when the world-wide web generated hyperbole about the Internet as a powerful news medium, the thesis goes back to the pre-web history of online news businesses, exploring the interaction between technologies and society to argue that seeing the technical potential online news as the primary driver of its diffusion might be misleading. It then explores the uptake of online news in Australia within a global context, using empirical data from two national surveys to investigate socio-technical determinants of public adoption/use of online news and the effect of online news and information use on the use of traditional media sources. In order to do this, this thesis adopts and integrates a range of macro- and micro-level theories from the broad fields of media and communication studies, economics, psychology and sociology, including the evolutionary and social-conflict perspectives on media development (DeFleur &amp; Ball-Rokeach, 1989); the governance of supervening social necessities and the law of suppression of radical potential in media history (Winston, 1998); innovation diffusion theory (Rogers, 2003); different uses and gratifications perspectives, especially the structural approach to media audience formation and expectancy-value theory (Blumler &amp; Katz, 1974; McQuail, 1997; Palmgreen, 1983; Palmgreen &amp; Rayburn, 1984; Rosengren, Wenner &amp; Palmgreen, 1985). The key arguments and findings of the thesis include the following: From a producer-centric perspective, despite its seeming sudden emergence in the 1990s, online news &#150; like any other news form &#150; has been evolving for about 160 years from the &#147;crude&#148; form of consumer news services over the telegraph to news services over the telephone and the fax machine to videotex of the 1980s and today&#146;s Internet-based news. This evolution has taken place largely because of attempts by media businesses to expand and/or defend markets in the face of technologies. Like the Internet of the 1990s, the technological power of some pre-web online news forms generated much fear and excitement among traditional publishers/broadcasters. Some of these new technologies met with failure, some enjoyed a modest success, and some were off and on again. The success or failure of these online news services depends on diverse social factors such as legal environments, cultural norms, and certainly, market demands. More recently, the traditional media&#146;s defensive culture in dealing with new technologies has been acting both as accelerators and brakes on the development of online news. From a user-centric perspective, the study finds that the Internet has reached the status of a mainstream news medium, with its penetration still growing in Australia and other developed segments of the world. Along with this, public participation via online news platforms has become a crucial part of Internet culture. This fast penetration of online news into people&#146;s life has been more or less driven by the medium&#146;s relative advantages over older media, defined across six dimensions: convenience of use, immediacy, content richness, news on demand, multimedia content/format, and participation opportunities. Of these, immediacy and content richness features are the most important technical determinants. In addition to online news attributes, the study finds a strong impact of three other groups of factors on the way online news is adopted, used and integrated into daily life: (1) social locators (education, income, employment status, job types, sex, age and living areas); (2) news orientation and behaviours (news needs, news dependency, general enjoyment of keeping up with the news, news use habits, and news exchange habits); and (3) Internet experience (the extent to which one can access, use, enjoy and depend on the Internet in daily life). Further, the analyses of survey data show that the more people receive news and information from the Internet, the more they do it from traditional sources, especially information-intensive sources like newspapers. Therefore, although old and new media do compete for people&#146;s resources, they will complement rather than replace each other. The implications of these findings are discussed in detail in the final chapter. From a producer-centric perspective, the thesis concludes that as the Internet has established itself as a major news source, the same fear-driven innovation culture of traditional media that has been a major cause of their reluctance to invest in Internet news might soon lead to a second stage of its development, one in which the radical potential of online news will be more aggressively embraced. From a user-centric perspective, the thesis results in a forecasting model of online news adoption/use, which encompasses the above four groups of social and technical determinants, plus innovativeness (the extent to which one is open to and ready to adopt new technologies) &#150; a concept that is theoretically explored but not empirically tested in the thesis. This model implies that the Internet is widening the long-recorded information gap between people with high and low socio-economic status and between the technology haves and have-nots in society. The negative and positive implications of the development of public online participation for journalism and the public sphere &#150; as well other implications of online news uptake &#150; are also discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158334</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of pain cognitions on perceived disability in people with chronic pain</field><field name="creator">Deen, Michael</field><field name="description">Chronic pain is a common condition that impacts on an individual&#146;s ability to engage in functional tasks such as self-care, domestic chores and paid work. In order to reduce the burden of chronic pain conditions, pain management clinicians and researchers have recognised the importance of identifying factors that contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic pain and disability. They have also articulated the need to assess the outcomes of pain management intervention using instruments that measure the impact of pain on daily functioning. Research over the years has consistently demonstrated a limited relationship between physical pathology and a person&#146;s functional abilities. However, studies that have approached pain using a biopsychosocial frame of reference have shown that pain cognitions, that is a person&#146;s belief&#146;s, appraisals and expectancies regarding their pain, have a significant role in determining the impact of pain on an individual&#146;s capacity to manage pain and participate in daily activities and social roles. As such, there has been a multitude of research over the last two decades into the relationship between pain cognitions and the impact and experience of pain. Using a cross-sectional design, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between pain cognitions, specifically pain-related fear, catastrophising and selfefficacy, and levels of disability experienced by patients attending a Multidisciplinary Pain Centre. Disability was defined in accordance with the World Health Organisation&#146;s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) definition, that is a) activity limitation and b) participation restriction. The study also aimed to investigate the ICF domains of activity limitation and participation restriction to provide evidence that these concepts are separate constructs. One hundred and sixty-one patients with chronic pain of non-cancer origin attending a Multidisciplinary Pain Centre at a metropolitan tertiary hospital over a ten month period were recruited to the study. One hundred and twelve patients attending the inpatient pain management programme and 49 patients attending the outpatient pain management programme completed a battery of self-report questionnaires prior to the commencement of cognitive-behaviourally based multidisciplinary intervention. Self-report measures included the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, Pain Catastrophising Scale, Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, Disability Anxiety Stress Scales - 21, Spinal Function Sort and Pain Disability Index. Information related to pain intensity and duration and demographic factors such as age and employment status was also obtained. A series of hierarchical regression analyses were performed to determine the relationship between pain cognitions (pain-related fear, catastrophising and self-efficacy) and perceived disability. Variables were entered into the regression analyses in an apriori manner, based on substantive theory, in order to identify the unique predictive capacity of particular pain cognitions in predicting disability over and above the other pain cognitions included in the study. The findings of this study suggested that in predicting the impact of chronic pain on a person&#146;s ability to perform physical tasks and participate in life roles, pain cognitions should be considered over and above pain intensity, pain duration and certain demographic variables. Furthermore, the findings identified self-efficacy as a stronger predictor of perceived disability, that is of both activity limitation and participation restriction, than pain-related fear and catastrophising. This study also provided support for the developing area of research indicating that disability is a multifaceted concept, the components of which should be considered distinct constructs. This finding was evidenced by a modest relationship between activity limitation and participation restriction (r = .543). It was further demonstrated through two hierarchical regression analyses; one with activity limitation as the dependent variable and one with participation restriction as the dependent variable. Different predictive models with distinct predictive variables were identified for each ICF domain providing support that the concepts are separate constructs. The discussion in this thesis focuses on the exploration of research findings in the context of established literature in the field of chronic pain management. Suggestions are made for future research and opportunities to further enhance current clinical practice are considered. Factors that may have influenced the findings, included limitations of the study, are also discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158439</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Computer Modelling Studies of the Structure of Prokaryotic Mechanosensitive Channels</field><field name="creator">Meyer, Grischa</field><field name="description">Mechanosensitivity is ubiquitous in all kingdoms of life with a wide range of physiological roles. The simplest mechanotransducing devices known are bacterial mechanosensitive channels that protect an organism from lysis by osmotic downshock. These channels have been studied intensively at a functional level for almost two decades. The molecular structure for two such channels has also been solved in recent years, allowing investigation of the structure function relationship. The first part of my research attempted to pinpoint functionally important structural elements by comparing the structures of two homologous archaeal mechanosensitive channels with distinct functional characteristics. Due to difficulties in working with these archaeal proteins, this project was not completed. My main research subject was the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance found in E. coli, called MscL. The periplasmic loop of MscL of E. coli plays an important role in the function of the channel as shown by mutagenesis studies. The loop has been thought to act as a spring, which adjusts channel sensitivity. However, its structure had not been studied in detail. The research presented here proposes a new detailed model of the periplasmic loop. The new model is based on experimental data obtained through cysteine-scanning site-directed mutaganesis, spin-labelling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The EPR spectra were measured for each residue and yielded information on dynamics and proximity to water and lipid environments. Using a novel molecular modelling technique that uses the EPR data to find the most suitable structural model, all-atom structures of the periplasmic loop in the closed and open state of the channel were created. Furthermore the models were incorporated into an all-atom fully-solvated explicit-membrane molecular dynamics simulation to verify their stability. The new models are the first to be based on experimental data. The periplasmic loop is the last part of the structure of MscL of E. coli to be determined experimentally.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158650</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The match-play demands and physiological requirements of professional rugby league</field><field name="creator">King, Patricia Anne</field><field name="description">Although a number of research groups have attempted to estimate the physiological demands of rugby league match-play in order to provide relevant data for the design of specific training programs, all have been subject to a number of limitations. The two studies that have used time motion analysis (TMA) were published before the introduction of influential rule changes and the findings from this previous research are arguably dated with regard to the contemporary demands encountered by professional rugby league players. Moreover, research is yet to compare contemporary TMA data with training programs presently used with professional rugby league players. In particular, it is not clear whether current training practices take account of the frequent bouts of very high-intensity activity that are believed to occur during passages of play and which can determine the outcome of a match. The primary aim of the present thesis was therefore to analyse the movement patterns specific to professional rugby league players during match-play (Study 1). A secondary aim was to identify the timing and frequency of the most highly intense periods of play (Study 2). The findings were then used to develop a highly specific training drill that would reflect the most physiologically demanding periods of the game. The physiological costs of this very high intensity activity reflecting the most demanding periods of a game were then examined in a modified drill and comparisons made between the costs of running alone versus running and tackling (Study 3). Furthermore, current training practices were assessed to determine whether they met the physiological demands identified through TMA (Study 4). Study 1 examined the movement patterns and physiological demands of specific positional groups (hit-up forwards, adjustables and outside backs) during competition using time motion analysis (TMA). There were significant (P &lt; 0.05) differences between the distances covered by the three positional groups and it was found that players covered shorter distances than described in previous research. It was determined that the average work to rest ratio was 1:6 for the outside backs and hit-up forwards and 1:5 for the adjustables. However, the average work to rest ratios did not reflect the most demanding periods of the game; these included repeated high-intensity efforts interspersed by recovery periods of very short duration. These periods of repeated highintensity work often occurred at crucial phases of the game, where players were either attacking or defending the try-line. The patterns of movement during the repeated highintensity periods of play were different for each of the positional groups. The hit-up forwards generally sprinted short distances before completing a tackle or being tackled. The recovery durations between bouts of high-intensity exercise were generally quite short. The adjustables covered greater distances in the lead-up to the tackle and completed more lateral movements. They also had greater recovery durations between repeated high-intensity efforts than the hit-up forwards and this was reflected in a greater time spent standing, walking and jogging. The outside backs covered greater distances in the lead up to the tackle than both the hit-up forwards and the adjustables. They also had longer recovery durations between repeated high-intensity efforts than the hit-up forwards but spent less time standing, walking and jogging than the adjustables. The patterns of play revealed significant differences between the positional groups, particularly in regards to repeated high-intensity activities. It was concluded that in order to be prepared for the most highly intense periods of match-play professional rugby league players should adopt training that included the highest and lowest work to rest ratios and also included tackling. Study 2 assessed the frequency, duration and nature of repeated high-intensity efforts in rugby league using the TMA data from Study 1. Rugby league players are frequently required to tackle an opponent after sprinting to a contest. Due to the high physiological demands of contact, and it&#146;s frequency in rugby league, the element of contact is considered to be a key component of match-play. &#145;Repeated bouts of high-intensity exercise&#146; (HiEx) were examined in the video footage; HiEx described any period of match-play that included three or more sprints and/or tackles with a mean recovery between efforts of less than 20s. There were a number of significant (P &lt; 0.05) differences in HiEx between the positional groups. The hit-up forwards (20.3 &#177; 1.5) completed a significantly (P &lt; 0.05) greater number of HiEx bouts than the outside backs (12.0 &#177; 1.0). In addition, the hit-up forwards (3.8 &#177; 0.8) completed a significantly (P &lt; 0.05) greater number of efforts within the HiEx bouts compared to the outside backs (3.2 &#177; 0.4) and the adjustables (3.1 &#177; 0.4). The duration of the HiEx bouts were significantly shorter for the outside backs (17.9 &#177; 5.4 s) compared to the hit-up forwards (24.8 &#177; 9.5 s) and the adjustables (21.4 &#177; 5.9 s). The outside backs also had significantly (P &lt; 0.05) longer recovery periods both within and between HiEx bouts compared to the hit-up forwards and adjustables. The study identified that rugby league players complete large volumes of high-intensity work compared to athletes in other sports. It is concluded that the hit-up forwards in particular should have a significant focus placed on repeated high-intensity efforts during training. Training for all positional groups should reflect the frequency, content and duration of those HiEx bouts identified in the present study. A modified training drill was used in Study 3 to determine the physiological requirements of repeated bouts of high intensity activities and to estimate the energy costs of tackling. A cohort (n = 7) of professional rugby league players completed two test protocols. The initial six minute protocol involved three repeat sets of six sprints interspersed by a rest period of equal time to the exercise duration. The second six minute protocol involved both sprinting and tackling. The subjects were required to drive a tackle bag backwards for two metres in a standing tackle. Heart rate, blood lactate concentration and oxygen uptake data were recorded for the duration of the two protocols. No significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) in heart rate, blood lactate concentrations and oxygen consumption were identified between the two trials, suggesting that for players required to only complete three or less repeated efforts in a single bout of high-intensity exercise (HiEx) during match-play, a running only drill during training would be sufficient to prepare them for the cardiovascular demands of competition. However, the pattern of changes over time tended to be different between trials for all measures. Further repeat efforts may have shown subsequent increases in the physiological cost of exercise for the tackle protocol compared to the running only protocol. These trends support the position that tackling places significantly greater physiological demands on players as the game progresses and when players are required to perform greater numbers of repeat sets. It is recommended that all positional groups, and especially the hit-up forwards, participate in more extensive repeat &#145;sets of six&#146; (i.e. greater than four repeat sets) in order to prepare for the most physiologically demanding periods of match-play. Study 4 examined whether selected training drills simulated competition demands. Three in-season training drills (Ups and Backs drill, Grids drill and Game Play drill) were video recorded and compared to match-play data of equal duration from Study 1. It was found that players covered a significantly (P &lt; 0.05) greater distance in all three training drills than for a match-play period of equal duration (with the exception of the outside backs in the game-play drill). It was also found that players spent a greater percentage of time completing high-intensity activities in all three drills compared to match-play. However, although the game-play drill most closely resembled match-play compared to the other two drills, overall none of the drills closely replicated the characteristics of match-play with regards to the match-play activities and movement patterns. As the findings from Study 3 have shown, there is a strong tendency for fullcontact to increase the physiological cost of an already high-intensity exercise drill, particularly as a function of time. The absence of, for example, tackling in the gameplay drill, may under expose players (particularly the hit-up forwards) to the highest demands of match-play. While injury prevention during training and simulated gameplay is essential and the benefits of avoiding collisions and contacts are clear, there may be value in coaches seeking to add in to game-play additional exercises that increase the physiological cost to that equivalent to the highest demands experienced in a match. This could involve, for example, static exercise against resistance or wrestling. The present series of investigations have collectively shown that professional rugby league players, particularly the hit-up forwards, engage in periods of very high-intensity exercise that often determine the outcome of critical phases of play. The data tend to support the notion that tackling, when combined with sprinting, is particularly demanding and that training may need to better prepare players for the most arduous passages of play.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158440</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Framework for Riparian Zone Monitoring over Local to Regional Scales in Australian Tropical Savannas: methods for monitoring riparian zones using high spatial resolution imagery and field survey data</field><field name="creator">Johansen, Kasper</field><field name="description">Riparian zones are globally important due to their contribution to biodiversity, geomorphology, cultural values, aesthetics of the landscape, tourism, and the economy. Riparian environments in tropical savanna areas are focus of much activity related to development of northern Australia. Threats to riparian zones in tropical savannas include overgrazing, weed infestation, fire, urban development, and human-induced disturbance such as water extraction and construction work. Consequently, there is a significant need to monitor changes in riparian zone condition in tropical savannas. Government agencies responsible for riparian environments are currently assessing the combined utility of field survey and remote sensing for mapping and monitoring the condition of riparian zones due to the need for developing cost-effective, accurate, time-efficient, and spatially extensive monitoring protocols. This thesis focussed on the development of a riparian condition monitoring scheme for use in tropical savannas. Three high spatial resolution multi-spectral images captured by the QuickBird satellite in August 2004 and August 2005, coincident with field surveys over sections of the Daly River and the South Alligator River / Barramundie Creek in the Northern Territory were used in this research. In addition, a Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) image of the Daly River captured in July 2004 was used. The QuickBird and TM images were atmospherically corrected to at-surface reflectance and geo-referenced to enable integration of field survey data. The first stage of the research used semi-variograms to determine how spatial variations in landform and vegetation structural properties of savanna riparian zones control their representation in high spatial resolution remotely sensed image data. The results showed that the correct selection of pixel size and spectral bands is essential to maximize the mapping accuracy of object-oriented image classification of riparian attributes. The findings of the semi-variogram analysis provided the foundation for the development of an inversion approach to map indicators of savanna riparian zone condition from high spatial resolution image data. Based on the findings of the semi-variogram analysis, the second stage developed and implemented a framework for monitoring the environmental condition of savanna riparian zones at local to regional scales based on an integration of field survey and high spatial resolution image data of the two study sites. The TM image data were used to develop a riparian zone extent map and to identify the level of grazing and agriculture within the study sites. The field survey and QuickBird image data were processed to map the following indicators of riparian zone condition: percentage canopy cover; leaf area index; organic litter; canopy continuity; tree clearing; bank stability; flood damage; vegetation overhang; manmade structures; riparian zone width; and river width. Field data and image derived spectral vegetation indices were integrated to develop biophysical algorithms for modelling vegetation structural parameters (R2 = 0.42-0.79). Object-oriented supervised image classification was used for mapping of tree clearing, man-made structures, and riparian zone and river widths (overall accuracies 81-90%). Bank stability and flood damage were mapped from a combination of vegetation structural information and the image classification products (R2 = 0.70-0.81). Multi-temporal assessment of riparian zone condition was carried out along the Daly River using QuickBird image data from both August 2004 and 2005. The findings demonstrated advantages using continuous data values as opposed to land-cover classes. The final stage of the research tested the feasibility of using a field based rapid visual assessment method and the image based riparian condition monitoring scheme in terms of accuracy, sampling representativeness, cost-effectiveness, and suitability of multi-temporal analysis. Results showed that a spatial coverage of 3% of the study area provided sample estimates within 20% of the global mean derived from the whole imaged area. The field based assessment was found more cost-effective at smaller scales (1-200km of river), while image based assessment becomes more feasible at regional scales (&gt;200km of river). Change detection analyses demonstrated that the riparian condition monitoring scheme can provide detailed information on gradual change and associated measures of minimum detectable change, while the field based method was less suited for multi-temporal analysis due to the use of ranked data values. For mapping purposes, both approaches could compliment each other if used at appropriate scales. The image based riparian condition monitoring scheme presented in this thesis represents a significant contribution to future management of riparian zones in remote tropical savannas and other riparian environments at local to regional scales (10km-2000km of river). This spatial scale meets monitoring requirements and legislations for State of the Environment Reporting for inland waters of Australia. If modified to suit other riparian environments, the proposed image and field based riparian condition monitoring scheme may also be applicable internationally and compliment on-ground riparian work conducted in other parts of the world. Through the development of the image based riparian monitoring scheme, limitations and need for future research were identified.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158335</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian Boards and Performance: A Multi-Method Test of Three Theories of Governance</field><field name="creator">Nicholson, Gavin John</field><field name="description">In this thesis I investigate how, if at all, boards of directors impact firm performance. To date, corporate governance research agendas have tended to concentrate on one particular role that a board performs. For example, agency theory concentrates on the monitoring role, resource dependence theory concentrates on the board providing access to resources and stewardship theory concentrates on the board&#146;s advice-giving or strategic role. While these approaches can provide specific (but limited) insights into how boards impact firm performance, there has been limited work that seeks to understand the board of directors&#150;firm performance relationship in its entirety. In order to pursue this broader agenda, I commence with a review of the corporate governance literature. The initial overview covers six theories of corporate governance and highlights how only three of these theories (resource dependence theory, agency theory and stewardship theory) directly relate to how the board impacts firm performance. I use these theories to develop a series of specific research questions about the relationships between various board demographic variables and firm performance. Following the literature review is a summary of the philosophical and methodological basis for the remainder of the research program. The first empirical study adopts the methodology used in international studies to investigate the link between boards and firm performance. I examine the relationships between board demographics and firm performance in 348 of Australia&#146;s largest publicly-listed companies and describe the attributes of these firms and their boards. The need for this study is justified by the relatively modest sample sizes used in previous Australian studies and the differences in board composition between Australian boards and their international counterparts. For example, Australian companies more closely conform to &#145;best practice&#146; governance structures than their international counterparts. I find that, after controlling for firm size, board size is positively correlated with firm value. I also find a positive relationship between the number of board interlocks and the market-based measure of firm performance, Tobin&#146;s q. I discuss the implications of these findings in light of the prevailing international research and conclude they are not robust enough to draw meaningful conclusions. The second empirical study responds to calls in the literature for a more processfocused research methodology by using qualitative case study analysis to examine links between the board of directors and firm performance. By employing a pattern matching analysis of five cases, I am able to examine the hypothesised links between board demography and firm performance expected under the three predominant theories in corporate governance research, namely agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory. I find that while each theory can explain a particular case, no single theory explains the general pattern of results. I conclude by endorsing recent calls for a more holistic, process-orientated approach to both theory and empirical analysis to understand better how boards add value. Following this case study investigation I revisited the data and undertook a post-hoc analysis designed to identify areas of potential theory development. Using a qualitative sensemaking approach aligned with grounded theory I identified eleven themes for inclusion in future theory development. The final substantive chapter of the thesis provides a model of board effectiveness that uses the construct of board intellectual capital to integrate the three predominant theories of corporate governance and illustrate how the board can contribute to corporate performance. I contend that boards wishing to improve their performance need to review their intellectual capital and in so doing I provide a practitioner-based framework to assist a board in assessing its level of intellectual capital. In particular, I highlight that any theory or model of corporate governance must be contingency based. That is, the relative composition of roles for a particular board at a point in time will depend on several factors including the growth trajectory of the organisation, the strength of the management team, whether a crisis situation exists, the strategic issues facing the organisation and, of course, the size and primary function of the organisation. Further, the level to which a board can adequately execute the roles required of it is determined by its intellectual capital, a construct that comprises four important dimensions: human capital; social capital; structural capital; and cultural capital. I conclude the thesis by summarising the major empirical findings and detailing the contributions of this work to theory, practice and public policy. The major conclusion of the thesis is that there are several different, sometimes conflicting roles that boards can execute to add value to the corporations they govern and, further, that there are numerous ways for a board to organise itself to carry out these roles. As a result of this research, academics and practitioners have a new framework to assist them to understand how boards contribute to firm performance.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158441</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cinderella vs. Princess Fiona: Actual and perceived functioning in stepfamilies and biological families</field><field name="creator">Planitz, Judith</field><field name="description">The present research program investigated actual and perceived functioning in stepfamilies and in biological families from the perspective of young adult members of such families. A substantial body of research has evaluated functioning in stepfamilies, and further literature has assessed the negative perceptions (or stereotypes) of stepfamilies; however, actual and perceived functioning have rarely been studied within the same framework. In the present studies, four specific aims were addressed: the first aim was to assess whether there are differences between young adults&#146; reports of stepfamilies and biological families on a number of key dimensions of (actual) family functioning; the second aim was to assess an integrative model of these family functioning variables; the third aim was to investigate whether and to what extent stepfamilies are stereotyped; and the final aim was to assess the theoretical perspectives (nuclear family ideology, biosocial perspective) that are most appropriate in explaining actual and perceived functioning in stepfamilies. A further aim (relating to the fourth aim) was to assess how attachment theory can be integrated as an explanation of actual and perceived functioning. The present research program also contained several important features. First, young adults in stepfamilies and biological families were compared on a number of key relationship dimensions, enabling a comprehensive coverage of important aspects of family functioning. Second, a broad overview of the negative perception of stepfamilies was obtained; this provided an overview of what the stereotype is, why people stereotype and whether those in stepfamilies have been subject to discrimination. Third, theoretical perspectives were used to explain actual and perceived functioning, and to determine whether potential discrepancies between actual and perceived functioning exist. Finally, quantitative data were complemented with short-response data, to obtain a broad picture of stereotypes of stepfamilies. These features are an important and novel contribution to further our understanding of stepfamilies. Study 1 assessed actual functioning in stepfamilies and in biological families as reported by a sample of young adult university students (1 = 102) who belonged to one or other of these family types. (The principal stepfamily contained a biological mother and stepfather.) Overall, findings suggested that stepfamilies and biological families were similar on many dimensions of family functioning, particularly on individual and family adjustment. Further, participants in stepfamilies and in biological families were similar on many reports of parental relationships, although relationships with stepfathers were reported as being more avoidant, as having less mutual conflict resolution styles, and as being less satisfying than relationships with biological parents. However, where differences between the families existed, the effect sizes were generally not large; this supports the assertion that there is substantial overlap in functioning between the families. In addition, more support for the social stigma hypothesis of stepfamily functioning was obtained; the social stigma hypothesis argues that stepfamilies are stigmatised; however, actual functioning in stepfamilies may not be as negative as the stereotype. Study 1 also provided a comprehensive assessment of attachment in stepfamilies (i.e., attachment functions, attachment dimensions and attachment figures were assessed). In Study 2, a similar sample of young adults (1 = 106) from stepfamilies and biological families were assessed on both actual and perceived functioning. (Participants in stepfamilies reported on relationships with up to four parents: biological mothers, biological fathers, stepmothers and stepfathers, where applicable.) Results largely replicated those of Study 1, with participants in stepfamilies and biological families reporting substantial overlap in functioning. Further, participants from these family types reported a negative stereotype of stepfamilies, particularly on perceived care, satisfaction, mental models, and conflict. These results generally suggest support for the social stigma hypothesis. That is, stepfamilies are perceived negatively but actual functioning is not as negative as the stereotype. Further, the attachment perspective was used to explain both actual and perceived functioning. The third study replicated and extended the previous studies by assessing actual functioning, stereotypes, and family identity. (Participants in stepfamilies again reported on relationships with up to four parents.) Data from young adults (1 = 160) in biological and stepfamilies again suggested that differences between stepfamilies and biological families are generally minimal in terms of actual functioning. Regarding stereotypes, data again suggested that a negative perception of stepfamilies exists; participants suggested cultural issues and a negative emotional climate as the predominant reason for the stereotype. Finally, those in stepfamilies reported identifying with their own families, but not with &#145;stepfamilies&#146; in general. These results are addressed in regard to the theoretical perspectives. The social stigma hypothesis received more support than other hypotheses of stepfamily functioning. The combined results (obtained across the three studies) were also assessed. Results suggested that, in general, those in stepfamilies and those in biological families did not substantially differ on many variables (assessing reports of parental relationships and individual and family adjustment). An integrative model of these variables assessing differences between stepfamilies and biological families was also assessed. Satisfaction with the biological father was found to mediate the relationship between family type (stepfamily or biological family) and family cohesion, and to partially mediate the relationship between family type and model of other. These results highlight the need to study stepfamilies as a system and to study multiple relationships within this system. Overall, the present studies extend previous research by suggesting that stepfamilies are negatively stereotyped although actual functioning in stepfamilies may not reflect this stereotype. A more complete understanding of actual and perceived functioning from the perspective of young adults in stepfamilies and in biological families was achieved. Further, the findings on actual and perceived functioning are discussed in relation to theoretical perspectives (specifically, the social stigma and incomplete institutionalisation hypotheses), and implications for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158651</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The construction of whiteness in Australia: Discourses of immigration and national identity from the White Australia Policy to multiculturalism</field><field name="creator">Ganley, Nathan Tobias</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">White Australia policy -- History</field><field name="subject">Racism -- Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Nationalism -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Emigration and immigration -- Government policy -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Multiculturalism -- Australia -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158442</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Economic Potential for Smallholder Rubber Production in Northern Laos</field><field name="creator">Manivong, Vongpaphane</field><field name="description">Rubber smallholdings are being established by shifting cultivators in Northern Laos, in response to demand from China and encouraged by government land-use policy. This can be seen as part of a general transition from subsistence to commercial agriculture in the uplands &#150; in particular, from shifting cultivation to tree crop production. This study examines the economics of smallholder rubber production in an established rubber-growing village in Luangnamtha Province and models the likely expansion of smallholder rubber in the Province. Data were obtained from key informant interviews, group interviews, direct observation, and a farm-household survey. Latex yields were estimated using the Bioeconomic Rubber Agroforestry Support System (BRASS). A discounted cash flow (DCF) model was developed to estimate the net present value for a representative rubber smallholding. This model was then combined with spatial data in a Geographical Information System (GIS) to predict the likely expansion of rubber based on resource quality and accessibility. The study shows that, given current market conditions and credit support, investment in smallholder rubber production in the uplands of Northern Laos can be profitable. The results from the DCF analysis for the study village show that the expansion of rubber planting in that village is based on good economic returns. The spatial analysis indicates that the potential for rubber in the study village is not an isolated case; there are also other areas in Luangnamtha Province that appear to be economically suitable for rubber. Therefore, rubber can be considered as one of the potential alternatives for poor upland farmers, in line with the government policy of stabilising shifting cultivation and supporting new livelihood options for poverty reduction. However, there are risks associated with rubber production and emerging constraints of land and labour, hence government should move cautiously in promoting rubber where farmers are uncertain about reducing their dependence on shifting cultivation. The role for government, as in other countries where smallholder rubber has played a significant role in rural development, is to ensure the provision of good quality planting material, to assist financially during the long investment period when no income is generated, and to invest in roads and marketing infrastructure. In particular, maintaining secure access to the China market will be crucial for the sustainability of smallholder rubber in Northern Laos. If carefully managed, the expansion of smallholder rubber in Laos has the potential to contribute to sustainable rural livelihoods.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158652</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Quota of Heartbeats: a novel &amp; &#147;The Interminable Son&#148;: a radio documentary</field><field name="creator">Sewell, Hamish</field><field name="description">This thesis is comprised of two creative works: a compact disk recording of a radio feature, &#147;The Interminable Son,&#148; and a seventy-two thousand word novel, A Quota of Heartbeats. There is also a short contextualizing introduction to both pieces and their genesis. The introduction looks at the drafting of the novel, A Quota of Heartbeats (AQOH). It focuses on the shortcomings of the earlier draft, the Untitled Novel, the forces at play, and how the final draft, AQOH, has moved away from the earlier &#145;autobiographical provenance&#146; to now work within the conventions of the novel. The radio feature and the novel are placed next to each other in this thesis in order to contrast them. They represent opposite ends of the story telling process. The radio feature began in 1999 and heralds the raw, autobiographic seeds of a story. It was commissioned by Radio National&#146;s Radio Eye in 2000. It covers fifteen years, from the mid 1970s to the late 1980s, and documents Hamish Sewell&#146;s return to New Zealand where he reckons with the legacy of his mother, Elizabeth Sewell. Elizabeth was a notable New Zealand feminist and abortion campaigner during the seventies and eighties who died in 1989. The radio documentary adopts a creative style and is comprised of personal interviews with Elizabeth&#146;s former colleagues, archival sound bytes and personal reflections and flashbacks from Hamish (see recording details of the radio script in Appendix B). Similar to the radio feature, A Quota of Heartbeats is also set in New Zealand during the 1970s and 1980s and concerns the issues of feminism, abortion politics and a central, motherson dynamic. At its heart, however, is the relationship and unfolding lives of senior New Zealand politician, Maddy Serron; her youngest son, Liam Serron, and Maddy&#146;s feminist friend and Liam&#146;s lover, Kimberley Thompson. It is primarily told through the eyes of Maddy and Liam within a duel past-present time frame. It follows Liam Serron&#146;s returns from Australia to New Zealand to see his dying mother in Wellington. Meanwhile, his mother, Maddy Serron, waits for him on the rocky vantage overlooking the sea while she contemplates her life as an activist, politician, mother, and her impending death. The closer Liam gets to his mother, the more the mother-son struggle from the past is revealed, and how the woman, Kimberley Thompson, changed their lives.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158336</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deterioration of Layered Coastal Aquifer Water Due to Density Dependent Flows</field><field name="creator">Al-Maktoumi, Ali Khamis Sulaiman</field><field name="description">Seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers threatens the development of coastal areas in many countries around the globe. In spite of the number of studies that have examined seawater intrusion in different heterogeneous coastal systems and hydrogeological settings, a situation where the coastal aquifer consists of two permeable layers separated by an aquitard with major abstraction from the upper aquifer (as is the case in the Al-Batinah area of Oman) has not been studied yet. This thesis focuses on such a situation and aims to extend existing knowledge about seawater intrusion dynamics and the consequent quality deterioration in such coastal aquifers. A good understanding of the seawater intrusion patterns is essential for improved management of coastal water resources. Shallow groundwater abstraction is expected to speed up seawater intrusion in the upper aquifer compared with that for the lower aquifer. As a consequence, an unstable condition with a complex flow and transport pattern develops. With time, a saline boundary layer (SBL) forms as salt is transported across the aquitard into the upper part of the lower aquifer, in time inducing instability and convective mixing. The system remains stable when the SBL is confined entirely within the aquitard. The extent and sensitivity of this unstable mixing and the consequential lower aquifer contamination are expected to depend on the hydrological and hydrogeological characteristics of the aquitard and of both upper and lower aquifers. Intensive two-dimensional (2D) numerical simulations have been performed for different aquitard properties and selected characteristics of upper and lower aquifers to gain an insight into the dynamics of the densitydriven flow. The impacts of different remedial strategies on the transport process are examined. The transport pattern in a three-dimensional (3D) system is also explored for selected cases. Both qualitative and quantitative measures have been used to analyse the results. These include selected salinity levels (standards for domestic and irrigation purposes), maximum depth of penetration (MDP), and total mass present in the lower aquifer (MtL). The literature presents several numerical codes for solving variable density groundwater flow and transport problems. In this thesis, a finite difference simulator &#147;SEAWAT-2000&#148; is selected and sensitivity of its results to spatial and temporal discretizations and numerical solution techniques is first tested against the Elder-Voss and Souza benchmark problem (EVS). The results are shown to be sensitive to the level of spatial and temporal resolutions for the chosen numerical scheme. A high-resolution mesh is necessary to minimize incorrect seeding of fingers and consequential artificially induced salinization due to numerical errors. The numerical simulations show that the pattern of contaminant-spread from buoyancy induced mixing in the layered coastal aquifer has a complex structure, described as a &#147;moving zone of instability&#148;. The instability occurs first in the seaward part of the SBL and then moves landward. With time the seaward part of the system begins to stabilize as the vertical density gradient reduces, but instability develops in the landward direction. As a result, previously adopted dimensionless criteria such as Rayleigh Number (Ra), wavelength (@) and wave number (&#181;) are not readily suited to analyse system stability. Factors that affect the timing of instability onset include SBL thickness and its solute concentration (C), and the upward vertical (Vv) and horizontal flow velocities (VH) within the lower aquifer. Large upward Vv retards the formation of the SBL while large VH increases the dispersion term, which smooths out the initial perturbations and thus impedes the occurrence of the instability. Investigation of the influence of aquitard parameters shows that increases in some (e.g., aquitard dispersivity, and porosity) promote the occurrence of instability and intensify the convective mixing by promoting the growth of the SBL. On the other hand, decreases in some lower aquifer parameters (e.g., smaller lower aquifer hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity) enhance the growth of the initial perturbations of the SBL into fingers. The growth of the SBL alone does not imply occurrence of instability as large flow velocity or high dispersion within the lower aquifer can refresh the bottom part of the SBL, and hence impede the trigger of instability. Factors or conditions that speed up seawater intrusion within the lower aquifer decrease the degree of convective mixing. This is because the unstable vertical density contrast between the upper and lower aquifers does not then develop, and the system regains stability more rapidly compared with cases where the seawater intrusion in the lower aquifer is slow. A higher abstraction rate (Q) speeds up the seawater intrusion and promotes SBL development, and hence an early occurrence of instability. For a specific set of aquifer parameters, the time for the lower aquifer to become unsuitable for domestic or irrigation purposes shortens as the abstraction rate increases. Different management options like discontinuous abstraction, alternating abstraction from the two aquifers, and short-term abstraction regimes are examined for their effects on the convective mixing. For a management option to be effective in reducing the degree of convective mixing, the seawater intrusion in the upper aquifer should be retarded or reversed so that the salt supply to the SBL is reduced. Subjecting both aquifers to continuous abstraction of approximately equal rates results in relatively similar intrusion rates, thereby impeding the onset of instability. While the work in this thesis is not based on an actual case-study, the Al-Batinah region in Oman is used as a reference for model conceptualisation since seawater intrusion in layered coastal aquifers is of major concern there. Given that the rainfall rate is very small in such arid regions, natural recharge (direct from rainfall) is not effective in reversing seawater intrusion in a useful timeframe. However, artificial recharge (through injection wells) can improve the groundwater quality when abstraction is stopped. The dispersion zone in the upper aquifer decreases, thereby slowing the growth of fingers. If abstraction from the upper aquifer continues, obviously a higher recharge rate is needed to reduce the degree of the convective mixing as well as the seawater intrusion in the upper aquifer. When the lower aquifer is recharged, the fingers are smoothed of and the system can become stable even if abstraction continues. With higher recharge rates, the system becomes stable more quickly. Abstraction from the saline wedge is also investigated as a remediation strategy. With cessation of the inland abstraction, saline water abstraction retards the seawater intrusion and so diminishes the size of the developed fingers. Alternating inland abstraction and saline water abstraction does not assist in effective reduction of the convective mixing given that the isochlors recede toward the sea during saline water abstraction and intrude again during inland abstraction. For a management or remedial strategy to be effective in stabilizing, or reducing the intensity of, buoyancy-induced mixing in the lower aquifer, it must induce strong enough horizontal velocity, VH, in the lower aquifer (to eliminate the developed fingers and prevent perturbations at SBL bottom boundary), large upward velocity, Vv (to resist SBL development), or decreases in the seawater intrusion rate in the upper aquifer so that the unstable condition (dense fluid overlying less dense fluid) does not develop. Although the convective mixing patterns are different in 2D and 3D simulations, results show that there are similarities in the basic features of finger growth, coalescence, and their response to an increase in the abstraction rate. Based on the limited simulations, the 2D results are broadly similar to those of the 3D case and, with appropriate caution; 2D modelling can provide useful information for water resources management in the aquifer situations studied. The study provides an improved understanding of the fingering process in layered coastal aquifers and thereby contributes to the rational management of layered coastal aquifers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158443</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FORMAL DERIVATION OF OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGNS</field><field name="creator">McComb, Timothy</field><field name="description">Formal methods provide rigorous approaches and proof mechanisms for the development and verification of software systems. Much of the work in this field has focussed on refinement, which models the relationship between abstract specifications and more concrete specifications. For example, there are refinement theories that model the relationship between state machines specified at different levels of abstraction. However, the application of these theories to the object-oriented paradigm poses a significant challenge. Object orientation is useful primarily because of the modularity and reuse constructs it affords, and has become prevalent in industry for the implementation of large systems. Although object-oriented specification languages exist, two key issues are at the core of applying a refinement theory to these systems. The aforementioned modularity and reuse constructs (classes and objects) provide for a plurality of independent but interacting state machines, and refinement theory is hindered by the complex mapping between these local states and a unified global state. This is because refinement is not necessarily compositional in such an environment. Additionally, the specification of domain requirements in an object-oriented specification may not necessarily resemble&#151;in a structural sense&#151;the design of the desired implementation. Here, structure is interpreted as the relationships between or within classes and objects. This includes inheritance, instantiation, polymorphism, and type parameterisation (often referred to as templates or generics). As a result, there is a distinct gap between object-oriented specifications and object-oriented designs. It is the purpose of this thesis to address this gap, which is motivated by the existence of systems that are sufficiently large to warrant the object-oriented programming paradigm, but additionally require development under strict verification conditions. A novel set of rules and an accompanying methodology are presented that provide for the systematic and rigorous evolution of object-oriented specifications to derive designs in the Object-Z specification language. The proposed method carefully intertwines refinement with refactoring to formulate a theory that is both minimal and complete, in that any design may be derived from any specification if it is a valid refinement of the specification. The minimality of the rules stems from the fact that they each address orthogonal but fundamental aspects of object orientation. The Object-Z specification language was chosen as a vehicle for the approach, as it encompasses the complexities found in many objectoriented designs, particularly with respect to structural features and reference aliasing. Additionally, a novel method for undertaking compositional class refinement is described that facilitates the scalability of the overall approach by significantly reducing the burden of proof required for justifying refinement steps. The rules, methodology, and compositional refinement theory do not impose restrictions on the constructs used in specifications, nor do they restrict the syntax and semantics of the specification language. As such, the results of this thesis are applicable to any existing Object-Z specification that adheres to the modern language definition.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158653</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simultaneous Localization and Mapping with Sparse and Uncertain Visual Measurements in an Indoor Environment</field><field name="creator">Hu, Wen Yan</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the development of a low-cost robot, whose main sensor is a single forward-facing camera.

The method is first verified by means of simulations and is then tested in an indoor environment. In the indoor environment, the method performs only modestly and an alternative technique, using a new particle filter approach is then developed.

Inappropriate application of management approaches, lack of management capacity and poor management schemes are possible reasons for this decline in the quality of the marine environment. With fundamentally different social expectations and differing biological and geophysical characteristics between terrestrial and marine protected areas, specialised marine expertise and experience is needed for effective management. In Thailand, marine national park staff largely come from a terrestrial park background and tend to apply strategies known to be effective in terrestrial situations, but which are often inappropriate in the maritime situation. In the absence of needed marine experience, researchers can provide insights to management through studying management effectiveness and informing managers how they might improve strategies for achieving nature conservation and other management objectives. This research sought to identify factors limiting the effectiveness of marine park management under Thai circumstances and to identify potential improvements. Surin Marine National Park was chosen as a case study area because of the importance of this site, the existence of considerable baseline information on reef condition and my previous experience with management of the area. Change in coral cover was used to evaluate the effectiveness of management in protecting reef condition. The acceptability of existing and other possible management approaches to stakeholders was examined through questionnaires, and observation. The planned study was interrupted when the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami hit Thailand&#146;s Andaman coast. As well as the devastation caused to coastal communities, the tsunami prevented the original research programme from being completed. However, it created a unique opportunity to examine the biophysical and management impacts that an unforseen perturbation could have and gave greater insight to the factors influencing the effectiveness of the management system. The research indicates that installing facilities (e.g. mooring buoys, piers, and sewage treatment plants) can help reduce the negative impact of use on coral reefs; however, these approaches are dependent on government capital investment and do not fully address use issues. Regulatory approaches (patrolling and enforcement) can help reduce inappropriate behaviour of resource users, but they too are capital intensive and strongly rely on the park&#146;s management capacity (i.e. budget and personnel). Shortfalls in the management budget and/or personnel directly affect the effectiveness of these approaches, which have been the principal management techniques applied at Surin to date. Respondents were largely ignorant of or ambivalent towards zoning and prohibition approaches to management, possibly because of insufficient communication of this information. As a result, the ability of stakeholders to self-regulate their use of natural resources is limited. This is exacerbated by Surin&#146;s management capacity being strongly dependent on income derived from tourism expenditure. In the absence of understanding of the management techniques applied, especially controls such as the zoning plan, management has not been able to defend its management, has bowed to external pressure, and opened prohibited areas to use when reef condition in other areas declined. This study suggests that a more co-operative approach to management, based on effective communication with stakeholders, and backed by strategic facilities and regulations, will result in improved management outcomes. Management reliant on top-up funding is always vulnerable to shifts in tourism trends, making forward planning of conservation works difficult. This situation was confirmed by the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. While the tsunami was assumed to have devastated the reefs around Surin, the study revealed that the physical and biological effects on the reef environments were less severe than expected. Although the effect of the tsunami on reef communities was limited, management was more severely affected. This led to the emergence of threats of possibly greater long-term moment than the tsunami. The interpretation programme and reef monitoring were suspended and delayed in being re-established due to the limited Government budget. The research identified donations and volunteer work as opportunities to address the budget shortfall, but these require a fundamentally different approach to management being in place: one that requires a shift towards co-management of Surin with stakeholders. With reduced management capacity and new threats emerging after the tsunami, the need for greater collaboration in the management of the park was identified. Tour operators support management and, from the tsunami situation, are willing to assist the park in many ways. Involving the tourism sectors in conserving practices, rather than just using the reefs, is important and can fill the gap in management capacity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158654</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coping with care-giving: Behaviour probelms in preschool children with developmental disabilities</field><field name="creator">Plant, Karen Merle</field><field name="description">This thesis details the outcomes of a research project involving the development and evaluation of an intervention program designed to assist parents cope more effectively in their role of caring for their preschool-aged child with a developmental disability. Specifically, it airns to examine factors which contribute to parents' caregiving burden and stress, develop an intervention program to address these factors, and evaluate the efficacy of this intervention program. Over the past 7 years, the author has been involved in a University of Queensland research project focusing on parental care-giving of preschool-aged children with developmental disabilities. Initially, the project's aim was to examine those aspects of care-giving which posed particular difficulties for parents, and contributed to their caregiving burden and stress. The second phase of the project was to develop an intervention program designed to address the difficulties identified by parents. Thirdly, the project included conducting an evaluation of a behavioural family intervention (BFI) specifically designed for parents of children with developmental disabilities. The intervention program consisted of an adaptation of the Triple P - Positive Parenting Program (Sanders &amp; Markie-Dadds, 1996) known as Stepping Stones Triple P (SSTP: Sanders, Mazzucchelli, &amp; Studman, 2003a) as well as an adjunctive intervention known as Coping with Care-Giving (Sanders &amp; Plant, 2002). The current research program assesses the effectiveness of SSTP which primarily targets difficult child behaviour, and examines whether the addition of an adjunctive intervention enhances parents' ability to cope with caring for a child with a developmental disability. The SSTP intervention includes individual consultation sessions with parents, as well as print and video materials that aim to promote positive, caring relationships between parents and children, and to help parents develop effective management strategies for dealing with a variety of common behaviour problems and developmental issues. The Coping with Care-Giving adjunctive intervention focuses on teaching parents about grief and loss issues associated with child disability, how to manage stress and other negative emotions, how to communicate effectively with professionals, how to manage their time effectively, and how to strengthen social support networks. Several reviews were undertaken pertaining to this program of research. The first, which is outlined in Chapter 1, discusses a conceptual framework for understanding parental care-giving, and identifies core constructs which are an integral part of the caregiving experience. Second, in Chapter 2, the prevalence and aetiology of childhood behaviour problems in children with developmental disability is detailed. In Chapters 3 and 4, behavioural family interventions for both typically developing children with behaviour problems and children with developmental disabilities and behaviour problems are reviewed. This includes evidence supporting the efficacy of interventions, and highlights the limitations of current research, particularly in relation to the use of BFIs for parents of children with developmental disabilities. The first study, detailed in Chapter 5, examines the extent to which difficulty of care-giving tasks, time involved in care-giving tasks, child problem behaviour, and level of child disability predict parent stress. In addition, the mediating effects of cognitive appraisal of care-giving responsibilities, and the moderating effects of positive coping strategies and social supports are explored. Chapter 6 outlines the second study which involves a randomised controlled trial examining the efficacy of Stepping Stones Triple P - Standard (SSTP-S) and Stepping Stones Triple P - Enhanced (SSTP-E) in comparison to a waitlist control condition (WL). Finally, in Chapter 7 primary outcomes of the research project are discussed, and recommendations for future directions are outlined. This program of research provides an evidence-base for improving future early intervention services to families of preschool-aged children with developmental disabilities. Also, it advances our understanding of the factors influencing parents' ability to effectively fulfil their care-giving role. The research had the following specific aims: 1. To examine the extent to which difficulty of care-giving tasks, time involved in care-giving tasks, child problem behaviour, and level of child disability predicts parent stress. 2. To explore the mediating effects of cognitive appraisal of care-giving responsibilities, and the moderating effects of positive coping strategies and social supports on parent stress. 3. To evaluate the efficacy of BFIs (SSTP-S and SSTP-E) for parents of preschool-aged children with developmental disabilities and problem behaviours in comparison to a waitlist control group (WL). 4. To examine if the addition of enhanced training (SSTP-E) aimed at assisting parents to cope with their care-giving role produces more positive outcomes than standard behavioural parent training intervention alone (SSTP-S). 5. To provide recommendations, based on outcomes of this research program, regarding future availability and dissemination of BFIs to families of preschool-aged children with developmental disabilities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158338</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CHRONIC COUGH AND EXTRATHORACIC AIRWAY HYPERRESPONSIVENESS SYNDROME: CHARACTERISTICS AND TREATMENT EFFICACY</field><field name="creator">Vertigan, Anne Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Chronic Cough (CC) and Extrathoracic Airway Hyperresponsiveness Syndrome (EAHRS) are common debilitating conditions that are poorly understood in terms of their pathogenesis and have a limited evidence base to support their management. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate symptoms, voice characteristics and respiratory function in people with CC and EAHRS, to explore the relationship between the two conditions and to determine the effectiveness of speech pathology management of CC. Participants included 55 adults with a combination of CC and EAHRS (Cough + EAHRS), 8 with EAHRS Alone, 56 with Cough Alone, 25 with Muscle Tension Dysphonia (MTD) and 27 healthy controls. A cross sectional design was used to compare the clinical case history, symptom frequency and severity rating, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and baseline spirometry and hypertonic saline challenge amongst these participant groups. Vocal function was analysed using perceptual voice analysis of samples of connected speech by blinded perceptual judges and acoustic assessment of sustained vowels using the PRAAT acoustics program. Electroglottographic analysis was conducted during connected speech using the Laryngograph &#174; Speech Studio software. Two additional studies examined the efficacy of speech pathology management for persons with CC through a single blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial. Eighty seven participants with CC were randomly allocated to receive either direct speech pathology intervention for the CC (treatment) or an equivalent course of healthy lifestyle education (placebo). Each group received four intervention sessions over a two-month period. Outcome measures included symptom ratings, perceptual, acoustic, and electroglottographic analyses of voice and vocal function. The results demonstrated considerable overlap in medical history, symptoms, and baseline respiratory function between the Cough + EAHRS and Cough Alone groups indicating that these disorders may be linked. Participants with EAHRS Alone and MTD overlapped with the Cough + EAHRS and Cough Alone groups on some features however significant differences remained between them and these appeared to be distinct conditions. The majority of participants in all groups had normal ratings on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, however there were significant group differences in anxiety and depression. Clinically significant perceptual ratings of vocal quality were identified in approximately 40% of individuals with CC and EAHRS in comparison to only 4% of healthy controls. Acoustic voice assessment revealed abnormal phonation times, standard deviation of fundamental frequency, jitter and harmonic to noise ratios in the participants with CC and EAHRS compared to healthy controls while electroglottographic analysis demonstrated reduced fundamental frequency and decreased closed phase of vocal fold vibration in the former group. The hypertonic saline challenge revealed reduced inspiratory flow indicative of glottal constriction in 52% of participants with CC. Results of the randomised treatment trial demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in all symptom scores in the treatment group compared to the placebo group. There was a significant pre to post-intervention improvement in breathing, cough and limitation scores in both treatment and placebo groups but significant improvement in pre- to post-intervention voice and upper airway scores in the treatment group only. Perceptual voice ratings demonstrated greater improvement in the treatment group compared to the placebo group. The treatment group also demonstrated a significant pre to post-intervention improvement in some acoustic voice measures, although the degree of change was not significantly different to that of the placebo group. The results of this research support a relationship between CC and EAHRS and suggest that these conditions cannot be differentiated on the basis of their symptom profile, vocal features or baseline respiratory function. The results suggest that EAHRS might be a possible explanation for a substantial proportion of individuals with CC and that psychiatric causes cannot automatically be assumed in CC and EAHRS. Voice problems can occur in a substantial proportion of individuals with CC and EAHRS. In addition to improved control of cough and respiratory symptoms, speech pathology intervention also results in improvements in vocal quality. This improvement suggests that voice problems in CC and EAHRS may be integral to the conditions rather than evidence of a separate co-existing disorder. The findings of this study have indicated that medical treatment protocols for CC could be expanded to include speech pathology intervention. Speech pathology intervention may be a viable alternative for individuals with CC that persists despite optimal medical treatment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158444</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THERMODYNAMICS OF POLYMER SOLUTION AND ITS APPLICATION IN 3D SCAFFOLD MANUFACTURING FOR USE IN TISSUE ENGINEERING</field><field name="creator">Lim, Sue Ann</field><field name="description">Three dimensional polymeric scaffolds, which act as a cell transplant device, have been widely used in the field of tissue engineering as an approach to generate tissue replacements. This 3D construct plays an important role in determining the viability and functionality of the transplanted cells by providing a physical and chemical template for cells to attach, proliferate, migrate and finally restructure into functionalized tissue. In this study, a Thermally Induced Phase Separation (TIPS) technique is chosen as the main scaffold fabrication methodology. While this process is known to be a simple yet cost effective scaffold fabrication technique, a detailed understanding of the thermodynamic behaviour of polymer solutions undergoing thermal transition is required. By identifying the influence of scaffold processing conditions on the resultant scaffold morphology, a huge array of scaffold architectures could be created easily. Hence, the first aim of this thesis was to develop an understanding of the phase separation behaviour of a commonly used polymersolvent- nonsolvent system, that is PLGA-dioxane-water system. In the present study, the phase diagram of a PLGA-dioxane-water system was developed through simplifying a ternary system of PLGA-dioxane-water to a binary system of PLGA-dioxane and water as the two respective components. Flory&#146;s lattice theory, together with the solution cloud point temperatures, were used to generate a complete phase diagram for this pseudo-binary system. Based on the calculated phase diagram, the effect of cooling rate, quenching temperature, polymer concentration and solvent/nonsolvent volume ratio on the expected morphology of the scaffold were described in detail. This resulting analysis method is seen to be very useful in defining the critical processing characteristics for manufacturing scaffolds using other polymer-solvent-nonsolvent systems. The second aim of the thesis was to develop a novel continuous scaffold fabrication procedure which incorporates traditional polymer extrusion processing (injection molding) in combination with TIPS. In an extrusion process, the final morphology of the product is controlled by the shear and pressure applied to the polymer blend or solution. Shear, in this study, was found to affect the scaffold morphology produced via a solid-liquid phase separation by disrupting the heat transfer gradient along the radius of the mold. Further, the influence of shear on the phase separation behaviour of a PLGA-dioxane-water system was also investigated. It was found that depending on the solution cloud point temperature, the shear rate applied and the polymer molecular weight, shear can induce either phase remixing or phase demixing behaviour. Generally, shear was found facilitate the formation of a bi-continuous structure by reducing the gap between the binodal and spinodal line. Overall, phase separation through spinodal decomposition was found to be encouraged by shear as it suppressed the formation of a dispersed droplet phase. This represents a significant outcome and allowed the production of layered scaffold structures in a one stage process. Pressure, similar to temperature can be used as a thermodynamic parameter to induce phase separation in an originally homogeneous polymer solution. Pressure has however, a significant advantage over temperature, as pressure changes can be brought about uniformly and very quickly throughout the bulk of a solution, thus potentially encouraging the formation of a uniform pore structure if this could be incorporated into a scaffold fabrication methodology. When looking at the influence of pressure on the phase separation behaviour of a PLGA-dioxane solution, it was found that pressure induced the crystallization of dioxane by shifting the solid-liquid equilibrium line to a higher temperature. The rate of crystallization was dependent on the pressure applied, the initial temperature of the solution, as well as the PLGA concentration. In the case of a liquid-liquid phase separating system, such as PLGAdioxane- water, depending on the interaction between the various component in the system, pressure could either induce phase remixing or phase demixing. The effect of scaffold morphology on cell behaviour was investigated in the last section of this study. Cell proliferation rate, cell morphology, cell cytoskeleton structure and extracellular matrix (ECM) protein orientation when cells were cultured on two different architectures within the same scaffold were compared. It is found that for all cell lines studied, cells proliferated at a higher rate when cultured in the region with directional pores. Further, the scaffold architecture was found to affect the overall cell morphology, as well as the orientation of the ECM protein (collagen I) deposited by cell. However, the relative influence of scaffold architecture on cell shape varied with the type of cell used.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158655</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TRAVELLERS' TALES: THE EXPATRIATE ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEACHER IN THE NEW GLOBAL CULTURE</field><field name="creator">Neilsen, Roderick Peter</field><field name="description">Most of the research into ELT has focused on its linguistic and methodological aspects, which are based on Western scientific traditions. The contributions and experiences of English language teachers themselves, especially their work in overseas contexts, have usually been overlooked. Native-speaking English teachers teach a world language which is contributing to the process of globalisation; therefore their work has important social and cultural ramifications. This quasi-ethnographic case study is an investigation of the lives and work of nine native-speaking English language teachers who have lived and worked outside their countries of origin for extended periods. The study aims to document the complexity of ELT as 'work' in new global economic and cultural conditions, and to explore how this complexity is realised in the everyday experiences of ELT teachers. The narratives of their experience will provide rich information on issues of culture, globalisation, and the multi-positioned nature of ELT. I begin by exploring the development of ELT from the colonial experience to its current status as a global commodity, referencing the work of Robert Phillipson and Alastair Pennycook. In order to more closely define the work of ELT, I then offer some comparisons with mainstream teaching. I explore issues of methodology in other cultural contexts, career 'paths' and cross-cultural issues. I then situate ELT in the discourses of globalisation, and explore its contribution to the process. As a framework for the case study analysis, I have applied Appadurai's theorisation of global flows of people, images, ideas, technology and money, or scapes, as a metaphor for the various dimensions of ELT. The narratives constructed from their experiences reveal much about the personal, pedagogical and cultural dimensions of ELT work in non-Centre countries. This information will be useful to ELT training programmes, and will contribute to a greater understanding of the intercultural dimensions of ELT for all those who work in it, and in related educational fields.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158445</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE CONCEPT OF SHIPPING CONTAINER</field><field name="creator">Bordahandy, Pierre-Jean</field><field name="description">This study deals with maritime transport law, which for the purposes of UN General Assembly Resolution 2102 (XX) may be defined as falling into the body of rules governing commercial relationships of a private law nature involving different countries and is therefore a branch of private international law. This research is concerned with the way shipping containers have impacted on the legal framework of international carriage and particularly of ocean carriage. More precisely, this study considers shipping containers used for maritime transportation that are compliant with the International Organisation for Standardization (ISO) norms and that fulfil the requirements of the Convention for Safe Containers (CSC). However, beyond those technical requirements this study has focused on the concept of &#147;shipping container&#148;. It demonstrates that the concept of shipping container is a very specific concept that cannot be confused with the concepts of &#147;package&#148; or &#147;part of the ship&#148;. On that basis this research shows that the concept of shipping container corresponds to the concept of &#147;means of transport&#148; because it has all its major characteristics and should therefore adopt its legal regime. As a justification for this approach, this research compares in a first part the result of the application of different concepts to containers and shows that the concept of means of transport corresponds to the true nature of shipping containers. In addition to this first demonstration, in a second part this study tries to highlight the advantages of the application of the concept of means of transport to containers by applying the regime of voyage chartering to the service of supply of containers. The author has chosen a global approach by considering both, the different legal regimes given to containers in international carriage, and the courts&#146; treatment of the legal issues arising therein. Thus, the comparative law approach adopted in this analysis aims to provide a platform of analysis that is wide enough to enable both an in depth analysis of the problems raised by containers and a good overview for a possible uniform solution. This research tries to emphasise the inadequacy of the existing statutes in regard to the specific issues raised by the use of shipping containers and the absolute cacophony resulting from the courts&#146; considerations of these matters. In this regard, two main issues raised by shipping containers have been identified by the author. These two issues are the conceptualisation of containers and the influence of containers on the &#147;period of liability system&#148; which results from the existing rules. The author then examines the interaction between the rules, the containers, and the courts through the prism of these two issues. The study aims at revealing that, despite the imprecision of the major texts on transport law, it is the courts from various legal systems (Australia, England, France and the United States) who are essentially responsible for the current legal uncertainty existing in this field. Apart from adopting a comparative law approach, the author also considers the draft project for a new international convention for ocean carriage and makes some remarks regarding containerisation. In this respect, this study expresses some reserves as to the achievement of uniformity as a result of a treaty process but favours a better understanding of the concept of shipping containers by the courts and the application of the correlative remedies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158339</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topological models of transmembrane proteins for subcellular localization prediction</field><field name="creator">Maetschke, Stefan</field><field name="description">Transmembrane proteins are proteins that are inserted into the membranes of the cell and its organelles. They perform a variety of essential functions as channels, pumps, receptors and energy transducers, and are therefore a major target for drug development. It is estimated that about 20%-30% of a proteome are transmembrane proteins but structure and function have been identified for only a fraction of them. Proteins are distributed to their specific subcellular locations within the cell by highly complex sorting machinery. A crucial first step in revealing the function of a protein is therefore the determination of its subcellular localization. Experimental localization techniques are time consuming and expensive and cannot keep pace with the exponentially growing number of protein sequences. Consequently, computational techniques for subcellular localization prediction have been developed. The vast majority of these prediction algorithms are designed for soluble proteins however, and ignore the characteristic topology of transmembrane proteins. In this thesis, topological models of transmembrane proteins for subcellular localization prediction are constructed and studied, utilizing three different machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machines, Hidden Markov Models and Conditional Random Fields. The objectives of the thesis are: Firstly, to evaluate whether topological models achieve higher prediction accuracies than non-topological models. Secondly, to examine methods to model the topological regions of transmembrane proteins. Thirdly, to study the relationship between topological regions and protein localization. And fourthly, to compare different machine learning techniques in the context of transmembrane protein modeling and subcellular localization prediction. The prediction performances of the constructed models are evaluated on two datasets. The first one is a subset of the mouse proteome, containing transmembrane proteins with experimentally confirmed subcellular localizations. The second one is a selection of eukaryotic transmembrane proteins, extracted from the Swiss-Prot database.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158656</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Identification of Novel Therapeutic Targets for Prostate Cancer</field><field name="creator">Landers, Kelly Anne</field><field name="description">Adenocarcinoma of the prostate is the second most common cause of cancer related deaths in men in the western world. Current curative therapies are directed to localised tumours; thus, extending effective but non-invasive treatments to combat both primary and secondary lesions remains a major challenge. A desirable criterion of any effective prostate cancer therapy is its ability to selectively utilise appropriate molecular targets. The identification of these targets represents the greatest challenge for prostate cancer therapy today. The aim of this project was to identify potential therapeutic targets at the level of mRNA and protein. Molecular targets were identified by examining the expression profiles of prostate cell lines using cDNA microarrays. Expression of the identified genes was verified on patient samples using real time RT-PCR. The gene claudin-4 was found to be significantly over-expressed in patient tumour samples compared with BPH samples. Claudin-4 is part of a large family of integral membrane proteins crucial for tight junction formation and function and is a receptor for the food-poisoning causative agent Clostridium perfringens Enterotoxin (CPE). A large immunohistochemical study conducted within a range of prostate tissue conditions confirmed the localisation of claudin-4 to the cell membrane of epithelial cells between cell-to-cell contact sites. Furthermore, the immunohistochemical data revealed that claudin-4 expression was high in low-grade tumours, low in high-grade tumours and high in prostate cancer metastatic lesions. Functional studies revealed that the over-expression of claudin-4 in prostate cell lines was associated with a reduction in cell migration and independent colony formation. In addition, the cytotoxic effects of CPE on the prostate cell lines were claudin-4 specific and dose dependent. An additional aspect of this study was to investigate the efficacy of using RNA-encoded tumour antigens to induce a DC-mediated T-cell response as an immunotherapeutic approach. In establishing the RNA-based approach, a number of important steps in the process were examined including, optimisation of electroporation conditions, amount of RNA required for optimal stimulation, time from transfection to the presentation of peptides and T-cell activation, as well as the importance of maturation before or after electroporation. The optimised RNA-based transfection approach was examined on a tumour model using the prostate TAA, PSMA as functional read-out which proved to be unsuccessful due to the low-affinity of the PSMA-specific CTL clone generated. From this study, the expression pattern of claudin-4 within prostate tissue and functional data obtained indicated that claudin-4 may play an important role in tumour dissemination and that it may be a potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer. Furthermore, investigation into the use of an immunotherapeutic strategy using RNAencoded antigens to induce a DC-mediated T-cell response has revealed promising results, however, it requires further investigation using a functional tumour model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158446</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantum dynamics of electronic excitations in biological chromophores: Models for the influence of the protein and solvent environment</field><field name="creator">Gilmore, Joel Benjamin</field><field name="description">This thesis presents minimal quantum mechanical models for the interaction between electronic excitations in a chromophore with its surrounding environment, including protein, bound water and bulk solvent. The interaction of the chromophore&#146;s electric dipole moment with the fluctuating electric dipole moments of the solvent and protein molecules is shown to be described by an independent boson model. An explicit microscopic derivation is given for the spectral density through a fluctuation-dissipation relationship. Continuum dielectric models are used to describe the protein and solvent. Several models are proposed for the structure of the protein and bound water around the chromophore, and spectral densities are obtained analytically for each case. These spectral densities depend only on measurable quantities, in particular the relaxation times of the environment, which are generally obtainable from experiment or simulation. In most cases, the relaxation times of the solvent, bound water and protein are widely separated and it is shown that individual contributions to the total spectral density can then be identified for each of these features. Current methods for obtaining the spectral density from molecular dynamics simulations and experiments such as the dynamic Stokes shift and three pulse photon echo spectroscopy are examined, and a survey of recent results is undertaken. Minimal models are used to provide a natural explanation and model for the different time scales observed in the extracted spectral densities, and suggest physical processes corresponding to experimental peaks. In many situations, it is found that only one aspect of the environment is important for the quantum dynamics. The relative contribution of each component is determined by the time scale on which one is considering the quantum dynamics of the chromophore. Results are then compared to those obtained for specific chromophores in specific proteins. The effect of the protein on ultrafast solvation is also considered. The models are then extended to two optically active molecules coupled by resonance energy transfer. When only a single excitation is present, the transfer dynamics of the excitation is shown to be described by the spin-boson model, with a spectral density given by the sum of the spectral densities of the individual chromophores. The dynamics of such systems are investigated and quantitative criteria are given for the presence of quantum coherent oscillations of excitations between the chromophores. Experimental tests to confirm these results, and to investigate the quantum-classical crossover between coherent and incoherent transfer, are proposed through the use of Fluorescent Resonant Energy Transfer (FRET) spectroscopy. The results are then applied to systems of coupled chlorophyll molecules in the photosynthetic reaction centre. Finally, spin-boson models suitable for describing the conical intersections associated with conformational change of a chromophore are proposed, and possible applications to modelling the transfer of vibrational energy within proteins and predicting spectra circular dichroism spectra for proteins are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158340</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of the mechanisms of gravity flow for block caving</field><field name="creator">Castro, Raul Luis</field><field name="description">In block caves, the flow characteristic of the caved rock strongly influences ore recovery and dilution content. Consequently, caved rock flow characteristics plays a fundamental role in determining, at an engineering level, optimal production level layout and draw control practices. Since the first applications of block caving, a significant amount of research has been focused towards an understanding of the flow characteristics of the caved rock. Laubscher&#146;s gravity flow principles for block caving mine design, widely used by the industry, were initially derived in the 1980&#146;s using a combination of sand physical models and observation in the field of the flow of finely fragmented caved rock. Those principles have involved the definition of the geometry of the Isolated Movement Zone (IMZ) and the interaction limit for defining the production level layout. Afterwards, other researchers have continued with sand modelling work confirming and improving on Laubscher&#146;s gravity flow principles. In today&#146;s mining practice, block caving methods are being applied to a range of competence of rock masses and block geometries which have resulted in a wide range of caved rock sizes from fine to very coarse. There is a general concern in the industry about the applicability of the principles of gravity flow derived from sand models to the full range of modern block cave conditions. This has motivated in the last years studies on the mechanisms of flow in coarse caved rock through large physical models and numerical modelling. Physical modelling work in large three dimensional models using gravel as the model media has been very helpful in understanding the location of the extracted material when drawing from a single drawpoint. However, there is still debate on the controlling parameters and mechanisms under isolated draw. Additionally, to date large three dimensional physical modelling has not been conducted to study the mechanisms of draw under multiple drawpoints using coarse fragmented materials. Numerical modelling using both particle flow codes and continuum models has been used to help describe the flow of coarse cohesionless granular materials. Mechanisms of isolated draw and interaction of IMZs as observed in sand models have also been observed in numerical models but those require to be validated through experiments. In this research, the mechanisms of the flow of coarse caved rock were studied by conducting controlled experiments using the largest ever three-dimensional physical model built to date. This research aimed mainly to investigate the mechanics of flow in both isolated and multiple drawpoint draw and to incorporate those observations into a cellular automata numerical approach to simulate flow. Previous to the experimental work, the physical modelling conditions were defined by means of an analysis of similitude based and on a benchmark study of block caving practices. Experimental studies of the mechanisms of isolated draw showed that the main controlling parameters that define the geometry of the IMZ are the mass drawn and the column height. The influence of other parameters such as particle size and drawpoint dimensions were varied but showed not to have a statistical major role in determining flow behaviour under the experimental conditions. Detailed modelling of the experimental data along with stress measurements during draw were used to describe the mechanisms controlling the evolution of the geometry of the isolated movement zone. Experiments were conducted to study the mechanisms of mass flow and the limit of interaction under multiple drawpoints using different drawpoint configurations. The results indicated that when the distance between drawpoints was such that IMZs overlap mass flow was initiated under concurrent (ideal) draw. When the distance between drawpoints was such that IMZ did not overlap, vertical stresses in the unmoved zone increased. However, movement zones between adjacent drawpoints only interacted when the distance between drawpoints was smaller than that of the IMZ&#146;s width. Stress data in the large physical model also showed that at model conditions there was significant stress arching expected to occur in a confined granular material. Analysis of vertical stresses and material characteristics in previous sand models were conducted which indicated an absence of stress arching and the use of weak under shear material conditions that could have induced failure of unmoved areas between IMZs. In the current mining design criterion, interaction is the main mechanisms to justify the spacing of drawpoints at up to 1.5 wIMZ. The current research and those from sand models suggest that interaction is a function of stresses and material shear strength characteristics (friction angle and cohesion). These conditions characteristics under full scale are not well understood. This suggest that it essential to investigate in-situ and induced stresses during flow and caved rock shear strength characteristics if interaction is to be used as part of the design criterion in block caving mines. Advanced numerical models using results of this research may be an avenue of investigating the observed behaviour in the physical model but under full scale conditions. The observed flow patterns in coarse granular material were used as a basis for the proposal of a new Cellular Automata Flow Simulator (CAFS). This solution showed to be able to represent the movement and extraction zone observed in the experiments and to give good prediction of the extraction and movement zone geometries even for the draw of several drawpoints in just a few minutes. Calibration and evaluations of CAFS were conducted showing that when properly adjusted the numerical approach was able to capture in qualitative and quantitative ways the flow pattern observed in the experiments.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">840299 Primary Mining and Extraction of Mineral Resources not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">091405 Mining Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158447</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Psychological and Physiological Variables on Memory Functioning in Mid-life Women</field><field name="creator">Spooner, Donna</field><field name="description">Factors proposed to influence the memory functioning of mid-life women have been the subject of much investigation over the past 15 years. This has followed from reports that memory difficulties are a common complaint of women around the time of menopause. Many previous studies have focused on the physiological changes that accompany the menopausal years, particularly the decline in estrogen levels, and the resultant effects on neural functioning and cognitive performance. The possible benefits of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on memory functioning has been one key area of research, although there has been much inconsistency in the findings to date. In recent years, the influence of the APOE F4 allele (a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer&#146;s disease) on cognitive functioning, and its possible interaction with HRT, has received increased interest. Psychologically-based theories of ageing and memory decline also abound, which have focused on the influence that variables such as self-efficacy and ageing stereotypes have on memory functioning. The current thesis presents a review of the literature on the impact of these physiological and psychological factors on memory performance. Three empirical investigations were conducted, with the aim of determining the effects of specific variables on the memory performance of mid-life women. In Study 1, the effect of HRT on performance of the WMS-III was assessed in a sample of 213 postmenopausal women. Many of the methodological limitations of previous studies were addressed and the test scores of the 95 HRT users were compared to the 118 nonusers. Possible confounding variables, including age, education, predicted premorbid FSIQ, socioeconomic status, climacteric symptoms, and mood were controlled through hierarchical regression analysis. The results indicated that HRT use contributed unique variance to one WMS-III subtest: Spatial Span (p &lt; .05), with the nonusers performing better on this test than the HRT users. This finding shows some consistency with the results of previous studies indicating that lower estrogen levels afford some advantage on tasks with a strong spatial component. Using ANCOVA, no significant interaction was found between HRT use and APOE genotype, indicating that the APOE genotype did not change the association between HRT use and performance of any of the WMS-III subtests or index scores. A major criticism of previous investigations of memory functioning has been the failure of many studies to use ecologically-valid memory tests, which are arguably more relevant to memory in everyday contexts in comparison to their traditional counterparts (e.g. the WMS-III). This criticism was addressed in Study 2, through the use of the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test &#150; Extended Version (RBMT-E) to assess memory functioning. The effect of HRT on performance of this test was assessed in a sample of 125 postmenopausal women (77 HRT users and 49 nonusers) via a series of hierarchical regression analyses. Following control of relevant confounding variables, HRT use was found to contribute unique variance to one RBMT-E subtest: Orientation and Date (p &lt; .05). ANCOVA analysis revealed no significant interactions between HRT use and APOE genotype. In Study 3, psychologically-based predictors of memory functioning were evaluated in a sample of 269 women (age range 42-76 years). Based on review of the literature to date, a novel model of memory performance was developed which proposed specific relationships between the variables of age, education, memory selfbeliefs, self-efficacy, affect, attitudes towards ageing, ageing stereotypes, and memory performance. Relevant questionnaires were selected to assess these variables, and the RBMT-E was used as the measure of memory performance. The adequacy of the model was assessed using structural equation modeling techniques. Following modifications of the proposed model, a final model emerged that provided a good fit of the data, highlighted the nature of the relationship between the model components, and had theoretical support. The findings of the present investigations highlight the complexity of the study of memory in mid-life women and the need for more research to further elucidate the contributions of both physiological and psychological variables to understanding variability in memory performance.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158657</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utilization of palm kernel meal and copra meal by poultry</field><field name="creator">Sundu, Burhanudin</field><field name="description">Palm kernel meal (PKM) and copra meal (CM) are derived from the nuts of palm trees and are available in large quantities in many tropical countries. These potential feedstuffs are not widely used either for animal production or other purposes. Due to their high fibre contents, imbalanced amino acids, Maillard products (due to heat damage during drying and oil extraction processes) and their susceptibility to mould attack, these by-products have been regarded as low quality feedstuffs. However, if their value could be improved so that their inclusion in animal feeds resulted in good production, there would be a large number of benefits. A total of ten experiments have been conducted to improve the quality of these ingredients in broiler diets. There are two main scenarios for improving their use as feedstuffs, namely, by addition of exogenous enzymes and nutrients which are deficient and by manipulation of the physical characteristics of the ingredients. This project investigated the physical characteristics (bulk density and water holding capacity) and feeding value of PKM and CM by feeding the pure PKM and CM plus additional vitamins and minerals in poultry diets. Improvement of the quality of PKM was mainly based on nutritional manipulation by considering the digestible amino acids of the diet and adding enzymes. To increase the feeding value of copra meal, physical treatments were proposed, along with using exogenous enzymes and formulating diets based on digestible amino acid. The physical treatments applied in this study were pelleting, crumbling, soaking and finely grinding the diets. Parameters measured were growth rate, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, feed digestibility, apparent metabolizable energy (AME) of the diet, passage rate, jejunal viscosity, gut dimensions and digesta weight. The results of the experiments using palm kernel meal showed that bulk density and water holding capacity were 0.57 g/cm3 and 2.93 g water/g feed respectively. These values are close to the values of conventional feedstuffs tested in this study. Accordingly, PKM is neither bulky nor watery when soaked. Therefore, feed intake was not affected by PKM. Palm kernel meal contains 13.6 % protein with high arginine content, being 19.2 mg/g. Ileal digestibilities of crude protein, arginine, lysine and methionine in PKM were 53.6, 81.9, 57.2 and 71.5% respectively. Palm kernel meal could be used up to 40%, provided that energy and amino acids are balanced. Body weights of birds fed diets containing up to 40% PKM in the diet were similar to the body weight of birds fed corn-soy diets. Feed digestibility was low in PKM based diets, due to the high dietary fibre, causing birds to consume large amounts of feed to gain optimal growth. Jejunal digesta viscosity of birds fed PKM based diets was low compared with those of birds fed a corn soy diet. The use of enzymes did not improve the birds&#146; production significantly. However, feed digestibility and AME of the diet were increased when enzymes were added to the diet. Analysis of CM indicated that is bulk density and water holding capacity were much less and much greater respectively than values for conventional feedstuffs, being about 0.49 g/cm3 for bulk density and 4.14 g water/g feed for water holding capacity. Copra meal contains 21.7% crude protein with high arginine content (30.5 mg/g) but low in lysine (5.5 mg/g). Ileal digestibility of crude protein, arginine, lysine and methionine were 63.1, 85.6, 51.3 and 71.1% respectively. The use of CM in the diet lowered feed digestibility and AME of the diet. The birds fed CM based diets consumed more water and less feed than did birds fed corn-soy (CS) diets. The use of enzymes did not improve the growth rate of birds in the starter period but they did increase it to a similar level compared to birds fed the CS diet when the birds were kept for six or more weeks. Soaking the diet gave similar results to the addition of enzymes. However, fine grinding either CM or the whole diet decreased the performance of birds. Significant improvement in the growth rate of birds was made when either CM or the diet was pelleted and fed as crumbles but not when the pelleted material was finely ground. Measurement of gut response of birds consuming CM showed that gizzard weight was increased when the birds were fed the unmodified CM or pelleted CM but not when fed fine ground, soaked or enzyme supplemented CM diets. However, the birds fed the CM based diet had heavier intestines than those of birds fed the CS diet. No doubt due to their larger body size, the beak size was bigger in birds fed larger feed particle sizes. There was a significant correlation between the size of the feed particles eaten by the birds and the width of the beak. The birds tended to prefer a feed particles size of 40% of the width of the beak. Larger feed particle sizes travelled down the digestive tract faster than finer feed particle sizes thus increasing feed intake and hence growth rate. In conclusion, there was no deleterious effect in using up to 40 % PKM in the diet provided that the diet was balanced, particularly in digestible amino acids and energy. Enzyme supplementation increased the digestibility of PKM based diets. Even if CM based diets were balanced, the use of enzymes, soaking the diets or pelleting the CM diet was needed to improve the feeding value of CM.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158341</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN INVESTIGATION OF HIGH-VOLUME FLY ASH CONCRETE FOR PAVEMENTS</field><field name="creator">Lu, Yuan</field><field name="description">Aims This thesis investigated the use of fly ash in concrete by establishing reliable and accurate test data on the properties of concrete incorporating different fly ash content. In addition, the study focussed on typical uses by local government authorities in pathways, such as footpaths and bicycle ways, and also looked at environmental impacts, incorporating durability and construction constraints in the life cycle costing issues. The aims of the project were: &#149; To obtain experimental data on mechanical properties and durability characteristics of fly ash concrete containing 23-50% fly ash with a 28-day compressive strength of 25MPa; &#149; To assess the effect of curing on the properties of concrete incorporating different percentages of fly ash; and &#149; To draw conclusions as to the cost effectiveness of concrete incorporating large amounts of fly ash by comparing life cycle assessments that include durability, construction and environmental factors. Scope This investigation of the high volume fly ash concrete was for the purpose of extending its application in footpaths and bicycle ways. Several concrete mixes using fly ash at levels ranging between 23-50% as a partial replacement of Portland cement were investigated. All concrete mixes had a 28-day compressive strength of 25MPa, and were applicable to the footpaths and bicycle ways construction. The effect of fly ash on the mechanical properties of the concrete mixes was determined under standard moist curing and ambient conditions. The tested properties included setting time, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, flexural tensile strength, drying shrinkage and abrasion resistance. The test apparatus, procedures and testing data are described in detail. Test results are reported and compared. In addition to the experimental work, a simple life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) were undertaken to evaluate the environmental impact and cost effectiveness of using high volume fly ash in concrete pavement construction. The energy consumption and CO2 emissions were compared between high volume fly ash concrete and the typical commercial concrete in the environmental life cycle assessment. The life cycle cost analysis included the costs of initial material cost, construction, rehabilitation, and residual values in the whole life cycle period of pavement structures. Conclusions According to the analysis of the experimental results, it is feasible to produce concrete with fly ash replacement of up to 50%, without significantly altering the concrete properties in the hardened state. However, high volume fly ash concrete with 50% fly ash replacement retarded the setting time by up to 6.5 hours, which should be considered in LCCA. High-volume fly ash concrete gained higher ultimate strength under standard moist curing conditions. In typical pavement construction, it is often difficult for the design engineer to ensure that adequate curing, as per the construction specification, occurs. Indeed, evidence suggests that in many applications curing of concrete pavements does not occur at all. However, without adequate curing, no strength development was observed after 28 days for high volume fly ash concrete. The 28-day abrasion resistance is very similar for all mixes with various fly ash percentages, but use of a curing compound increased the wear and tear properties of fly ash concrete to some extent. Based on the information provided by the local industry and the results of the environmental life cycle assessment and life cycle cost analyses, the following conclusions are summarized: &#1048698; From the environmental life cycle assessment, 50% fly ash concrete is the best alternate for pavement design with 20% energy and CO2 savings compared to typical concrete; &#1048698; However, in terms of life cycle cost analysis, when variability is considered in the inputs (cost, setting time, service life, etc.), the typical 23% fly ash concrete would be the most cost effective material in footpath and bicycle ways applications; and &#1048698; The results of LCCA are highly dependent on the setting time of concrete. When using setting accelerator admixture in high volume fly ash concrete, the cost effectiveness is dependent on the efficiency of the admixture to reduce setting time. Without an increase in construction cost, the high volume fly ash concrete would have a similar life cycle cost to typical concrete.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158449</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality of Health Care: The Patients' Perspective on Quality of Care for Type 2 Diabetes</field><field name="creator">Tabrizi, Jafar Sadegh</field><field name="description">BACKGROUND Quality improvement literature usually conceptualises two principal dimensions of quality, technical and service. Technical quality is what the customers receive relative to what is known to be effective and largely reflects issues related to the health care providers. Service quality is how the customers receive the services and reflects the way and the environment in which health services are provided. This thesis proposes and tests a third principal dimension, Customer Quality, which is the characteristics that customers need for effective involvement in health care processes, decision making and action to improve the quality of care delivered and received. This model is applied in the context of care for people with Type 2 diabetes as an example of the high priority common chronic diseases and one of the most important public health problems in Australia and worldwide. The study also examines the feasibility of using patient reports of received care as a way of measuring service and technical quality on a population basis. OBJECTIVE The present study aims to assess the quality of delivered care as perceived by people with Type 2 diabetes. Specifically it aims to measure service quality, technical quality, customer quality; and finally an overall quality index by combining all three dimensions. METHODS A community based cross-sectional survey of 603 people with Type 2 diabetes was carried out in Queensland, Australia in 2005/06 using a self-administered questionnaire. The eligible participants were Diabetes Australia-Queensland members over 25 years old with diagnosed Type 2 diabetes at least one year prior to the study. Adherence to the eleven clinical, lifestyle and management indicators, derived from standard Diabetes Australia Guidelines, were measured from the patients&#146; reports as a representative of technical quality to explore the likely gap between received services and what should have been received in the 12-month period. Focus Group Discussions were used to determine the elements of service quality that were important from the patients&#146; perspective. Twelve service quality indicators, derived from the review of the literature and the focus groups, were assessed to calculate service quality as perceived by people with Type 2 diabetes. The validated, reliable and practical 13- item Patient Activation Measure was used to evaluate customer quality in terms of customers&#146; knowledge, skills and confidence. Demographic and disease related information was obtained using a self-reported questionnaire. Two types of outcome variables were used in this study: participantreported binary variables (having complications, continuity of care and diabetes control status) and calculated continuous variables (technical quality rating, service quality and customer quality scores and, finally, the overall quality index). RESULTS The response rate from the 1500 mailed out questionnaires was 40%. Nonrespondents were a little younger (P&lt;0.001) than study participants and matched on gender (P&gt; 0.05). Participants were mostly over 65 years old, over 50% were male, almost half of them were obese and a quarter were studying or had completed tertiary level of education. Almost two-thirds reported well controlled diabetes and 60% had diabetes for more than five years. Most of them were not treated by specialists and maintained continuity of care for their diabetes management. The majority of participants were treated with insulin or oral agents (72%) and 37% reported diabetes complications. Overall adherence rate for top 5 clinical and top 3 management and lifestyle indicators were 49.7% and 18.8% respectively. Over 90% of participants reported an appropriate level of checks of HbA1c, blood pressure and serum cholesterol. For lifestyle and management indicators, reported adherence rates to guidelines were lower than for clinical indicators. Participants who reported care as recommended for blood pressure measurements; feet examinations; self-management, diabetes knowledge and nutritional consultation reviews were more likely to report their diabetes as being well controlled. Participants maintaining continuity of care also reported fewer complications and well controlled diabetes. Of the twelve service quality indicators, the highest service quality score were for support group, basic amenities, dignity and confidentiality. Inadequate quality was identified for overall service quality (86.2), choice of care provider, continuity, timeliness, safety, prevention and accessibility. Younger participants reported lower service quality scores (P=0.001) and participants with good control of their diabetes had higher scores (P&lt;0.001). Overall reported Customer Quality score was 64.5. Ten percent of participants did not achieve the Customer Quality score for the confidence stage and 26% did not reach the actual action stage. Nearly three quarters of respondent reported the capacity to take action for self-management but only 38% reported the highest Customer Quality score equating to perceived ability to change the action by changing health and environment. Participants with a higher level of education and those who maintain continuity of care reported a higher Customer Quality score. Participants with a higher Customer Quality score were also more likely to report well controlled diabetes status. An overall imperfect Quality Index score (70) reflects significant room for overall quality improvement of diabetes care services. The younger participants reported lower Quality Index scores than older ones. Higher Quality Index scores were highly significantly associated with reporting better diabetes control status and continuity of care. There were no significant differences in the Quality Index scores in terms of gender, participants&#146; education level and diabetes complications. CONCLUSION Customer quality appears to be a useful third dimension in conceptualising quality in health care, particularly in the context of chronic disease where good selfmanagement can improve the outcomes of care. A substantial proportion of Queensland adults with Type 2 diabetes reported receiving suboptimal care. From the perspective of people with Type 2 diabetes there is a notable gap between their expectations and what they have actually received in most aspects of provided care. The overall service quality and choice of care provider, accessibility, prevention, continuity, timeliness and safety were identified to be of inadequate quality. Participants also reported relatively low customer quality scores based on the personal knowledge, skills and confidence as well as low overall quality score for delivered diabetes care. Thus, there was a significant opportunity to improve the quality of diabetes care on all three dimensions. The study demonstrated that a patient selfadministered survey is a potentially useful way of measuring all three dimensions of quality of care for diabetes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quality in health care</field><field name="subject">technical quality</field><field name="subject">service quality</field><field name="subject">customer quality</field><field name="subject">Type 2 diabetes</field><field name="subject">patients&#146; perspective</field><field name="subject">adherence to diabetes guidelines</field><field name="subject">quality index.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158658</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attention and Relations in Conceptual Combination</field><field name="creator">Ramm, Brentyn</field><field name="description">Combined concepts such as computer chair, road rage, and terrorist threat are common in everyday language. Combining concepts into novel meanings is achieved spontaneously in conversation, and serves to decrease working memory loads. Due to this function, it could be argued that conceptual combination is a process similar to chunking. Yet despite the importance of conceptual combination to human cognition, and the assumption that chunking occurs in working memory (e.g., A. D. Baddeley &amp; G. Hitch, 1974), no previous studies have assessed the role of attention in the process of conceptual combination. The Competition Among Relations in Nominals (CARIN) theory (C. L. Gagne &amp; E. J. Shoben, 1997) proposes that relations provide the mortar for combining concepts. Furthermore, these relations compete to become the binding link between concepts, with priority given to relations that historically have been frequently linked with the modifier (Relational Frequency). Since evidence has shown that the binding of relations is a capacity-constrained process (e.g., G. S. Halford, W. H. Wilson &amp; S. Philips, 1998; N. Robin &amp; K. J. Holyoak, 1995) this thesis seeks to elucidate the role of attention and relations in conceptual combination. The attentional demands of combining novel modifier-noun phrases are explored in Experiment 1 using a dual-task methodology (digit transformation). The results show that a concurrent task significantly increases the response time of a sense-nonsense decision, supporting the hypothesis that conceptual combination is capacity-limited. However, it was not clear from the results whether it is the simultaneous activation of the word meanings, the combination process itself, or both that requires attention. To assess this issue, Experiment 2 used probe reaction time (RT) as an indication of the attentional demands of a sense-nonsense decision or a lexical decision to the word-pairs. The results show that the process of conceptual combination is attentionally demanding after accounting for the demands of activating the constituent meanings of the wordpairs. No effect of Relational Frequency was found on attention in this experiment. However, each participant only made a sense-nonsense decision to half of the phrases, therefore the variability of scores was poor for assessing this issue. Experiment 3, therefore, again assessed probe RT but used a sense-nonsense decision for all of the word-pairs. Results show that the linking of concepts with a low frequency relation is more attentionally demanding than linking with a relation of high frequency. Further investigations used Google hit rates as an indication of word-pair familiarity, and show contrary to E. J Wisniewski and G. L Murphy (2005) that familiarity of the word-pair does not account for Relational Frequency. A new metric of relations (Relational Familiarity) was developed based upon the median Google score of each relational type. While both Relational Frequency and Relational Familiarity provided equal contributions to the accuracy of the sense-nonsense decisions, frequency of the relational type was subsumed by familiarity in predicting probe RT. That is, Relational Familiarity provided the best predictor of the capacity-demands of conceptual combination, thus showing that it is easier to select relations of high familiarity than low familiarity. Inhibition was suggested as a viable candidate for this selective mechanism. Lastly, relation competition was shown to be a poor predictor of probe RT scores. These findings, in conjunction with previous research, support a Capacity-Constrained Relation Selection model of conceptual combination, including four characteristics: 1. Relations compete in parallel in the activated proportion of long-term memory to enter the focus of attention. 2. The activation and maintenance of the meanings of the individual word-pairs is attentionally demanding. 3. The selection of relations is also a capacity-constrained process. 4. The difficulty of selecting a relation depends upon its familiarity rather than its frequency. This project extended the CARIN model (C. L. Gagne &amp; E. J. Shoben, 1997) to show that attention has a function in both forming new representations and in the selection of relations. Overall, it was demonstrated that attention plays an essential role in forming combined concepts and thus should be included in any valid model of this process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158342</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Effective Bentonite Adsorbents for Colour Removal</field><field name="creator">Hu, Qiuhong</field><field name="description">Adsorption techniques have been widely used to remove certain classes of pollutants from wastewaters, especially those that are not easily biodegradable. Desired adsorbent should have sufficient adsorption capacity, high thermal and chemical stability, low cost and low environmental impact. The successful implementation of solid-liquid phase dye adsorption requires stable and effective adsorbents. This thesis focuses on the development of effective bentonite adsorbent for dye removal. Bentonite is a layered clay having the potential to be an alternative low-cost adsorbent because it is abundantly available and possesses unique physiochemical properties, such as cation exchange ability. However, it is this property that makes bentonite unlikely to adsorb anionic species. In order to remove contaminants in effluents that normally contain both cationic and anionic materials, it is necessary to develop a composite adsorbent which is capable of removing both cationic and anionic dyes. The screening of various bentonite based adsorbents was first conducted for the purpose of exploring the possibility of anionic dye removal. From the literature, there are a number of bentonite modification techniques effective for dye removal. Considering the previous work conducted in our group, the methods of acid activation and aluminium pillared clay were preliminary tested. However, the dye removal results showed that there was no improvement following these modification processes. We found that it is necessary to investigate the adsorption mechanism before proceeding with any further modification attempts. A systematic cationic dye adsorption study was then carried out between bentonite and a cationic dye under various experimental conditions, such as the changes of solution temperature and pH, and the addition of salt. The results indicated that it is the cation exchange property dominating the removal of dye from aqueous solution. In this study, a simple and effective technique to modify the natural unpurified bentonite clay has been developed and the process parameters have been optimised. The modification was achieved by introducing layered double hydroxide (LDH) into bentonite interlamellar region, allowing for anionic materials to be adsorbed. LDHs are anionic clays, consisting of positively charged metal hydroxide layers with balancing interlayer anions and water molecules. These anions together with water presented in the interlayer space or on the surface of LDHs can be exchanged with other anionic species. The modification of bentonite with LDH is expected to take the advantage of LDH to adsorb anionic dyes. To obtain the optimum modification result, the influence of a number of process parameters has been investigated, such as LDH loading and particle size, as well as the calcination temperature of the modified clay. The surface properties of the novel composite adsorbent was characterised using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nitrogen sorption techniques. The adsorption ability of the LDH modified bentonite adsorbent was examined in the single dye adsorption, binary component dye adsorption and the column systems. Five commercial dyes were selected to conduct the experiments, they are Acid Red 18 (AR18), Acid Yellow 23 (AY23), Basic Red 2 (BR2), Reactive Yellow 2 (RY2) and Direct Blue 1 (DB1). The single component adsorption equilibrium data were analysed using the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Redlich-Peterson isotherm models. The adsorption capacity estimated from the linear Langmuir equation was found to be in the order of AY23 &gt; AR18 &gt; RY2 &gt; DB1 &gt; BR2. The binary component dye adsorption involved two pairs, one was composed of AR18 and AY23, and another one was RY2 and BD1. The adsorption parameters obtained from single component were adopted to predict the binary results, but the fitting results were poor because of the significant competition and interaction between the dyes. The bed depth service time (BDST) model was applied to the column adsorption system and the results could be used as basis for the design of industrial scale-up operation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158450</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vapours and visions religious dimensions of DMT use</field><field name="creator">Tramacchi, Desmond Thomas</field><field name="description">Not available</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440207 Religion and Society</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158343</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secondary Nucleation Characteristics of Protein Crystals</field><field name="creator">Tait, Stephan</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to establish whether secondary nucleation mechanisms proposed for the crystallization of non-protein materials are shared with protein crystallization. In addition, the density of crystals for non-protein materials influences their secondary nucleation behaviour. The density of a protein crystal is interesting in that it varies with the density of the liquid in which it is suspended or stored. Similarly, the density of protein crystals may change with crystal drying in air, an important consideration for post-crystallization handling and storage of protein crystals. The effect of crystal drying on protein crystal density is investigated briefly in this thesis. The propensity of protein crystals to generate potential secondary nuclei by attrition is characterized from crystal mechanical properties measured by indentation. A fracture toughness value of a protein crystal (tetragonal hen egg white lysozyme) is measured for the first time and is found to be 1.6 x 10-3 MPa m1/2. This value is two orders of magnitude lower than the measured values for potassium sulphate (165 x 10-3 MPa m1/2) and glutamic acid crystals (68 x 10-3 MPa m1/2). This observation indicates that lysozyme is much more fragile than the two non-protein materials. Lysozyme crystals have an indentation hardness value of 15 MPa. This value is two orders of magnitude lower than the measured hardness for glutamic acid (2158 MPa) and the literature hardness for potassium sulphate. This observation indicates that lysozyme is most prone to deform plastically. Lysozyme and potassium sulphate have similar brittleness indices (hardness/fracture toughness), which indicates that these two materials have a similar tendency to deform plastically rather than fracture. The available literature shows that potassium sulphate crystals undergo attrition from collisions in stirred suspensions. Thus, it is expected that lysozyme would behave similarly, but would attrite at a greater rate due to its much lower fracture toughness and hardness. The density of part-dried protein crystals (hen egg white lysozyme) are measured for the first time and are observed to change by as much as 15 % from a wet crystal (1.17 g/mL) to a dry one (1.39 g/ml). The moisture content of lysozyme crystals in contact with air at different relative humidities are measured and are found to vary with the air humidity. The moisture content of lysozyme crystals in air at high relative humidities (&gt; 80 % RH) approach that of crystals whose interstices are fully filled with liquid (as in solution). These results suggest that the density of lysozyme crystals would vary significantly with the humidity of the air in which they are stored. Nucleation thresholds are estimated from nucleation induction periods measured at different levels of supersaturation, solution temperature, pH and buffer and sodium chloride concentrations. Primary nucleation induction periods are significantly influenced by solution pH, buffer concentration and supersaturation. Secondary nucleation induction periods are significantly influenced by solution pH, sodium chloride concentration and supersaturation. Supersaturation is the factor with the greatest influence on the induction periods for both primary and secondary nucleation. The induction period for primary nucleation decreases approximately log-linearly with increasing supersaturation. The estimated primary nucleation threshold for a nominated induction period of 1 hour is approximately 9 times the solubility concentration. The estimated secondary nucleation threshold for a nominated induction period of 1 hour was approximately 4 times the solubility concentration. These nucleation thresholds are used to select operating conditions for nucleation experiments of this thesis. Fluid-shear secondary nucleation occurs when circulating crystallizer solution shears off material from a growing crystal surface to become nuclei in solution. The importance of fluid-shear secondary nucleation in protein crystallization is assessed. Methods used by others to investigate fluid-shear nucleation for non-protein systems are further developed and applied for the first time to the crystallization of a protein system (hen egg white lysozyme). Secondary nucleation occurs, but the results do not suggest that fluid-shear nucleation significantly contributes to the overall nucleation kinetics. Secondary nucleation rates are measured for lysozyme crystallization in a stirred vessel at different conditions of solution temperature, sodium chloride concentration, supersaturation, stirring speed, the volume of seed crystals added and seed crystal size. Lysozyme crystallization exhibits moderate secondary nucleation rates when compared with that found by literature studies on the continuous crystallization of potassium sulphate and glutamic acid. Thus, the substantial differences in mechanical strength between crystals of lysozyme and these non-proteins are not reflected by substantial differences in secondary nucleation rates, perhaps due to the influence of inertia and its effects on the frequency of crystal collisions. Fluid-shear nucleation in the crystallization of non-proteins exhibits a strong dependency on supersaturation. The influence of supersaturation on the kinetics of secondary nucleation for lysozyme crystallization is found to be not significant over experimental variability. This observation indicates that fluid-shear nucleation is not likely to be an important mechanism in the crystallization of lysozyme. This observation supports the findings of the fluid-shear experiments. Increasing stirring speed is found to increase the kinetics of secondary nucleation in lysozyme crystallization, which can indicate that secondary nucleation by attrition is occurring. The amount and size of seed crystals typically exert a notable influence on attrition-based secondary nucleation in the crystallization of nonproteins. It is observed that these variables do not significantly influence secondary nucleation rates for stirred lysozyme crystallization. The influence of these variables may be overshadowed by the well-known experimental variability of secondary nucleation rates, which is also observed in the experiments of this thesis. In answer to the research question of this thesis, the overall findings indicates that nucleation by attrition is likely to be a mechanism of secondary nucleation which is shared by the crystallization of many non-proteins and the crystallization of the model protein hen egg white lysozyme. Studies in the literature show that fluid-shear nucleation occurs in the crystallization of the non-proteins: sucrose, citric acid, magnesium sulphate heptahydrate and potash alum. The observations of this thesis indicate that fluid-shear nucleation is not a significant mechanism of secondary nucleation in the crystallization of lysozyme.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158659</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and Modelling of Expansion Tubes</field><field name="creator">Scott, Michael Paul</field><field name="description">The accurate simulation of flow conditions encountered by aircraft is imperative to the development of aeronautics and astronautics. Test flights are expensive and time consuming, thus, ground based test facilities provide the majority of data in new flight regimes. A mixture of analytical studies, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), experimental results from ground based test facilities and actual atmospheric flights are required to obtain important design parameters. Coupled with this need for aerodynamic information, is a constant desire to simulate higher flow speeds. Expansion tubes provide an option for testing aeroshells such as the new Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) or the high enthalpy end of scramjet flight regime. A unique opportunity already exists in which the fabricated hardware for the RHYFL shock tunnel could be utilized to create the world&#146;s largest expansion tube, RHYFL-X. This thesis continues a project which attempted to investigate if RHYFL-X would be a beneficial experimental tool. This thesis began by installing and commissioning a new single-stage, free-piston driver for the X2 expansion tube located at the University of Queensland. The new configuration provided a smaller scale version of the RHYFL-X expansion tube on which testing could be performed. It also provided a number of advantages which would lead to increased performance in the X2 facility. Once installation was complete, a series of experiments was conducted to ensure that the new driver configuration was operating correctly and to determine the capabilities of it. Four conditions were examined. Two air conditions which produced secondary shock speeds of 8.14 km/s and 8.61 km/s, a condition to simulate the entry into the Titan atmosphere at 5.51 km/s and another condition to simulate entry into the Jovian atmosphere at 10.2 km/s. Numerical one-dimensional models were examined along with hybrid simulations, which used the one-dimensional model up to rupture of the secondary diaphragm and then coupled this to an axisymmetric simulation of the acceleration tube. The results from these numerical simulation models compared well to the experiments and showed that the new driver provided a significant increase in the stagnation pressures that could be generated in the expansion tube over the old two-stage, free-piston driver. There have been claims in previous studies that an expansion tube nozzle would not only increase the core flow diameter but also the steady time available for testing. However, this claim has never been physically demonstrated. A full-capture, contoured, shockfree nozzle was designed for the new X2 configuration. The design code for the nozzle incorporated a flow solver for the Parabolized Navier-Stokes (PNS) equations coupled to a Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm. A 1.4m nozzle was installed at the end of the acceleration tube and a series of experiments conducted. CFD simulations similar to the hybrid method mentioned above were conducted with the nozzle attached. The experiments again matched well with the numerical models. The results indicated that the addition of the nozzle produced a larger core flow diameter and longer test time as had been claimed. However, the improvements were not as significant as predicted by the axisymmetric simulations. Extremely large boundary layers were formed but sufficient core flow was still generated to enable the testing of models. Both the addition of a single-stage, free-piston driver and a contoured nozzle has significantly increased the capabilities of the X2 expansion tube. The numerical models that are used in this thesis provide an excellent basis for the prediction of the flow that can be generated in the X-series of expansion tubes located at the University of Queensland. Following the success of this project, the larger X3 expansion tube located at the University of Queensland is going to be refurbished with a single-stage, free-piston driver and a nozzle.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158451</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CONSUMPTION OF MOBILE DEVICES: EXPLORING THE IMPACT OF EXPERIENTIAL VALUE AND EMOTIONS ON CONSUMER ACTIONS</field><field name="creator">Andrews, Lynda Margaret</field><field name="description">With the rapid diffusion of mobile phones into modern society, marketers are seeking to interact with their consumers in ways that leverage the advantages of this new technology. The attraction is that of unparalleled mobility - now marketers have the potential to reach their customers almost anywhere, anytime. Current research, however, tends to focus specifically on consumer perceived value towards mobile service offerings or their responses to forms of advertising on mobile phones. It is argued in this thesis that researchers should be attempting to understand what owning and consuming a mobile phone means to the consumer as a total experience. This view acknowledges that an individual&#146;s consumption of a mobile phone is not primarily based in the marketing experience, but that there is the potential to engage in such activity to enhance the experiential nature of owning and using this technology. The program of research in this thesis applied an experiential view of consumption as the theoretical lens through which to examine individuals&#146; consumption of mobile phones. Furthermore, the research included an ongoing examination of how marketing could be integrated into these consumption experiences. The research undertaken addressed the following overarching research question. Within an experiential view of consumption &#150; how do consumers cognitively, affectively and behaviourally respond to receiving marketing communications on their mobile phones as part of their everyday consumption practices? From a review of the literature, five research questions were developed to address five identified gaps in consumer behaviour knowledge relating to the experiential consumption of mobile phones and marketing&#146;s integration into these experiences. These questions were then mapped on to a conceptual model of consumers&#146; cognitive, affective and behavioural responses to receiving mobile marketing (m-marketing) communications. The first two studies in this thesis provided an in-depth exploration of the consumption practices, consumption values and consumption emotions experienced by mobile phone users in order to understand how marketing activities might be integrated to enhance this total experience. These findings were then incorporated into a revised conceptual model, which was tested in the confirmatory third study. Each study and its findings are discussed as follows. Study One addressed research questions one and two posed in the literature review and involved an exploratory, two-part research design using qualitative research and Q methodology. The qualitative component examined the experiential consumption of mobile phones contextually situated as social and communicative practices. M-marketing activities were included also as part of these experiential consumption practices. The Q methodology component analysed the findings at a collective level to examine the extent to which individuals&#146; cognitive and affective experiences were shared by others. Findings in Study One highlighted how the interviewees contextually situated their social and communicative consumption practices. These practices reflected how the mobile phone was integrated into their lives and the extent to which they used this technology to let others in or keep them out, including marketers. The second stage of the study integrated two Q sort analyses to examine how individuals could be clustered regarding their shared cognitive and affective opinions on the experiential value of their mobile phones. This resulted in three clusters, the Mobile Pragmatists, the Mobile Connectors and the Mobile Revelers, named for the aspects of experiential value that identified each cluster. These clusters were also linked to their subjective opinions about how mmarketing might enhance these value perceptions. Study Two was also exploratory and addressed research questions three and four. The study used experience sampling method (ESM) in an innovative research design, named the ESM-SMS method. This method was used to collect repeated measures of participants&#146; experiential emotions during everyday consumption practices with their mobile phones. The study included m-marketing activities to contextualise m-marketing as part of an individual&#146;s everyday experiential consumption practices with this technology. Findings in Study Two identified the range, frequency and intensity of emotions that individuals&#146; experienced over a seven day period of using their mobile phones. These emotions arose from a number of situations or events involved with everyday mobile phone use, clustered as experiential consumption practices. The findings showed that overall, individuals more frequently experienced positive emotions than negative ones, which were also experienced more intensely, particularly from their everyday interactions with others. However, individuals also experienced both positive and negative emotions in situations that represented ways that mobile phones were integrated into their everyday life. Furthermore, the findings identified a relationship between gender and undesirable mobile phone activity, suggesting that people are more likely to experience bullying or harassing through their mobile phones. Additionally, there was a relationship between age, gender and negative emotions experienced, which suggested that younger women experienced more sadness from their mobile phone consumption. The results also showed that marketing situations and events did not specifically arouse negative emotions in participants; instead, such activity reduced the intensity of their positive emotions. In Study Three, the results from the two exploratory studies were used to inform the revision of a conceptual model that was developed from the literature review. This study addressed research question five. Additionally, the research questions guiding Studies One and Two were further addressed in this conceptual model through the hypotheses that were tested. Using appraisal theory, this confirmatory study examined consumers&#146; cognitive and affective appraisals of m-marketing communications under specified m-marketing communication conditions. These conditions were identified as: product consistency, incentives and permission giving that were manipulated in the experimental scenarios. The study was extended to examine consumers&#146; subjective behavioural responses to mmarketing communications, identified as action tendencies likely to impact on organisations using m-marketing communication strategies. The findings in Study Three provided extensive insights into consumers&#146; cognitive, affective and behavioural responses to appraising marketing communications on their mobile phones. The findings showed how different combinations of emotions were elicited under manipulated marketing conditions, in particular, multiple emotions and mixed emotions. The results also showed how these emotions influence action tendencies, that is, a consumer&#146;s behavioural intention to take actions that either engage or disengage with the company sending the m-marketing communication. In addition, the findings provided insights into emotions elicited from viral marketing strategies, that is, when people forward m-marketing communications to friends. This investigation also included insights into the action tendencies that individuals might feel like taking that either engage or disengage with the friend sending the viral m-marketing communication. The program of research contributed to consumer research in three areas: experiential consumption, consumer emotions and methodology in consumer behaviour research. The contributions to experiential consumption were made by addressing the five identified gaps in the literature in terms of the experiential consumption of mobile phones and marketing&#146;s integration as part of these everyday experiences. The three studies also provided a comprehensive answer to the overarching research question through the five research questions addressed. The contribution to consumer emotions research was made through a systematic focus on consumers&#146; affective responses to the experiential consumption of mobile phones and m-marketing. The contributions to marketing methodology arose from the mixed methods studies applied in the thesis. In Study One, Q methodology was used to extend the interpretist study of consumer behaviour to make the collective aspects of these subjective experiences more readily accessible while retaining a qualitative methodology. The second study demonstrated a method for integrating mobile phone technology into an ESM research design, thereby contributing to emerging literature on the use of mobile technologies in ESM. The third study demonstrated the utility of applying appraisal theory as a complementary theory-based approach to examining consumers&#146; cognitive, affective and behavioural responses to marketing stimuli. The research contributed to marketing practice through identifying ways to conceptualise consumers&#146; social and communicative consumption practices with their mobile phones and how marketing can be conceptualised as part of these practices. The research also contributed to marketers&#146; understanding of consumer emotions elicited through receiving m-marketing communications and the marketing conditions that elicit these emotions. The findings also provided an understanding of consumers&#146; behavioural responses in terms of the actions they might take in relation to a company or friend sending m-marketing communications. Limitations in the research were identified in terms of the sampling techniques used and the methodological concerns in developing the three studies. A program of future research directions was identified that suggested opportunities to retest the conceptual model of consumers&#146; cognitive, affective and behavioural responses to receiving m-marketing communications. The studies developed and reported in this thesis provide the springboard for a number of research directions that will contribute to conceptualising and theorising the emerging area of m-marketing in order to inform theory and practice.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158345</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bactrocera tryoni Volatiles: Spiroacetal Structure, Synthesis and Biosynthesis</field><field name="creator">Booth, Yvonne</field><field name="description">The Queensland Fruit Fly, Bactrocera tryoni is the most damaging horticultural pest in Australia having in excess of 200 host plants and being found all along the eastern coast. The annual cost to the horticultural industry from this species alone, is estimated to be AUD$500 million, through lost production, population monitoring and control programs. Current control methods are based on a combination of insecticides, bait sprays, chemical lures and the release of sterile males, all of which have inherent problems. Therefore, recent interest has focused on the development of pheromone based control measures, which are more species specific and environmentally benign. However, for this type of approach to become viable a detailed knowledge of pheromone biosynthesis in the target species is essential. This thesis describes the delineation and disruption of biosynthetic pathways to some of the minor spiroacetal components released by B. tryoni. Chapter one provides an overview of previous research into spiroacetal biosynthesis in Bactrocera species and describes the nomenclature and characteristic mass spectrometric fragmentation patterns of spiroacetals, which are referred to throughout this thesis. The suite of spiroacetals produced by female B. tryoni is introduced, as well as those from the closely related fruit fly species B. cucumis, B. cacuminata and B. oleae. The proposed biosynthetic pathways to the major spiroacetal component are summarised for each of these species, with the importance of the cytochromes P450 being highlighted. Chapter two describes an investigation into the biosynthesis of the unusual C12 spiroacetal, 2-ethyl-8-methyl-1,7-dioxaspiro[5.5]undecane and C13 spiroacetal, 2-methyl-8-propyl-1,7-dioxaspiro[5.5]undecane in B. tryoni. The syntheses of over thirty potential precursors, with the majority bearing deuterium labels, are described. This required the development of divergent synthetic routes, which would allow for the introduction of isotopic labelling and characterisation of the deuterated products by 1H and 13C NMR and mass spectrometric analysis. The potential precursors were then administered to female B. tryoni and the level of deuterium incorporation into 2-ethyl-8-methyl-1,7-dioxaspiro[5.5]undecane or 2-methyl-8-propyl-1,7-dioxaspiro[5.5]undecane qualitatively monitored by analysing the volatile fly emissions by SPME coupled GCMS. From the relative incorporation levels and the identification of some of the exceptionally minor spiroacetals, which were also biosynthesised (in particular 2-methyl-8-ethyl-1,7-dioxaspiro[5.6]dodecane), it was ultimately possible to conclude that B. tryoni biosynthesises these minor spiroacetals from fatty acids via 2,6-dioxygenated precursors and presumably by a modified fatty acid &#946;-oxidation pathway. The third chapter describes a detailed investigation into the possibility of P450 mediated hydroxylation of a diketone intermediate rather than a hydroxy ketone being the penultimate biosynthetic step. The synthesis and administration of specifically labelled [2-2H]-2-hydroxydodecan-6-one and [2-2H]-2-hydroxytridecan-6-one provided direct evidence for the former, as the precursors were respectively converted into 2-ethyl-8-methyl-1,7-dioxaspiro[5.5]undecane and 2-methyl-8-propyl-1,7-dioxaspiro[5.5]-undecane with retention of the deuterium label. Even though the alternative pathway could not be ruled out, the former was further supported by the synthesis and administration of 2-hydroxy-2-methyldodecan-6-one which was converted into the non-natural spiroacetal, 2,2-dimethyl-8-ethyl-1,7-dioxaspiro[5.5]undecane. Conversely, the loss of deuterium label from the synthesised and administered mono-oxygenated precursors, [2-2H]dodecan-2-ol and [2-2H]tridecan-2-ol and the lack of incorporation from 2-methyldodecan-2-ol confirmed that the early biosynthetic steps proceed through a C2 ketone, which is in agreement with a modified &#946;-oxidation type pathway. Chapter four describes the identification, synthesis and characterisation of two novel spiroacetals biosynthesised by B. tryoni. The first, 2-methyl-8-ethyl-1,7-dioxaspiro-[5.6]dodecane, is noteworthy not only as the second member of this spiroacetal system but also as its first disubstituted derivative. Furthermore, this spiroacetal, which was determined to have a high enantiomeric excess in favour of the (2S,6R,8S)-isomer in vivo, played a pivotal role in determining that spiroacetal biogenesis in B. tryoni occurred via 2,6-dioxygenated precursors. The second spiroacetal, 2-ethyl-2,8-dimethyl-1,7-dioxaspiro[5.5]undecane is a rare branched chain spiroacetal, which was also determined tentatively to have (2S,6R,8S)-stereochemistry in vivo. However, the biological origin of the branch-position with the required (2S) stereochemistry is still uncertain. The final chapter describes the synthesis of acetylenic compounds based on the highly incorporated potential precursors, which irreversibly bind to and inhibit the action of cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in spiroacetal biosynthesis. Preliminary results from the administration of these inhibitors, followed by precursors to either 2-ethyl-8-methyl-1,7-dioxaspiro[5.5]undecane or 2-methyl-8-propyl-1,7-dioxaspiro[5.5]undecane indicated that two inhibitors resulted in a decrease in production of these spiroacetals in B. tryoni and so show promise for future applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158660</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of motivation through repertoire in intermediate cello students</field><field name="creator">Berry, Anne Irma</field><field name="description">The decision to research motivation through repertoire in intermediate cellists arose from two different perceived areas of need. Firstly, it was found that there was a scarcity of availability and accessibility of Australian compositions for intermediate cellists. Secondly, the literature suggested that there was a need for the further research of intrinsic motivation in the field of instrumental pedagogy. A review of the literature found that research into intrinsic motivation in instrumental pedagogy was mostly related to the 'process' of developing and maintaining motivation. Of the research which examined the aspect of 'content' in the maintenance of intrinsic motivation, this was mostly related to 'student choice'. This study emerged as a way of providing information to composers and teachers about what aspects of repertoire may be motivational. It investigates intrinsic motivation by questioning students and their teachers about which aspects of music repertoire are most likely to inspire students to practice more and strive for excellence. A discussion of the philosophies of Bruner and Csikszentmihalyi is included to give meaning and context to 'intrinsic motivation' in instrumental pedagogy. Research was conducted through purpose-designed questionnaires distributed to cello teachers and their students in Queensland. Questionnaires for teachers and students were very similar although the student questionnaire was a little shorter. The questionnaires gathered information on the most frequently used general teaching repertoire, as well as teachers&#146; experiences in teaching contemporary and Australian repertoire. Musical aspects investigated included style, emotional content, harmony, articulation, tempo (speed), tonality, and rhythm as well as cellistic techniques. This information was balanced with questions regarding the technical developmental requirements perceived necessary for intermediate students. In comparison with other motivators such as verbal encouragement, ensemble participation and preparation for performances and exams, repertoire was found to be a significant motivator for 'students' best work'. Students' preference for challenging music, or by contrast, beautiful music was a persistent theme throughout the results. The three characteristics which were nominated as most motivating by both teachers and students were fast and lively, from the Romantic period and for cello and piano. The strongest difference between results for teachers and students was on the characteristic of folk feel which produced opposite results for the two groups of respondents. Some differences were also found within the respondent groups on the basis of gender and age. It is noted that students acknowledged the benefits of learning more advanced aspects of technique, such as thumb position, in expanding the pool of repertoire which they would be able to play. It was confirmed that Australian repertoire was not often taught to students at this level and that this was, at least in part, because of a lack of availability. Suggestions have been made for both composers and teachers in choosing techniques and repertoire for intermediate students. However, the importance of asking students about their preferences is borne out by the volume and detail of students' individual responses. Also, by questioning their students, teachers are likely to be stimulating the valued development of 'metacognitive strategies' in adolescent students.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">750201 The performing arts (incl. music, theatre and dance)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158346</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entanglement, geometry and quantum computation</field><field name="creator">Dowling, Mark</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses a number of problems within the emerging field of quantum information science. Quantum information science can be said to encompass the more-established disciplines of quantum computation and quantum information, as well as rather more recent attempts to apply concepts, tools and techniques from these disciplines to gain greater understanding of quantum systems in general. The role of entanglement &#151; non-classical correlation &#151; has been of particular interest to date. Part I contributes to this later goal. In particular, we establish a connection between the energy of a many-body quantum system and the idea of an entanglement witness from the theory of mixed-state entanglement. This connection allows mathematical results about entanglement witnesses to be translated into physical results about many-body quantum systems, specifically energy and temperature thresholds for entanglement. For the case of two qubits we are able to establish fairly detailed results about the behaviour of entanglement with temperature. We also study entanglement in systems of indistinguishable particles, where even the question of which quantum states should be regarded as entangled has been the subject of much controversy. We aim to clarify this issue by applying Wiseman and Vaccaro&#146;s notion of entanglement of particles to a number of wellunderstood model systems. We discuss the advantages of the entanglement of particles approach compared with other methods in common use. Finally, we study the operational meaning of superselection rules in quantum physics, in particular the connection to the existence or not of an appropriate reference frame. We propose an experiment that aims to exhibit a coherent superposition of an atom and a molecule, apparently in violation of the commonly-accepted particle-number superselection rule. This result sheds light on the entanglement of particles approach to entanglement of indistinguishable particles. Part II returns to a fundamental question at the heart of quantum computation and quantum information, namely: how many quantum gates are required to perform a particular quantum computation? In other words, how efficiently can a quantum computer solve a particular computational problem? We establish a connection between this question and the field of Riemannian geometry. Intuitively, optimal quantum circuits correspond to &#147;free-falling&#148; along the shortest path between two points in a curved space. This opens up the possibility of using Riemannian geometry to study quantum computation, a possibility that was previously unknown. We provide explicit calculations of all the basic geometric quantities associated with the space, and give some preliminary results of applying geometric ideas to quantum computing. Finally, we explore more generally the connection between optimal control and quantum circuit complexity, of which the Riemannian metric described above can be viewed as a special case.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240301 Atomic and Molecular Physics</field><field name="subject">780102 Physical sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158661</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE ON-LINE PROCESSING OF ASPECTUAL COERCION: SOME PSYCHOLINGUISTIC CONSIDERATIONS</field><field name="creator">DeVelle, Sacha Leigh</field><field name="description">There is much we do not understand about the relationship between linguistic expressions and their cognitive functions. The mechanisms that underlie aspectual coercion are no exception. Aspectual coercion describes the interpretive effects that follow the realignment of temporal semantic mismatches between the verb and an external modifier. It is assumed that the reinterpretation of sentential information is dependent upon an extra-linguistic process absent from surface level structure. Attempts to account for this effect have focused on the aspectual characteristics of the verb and how these features interact with temporal modifiers. Prominent among these is Jackendoff's enriched compositional hypothesis (1997, 2002, 2003) that posits a two-step coercion process consisting of the temporal alignment of sentence level semantic features, followed by the insertion of conceptual (CS) structure. Such insertion is a necessary prerequisite for the coercion process that distinguishes simple (e.g., The light shone for an hour/until dawn) and enriched composition (e.g., The light flashed for an hour/until dawn) respectively. This dissertation examines the effects of punctual verbs externally modified by the adverbials for and until. It is particularly concerned with the on-line coercion effects for sentences that contain point action verbs (e.g., flash) and an achievement sub-class known as change in a state of affairs (CSA) verbs (e.g., borrow). The processing mechanisms that underlie such verbs modified by for and until have particular implications for the enriched compositional hypothesis and the process known as iteration (i.e., The light flashed for an hour/until dawn). This approach predicts that the iterative sense (i.e., multiple flashes) that emerges within such contexts will be the same across both adverbial types. A set of empirical studies presented here shows results that are partially compatible with this assumption. The enriched composition hypothesis does not, however, address CSA verb/modifier sentence combinations (e.g., The student borrowed the book for a week/until it was recalled). The present results for those sentences showed significantly longer processing on CSA verb/for combinations. This finding is attributed to aspectual verb switching, triggered by the adverbial for and the following insertion of CS that reflects an extended process (e.g., The student borrowed the book to read for a week). The studies presented here identify theoretical and empirical gaps for the enriched compositional hypothesis in terms of what characterizes sentence-level coercion shifts. The on-line processing implications that emerge for aspectual coercion show that the temporal semantic features pertinent to a verb type [atelic/telic] [durative/punctual] [homogenous/ heterogeneous] and modifier type [durational/bounded] contribute to linguistic and cognitive sentence-level interpretation. The type of coercion appears to depend upon both the temporal semantic feature of the verb and durative modification. Point action verbs are temporally [punctual], [atelic] and [homogeneous]. Such verb types lack internal structure and so rely on the [bounded] [durational] features of for and until to trigger an iterative effect. Access to CS supplies this sense of repetition. CSA verbs in contrast are also temporally [punctual] and [atelic], but encode a [heterogeneous] feature that allows for internal change. In such cases the [durational] feature of for selects for a process reading. This selection is dependent upon the available [heterogeneous] feature that internally switches the verb from an achievement to an extended process (i.e., an accomplishment reading). The insertion of such a process is extra-linguistic and thus accessed via CS in a manner similar to iteration. This effect does not emerge with until (i.e., The student borrowed the book until it was recalled) due to its [bounded] feature that places an inherent end upon the verb and consequent overall sentence level interpretation (i.e., the subsequent return of the book). In sum, the present studies refine and extend upon the assumptions made by the enriched compositional hypothesis. The overall findings further support a common theoretical argument advocated in lexical semantics, namely that the internal structure of a verb contributes to linguistic and cognitive sentence-level functions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158347</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal and catalytic degradation of high density polyethylene into useful fuels</field><field name="creator">Wallis, Michael Drew</field><field name="description">Developing environmentally friendly methods for the recycling and disposal of waste plastic is important for the efficient use of resources and environmental sustainability. Of the different strategies for waste plastic recycling, chemical recycling has shown great potential as an environmentally friendly method of disposing of a wide variety of plastics. The advantage of chemical recycling is that useful chemicals and fuels can be produced from waste plastic streams without significant effort spent sorting and purifying the plastic waste stream. The aims of this thesis were to demonstrate the potential of reactive extrusion as a method of degrading plastic into useful fuels and to investigate the reaction kinetics of the degradation of high density polyethylene (HDPE) through the use of population balances. The thermal degradation of HDPE was first studied using thermogravimetric analysis to identify important kinetic mechanisms and reaction rates. A population balance model was proposed to describe how the molecular weight distribution changed throughout the thermal degradation. The proposed model described the data well for all nonisothermal experiments however the model was less accurate at the slow reaction rates of the isothermal experiments. The thermal degradation of HDPE was then conducted in a reactive extruder for a variety of conditions. The important operating variables and behaviour of the reactive extruder were characterised, with the molecular weight distributions of the reactive extruder reaction products determined using gel permeation chromatography. A new population balance model was developed to describe the thermal degradation in the reactive extruder by incorporating two more model parameters, a parameter for the rate of scission&#146;s dependence on molecular size and a breakage kernel parameter that allowed departure from random breakage. The model parameters were estimated from the molecular weight data of the reactor products. The new model predicted the reactive extruder data well for all conditions, particularly so for the long residence time (slow screw speed) experiments. The new population balance model also performed better than the previous model when applied to the data obtained from thermogravimetric analysis. Finally the catalytic degradation of HDPE was conducted in the reactive extruder using two weight percent silica-alumina catalyst. All the catalytic degradation experiments produced a high yield of liquid with a liquid weight fraction ranging from 74 to 84 weight percent. The liquid produced was found to have a composition that was comparable to gasoline. The influence of the screw speed on the total mass flowrate of the reactive extruder was significantly less in the catalytic experiments compared to the thermal experiments. This was attributed to the decrease in effectiveness of screw to convey gaseous reaction products. A population balance model for catalytic degradation described the product distribution obtained from reactive extruder well. In conclusion this thesis has demonstrated the potential for developing a process to recycle waste plastic into useful fuels utilising a reactive extruder. Additionally population balances were successfully used to describe the molecular size distribution of HDPE undergoing both thermal and catalytic degradation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158452</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and Construction of a Humanoid Robot Platform for Walking Gait Research</field><field name="creator">Kee, Damien</field><field name="description">The desire to one day see a robot assistant cleaning our houses or walking our dogs has led to an increased interest into humanoid robotics research, and more specifically humanoid locomotion. At present, due to the high cost of robot platforms, there are only a small number of labs in the world conducting meaningful research on full sized humanoid robots. The existence of a low-cost humanoid platform would pave the way for greater involvement and development in the field of humanoid locomotion. This thesis describes the complete design and construction of an affordable humanoid robot platform for walking gait research, from the mechanical structure and actuator selection, right through to the required electronics and power storage implementation. The software required to operate the robot is discussed, from low-level feedback control through to high-level motion planning. The distributed nature of computational resources employed on this robot is outlined, along with the interaction with the robot&#146;s sensors and actuators. A position based control methodology is proposed and implemented using traditional feedback loops on the robot. Control parameters were initially hand-tuned but subsequently improved via the implementation of an off-line evolutionary algorithm. Shortcomings in the mechanical design limited the success of this control scheme, with significant positional error observed in all joints whilst executing a walking gait. Actuator non-linearities as well as significant flexion in the underlying structure contributed to this positional error. To compensate, a series of adaptive control techniques were in turn amalgamated with the initial control loop in an attempt to &#145;learn&#146; the system dynamics of the robot and provide adequate compensatory signals. These additional control schemes realised a slightly improved level of accuracy in simulation in the joint control space but not enough to compensate for the robot&#146;s significant mechanical flexion. Extensive hand tuning of algorithm parameters and excessive memory requirements prevented their implementation on the real robot. This robot competed at two international robot competitions with acceptable results. In 2002, the robot competed in the Humanoid League of RoboCup02, in Fukuoka, Japan. The robot was the largest competing humanoid by a considerable margin and it achieved a ranking of 7th in both the freestyle and walking distance category, out of the ten humanoids competing. In 2005 the robot competed in the RoboCup competition, this time in Osaka, reaching the semi-finals of the penalty shootout for robots over 650 mm in height. The final robot was capable of rudimentary walking and other simple movements such as penalty shootout soccer skills, validating the structure&#146;s ability to withstand the forces required to execute a walking gait.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158662</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NEAR-SHORE GROUNDWATER FLOW AND SALT TRANSPORT PROCESSES IN A SUBTERRANEAN ESTUARY</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Clare Elizabeth</field><field name="description">It is widely recognised that submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) provides a significant transport pathway for chemicals entering the marine environment. Chemical fluxes to coastal waters via SGD may be influenced by the flow and reaction dynamics in subterranean estuaries. In contrast to extensive research conducted on surface estuaries, the processes and functioning of subterranean estuaries are not well studied despite their potential implications. To accurately predict subsurface chemical fluxes to coastal waters, there is a need for greater understanding of the water exchange, flow and transport mechanisms in the near-shore aquifer. Research is needed to identify conditions where different processes are likely to contribute significantly to SGD, and influence mixing dynamics and thus the fate of chemicals in subterranean estuaries. The work presented in this thesis examines the influence of near-shore processes (including tides, waves and density-driven convection) on the magnitudes of water exchange across the aquifer-ocean interface, and the extent and time-scales of mixing between recirculating seawater and fresh groundwater in a subterranean estuary. To understand the mixing conditions in a subterranean estuary, it is necessary to identify the main flow and salt transport mechanisms. This research is based on field and numerical experiments. Field data is collected from a sandy meso-tidal beach on the west coast of Moreton Island, Australia (27&#176;08'39.0" S, 153&#176;21'54.0" E). A numerical model is developed using the variable density groundwater flow code, SEAWAT-2000. The introductory chapter, Chapter 1, describes the problem, defines the scope and objectives of the research and presents a literature review. In Chapter 2 (published in Geophysical Research Letters), the main mechanisms for groundwater flow and salt transport in an intertidal subterranean estuary are identified. Field measurements, combined with modelling results, illustrate the complex and dynamic nature of the flow and transport processes. At the field site, these processes are driven primarily by tides, waves and their interactions with the beach morphology. Results show that salt transport associated with tide-induced seawater circulations leads to the formation of an upper saline plume in the intertidal region, in addition to the classical saltwater wedge. This upper plume represents an important mixing and reaction zone and thus may significantly influence the functioning of a subterranean estuary. Further insight into the salt-freshwater dynamics in the near-shore aquifer is provided in Chapter 3 (submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research - Oceans). Here, field data collected over a springneap tidal cycle, coupled with numerical simulations, examines the extent and timescales of mixing driven by different forcing. Dissolved oxygen and pH measurements provide evidence of potentially important biogeochemical zonations in a subterranean estuary which are strongly influenced by the tide-induced flow and exchange dynamics. Chapters 4, 5 and 6 focus on the influence of tidal forcing on the water exchange, flow and transport processes. A framework for quantifying these processes in a tidally-influenced subterranean estuary is presented in Chapter 4 (published in Advances in Water Resources). Numerical results demonstrate that the upper saline plume is a potentially more active and dynamic zone of mixing than the transition zone of the saltwater wedge. Based on the estuarine analogy, a systematic classification of subterranean estuaries based on stratification is introduced. In Chapter 5 (accepted in Water Resources Research), a detailed parametric analysis is conducted to examine the magnitude of tide-induced seawater recirculation across the aquifer-ocean interface for different tidal, inland hydraulic and aquifer conditions. Simulation results are analysed based on relevant non-dimensional groups to identify conditions for which tide-induced recirculation is likely to constitute a large portion of the total SGD. Results presented in subterranean estuary are strongly dependent on the relative magnitude of inland (fresh groundwater discharge) to tidal forcing. This is also a fundamental feature of surface estuaries. In Chapter 6, the numerical model is applied to examine the influence of tidal forcing on seawater intrusion in unconfined coastal aquifers, an effect that is currently not well understood. Tidal forcing is found to lead to a significant reduction in the overall extent of seawater intrusion in the aquifer under the condition of constant inland fresh groundwater flux. In Chapter 7, conclusions are drawn based on the preceding chapters and recommendations for further research are presented.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158454</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Loss of Leadership Machiavelli and Australian prime ministers</field><field name="creator">Bateman, Joel</field><field name="description">In this thesis I explore the phenomenon of the loss of political leadership. This is a problem which has not received much academic attention, yet it is important to understanding leadership in a broader sense. I examine the loss of leadership by using the writings of Niccol&#242; Machiavelli to assess four Australian prime ministers: John Gorton, Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. From Machiavelli&#146;s political writings and advice on successful leadership, I have drawn four criteria by which leaders can be measured. The leaders&#146; performance on these four measures can be used to explain their political success and failures. Machiavelli&#146;s method was one of observation and description, from which he constructed advice for political leaders. He self-consciously sought to present advice to leaders based on the realities of human nature, rather than on abstract theory or moral principles, and it is for this reason that his ideas are relevant to systems beyond Florence of the 15th and 16th centuries. Many aspects of political systems vary, but in most respects human nature remains the same, and thus Machiavelli&#146;s observations on leadership resonate today. The four measures of successful leadership I draw from Machiavelli are: political judgement and flexibility; the perception of strength; relationship with the public; and relationship with colleagues. To succeed, leaders need do well on each of these aspects of leadership, while poor performance on any will contribute to their loss of leadership. Australia&#146;s post-World War II experience has seen only Sir Robert Menzies choose the manner of his departure from office, with most of the remaining leaders falling through either of two ways: a party-room deposition or electoral defeat. A prime minister&#146;s style will affect the manner in which they lose their leadership. Of the four Australian prime ministers analysed and compared in this thesis, two ended their leadership through each of the two main forms of leadership loss. Similarities within, and contrasts between, the two groups of leaders exist.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158348</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE POTENTIAL FOR PEDIATRIC TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY DUE TO SHAKING</field><field name="creator">Couper, Zachariah Sol</field><field name="description">Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) is understood to refer to a recurring and specific pattern amongst infants presenting with brain injury, characterized by retinal and extracerebral haemorrhage, and a lack of external trauma to the head and neck. While numerous cases of SBS have been diagnosed, its validity is a contentious issue on both biomechanical and medical fronts, primarily due to a lack of understanding of the loading-injury relationship of infant shaking, and the parameters which are deterministic to its nature. In order to address this lack, a series of finite element representations of a three month infant head were developed to utilise the results of physical testing with an anthropomorphic infant surrogate. Physical testing involved subjecting the infant surrogate to manually applied shaking confined to the sagital plane, in the anteroposterior direction. The 3D kinematics of the torso and head of the surrogate were recorded using a motion tracking system. The output history was converted to an &#145;average shake&#146; profile, which in turn yielded translational and rotational sagital plane accelerations in the anatomic reference system of the head. This data is suitable for application to numerical models as boundary conditions, and constitutes a fundamental data set for future investigations. Brain matter material properties are a key component of finite element models of the head. Given the disparate body of research in this field, a detailed synthesis was conducted to determine appropriate representations for use in infant head models. This led to the proposal of a new infinitesimal strain viscoelastic model which was in good agreement with much of the past testing, and covered a much larger frequency range than has generally been used. Additionally, recently developed large strain models were proposed for use in future numerical modeling, given their superior ability to represent both shear and uniaxial test data for isotropic and transversely isotropic brain matter. Building upon the previous chapters, a series of 2D finite element models of the infant head were created in order to parametrically investigate the effects of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) modelling technique, CSF thickness, brain matter stiffness, dissipation and nonlinearity, and material differentiation. A novel method based on Reynolds lubrication theory was used to represent the subarachnoid CSF. The results attest to the need to represent CSF through fluid rather than solid mechanics, particularly in the loading regime associated with shaking, as opposed to impact. Furthermore, it is evident that the brain-CSF interaction is highly dependant on both the subarachnoid CSF volume, and the thickness variations associated with protusions of the gyri. These protusions alleviate deep brain stress concentrations and hence aid injury mitigation. Differentiating between types of brain matter led to noticeable changes in the evolution of the brain-CSF interaction, outside of those caused by average stiffness changes. Inclusion of the pia mater was important from a local stress reduction perspective. These results aided the development of a 3D finite element model of the infant brain. A method allowing for the creation of more optimal meshes of the head with the capacity for case specific adaption was developed and applied to create the model. CSF was represented through static pressure equilibration in combination with a locally based squeezing resistance. The results of the simulation indicate that anteroposterior shaking will lead to specific patterns of brain matter motion, with a rotational squashing caused at both extremes of the shaking cycle, combined with translational acceleration effects which generate a tendency for the brain to cleave to the underside of the superior portion of the cranium. Significant contact between the brain matter and the cranium/membranes is caused at each squashing extreme, while high strains are also developed in the corpus callosum and brainstem/cerebrum/cerebellum connections. Taking into account the repetition of these strain levels, it appears likely that focal axonal injury would be generated at these locations. The relative motion between the cranium and brain matter is substantial, and sufficient to overstretch many of the bridging veins, particularly those located superiorly, indicating a capacity for the development of subdural hematomas. Taken together, these results indicate the act of anteroposterior shaking of an infant is sufficiently traumatic to cause injuries to the contents of the cranial vault, in the absence of blunt trauma. The results of this thesis are suitable for consideration by medical practitioners. The partial predication of Shaken Baby Syndrome diagnosis on subdural hematoma development appears to be justified; in addition, improvements to the confidence of SBS diagnosis could be aided by the targeted detection of focal axonal injury. However, further work is required to improve the fidelity and performance of the numerical models, with the eventual aim of establishing a detailed correspondence between an applied head insult and the resulting injury pattern.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158663</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">OPTIMISATION OF LARGE-SCALE OVERNIGHT DELIVERY NETWORKS</field><field name="creator">Grenfell, Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with scheduling the delivery of a product (mail or similar courier products) across a large scale network serviced by several types of vehicle (aircraft and trucks) over a fixed time horizon (overnight). In particular, the application context is that of a national postal operator. The techniques have been used by New Zealand Post in New Zealand and Consignia (in particular, the Royal Mail division) in the United Kingdom with great success, and these contexts have provided data sets for this thesis. We construct a general network model of the transport network for postal operations at a national level. We then formulate an optimisation problem on this network which is to determine a set of transport services which essentially &#147;delivers all the mail&#148; with minimum total cost. Product from each location to all other locations on the network becomes available deterministically at specified times and must be delivered to its destination within specific time windows. Vehicles of varying speed and cost operating from depots (whose locations are to be decided) may travel on any of a specified set of links. Similarly product may take any route carried by any of these vehicles. Both product and vehicles may also wait at a location for any duration. Mathematically the problem can be described as a vehicle routing-like problem with multiple depots coupled with a multi-commodity network flow problem for product. This problem is formulated as the Overnight Delivery Problem. It is a new problem that has not been solved before in the context with which we are concerned. It is shown that a straightforward Mixed Integer Program formulation can solve only very small problem instances of this NP-hard problem. Hence a heuristic solution framework is developed which is suitable for largescale problems, as inspired by similar heuristics used in related transportation problems (the Less-Than-Truckload motor carrier industry in particular). The technique presented decomposes the problem into a product-flow subproblem and a vehicle routing-like subproblem. A path-based (column generation) Multicommodity Network Flow (MCNF) formulation is used to solve the former, and a set of constructive heuristics solves the latter. MCNF resolve time is reduced by adaptively controlling the number of columns kept between solves, thus balancing the execution time of the master LP with the time taken to generate new columns. We also show how initial solutions of good quality (and diversity when used in a Multistart framework) can be derived by manipulating the MCNF arc costs. The main algorithm iterates between the two sub-problems using the central concept of overflow to move towards feasibility. It is shown that the application of this heuristic produces high quality solutions in terms of the overall transport network cost, and that embedding within Multistart and Simulated Annealing metaheuristics (with suitable neighbourhoods) obtains slightly better results, and stabilises the search with respect to the parameters, for the more computationally amenable data sets. A variety of implementation and modelling issues are also considered in order that the mathematical model be practical in the context of a national postal corporation. These issues include innovative ways of modelling the costs of transshipping, deciding between transport modes in order to producing realistic mail routes, and modelling Travelling Post Offices.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158349</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GEOCHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL FACTORS CONTROLLING ARSENIC MOBILITY AT THE MOLE RIVER ARSENIC MINE AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Ai Duc</field><field name="description">Arsenic is a well known element that is very poisonous to human and other living organisms once it is mobilised into the environment due to either natural or anthropogenic causes. Soil and water contamination by arsenic has been reported all over the world. The Mole River Arsenic Mine is located in the northern New South Wales, Australia. It was one of the largest arsenic mines in the New England Fold Belt and its geological formation was associated with the intrusion of plutons and with volcanic activity in the Late Permian to Early Triassic. Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) and arsenic pentoxide (As2O5) were produced during the period 1924-1935 by Roberts Chemicals Limited from arsenopyrite mined from the sporadic lenses, bungs or pipes which are hosted in the metasedimentary Texas beds. A total of 19000 tonnes of arsenopyrite ore was mined and processed at the site. The mine was closed in 1940 but it was not until 2000 that it was partially rehabilitated. Some environmental research studies have been undertaken to define the arsenic contamination at the site and in the adjacent areas, however the geochemical and physical factors relating to arsenic mobility at the site have not been thoroughly investigated. This study was therefore proposed to fill the gap in this knowledge. The site was surveyed in detail, so that different areas could be accurately defined and characterised in terms of their soil types, vegetation, hydrology and extent of human impact. The leachability of arsenic, the hydraulic conductivity of the soils, the water release characteristics of the soils, site erosion, and the geochemical modelling of arsenopyrite oxidation were studied in detail for each area. The total concentrations of arsenic and other elements (Mg, Al, Fe, Mn, P, Cu, Zn and Pb), the soil mineralogy, the contents of organic matter and carbonate, the water chemistry and some other physicochemical parameters were also determined. The data was used to quantify the potential for arsenic release from the site, its mobility and the overall stability of the site. Finally, some recommendations for the rehabilitation of the site have been put forward. Inductively Coupled Plasma &#150; Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) and Inductively Coupled Plasma &#150; Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) were used to determine the concentrations of elements in total digests, in leachates obtained from leaching test using step 1 of the BCR sequential extraction scheme, and in surface water. The contents of organic matter and carbonate were determined from Loss on Ignition. Mineralogy was determined by X-Ray Diffraction. The Geochemist&#146;s Workbench&amp;reg; software and its database were used to model the oxidation of arsenopyrite. To determine soil physical factors, the intact core method was used for the measurements of soil bulk denisty, porosity, and initial soil water content. The constant potential supply method was used for the determination of hydraulic conductivity. Water contents at six different water potentials were determined by using sand bath, a vacuum pressure assisted ceramic suction plate, and a pressure plate apparatus. Finally, the RETC software was used to interprete the water contents in a wide range of water potentials. The concentrations of arsenic on the site soils ranged from 22 to ~ 300000 mg/kg, with an average of 44700 mg/kg. These values exceeded by about 4000 times the recommended arsenic levels issued by the National Environment Protection Council for soil quality (ANZECC/NHMRC, 1992) and were four times higher than the arsenic level found in one of the previous studies. The concentrations of arsenic varied in different soil types and greatly depended on the degree of the disturbance of the soil by the previous mining activities. Although the mine site was rehabilitated in 2000, the soils at the site have remained extremely contaminated by arsenic. Two important sources of the arsenic are the waste rock heap and the residual processed materials in the furnace and the flue. The results of soil mineralogy derived from this study (and from the existing knowledge) showed that arsenopyrite (FeAsS), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), arsenolite (As2O3), pharmacolite [Ca(HAsO4).2(H2O)], clinoclase [Cu3AsO4(OH)3], claudetite (As2O3) and krautite (Mn(HAsO4).2H2O) dominate in the waste rock and in the residual processed materials. Arsenic had been transported from these sources in AMD water to the soils. Much of the arsenic was held by ferrihydrite (5Fe2O3.9H2O), jarosite [KFe3(SO4)(OH)6] and goethite [&#225;-Fe3+O(OH)] and clays, and arsenic was also found to coprecipitate with iron to form scorodite (FeAsO4.2H2O). These associations were proved through significant correlation of arsenic with other elements such as Al, Fe, Mn, Cu, Pb and finely grained soils (FGS). Leaching tests showed that the order of the leachablity of the elements in soils was Mn&gt;Zn&gt;Cu&gt;P&gt;Mg&gt;As&gt;Al=Fe&gt;Pb and an average of 2.2% of the arsenic was leached from the soils. The leachability of arsenic was strongly dependent on the availability of the easily mobile fraction of arsenic bound to soils, and the forms of the solid phase which bind arsenic in the soils. Leached arsenic was not only derived from the easily mobile fraction bound to the soil surface, but also from dissolution of arsenic-bearing carbonates because the leachablility of arsenic was associated with the leachability of Mg and Mn and the content of carbonates in the soils. The absence of any associations of arsenic with Al, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Pb showed that arsenic was still held to the mineral forms of these metals in the soils. Although the leachablility of arsenic was low, the actual concentrations of mobile arsenic was elevated (200 mg/kg in average). Under natural conditions, arsenic in the soils at the mine is potentially mobilised with seepage or runoff water and eventually discharge into the local aquatic system. This migration however is strongly controlled by the degree of erosion of the soils at the site and by the textures, hydraulic conductivities and the water release characteristics of the soils. Measurements of the density, porosity, hydraulic conductivity and water content of the soils showed that the movement of water in the soils is not favoured for the retention of arsenic. The soils, particularly where they have been strongly disturbed by mining activities, have low densities (1.3 g/cm3), high porosities (50%) and hydraulic conductivities in the range of 400 &#150; 17000 cm/day. The values of water content in a range of water potentials of 1 &#150; 15000 hPa show that the soils are unlikely to be able to retain water. Approximately 50% of total water is lost at a water potential of 50 hPa (corresponding to the field capacity), indicating that when the mine site is subjected to rain, the soil water is immediately transported within the soil and arsenic is likely to be carried with the water. Soil erosion can be also a significant factor in the migration of arsenic. The erosion rate for the site has been estimated at 29 tonnes/ha/year which shows that the site has been subject to heavy erosion. An interpretation of rainfall records and soil profile shows that the heavy erosion has occurred at least twice since the site was rehabilitated in 2000. When the soils were saturated by high intensity rainfall, any rainwater falling on the mine site catchment area would have formed erosive runoff which would have physically carried arsenic-bearing materials to Sam&#146;s Creek, located immediately south east of the site. The results of sediment and water chemistry confirmed the migration of arsenic to Sam&#146;s Creek. The concentrations of arsenic in sediments upstream of the site were relatively low (240 mg/kg), but very high (2880 mg/kg) in the sediments collected next to the mine site, but then they decreased downstream of the mine site. This decrease in arsenic concentration in the downstream sediments plus the associations of arsenic with Mg, Al, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn and Pb and the presence of ferrihydrite, scorodite and carbonate shows that arsenic is co-precipitated and adsorbed immediately downstream. Water chemistry in Sam&#146;s Creek showed that arsenic in the water ranged from 12 to 2461 &#181;g/L and increased downstream from the mine site. This increase in arsenic in the water indicates the remobilisation of arsenic bound to the sediments (derived from dissolution of scorodite and carbonates). Although the Sam&#146;s Creek water had a high level of arsenic, which exceeded the ANZECC guideline values for irrigation, livestock and human drinking water, its level had fallen to below these recommended values after the water from Sam&#146;s Creek is discharged into the Mole River. The mechanisms leading to the decay of arsenic in the Mole River are dilution and co-precipitation. The reduction in Fe concentration in the Mole River water and arsenic in Sam&#146;s Creek water, and the presence of scorodite in the sediments at the confluence suggest co-precipitation of arsenic with iron. However, dilution apparently plays a vital role in reduction of arsenic in the Mole River water. Although the arsenic level was below the recommended values for water use, the Mole River water still suffered from elevated concentrations of Fe and Ni and thus it is not recommended for irrigation, or for livestock and human consumption. It is concluded that geochemical and physical factors have helped to define the sources, the level of contamination, and the pathway of arsenic at the Mole River Arsenic Mine site. The results also showed that the mine site has not been chemically and physically stabilised as it is evident that the waste rock heap and the residual processed materials in the collapsed furnace and the flue are undergoing ongoing oxidation and dissolution; soil erosion is occurring on the barren, non-vegetated catchment areas of the site and arsenic is being mobilised and transported to the aquatic system. These environmental concerns require the long-term stabilisation of the mine site, and the implementation of an effective rehabilitation program. Geochemical modelling of arsenopyrite oxidation showed that the oxidation of arsenopyrite in the presence of oxygen and water at pH 5.5, but without the adsorption and buffering capacity of non-sulphide minerals, led to a very acidic solution (pH 2.3) with a high arsenic content. When the non-sulphide mineral (calcite) took part in the reaction, the acidity remained unchanged, but the solution has a higher concentration of arsenic since adsorption was not taken into account in this model. However, when adsorption was considered, only 20% of the arsenic was removed from the solution. Any rehabilitation program should therefore provide for not only the revegetation of the catchment, the reconstruction of the sedimentation ponds, the building of a new repository into which all the strongly contaminated materials should be placed, but should also include the application of lime or limestone to the waste rock heap to reduce the acidity. The lime or limestone should be applied during the reshaping, reconstruction and capping of the waste rock heap, and the amount of lime needed to maintain the pH at around 5 should be determined. It is also recommended that the capping of the waste rock heap should be finished in a concave shape to avoid water infiltrating into it. In addition, Fe salts should be applied in the furnace and to the flue to increase the coprecipitation of any dissolved arsenic in runoff. The banks of Sam&#146;s Creek next to the mine site should be stabilised by suitable riprap materials. The implementation of these measures should ensure the long-term stability of the Mole River Arsenic Mine.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158455</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enabled to Engage in the Information Age: A Comparative Study of Broadband Take-up in Two Regions of Australia</field><field name="creator">Cameron, Alicia</field><field name="description">Australia has a large landmass and relatively small population and, like many countries, has embarked upon a program of telecommunications liberalisation. The most contentious issue emerging from the liberalisation of telecommunications in Australia is timely availability of advanced telecommunications services, such as broadband, in population -sparse, nonmetropolitan areas. Due to ongoing political debate this issue has received a lot of media attention, however, there has been very little empirical research undertaken to further understand the spatial effects and impacts of free -market reforms on non-metropolitan telecommunications services. The aim of this doctoral research was to provide much needed empirical data on the factors associated with the adoption of broadband technologies in a metropolitan and non -metropolitan area. These factors relate to cultural and attitudi nal as well as over-arching socio-demographic attributes. The study utilised a comparative, mixed methodology of qualitative and quantitative data collection within a broadly critical framework. The study sites compared in this research were the non-metropolitan, regional and rural lifestyle region of the Northern Rivers of New South Wales (NSW), and the metropolitan area of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) including the city of Canberra. These study sites have starkly different histories, populati ons, economies and cultures. They also have contrasting broadband infrastructures and development strategies. The central issue and impetus for the study was a perception that non -metropolitan areas were slipping into a position of social, political and economic disadvantage due to developing geographic disparities in access to telecommunications networks. This position was perceived to be developing due to recent events, technological innovation and changes in the domestic and global political and economic landscape. This work examines the dialectics between the urban/rural, the networked/non-networked, and the forces of centralisation/decentralisation emerging from recent events and policy. The underlying conflict examined is that of the interests of individuals, organisations and communities situated in non-metropolitan areas (related to the broad and sometimes nebulous term of &#145;regional development&#146;) against the interests of centralising, and economising (and usually urbanising), management hubs bein g enabled by new networking technologies. It is argued that non-metropolitan areas in Australia need greater fiscal capacity and political autonomy if they are to develop the capacity to adapt to, and engage with, the conditions of the new or knowledge-based economy, in what is becoming known as the &#145;information age&#146;. This applies to many areas, but is particularly relevant to the telecommunications sector. Regulatory mechanisms that may achieve better outcomes in terms of sustainable telecommunications systems in non-metropolitan areas of Australia are discussed as an afterword to the body of this work. Results from the quantitative and qualitative the data collected confirm that in November 2003 there were significant disparities in broadband adoption between the metropolitan and nonmetropolitan study sites: 27 per cent of respondents from the ACT had a broadband connection compared to just 11 per cent of respondents from the Northern Rivers. Differences in demand for broadband services between the study sites were less pronounced but still significant: 56 per cent of respondents from the ACT stated they would like to use one of the listed broadband applications compared to just 43 percent of respondents from the Northern Rivers. Other results from the data collection includes: x Broadband take-up by households is most associated with location of household (the Northern Rivers or the ACT), whether or not an individual thought the Internet was providing them with opportunities, home ownership and the presence of other information and communication technology (ICT) in the home; x Desire for broadband by individuals within households was most associated with location (the Northern Rivers or the ACT), gender, age and whether or not someone works from home; x Within organisations, factors such as negative network externalities resulting from more data traffic and larger files circulating on the Internet, exposure to, and training in, broadband applications and organisational structure, size and core competenc y were found to impact upon broadband take -up rates as well as broadband use. x Two very different populations studied illustrated contrasting lifestyles and values. These were measured by both the survey data and interview data. It is suggested that the differences found in attitudes, values and lifestyles between the two study sites impacted upon technology adoption choices including the adoption of broadband services. By acknowledging the role of ICTs including broadband as enabling technologies, thi s work also suggests that participation in a knowledge -based economy will be based on access to technology as well as access to knowledge on how to utilise, adapt and deploy the technology to support various industries. This was particularly highlighted in the comparison between the two study sites. The ACT, with a high degree of political autonomy and fiscal capacity through a) increased Federal Government expenditure and b) the reinvestment of &#145;state&#146; -based taxes, was able to deploy superior state and community infrastructure before there was a commercial market case. The large organisations in the ACT also played a vital role in resourcing as well as exposing employees to, and disseminating knowledge on the use of, related information and communication technologies. The development of broadband infrastructure in the Northern Rivers, in contrast, was hampered by a disorganised mix of state and federally resourced initiatives reliant on existing telephone-wire infrastructure. Local governments were not in the same financial or political position to offer equivalent infrastructure or support as a state -level jurisdiction such as the ACT, despite the recognition of potential economic and social benefits of deploying broadband infrastructure. This thesis argues that if regional communities in Australia are to share in the wealth of the information age, and contribute to the knowledge -based economy, there needs to be a reexamination of how regions are resourced for broadband infrastructure and future development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158350</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ambient Information Display</field><field name="creator">Jones, Paul Robert</field><field name="description">Ambient Information Displays provide alternate means of displaying information that does not require the direct attention of the user. As the amount of information that people need to process each day grows, alternative methods of information consumption need to be explored. Ambient Displays provide a way of doing this by exploiting people&#146;s peripheral processing capabilities. Significant previous research has investigated the development of different types of displays and analysed the ways that users interact with these displays. Commercial Ambient Information services in the form of wireless devices driven from central servers are available overseas. Little research however has been performed in the field of reusable frameworks for the display of Ambient Information. This work explores two assertions: Many apparently different Ambient Displays can be characterised in terms of a number of common functional modules. The common modules can be developed and reused to greatly simplify the implementation of later Ambient Displays, without each type of display needing to have the same inputs, outputs, or management methodologies. After a background exploration into devices, software structures and the current stateof- the-art in ambient technologies, an iterative development process is utilised to characterise in detail the components required. These components are to be reusable across multiple displays, so that subsequent implementations can be built more quickly and economically. The completion of the iterative process results in a number of developed components that were reused through each of these example displays. To validate the choice of components, a number of thought-experiment style implementations are conducted, where each potential application is analysed and an implementation utilising the developed components is proposed. The fundamental aspect of the proposed set of components is &#147;Scenario Based Information Transformation&#148;. The assertion is that displays consist of transformations of data from one form to another; the underlying work performed by any given application can be modelled in terms of a transformation scenario. To support applications based on top of scenarios, the following components are required: - Underlying web framework &#150; providing the basic environment in which to develop applications. - Executors &#150; application installed on local user&#146;s machines, performing the actual transformation work in taking data from sources and transforming it for the outputs. - Authentication/Identity Management &#150; web application supporting the OpenID protocol, and managing identity information for each user. - Configuration Storage &#150; allowing for the separated/private storage of user information. - Scenario Dispatch &#150; providing the bridge between web applications and the underlying communication method for executors. Analysis of a range of typical applications shows that using these components, applications that monitor different physical or electronic data sources and produce outputs in many varied forms using a variety of communications technologies can be easily developed. In parallel to the software development, hardware output devices are explored. SunSPOT wireless sensor devices and lost-cost USB connected devices are both investigated, each providing quite different experiences and usage possibilities, and allowing several demonstration applications to be fully implemented and tested. The results of this work confirm that it is possible to share components between ambient displays, and to characterise many different displays in terms of a set of common functional components. Display authors need not build the entire infrastructure for new displays, lowering the cost barrier for the design of new displays, and the introduction of new data sources into an ambient information environment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158351</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Economic Examination of Australian Private Psychiatric Services under Medicare: Conceptual and Empirical Studies</field><field name="creator">Williams, Ruth F.G.</field><field name="description">The objective of this thesis is to present the results of several conceptual and empirical analyses of the services of private psychiatrists that are provided in Australia on a fee-for-service (FFS) basis. The contributions to knowledge provided by this study are outlined here. Part I of the thesis contains three chapters that contribute separate overviews of some dimensions of private psychiatry, which previously have not been available in the literature. The economic characteristics of FFS psychiatry as an industry are discussed in Chapter One, which also broadly discusses the importance of Medicare in the operation of private psychiatry. Although it has been established medically in the literature that mental illnesses are an important disease category, economists have neglected psychiatry, along with other industries in the mental health sector. The only comprehensive review of the economic literature on Australian mental health issues is provided in Chapter Two, which demonstrates also that numerous lacunae exist. In Chapter Three, the context of this study is given. An innovative conceptual and empirical overview of the mental health sector in Australia is given and various measures of the size and composition of FFS psychiatric services are provided. Part II is entitled &#147;Further Conceptual Analyses&#148;, the content of which encompasses four new studies. A positive economic analysis of Australia&#146;s system of health care fi nancing of FFS psychiatric services is provided in Chapter Four. Such an analysis has not been undertaken previously for this industry. The Chapter demonstrates the important economic relationships between the gross prices received by FFS psychiatrists, the net (&#147;out-of-pocket&#148;) prices that consumers pay and the Medicare rebate, or subsidy. In Chapter Five, there is a conceptual examination of &#147;need&#148;, which is an asserted basis for the establishment of the Medicare system of funding. This study demonstrates that conventional economic measures of a necessity, such as the income elasticity of demand, are insuffi cient for determining medical need and provides new bases for conceptualising and measuring medical needs. Attention turns in Chapters Six and Seven to another rationale underlying the Medicare funding of private psychiatric services, viz. equality. The importance placed in the economic literature on income inequality measurement is demonstrated in Chapter Six, and this is contrasted with the lack of attention by economists to inequality measurement in the health sector. Some illustrative data are then used in Chapter Seven to demonstrate, in a innovative way, the relevant economic concepts and tools required for measuring inequalities related to the mental health sector. The &#147;Further Empirical Analyses&#148; of Part III involve a further four new empirical studies. In Chapters Eight and Nine statistical results are provided about the quantity and price outcomes, respectively, of private FFS psychiatry under Medicare. These results are based on quarterly time-series data for six Australian regions. Broadly speaking, these Chapters provide some initial information about a popular word used in respect of Medicare funding, viz. &#147;access&#148;. The empirical focus turns once again in Chapters Ten and Eleven to distribution. Two major distributional outcomes of this industry are measured in these Chapters, with the inequality measurements of quantities of services and mental health status that are provided, respectively. In Chapter Ten, conventional measures of statistical dispersion and inequality (such as coeffi cients of variation, Gini coeffi cients, Atkinson measures and Lorenz curves) are applied to the quarterly time-series data on quantities of services. The trends on equality of spatial access to psychiatric services since the introduction of Medicare in 1984 are demonstrated. The focus of Chapter Eleven is on mental health per se and its distribution. This focus is appropriate as the ultimate objective of psychiatric services is mental health. In this Chapter is the fi rst economic measure of mental health status, and this is undertaken for the State of Queensland. This measure is based of the period of time lived prior to the onset of serious mental illness. The study demonstrates whether mental health status has increased, decreased or remained constant through time and, by constructing time trends on various inequality measures, including Gini coeffi cients, determines statistically whether inequality in mental health status has increased, decreased or remained constant since 1964. In Chapter Twelve the dissertation is summarised and the main conclusions are presented. The above outline indicates the types of information about the Australian market for psychiatric services that are contributed by this thesis. The contributions are particularly relevant at a time when economic understanding of the industry is like a &#147;black hole&#148;. Tools and concepts from both Industrial Economics and Public Finance are applied in this study, because the market outcomes of private psychiatric services in Australia, in terms of such variables as prices and quantities, involve the interaction of market and government forces. The role of government is heavily woven into the operations of private FFS psychiatry in Australia, and occurs not only via the control of entry into psychiatry, but also through Commonwealth Government fi nancing of the industry via Medicare. This thesis demonstrates that the institutional forces of Commonwealth Government funding are of fundamental economic relevance to the operation of private psychiatry. However, this is an atypical industry study. Absent are conventional issues in Industrial Economics, such as market structure, collusion, strategic behaviour, mergers and joint ventures, innovation and so forth. Present are contributions to knowledge about the size of the industry, the public-private split in funding private psychiatry, &#147;need&#148; and &#147;access&#148;, the quantities of private psychiatric services, and their gross prices, various inequality measures of private psychiatric service provision and, fi nally, an economic measure of mental health and of mental health inequality.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158664</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motivation In an Indonesian EFL Context: Individual Attributes, Social Cultural Background, and Teachers&#146; Behaviours</field><field name="creator">Liando, Nihta Vera</field><field name="description">The four aims of this research were: 1) to investigate the similarities and / or differences in motivational factors that influence high school and university students&#146; performance when studying English as a foreign language (EFL) in an Indonesian context; 2) to explore the socio-cultural factors which influence students as they learn English as a foreign language; 3) to examine the relationships between teachers&#146; behaviours and students&#146; academic performance, and 4) to expand the contextual framework for understanding motivation in foreign language learning to include Indonesia. Based on the literature review, a contextual framework for research into motivation and language learning was proposed that suggested that three key areas influenced the success of second or foreign language learning &#150; individual attributes, social cultural background and teachers&#146; behaviours. A pilot study based on interviews with teachers and students, was used to test whether the framework was applicable in the Indonesian context. The findings of this pilot study supported the validity of the three key areas proposed in the framework as the basis for a broader scale study. The participants in this study were 126 first year students and 28 lecturers in an English department at a state university, as well as 149 third year students and 21 English teachers in a government and a private high school. Questionnaires, classroom observations and interviews were employed to collect data in this study. Questionnaires with ten scales were used in this study: Integrative Orientation, Instrumental Orientation, Motivational Intensity, Attitudes toward Learning English, Social Orientation, Parental Encouragement, Family Influence, Outstanding Teachers&#146; Characteristics, Nonverbal Teacher Immediacy Behaviours, and Verbal Teacher Immediacy Behaviours. Classroom observation and selective interviews were also employed. A range of statistical and qualitative analysis techniques were applied to analyse the data. The results of the study indicate that despite differences in motivational factors among three groups (university and two high schools), the groups shared the same predictive variable for student academic performance &#150; teachers&#146; behaviours, although attitudes toward learning English was also found to be important for the two high schools. The different educational contexts also produced variation in motivation. The results showed that high school students were more integrative and instrumental than university students who had a stronger intensity of motivation and more positive attitudes toward learning English. The results of discriminant function analysis indicated that the best variables for distinguishing between the high schools and the university group were attitudes toward learning English and integrative motivation, while the motivational factors for differentiation between the two high school groups were instrumental motivation and teachers&#146; verbal immediacy behaviours. The implications for future research included: broadening the research to other contexts, the need to examine other levels of school context, the need to study the relationships between motivation and other constructs such as other individual differences, and the requirement to more fully understand students&#146; learning strategies and related teaching approaches to better model the complexity of the EFL learning process. Finally the study has revealed the importance of developing an understanding of the role of local context, as in foreign language learning culture plays an important role in learner success.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158456</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DISTANCE RANKING IN CONSTRAINT-BASED SPACES: AN ELEMENTAL PROBLEM IN SPATIAL QUERY PROCESSING</field><field name="creator">Deng, Ke</field><field name="description">Along with the proliferation of applications such as in geographical information systems (GIS), Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing systems (CAD/CAM), there has been a growing need in efficiency of managing and processing large-scale spatial data. This insight provides the stimulus for a series of studies on spatial database management systems. A primary query task over spatial data is to retrieve objects according to their relative positions in space. One of the basic spatial relationships is the measurement of distance between objects, and distance ranking is one of the most frequently encountered problems in a wide range of spatial queries, such as nearest neighbor queries, spatial range queries and spatial join queries. According to the distance function, the space can be constraint-free or constraint-based. If Euclidean distance is used, it is solely determined by the locations of objects such that the spatial query is said to work in a constraint-free space. However, in practice, objects typically exist and move on pre-defined environments (i.e., a road network or a terrain surface) where usually the shortest travelling distances makes sense. In this context, the spatial query is said to work in a constraint-based space. To date, there has been limited exposure to this type of spatial query in literature. As the first in-depth study, this thesis investigates the problem of efficient distance ranking in constraint-based spaces where the distances are computed on-the-fly. This problem is one of the main challenges in efficient spatial query processing due to costly distance calculation. Typically, the distance between objects in constraint-based spaces is calculated by using a costly shortest path algorithm, and the environment data used by the algorithm is much larger and much more complex comparing to the object data. The strategy of our proposed methodology stands on the ground that if current distance estimation is accurate enough for distance comparison, then the distance ranking is done. To be able to do that, distances need to be estimated using faster algorithms and the accuracy of the estimation can be monotonically improved as more environment data are used. This can lead to more efficient methods for query processing by accessing environment data in a level as low as necessary and using faster algorithms to minimize the cost of distance measurement. For distance ranking with this strategy, this thesis proposes the Multi-resolution Surface Distance Model on terrain surfaces and the Lower Network Distance Bound Distance Ranking method in spatial networks. The Multi-resolution Surface Distance Model utilizes Multi-resolution terrain data structures where the distance estimation can be improved when higher resolution environment data is used, while the Lower Network Distance Bound Distance Ranking method explores the intermediate results of the network shortest distance algorithm (A*) where the distance estimation can be improved when more network region is searched. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed distance ranking methods, two important types of queries are studied in this thesis: the terrain-based k nearest neighbor queries and the network-based multi-source skyline queries. Both of them are widely used in many real life applications, such as spatial decision making systems, spatial data mining and environment protection applications. They are typical queries whose processing is fundamentally based on ranking distances. Through comprehensive performance analysis and extensive experiments on real datasets, we have shown the superiority of the proposed processing algorithms, which utilize our distance ranking methods. Moreover, this study provides much experience which is helpful for processing other spatial query types in relevant constraint-based spaces.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158665</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The construction of students&#146; identities in teacher-parent interviews</field><field name="creator">Badger, Lynne May</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the construction of children&#146;s identities in teacher-parent interviews that were held in two metropolitan primary schools in Adelaide, South Australia. The analysis was conducted using Ethnomethodology, Conversation Analysis and Membership Category Analysis. These analytic approaches were selected because they are ideally suited to the task of revealing how identities are oriented to, and made relevant, through the interpretive and common-sense reasoning practices of the participants as they interactively assemble their social worlds. The data consists of teacher-parent interviews which are naturally occurring educational events carried out as part of schools&#146; obligations to report to parents on children&#146;s achievements. The fact that some children were present in the interviews and that some of these children also became participants in the interviews, meant that the analysis could focus not only on how the adults constructed children&#146;s identities but also on how the children were able to participate in identity work for themselves. By virtue of their participation these children are constructed as having the interactional competencies to take a role in the talk and to shape their identities. Central to the analysis presented in this thesis is the position that children&#146;s identities are interactively achieved by the participants and that they are a resource that participants use to accomplish their purposes and needs in the local setting of the teacher-parent interviews. The situational relevance of the identities constructed for children by the adults or by the children themselves is evident in how they are used to accomplish interactional activities such as making a complaint, criticising, giving advice, explaining children&#146;s successes or problems, and resisting stigmatised educational identities and the social and material consequences that may ensue from them. Another significant part of the work that the children&#146;s identities are used for in the interviews is the construction of a moral version of the ideal student which is referenced by predicates such as children&#146;s attitudes to school, their relationships with their peers, their work practices, their academic achievement and their personal traits. The thesis findings demonstrate the interactional complexity of teacher-parent interviews which are not simply sites for reporting on children&#145;s achievements but are also sites for the in situ production of the institutional identities of &#145;teacher&#146; and &#145;student&#146; in actual instances of teaching, learning and assessment. That is, children&#146;s identities can be constructed not only through talk about children&#146;s performance on schoolwork but also through &#145;doing school&#146; in the teacher-parent interviews. This thesis shows that educational activities such as teacher-parent interviews are not a neutral part of the reporting framework in schools. The thesis shows how teacherparent interviews can be analysed to reveal important insights into how children&#146;s identities are constructed, how they are consequential for the immediate work that is accomplished in the interviews and for what they may portend for children&#146;s trajectory through school.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158457</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Methods of Understanding and Designing For Mobile Communities</field><field name="creator">Axup, Jeffrey Charles</field><field name="description">Society is increasingly on the move, mobile devices are commonly being used to coordinate group actions, and group communication features are rapidly being added to existing technologies. Despite this, little is known about how mobile groups act, or how communications technologies should be designed to augment existing behaviour. This is partially due to minimal research being done on the topic, but also to the lack of research methods available to study the topic with. Mobile groups are challenging to study because of frequent and long-duration movement, frequent distribution, and the rapidly changing environments they operate within. To address these issues, this research focuses on methodological issues surrounding the development of mobile devices for mobile groups and communities. More specifically it addresses backpackers, who are a relevant example of this type of community. The research primarily explores the convergence of computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) and the field of mobile device development. This enables the combination of emphasis on designing technologies for groups, social implications, mobile device design, and mobile settings. Major research outcomes presented in this thesis lie in three areas: 1) methods, 2) technology designs, and 3) backpacker culture. Five studies of backpacker behaviour and requirements form the core of the research. The methods used are in-situ and exploratory, and apply both novel and existing techniques to the domain of backpackers and mobile groups. Methods demonstrated in this research include: field trips for exploring mobile group behaviour and device usage, a social pairing exercise to explore social networks, contextual postcards to gain distributed feedback, and blog analysis which provides post-hoc diary data. Theoretical contributions include: observations on method triangulation, a taxonomy of mobility research, method templates to assist method usage, and identification of key categories leading to mobile group requirements. Design related outcomes include: 57 mobile tourism product ideas, a format for conveying product concepts, and a design for a wearable device to assist mobile researchers. Our understanding of backpacker culture has also improved as a consequence of the research. It has also generated user requirements to aid mobile development, methods of visualising mobile groups and communities, and a listing of relevant design tensions. Additionally, the research has added to our understanding of how new technologies such as blogs, SMS and iPods are being used by backpackers and how mobile groups naturally communicate.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280302 Software Engineering</field><field name="subject">mobile communities</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158352</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SUMMARIZATION-BASED SIMILARITY SEARCH FOR COMPLEX DATABASES</field><field name="creator">Huang, Zi</field><field name="description">Similarity search over complex databases which are characterized by high dimensionality and large scale is a common problem fundamental to a wide range of applications, such as multimedia retrieval, molecular biology, digital libraries, medical imaging, video surveillance, and so on. As the volume of complex data keeps increasing rapidlv, traditional relational and spatial databases are insufficient to provide support for effective complex database management and efficient similarity search. This thesis aims at investigating solutions to efficient similarity search of such complex data. In particular, our approaches are motivated by two representative types of complex data, i.e., video sequence data and 3D protein structure data, which often describe a data object as a set of multi-dimensional points but differ from each other in their requirements on the similarity measurements. On the other hand, our approaches are generic and can be generalized to other applications where data objects are represented as sets of high-dimensional points. This thesis addresses two essential research issues in managing complex databases: (I) effective data summarization to summarize a complex object from a set of multidimensional points to compact representations which preserve the most discriminative features and reduce the time complexity of similarity computation significantly; (2)efficient indexing and query processing strategies to perform fast similarity search on the compact representations. To address different requirements on similaritv measurements for different applications, a number of effective data summarization models have been designed in this thesis to consider the similarity of two objects from the global to more specific features. Each summarization model is accommodated with corresponding indexing and query processing mechanisms. The proposed approaches have been evaluated extensivelv with real-life large scale video sequence data and 3D protein structure data. Experimental results have demonstrated that our techniques produce remarkable improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency over a number of wellknown existing approaches.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158666</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Martha from the Margins: An examination of early Christian traditions about Martha</field><field name="creator">Ernst, Allie Almuth Maria</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates Martha in the New Testament and early Christian tradition. It is situated primarily in the areas of feminist biblical studies and in women&#146;s studies in early Christianity. Both biblical and non-biblical references to Martha are gathered and analysed using literary and rhetorical methods. The interest of the thesis is not in any historical Martha that might have given rise to the traditions, but in the way in which the figure of Martha appears in the texts and in the rhetorical purposes which she serves. The thesis includes not only literary texts but also images and it considers not only narrative texts but also patristic interpretations of the biblical texts and liturgical texts such as hymns. Beginning with an analysis of Martha in the Gospel of John, the thesis argues that Martha appears as the carrier of Johannine theology and the figure that expresses Johannine faith most completely. A survey of patristic commentary on the text demonstrates that she is interpreted both as faithful witness (a &#145;second Peter&#146;) and as faithless, to the point of being depicted as an Arian heretic, while early Christian iconography focuses on her role as intercessor for her brother. Next the thesis examines a number of texts which name Martha as one of the women who went to the tomb of Jesus. Included here are the Epistula Apostolorum, the Commentary on the Song of Songs of Hippolytus, an early Christian hymn, the Ambrosian Missal, the Syrian Catholic Fenqitho and numerous images. In all of these texts and images Martha replaces, rather than being added to, the women known from the canonical texts. The analysis suggests that this tradition of Martha as myrrhophore and apostle is as ancient as the canonical Gospels, widespread and persistent. It also demonstrates that Martha is not simply an adjunct to Mary in these texts, for she typically takes the leading role. There is some evidence to suggest that the tradition of Martha as myrrhophore might have been known to the author of the Gospel of John and that this tradition had its Sitz im Leben in the liturgical celebrations of Easter, including the Easter celebrations in Jerusalem. The thesis then turns to a number of texts that link Martha with &#145;serving&#146; (diakonein), Luke 10:38-42, John 12:1-3, the Apostolic Church Order and the Acts of Philip. It is argued that Martha&#146;s &#145;serving&#146; could be interpreted Eucharistically and that this connection was at times used polemically in the struggle over women&#146;s authority and participation at the Eucharist. Finally the thesis examines a number of texts in which Martha appears in lists of Jesus&#146; women disciples. These include Origen&#146;s Contra Celsus, Pistis Sophia, the Manichean Psalmbook, the First Apocalypse of James, the Ethiopic Didascalia Apostolorum, the Apostolic Constitutions, the Testamentum Domini and the Acts of Pilate (Gospel of Nicodemus). The thesis contends that Martha served as an apostolic authority for some groups. She is depicted as a key female disciple and mediator of divine knowledge in some texts. In some cases she is used to undermine women&#146;s authority, while other texts cite her to support the authority of women. The analysis of early Christian texts and images offered here reveals that Martha held a more significant place in early Christian tradition than has been recognised heretofore. It also illustrates the value of attending to liturgy and iconography for the study of women in early Christianity as important non-literary avenues into the tradition. The way in which some Martha stories are used in early Christian rhetoric about women&#146;s authority and leadership in the church offers an important point of comparison for scholarship carried out on the figure of Mary Magdalene in relation to women&#146;s authority. In shifting Martha &#147;from the margins&#148; to the centre of the investigation and gathering as broad a range of texts and images as possible the thesis sheds new light and offers a richer context for interpreting Martha within early Christian tradition.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158458</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#147;FRUITLESS AND FRIENDLESS&#148;: AUSTRALIA AND THE WEST NEW GUINEA DISPUTE, 1949-1962</field><field name="creator">Maskey, Jan Elizabeth</field><field name="description">In 1949 Australia witnessed the birth of a new nation, Indonesia, on its doorstep. While the Chifley Government had been generously described by the Indonesians as the &#145;midwife&#146; of their new Republic, the conservative Menzies Government that came to power at the end of 1949 seemed far less comfortable with its newly independent Asian neighbour. Relations between the two nations rested on an uncertain footing, and the focus of their differences over the next thirteen years centred on the issue of who was to have sovereignty over the territory of West New Guinea: Canberra favoured Dutch retention of control over the western half of New Guinea, whereas Jakarta was adamant that sovereignty over this territory was part of its &#145;birthright&#146;. This thesis will analyse the formulation of Australian foreign policy during the course of the West New Guinea dispute, and the attempts by the Menzies Government to achieve support for its objective of retaining West New Guinea in Dutch hands from its major ally, the United States. The central contention of this thesis is that Australia ultimately failed to achieve these goals because its policies were plagued by conflicting objectives, inconsistencies, and a mentality of dependence with respect to the United States. What lay at the heart of these policies was a fundamental contradiction, a nation torn between traditional fears of Asia, forged in the national psyche over the previous century, and the desire to develop friendly relations with its northern neighbours. This dissertation reveals a nation struggling to find its place in the world, and trying to define a role for itself in the Asia-Pacific region. Initially the Australian Government was adamant that retaining West New Guinea in friendly Dutch hands was vital to Australia's national security and that, as such, Australia had a right to be considered a "party principal" in the dispute. However, it also believed in the need for Australia to develop friendly relations with Indonesia, and for the remainder of the decade the Menzies Government would struggle to achieve these conflicting objectives, and at the same time gain Washington's support for its policies. Any chance of success was made doubly difficult because throughout the course of the 1950s the United States became increasingly convinced that Indonesia would fall under Communist control if its demands for sovereignty over West New Guinea were not met. There also emerged a basic inconsistency between the Australian Government's belief in the strategic importance of West New Guinea and what it was prepared to do to protect these interests. Such complacency was a clear result of the Menzies Government's mentality of dependence towards the United States, its inherent belief that ultimately the United States would back Australia's position in the dispute. Eventually, in January 1959 Cabinet made a secret decision that it no longer considered Dutch retention of West New Guinea to be more important than cultivating friendship with Indonesia, and that therefore it was not prepared to support the Dutch militarily if West New Guinea came under Indonesian attack. However, it would be another three years of vacillation before the Menzies Government was prepared to embrace the consequences of its 1959 decision and accept that West New Guinea would inevitably become Indonesian territory.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158459</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Equality of opportunity for all?: An assessment of the effectiveness of the Anti-discrimination Act 1991 (Qld) as a tool for the delivery of equality of opportunity in education to people with impairments</field><field name="creator">Dickson, Elizabeth Anne</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1301 Education Systems</field><field name="subject">330104 Educational Policy, Administration and Management</field><field name="subject">Queensland.

In Queensland, regional ecosystem mapping, and the broader bioregional hierarchy, are used for landscape-level planning, underpinned by site-based data. &#145;Regional ecosystems&#146; and site-based floristic datasets are closely allied, with changes to one necessitating changes to the other. Therefore, neither can be viewed in isolation. This research assesses their utility as surrogates for biodiversity patterns. The ecologically diverse Southeast Queensland (SEQ) Bioregion is the focus of this research. The temporal trends and effectiveness of these two datasets in portraying biodiversity patterns were the first component examined. Regional ecosystem mapping showed a decrease in the number of heterogeneous polygons (i.e. a polygon with multiple ecosystems assigned) across successive versions. Polygon heterogeneity levels were positively correlated with lower polygon accuracy, and strongly related to particular regional ecosystem and geomorphology types. Retrospective analysis of the Queensland Herbarium&#146;s site-based floristic dataset, &#145;CORVEG&#146;, showed improved data quality and completeness in the past decade as a consequence of more explicit sampling protocols, although missing information continues to limit data utility. Analysis of species richness variation and dissimilarity differences within and between units of the bioregional hierarchy form the core of this dissertation. These revealed that ecosystem types are differentially represented by the mapped patterns. Analysis suggested that up to onethird of ecosystems may not be represented by existing regional ecosystem mapping. Species richness exhibited significant differences in total species richness, and of plant life forms between units at each of the subregion, land zone and regional ecosystem levels. Comparisons of species compositional dissimilarity between units revealed that dissimilarity levels and variation increased from broader-scale subregions, intermediate-scale land zones, to finerscale regional ecosystems. Within plant life forms, trees were consistently differentiated by hierarchical units; shrubs and herbs to a lesser extent; vines were moderately represented; and epiphytes poorly represented. Analysis showed that a minimum of three regional sites per regional ecosystem unit were required to gain a robust estimate of species compositional dissimilarity, which rose to ten or more sites for land zone units and 15 or more for subregion units. These results show opportunities to use species compositional dissimilarity to guide future &#145;lumping&#146; or &#145;splitting&#146; decisions of units, and the basis of a framework for representative site-based data sampling. Case studies were used to explore the application of regional ecosystem mapping in varied circumstances. The first case study came from Toohey Forest in southern SEQ, an area which was mapped as a single regional ecosystem type at 1:100 000 scale despite its recognised biotic and abiotic diversity. Fine-scale mapping approaches were explored to assess the representation of floristic patterns, indicating that ongoing reduction in regional ecosystem mapping scale, and incorporation of fine-scale geomorphic mapping were vital to improve the floristic representation. The second case study examined SEQ sand islands where high levels of map unit homogeneity relative to adjacent mainland areas were observed. Mapping was shown to effectively portray ecological patterns and with homogeneity apparent across various map scales and map authors of each island, suggesting that high polygon homogeneity were ecological, rather than cartographic, phenomena. Queensland&#146;s regional ecosystem mapping program shows continued improvement in the representation of biodiversity patterns, with some areas more effectively portrayed than others. The use of heterogeneous polygons to identify ecosystems otherwise unrecognisable at particular map scales is simultaneously a major advantage and disadvantage to representing biodiversity patterns. Opportunities are available to focus limited resources on particular geomorphic and regional ecosystem types, and for alternate methods of representing geographically restricted ecosystems. This research has identified several changes that could be implemented to improve these systems and their portrayal of ecosystem patterns. The current and future applications of site-based data remains a most pressing issue, not only in refining the bioregional framework but also to address a suite of other issues, including crosstaxon congruence, condition assessment, temporal change and informing natural resource management. This necessitates a review of data collection and systems to identify data needs, users and costs, and options to achieve this in a cost-effective manner, while serving multiple biodiversity objectives. The research also proposes distinct separation of 1:100 000 scale regional ecosystem mapping for broad-scale land planning purposes from finer-scale mapping targeted at local-level planning and management to achieve greater consistency and transparency.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158461</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The perceptions and motivations of visitors attending special events in galleries</field><field name="creator">Axelsen, Megan</field><field name="description">Art galleries have traditionally been seen as entertainment venues aimed at the elite. In an attempt to alter this perception, galleries are shifting their focus to become more responsive to visitor needs. Contemporary policies explicitly pursue more equal access and participation, and new strategies are being developed to make galleries more appealing to people who would not usually visit them. One such visitor-focused strategy that is increasingly being utilised is the staging of special events. Special events enable galleries to inspire and attract new visitors, as well as respond to changing visitor needs and expectations. With the increased use of special events however, it is important that galleries develop an awareness of how their visitors understand and respond to such events. To explore this issue, this study investigates visitors&#146; perceptions of special events in galleries and their motivations to attend such events. A qualitative approach is taken to facilitate the ability to illustrate, in visitors&#146; own words, the contemporary perceptions of, and motivations for attending special events at galleries. Intensive interviews and focus group interviews were conducted with visitors attending two different special events at two different galleries: The Nature Machine Summer Children&#146;s Festival, a week long festival at the Queensland Art Gallery; and International Women&#146;s Day at the National Gallery, an afternoon of fundraising lectures at the National Gallery of Australia. From the interviews, a set of categories were developed that represent the main motivations visitors have for attending special events at galleries. A set of categories were also developed to represent the perceptions visitors have of what defines a special event at a gallery, and how special events differ from a gallery&#146;s day-to-day program. These findings are important because they can help galleries more fully understand both their visitors and their programs. This therefore enables the development of more relevant events, programs, marketing campaigns and audience-development strategies. By exploring visitor perceptions, this study augments the understanding of how the special events at galleries are changing people&#146;s perceptions of galleries. The research into motivation is subsequently essential for understanding the attributes of special events that are important to stimulating visitation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158669</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Approach to Poverty in Developing Countries: A Case Study of the Philippines</field><field name="creator">Takishita, Yoshinobu</field><field name="description">This dissertation offers a contribution to the improvement of poverty research and propoor strategies in developing countries. My argument is that the narrow focus of conventional poverty research has led to ineffective pro-poor strategies and resulted in the slow progress of poverty reduction. This narrow focus can be seen in the approaches of defining poverty, the selection of poverty measures and aggregation methods, and analysis of only quantitative data. Poverty reduction programmes based on the results of such research often miss the target group, or area, and lead to leakage of allocated resources. More importantly, conventional research lacks deeper analysis of systemic constraints which institutionalise poverty and undermine any effort toward poverty reduction. In the first part of the research, I address key issues related to poverty research and propoor strategies: the development of a conceptual framework; identification of factors related to poverty; basic approaches to planning anti-poverty strategies; and methodology of data collection and analysis. Most conventional poverty research takes either an absolute or relative approach to define and measure poverty, and relies on monetarybased poverty measures and single aggregation techniques such as head count measures. While assessing the weakness of the conventional approach, I seek to develop an appropriate approach to conduct poverty research. In analysing a number of causal factors, I have classified them into four levels - macro, domestic, trans-national and external. These factors are often interrelated and create a poverty cycle. In planning effective propoor strategies, it is essential to understand economic, political and socio-cultural contexts. The narrow focus of development strategies emphasising economic growth ignores the mechanism of institutionalising poverty and growth often does not lead to reduction of poverty but to an increase in income inequality. Thus, the process of poverty research and planning pro-poor strategies requires extensive collection of data both primary and secondary, quantitative and qualitative, with different levels of micro, domestic, trans-national and external data. The conceptual overview developed in the first section is used as a tool for a detailed analysis of poverty in the Philippines. My research in the case study includes: assessment of the development process in terms of economic, political and social development; analysis of public policies related to poverty; quantitative analysis of poverty profiles and causal factors; and qualitative data collection and analysis. Although the Philippine government has developed poverty research since the 1980s and the results have been incorporated into a number of government policies, many official programmes suffer from ineffectiveness. This is partly due to the weakness of poverty research which relies only on quantitative data. Through the combined analysis of quantitative and qualitative, macro and micro level data, I have also identified causal factors which form systemic constraints to institutionalise poverty in the Philippines. This case study provides a number of findings which could be applicable to poverty reduction in other developing countries.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158462</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative ecophysiology of Graptophyllum species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Le, Buu Thach</field><field name="description">Ecophysiological attributes could be causes for rarity in plants. We tested the hypothesis that a species&#146; ability to regulate photosynthesis and growth in response to environmental factors is indicative of its environmental resilience and that this is linked to its conservation status. In this study, the ecophysiology of Graptophyllum reticulatum, an Australian endangered endemic species, was compared with that of its three closely related and more common congeners G. ilicifolium, G. excelsum and G. spinigerum. Ecophysiological attributes were measured on the four species in their natural habitats and under artificially imposed environmental stresses, including changed soil conditions, excess light and low water availability, in a glasshouse experiment. Photosynthesis was determined at the photosystem II and leaf level using chlorophyll a fluorescence and gas exchange techniques. Applied to the chlorophyll fluorescence transient of leaves, the JIP test provides a Performance Index which quantifies the main steps in PSII photochemistry including light energy absorption, excitation energy trapping, and conversion of excitation energy into electron flow. At the leaf level, gas exchange measurements allow determination of maximum CO2 assimilation rates, intercellular CO2 concentrations, stomatal conductance for water vapour and instantaneous water use efficiency. Growth analysis was performed to assess relative growth rates and physiological and morphological responses. Analysis of physiological differences and responses indicated that, compared to its more common relatives, the endangered G. reticulatum was an intrinsically slow growing species, exhibited the lowest fitness when growing in favorable environments and was most sensitive to excess light stress. Photoinhibition is therefore likely to restrict the endangered species to shade habitats. Compared with the endangered G. reticulatum, the vulnerable G. ilicifolium and common G. spinigerum species were better adapted to high light and changed nutrient levels, but were more susceptible to water stress. The rare G. excelsum had the fastest growth rate and the highest fitness in favorable environments. Based on the ecophysiological attributes examined here, it is proposed that excess light is likely to be the most critical abiotic factor restricting distribution of the endangered species in a fragmented landscape. The survival of the species may be most dependent on the intactness of the habitat over-storey. In contrast, the vulnerable G. ilicifolium showed strong susceptibility to water limitation, and survival might be threatened if climate change alters habitat water relations to cause, for example, more pronounced dry periods. The rare G. excelsum which had highest carbon gain and growth in the experiments carried out in this study, may become the most successful adaptation out of the rainforest environment due to its tolerance to higher light and limited water availability. To examine the generality of the link between rarity and ecophysiology with Graptophyllum species, two dipterocarp species, narrowly endemic Dipterocarpus condorensis and local common Shorea roxburghii that are actually co-located in South-eastern Vietnam were studied. Findings in this case study confirmed the usefulness of the comparative approach based on physiological measurements, either in situ or ex situ, to explain plant rarity. The results of this study indicate ecophysiological research is a tool for examining causes of rarity and possible abiotic threats. The information gained allows assessment of environmental resilience of species and contributes essential knowledge for management and conservation of threatened plants. Such knowledge is also useful for ex situ conservation including propagation, translocation and re-introduction in restoration programs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270400 Botany</field><field name="subject">270402 Plant Physiology</field><field name="subject">ecophysiology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158670</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Certain India : An enquiry into a claim to national territory</field><field name="creator">Grant, William John</field><field name="description">In both intimate and abstract encounters, India is today understood as a land certain, and a land connected naturally with the Indian nation. India is, for many, a land visible in the physical world, a land visible on the world map, and a land the exclusive political domain of a definable group of people. This was not always the case. This thesis enquires into the circumstances and campaign that have made it so; this thesis enquires into the claim to national territory in India. Specifically, I seek in this work to explain how the land between the Himalayas and the Indian Ocean has been produced as the national territory of the Indian nation, and how this national territory is understood by these nationalists. To conduct this enquiry, I take in this work two broad steps: the construction of a framework within which we can theoretically situate the Indian national territory, and the application of this framework to the specifics of the case at hand. To construct the required theoretical framework, I turn first away from the Indian national territory to the more abstract phenomenon of the national territory in general, and to theoretical literature against which this more abstract national territory in general can be situated. In this, I turn to both theoretical works on nations and nationalism, and theoretical works on space. Here I suggest that we can theoretically situate the abstract national territory in general against both our understanding of the essence of the nation and our understanding of the essence of space; that the national territory is both one element of that which is of the nation, and one particular form of space. Located in this way, I argue in this work that the national territory is a form of space emergent in the intersection of the highly abstract, disembodied forms of knowledge of the physical dominant with the onset of modernity, and knowledge of the physical derived from forms of integration more intimate, particular and local. I argue, more precisely, that the national territory is a form of space produced through both the emergence to dominance of highly abstract forms of knowledge of the physical, and the renegotiation of these dominant forms according to interests and understandings more intimate and particular. From this point, I then proceed to locate and describe the specifics of the production and understanding of the Indian national territory. To do this, I draw on the theoretical framework constructed in the first part of the thesis to trace the emergence to dominance in southern Asia of highly abstract, disembodied forms of knowledge of the physical, and, following this, the response to this derived from the more intimate forms of knowledge of the physical marginalised by this emergence. Thus in this second step I chart first the emergence to dominance of highly abstract forms of knowledge of the physical in southern Asia. In this I look in particular at the forms of social integration and knowledge of the physical that emerged to dominance under the British Empire. Following this, I then trace the response to this emergence to dominance offered by two significant political perspectives: one of &#145;secular Indian nationalism&#146;, the other of &#145;Hindu nationalism&#146;. With this, I argue that the Indian national territory is a space which has been produced through the emergence to dominance in southern Asia of highly abstract, disembodied forms of knowledge of the physical, and the complicated and ongoing efforts to renegotiate this highly abstract knowledge according to interests and understandings more intimate and particular. The Indian national territory is understood, thanks to this production, as a land natural and concrete, eternal and certain, in both embodied locales and the world at large; a land, that is, for which people have willingly died.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158463</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FINITE ELEMENT INSTABILITY ANALYSIS OF COMPOSITE BEAMS WITH PARTIAL SHEAR INTERACTION</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Kinh Luan</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a theoretical study on restricted distortional buckling of composite steel/concrete composite beams including the effects of partial shear interaction. In-plane and out-of-plane finite element formulations have been developed to investigate the buckling behaviour of steel joist of composite beams in negative or hogging regions. The variation of flexural rigidity along the length of composite beams is considered due to concrete cracking in tension. The results are important, as contemporary design techniques tend to be on the unconservative side neglecting partial shear interaction between the concrete slab and the steel joist. The theoretical investigation starts with developing a governing differential equation that governs the in-plane behaviour of composite beams with partial shear interaction. Its application is for simply-supported and fixed-ended composite beams with a uniform second moment of area along the length. A finite element formulation which accounts for the difference of beam&#146;s flexural rigidities in hogging and sagging regions is then developed to analyze the composite beams subjected to general loading and end support conditions. The in-plane stress resultants of steel joist are then used as the input data for the out-of-plane finite element model to investigate the out-of-plane buckling behaviour of composite beams. These versatile finite element models are capable of accommodating different types of boundary and loading conditions such as fixed-ended and continuous composite beams. The findings conclude that the critical buckling load of composite beams is larger at the lower degrees of interaction. They can therefore be used to develop more economical and efficient designs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158671</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">METABOLIC CHARACTERISATION OF A HIGHLY ENRICHED CULTURE OF CANDIDATUS ACCUMULIBACTER PHOSPHATIS UNDER VARIOUS CONDITIONS</field><field name="creator">Lu, Huabing</field><field name="description">Phosphorus (P) is one of the primary nutrients that stimulates the growth of toxic cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), and must be removed from wastewater to prevent eutrophication in aquatic systems. Enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) is an activated sludge process that is widely accepted as an economical and environmentally friendly approach of P removal when it performs well. The group of bacteria responsible for P removal from wastewater is polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs), whose growth is favored by sequential anaerobic and aerobic conditions. In anaerobic phase, PAOs are able to take up volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and convert them to intracellular carbon polymers. During the following aerobic phase, these polymers are utilized for beneficial growth and phosphorus uptake and storage as polyphosphate (polyP). Phosphorus removal is accomplished through the wastage of excess sludge containing the accumulated P. The understanding of the metabolism of PAOs is beneficial for optimizing the design and operation of EBPR system, but still incomprehensive so far. The aim of this study is to fill the following knowledge gaps concerning the metabolism of PAOs: (i) their endogenous metabolism in the presence/absence of various electron acceptors, (ii) the effect of COD/P ratios on PAO metabolism, (iii) nitrate reduction capability of PAOs. This study used an enriched culture of &#145;Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis&#146; (henceforth referred to Accumulibacter), the most prevalent PAOs in EBPR sludge. Since no pure culture is available, the more highly enriched culture would better represent the typical metabolism of Accumulibacter. For this purpose, a method for obtaining highly enriched Accumulibacter cultures was developed at the beginning of this work. The main contributions from this thesis are described below: A highly enriched culture of Accumulibacter (&gt;85%), quantified by fluorescence in-situ hyrbridisation (FISH), was obtained using a novel strategy of switching carbon sources between acetate and propionate in the feed, which was proposed in this work. The obtained culture was carried out in the rest of this PhD thesis. It would also assist further studies on the physiological and biochemical behavior of Accumulibacter, and the future attempts to the isolation of this organism. As repeatedly shown, this type of carbon source control was able to eliminate glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs), which can deteriorate the EBPR performance. This control method may thus potentially be implemented in full-scale EBPR plants to improve phosphorus removal performance. Under anaerobic and anoxic starvation conditions, the decay rates of Accumulibacter were found to be negligible. This suggests that anaerobic and anoxic decay of PAOs may be ignored in activated sludge modelling. The aerobic decay rate of Accumulibacter was determined to be about 0.03 d-1. With respect to the utilization of storage polymer for maintenance processes, both glycogen and polyphosphate were consumed to gain maintenance energy under anaerobic and anoxic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, maintenance energy was derived from glycogen in the absence of PHA, and likely also from other cellular materials. Alternating aerobic and anaerobic conditions was found to achieve a lower Accumulibacter decay rate compared to aerobic storage, and also result in slower utilization of glycogen and polyphosphate compared to anaerobic and anoxic storage, and is recommended for sludge storage when plant operations are interrupted by for example unavailability of wastewater. Accumulibacter recovered the fastest after intermittent aerobic-anaerobic starvation conditions, followed by anaerobic, anoxic, aerobic conditions. The benefits of intermittent aerobic-anaerobic strategy would be expected more when long starvation period was applied (e.g. biomass storage tank), resulting in a potential value of industrial application. Furthermore, the diversity in their recovery metabolism was observed, varying from different starvation conditions. When acetate was re-supplied, polyhydroxyalknaoates (PHA) could be formed anaerobically, anoxically and aerobically, respectively. Mminimum COD/P ratios for complete P removal were found to be 8.3 gCOD/gP for acetate, 11.4 gCOD/gP for propionate and 9 gCOD/gP for a 3:1 mixture of acetate and propionate (on COD basis). During the aerobic phase, the glycogen pool was decreased with the increase in P loading, but it remained considerably larger than what was required for anaerobic VFA uptake even when P was overloaded. This suggested that Accumulibacter might prefer to maintain a good glycogen storage level rather than generating additional polyP. The utilisation of a 3:1 mixture (COD basis) of acetate and propionate was confirmed to be effective in eliminating GAOs from the EBPR system. This provides a practically feasible operating strategy, which still has a low COD minimal requirement to achieve both effective and efficient biological P removal. Experiments results showed that Accumulibacter was very likely able to use nitrate as electron acceptor. This was contradictory to the recent finding that the known nitrate reductases were not found in two Accumulibacter communities based on their genomic analysis. This raises the prospect of a different nitrate reductase Accumulibacter may have or the existence of significantly different Accumulibacter species (some of them could reduce nitrate). Additionally, it was observed that Accumulibacter took up acetate even after its polyP pool had been largely depleted. This thesis demonstrates some new aspects of Accumulibacter metabolism under starvation, different COD/P ratios and anoxic (nitrate) conditions. The obtained information gives some suggestions on how to improve the reliability and efficiency of EBPR performance, which may be adopted for optimizing full-scale EBPR plants.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158464</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE ROLE OF PHASE VARIABLE TYPE III RESTRICTION-MODIFICATION SYSTEMS IN GENE REGULATION</field><field name="creator">Srikhanta, Yogitha</field><field name="description">Phase variation, the high frequency reversible switching of gene expression, is a common feature of host-adapted bacterial pathogens and is generally associated with genes encoding surface factors. Phase variation results in genetically and phenotypically diverse populations, providing a strategy for rapid adaptation to changes within the host environment and evading immune responses. However, in a growing number of host-adapted pathogens, phase variation has been found to occur in genes encoding methyltransferases (mod genes) associated with type III restrictionmodification (R-M) systems. R-M systems traditionally confer protection against foreign DNA, and several roles have been proposed for phase variable R-M systems based on DNA restriction function. The existence of phase variable methyltransferases raises the possibility of further functions for R-M systems such as gene regulation. In this thesis the role of a phase variable methyltransferase (mod) associated with a type III R-M system of Haemophilus influenzae strain Rd was investigated. Microarray expression analysis comparing a wild-type strain expressing mod to a mod knockout mutant strain, revealed altered expression of 15 genes under Mod control, some of which were virulence associated. This key finding confirmed that this phase variable methyltransferase coordinates the random switching of expression of multiple genes. Phylogenetic studies were used to analyse phase variable mod genes associated with type III R-M systems in the human pathogens Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae revealing that these organisms have two distinct mod genes - modA and modB. There are also distinct alleles of modA and modB that differ only in their DNA recognition domain. Phylogenetic analysis was also used to create an up-to-date list of potentially phase variable type III R-M systems present within other host-adapted organisms. To confirm whether phase variable methyltransferases controlled gene expression in other pathogens, the phase variable modA genes of Neisseria were studied. Mutant strains lacking the modA11, modA12 or modA13 genes were made and their phenotype analysed. Microarray analysis revealed that in all three modA alleles multiple genes were either up- or down-regulated, some of which were virulence associated. For example, in N. meningitidis (modA11), 80 genes were differentially expressed including the vaccine antigen candidates lactoferrin binding proteins A and B. Functional studies in N. gonorrhoeae confirmed that wild-type FA1090 modA13 ON and FA1090modA13::kan mutant strains have distinct phenotypes in antimicrobial resistance, a primary human cervical epithelial cell model of infection and biofilm formation. In summary, this thesis provides experimental confirmation that in three important human pathogens, H. influenzae, N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae, alteration of expression of a type III DNA-methyltransferase causes switching of multiple genes. This novel genetic system has been termed the &#145;phasevarion&#146; (phase variable regulon). The wide distribution of phase variable mod genes indicates that this may be a common strategy used by host-adapted bacterial pathogens to randomly switch between distinct &#147;differentiated&#148; cell types.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158679</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using scenario planning to identify potential impacts of socio-demographic change on aspects of domestic tourism demand in Queensland in 2021</field><field name="creator">Glover, Petra Sabine</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism -- Supply and demand -- Forecasting</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Queensland -- Forecasting</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Queensland -- Economic aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158465</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genomic approach to the study of moulting and cuticle formation in crustaceans</field><field name="creator">Kuballa, Anna Viktoria</field><field name="description">Crustacean moulting is a complex process involving many regulatory pathways. A holistic approach to examine differential gene expression profiles across all moult cycle stages was used in this study. Custom cDNA microarrays were constructed for P. pelagicus. The chips contained 5000 transcripts derived from both the whole organism, and from individual tissues such as the brain, eyestalk, mandibular organ and Y-organ from all moult cycle stages. Thus the arrays were designed to study global gene expression profiles of transcripts relevant to the moulting process, across the entire moult cycle. A total of 556 clones were sequenced from the cDNA libraries used to construct the arrays. These cDNAs represented 217 singlets and 62 contigs, resulting in 279 unique putative genes. The isolated transcripts were classified into the following biological functions: cuticular proteins associated with calcified and/or uncalcified arthropod exoskeletons, FaMeT, proteins belonging to the hemocyanin gene family, lectins, proteins relevant to lipid metabolism, mitochondrial proteins, muscle related proteins, phenoloxidase activators, ribosomal RNA relevant to protein biosynthesis, other sequences which did not fall into these groups, and those transcripts which displayed no significant sequence homology with sequences deposited in the NCBI database. Partial characterisation of the unannotated transcripts was achieved via conceptual domain analysis. Moult cycle-related differential expression profiles were observed for many transcripts. Of particular interest were those relating to the formation and hardening of the exoskeleton, which were shown to be up-regulated at key stages of moulting, and the gene for putative FaMeT which was up-regulated only in intermoult. The moult cycle-related differential expression profiles of genes involved in exoskeletal formation were analysed and described in detail. Additional characterisation was carried out in the form of conceptual domain analysis, uncovering many types of cuticle proteins. Twenty-one distinct transcripts representing crustacean cuticular proteins were isolated. Thirteen contain copies of the cuticle_1 domain, previously isolated only from calcified regions of the crustacean exoskeleton. Four transcripts contained a chitin_bind_4 domain, associated with both the calcified and un-calcified cuticle of crustaceans. Another four transcripts contained an unannotated domain (PfamB_109992) previously isolated from C. pagurus. Additionally cryptocyanin, a haemolymph protein, involved in cuticle synthesis and structural integrity, also displayed moult cycle-related differential expression. Moult stage-specific expression analysis of these transcripts revealed that differential expression occurs both within transcripts containing the same domain and between transcripts containing different domains. Exoskeletal hardening in crustaceans occurs through the mineralisation and sclerotization of the organic matrix. Glycosylation levels of proteins in an organic matrix have been attributed to the regulation of calcification. Two genes potentially involved in the recognition of glycosylation, the C-type lectin receptor and the mannose-binding protein, were found to display moult cyclerelated differential expression profiles. C-type lectin receptor up-regulation was found to coincide with periods associated with new uncalcified cuticle formation, while the up-regulation of mannose-binding protein occurred only in the postmoult stage, during which calcification takes place, implicating both in the regulation of calcification. Genes known to be involved in the phenoloxidase activation pathway, which facilitates sclerotization, also displayed moult cycle-related differential expression profiles. Trypsin and chymotrypsin were up-regulated in the intermoult stage when compared to postmoult, while trypsin was also up-regulated in premoult compared to ecdysis. Furthermore, hemocyanin, itself with phenoloxidase activity, displayed an identical expression pattern to that of the phenoloxidase activators, i.e. up-regulation in pre- and postmoult. FaMeT is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of FA to MF in the final step of MF synthesis. Multiple isoforms of putative FaMeT were isolated from six crustacean species belonging to the families Portunidae, Penaeidae, Scyllaridae and Parastacidae. The portunid crabs Portunus pelagicus and Scylla serrata code for three isoforms. Two isoforms (short and long) were isolated from the penaeid prawns Penaeus monodon and Fenneropenaeus merguiensis, and the scyllarid Thenus orientalis and parastacid Cherax quadricarinatus. Putative FaMeT sequences were also amplified from the genomic DNA of P. pelagicus and compared to the putative FaMeT transcripts expressed. Each putative FaMeT cDNA isoform was represented in the genomic DNA, indicative of a multi-gene family. Various tissues from P. pelagicus were individually screened for putative FaMeT expression using PCR and fragment analysis. Each tissue type expressed all three isoforms of putative FaMeT irrespective of sex or moult stage. Protein domain analysis revealed the presence of a deduced casein kinase II phosphorylation site present in only the long isoform of putative FaMeT.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158680</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantum control and Quantum information</field><field name="creator">Sarovar, Mohan</field><field name="description">Quantum information science has blossomed into a major research field over the past decade or so. In doing so, it has established links with several other areas of physics, computer science, and engineering. One of these areas is quantum control &#150; the extension of control theory to physical systems whose dynamics are governed by quantum mechanics. Quantum control, like quantum information, is a fairly young field with remarkable technological consequences, and this cross-pollination is proving to be stimulating. In this thesis we explore some of the connections between quantum information and quantum control. In particular, (i) we examine quantum error correction from a quantum feedback control perspective, and demonstrate new continuous time implementations of quantum error correcting codes; (ii) we consider performing quantum feedback control experiments on a solid-state quantum computing architecture &#150; circuit QED &#150; and propose new measurement schemes that would enable such experiments; and (iii) we consider the problem of optimally estimating quantum processes, and in particular, analyze in detail the problem of optimally estimating a one-parameter quantum process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158466</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Static Single Assignment for Decompilation</field><field name="creator">Van Emmerik, Michael</field><field name="description">Static Single Assignment enables the efficient implementation of many important decompiler components, including expression propagation, preservation analysis, type analysis, and the analysis of indirect jumps and calls. Source code is an essential part of all software development. It is so valuable that when it is not available, it can be worthwhile deriving it from the executable form of computer programs through the process of decompilation. There are many applications for decompiled source code, including inspections for malware, bugs, and vulnerabilities; interoperability; and the maintenance of an application that has some or all source code missing. Existing machine code decompilers, in contrast to existing decompilers for Java and similar platforms, have significant deficiencies. These include poor recovery of parameters and returns, poor handling of indirect jumps and calls, and poor to nonexistent type analysis. It is shown that use of the Static Single Assignment form (SSA form) enables many of these deficiencies to be overcome. SSA enables or assists with: &#149; data How analysis, particularly expression propagation; &#149; the identification of parameters and returns, without assuming ABI compliance; &#149; preservation analysis (whether a location is preserved across a call), which is needed for analysing parameters and return locations; &#149; type analysis, implemented as a sparse data flow problem; and &#149; the analysis of indirect jumps and calls. Expression propagation is a key element of a decompiler, since it allows long sequences of individual instruction semantics to be combined into more complex, high level statements. Parameters, returns, and types are features of high level languages that do not appear explicitly in machine code programs, hence their recovery is important for readability and the ability to recompile the generated code. In addition, type analysis is either absent from existing machine code decompilers, or is limited to a relatively simple propagation of types from library function calls. The analysis of indirect jumps and calls is important for finding all code in a machine code program, and enables the translation of important high level program elements such as switch statements, assigned gotos, virtual function calls, and calls through function pointers. Because of these challenges, machine code decompilers are the most interesting case. Existing machine code decompilers are weak at identifying parameters and returns, particularly where parameters are passed in registers, or the calling convention is non standard. A general analysis of parameters and returns is demonstrated, using new devices such as Collectors. These analyses become more complex in the presence of recursion. The elimination of redundant parameters and returns are shown to be global analyses, implying that for a general decompiler, procedures can not be finalised until all other procedures are analysed. Full type analysis is discussed, where the semantics of individual instructions, as well as information from library calls, contribute to the solution. A sparse, iterative, data How based approach is compared with the more common constraint based approach. The former requires special functions to handle the multiple constraints that result from overloaded operators such as addition and subtraction. Special problems arise with aggregate types (arrays and structures), and address taking of variables. Indirect branch instructions are often handled at instruction decode time. Delaying analysis until the program is represented in SSA form allows more powerful techniques such as expression propagation to be used. This results in a simpler, more general analysis, at the cost of having to throwaway some results and restart some analyses. It is shown that this technique easily extends to handling Fortran assigned gotos, which can not be effectively analysed at decode time. The analysis of indirect call instructions has the potential for enabling the recovery of object oriented virtual function calls. Many of the techniques presented in this thesis have been verified with the Boomerang open source decompiler. The goal of extending the state of the art of machine code decompilation has been achieved. There are of course still some areas left for future work. The most promising areas for future research have been identified as range analysis and alias analysis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158682</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BEHAVIOUR MANAGEMENT OF CHILDREN IN LONG DAY CARE CENTRES: THE EFFECTS OF TRAINING ON CARERS&#146; PRACTICES</field><field name="creator">Abbey, Brenda Joyce</field><field name="description">This study investigated the effects on carers&#146; practices, and the knowledge, understandings, and stated beliefs that underpinned those practices, of training them to manage children&#146;s behaviour democratically. Specifically, it aimed to identify the effects of training on carers&#146; (a) behaviour management practices, (b) knowledge of approaches to behaviour management, (c) understandings of theories of child development and learning, (d) knowledge of the governance that sets the parameters for their behaviour management practices, (e) goals for their behaviour management practices, and (f) perceptions of their role in managing children&#146;s behaviour. The researcher addressed these research questions by conducting concurrent case studies of the behaviour management practices of 17 carers in four long day care centres in South-East Queensland. The researcher assumed the role of privileged observer during the data-gathering phases. The data were collected at all four centres at regular intervals, both pre-training (baseline), and post-training for 20 weeks. During this time, each centre was visited fortnightly with each visit lasting approximately five hours. The data were gathered from direct observations of carers working with the children pre-training and post-training; semi-structured interviews with carers pretraining and post-training; informal discussions with directors and carers throughout the study; analysis of carers&#146; reflective diaries maintained after the training; carers&#146; written responses to training activities; analyses of centre documents (such as behaviour management policy); and communications displayed in centre entrances, corridors, and rooms. Pre-training data reflected carers&#146; established behaviour management practices. Post-training data reflected carers&#146; practices after the training. Both pre-training and post-training data were categorised and the two sets of data compared. The changes to carers&#146; baseline practices after the training were attributed to that training. The training program was developed by the researcher from the literature on democratic approaches to behaviour management, on constructivist theories of child development and learning, and on the legislative and ethical parameters of the child care field. Embedded in the training was a respect for carers&#146; individual and collective knowledge pre-training. The program was drafted prior to the data collection phase, and fine-tuned once the pre-training data were collated. Carers knew that the training session was only one aspect of the training, and that they had each other&#146;s ongoing support, and that the researcher would be their mentor for the duration of the study. The program was delivered over a full day, was interactive and experiential. Each participant received a folder that included selected pertinent readings. After the training, the carers maintained practices consistent with the training (e.g., indirect guidance and prevention); adopted new practices consistent with the training (e.g., educative methods and scaffolding children&#146;s relationships with others); and reduced their use of practices inconsistent with the training (e.g., reward, punishment, and imposed control). They attributed these changes to their intent to align their practices with their new understandings about the way children learn to behave, and the carers&#146; role in that process. These changes demonstrate the effectiveness of the training. In summary, the results provide support for training carers to manage children&#146;s behaviour in democratic ways. In a more general sense, the results add to the current limited pool of knowledge on carers&#146; behaviour management practices and to what constitutes an effective training program for carers. Future studies on effective training programs should ascertain the length of time carers uphold changes, and for examining the conditions necessary for the changes to be enduring. Another topic to be addressed more closely would be how to effect change in those practices where carers resist change (e.g., in this study, carers&#146; rigid adherence to routines, their level of involvement with children).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158467</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consequences of Boundary Permeability on Organisational Outcomes: Investigating the Moderating Role of Culture and Self Construal</field><field name="creator">Loh, Min Ing (Jennifer)</field><field name="description">Boundaries are an inevitable consequence of cognitive categorisation, a basic cognitive process through which individuals simplify complex stimuli into meaningful categories (Abrams &amp; Hogg, 1999). Boundaries are generally understood as the physical, temporal, emotional, cognitive, and relational demarcations that separate one entity from another (Ashforth, Kreiner, &amp; Fugate, 2000; Nippert-Eng, 1996; Zerubavel, 1993). For instance, a national boundary usually refers to the border of a nation or country. In contrast, socio-psychological boundaries refer to different cultural norms used by members to guide their thoughts, emotions and behaviours. Boundaries have varying levels of permeability. Boundary permeability refers to the ease with which individuals can either mentally or physically enter or exit the group. For example, impermeable workgroup boundaries may restrict employees from entering the group and this can cause disruption to normal work processes. For many of us, however, socio-psychological boundaries are rather vague concepts. It is only when we encounter people from another culture that we realise many of the basic assumptions we have about human interactions simply do not work in different cultural contexts. Although boundary issues have been examined in a wide array of research domains, such as role transitions and intergroup relations, most of these studies examined behaviours in Western contexts. There has also been a dearth of research examining the role of boundary permeability in the workplace. Thus, given the important implications of boundaries on workplace processes and effectiveness, it is worthwhile investigating this issue using a cross-cultural perspective. The objectives of this thesis are three-fold. First, I identified the different types of workplace boundaries and boundary dimensions between Australian and Singaporean employees. Second, I examined the interactive relationships between boundary permeability and culture in predicting cooperation and workgroup identification. Finally, I examined the interactive relationships among cultural grouping, cultural group membership and workgroup membership in predicting level of trust and level of collaboration. In order to investigate these objectives, three studies were designed. Study 1 explored the nature of boundaries and boundary permeability using a semistructured interview with 20 employees from Singapore and Australia. Using a qualitative analysis, results revealed four boundary categories, each with two subcategories, except ethnic boundary which only has one category: collectivist versus individualist norm boundaries, ethnicity boundaries, relationship versus taskoriented work boundaries, and explicit versus implicit communication boundaries. Results also suggested that these cultural dimensions affected boundary permeability. Study 2 directly examined the effect of boundary permeability on workgroup identification and cooperation. In addition, the moderating role of culture (conceptualised in terms of cultural grouping and self-construal) on the relationship between boundary permeability and these outcomes was also investigated. Using a sample of 134 employees (consisting of 87 Chinese Singaporeans and 47 Anglo- Celtic Australians), results suggested that boundary permeability was positively related to cooperation but not to workgroup identification. Further analysis revealed that boundary permeability had a stronger effect on cooperation and workgroup identification for Singaporeans than Australians. In terms of self construal, results indicated that boundary permeability had a stronger effect on workgroup identification for individuals with higher interdependent self construal compared to individuals with lower interdependent self construal. Results indicated that there was a stronger relationship between boundary permeability and cooperation for employees with lower interdependent self-construal compared to those with higher interdependent self-construal. In Study 3, 240 university students (120 Australians, 120 Singaporeans) participated in an experiment which involved assessing hypothetical scenarios of cooperation with an in-group or out-group team member. First, boundary permeability was manipulated to examine whether high boundary permeability versus low boundary permeability would affect individuals&#146; intentions to cooperate and help. Results indicated that compared to Singaporeans, Australians&#146; intention to cooperate was higher in low boundary permeability than in high boundary permeability but this was not found for their intention to help. Second, the interactive effects among cultural grouping (Australians versus Singaporeans), cultural group membership (i.e., cultural in-group versus cultural out-group) and workgroup membership (i.e., members from one&#146;s own workgroup or in-group workgroup versus members from another part of the company or out-group workgroup) was examined in predicting level of trust and level of collaboration. Results suggested that there was a significant three way interaction among cultural grouping, cultural group membership and workgroup membership in predicting level of trust but not level of collaboration. Further analysis revealed that when members came from an out-group workgroup (i.e., from another part of the company, Australians accorded a higher level of trust than Singaporeans towards members of cultural out-group than in-group. In general, these results suggested that group membership and boundary permeability affected how Australians and Singaporeans cooperated and trusted one another. Overall, the present research program contributed to the literature in several ways. First, by integrating cross-cultural psychology, social identity theory and selfcategorisation theory, boundary definition in two cultural contexts could be investigated. Second, evidence was gathered suggesting that culture influences how workplace boundary permeability and group membership affected organisational outcomes. Implications of this research in terms of research and management practice are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158468</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disturbance of Cardiovascular Structure and Function in Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome: Implications for Diagnosis, Prevention and Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease</field><field name="creator">Wong, Chiew Ying</field><field name="description">Obesity is a worldwide phenomenon of epidemic proportions. It has been estimated that there are more than 300 million obese humans worldwide and greater than 2 million adult Australians who are clinically obese. Epidemiology studies have linked obesity to heart failure. Overweight and obesity are potent predictors of subsequent clinical heart failure in Framingham Heart Study. Previous studies reported abnormal left ventricular (LV) diastolic function without consistent association with systolic dysfunction. There is limited information on the right ventricular changes. There are various limitations in the previous studies. Some of the earlier findings may reflect the role of co-morbidities that contribute to LV dysfunction (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease and obstructive sleep apnoea). Furthermore, most of the previous studies used conventional echo techniques based on Doppler flow and blood pool information which were less sensitive than current measures and more load-dependent (e.g. mitral inflow velocities, IVRT and EF). Comprehensive echo- Doppler assessment is absent from most studies. Using conventional echocardiographic techniques, clinical heart disease is only detected when gross structural changes or (less reliably) when poorly defined changes in LV filling have occurred, and patients are already at increased cardiovascular risk. Overall, early stages of obese heart disease are not well characterized, largely due to associated comorbidities related to obesity such as coronary artery disease, sleep apnoea and hypertension. The pathophysiology of obesity cardiomyopathy likely involves structural but subclinical changes. The overall hypothesis of the studies undertaken in this thesis was that sensitive new echocardiographic techniques can make a major contribution to the understanding of myocardial dysfunction at an early stage in the development of obese heart disease. Further, this thesis hypothesizes that these new technologies will facilitate the evaluation of novel diagnostic strategies, and allows selection of at risk populations for intervention and quantification of the response to treatments in patients with obese heart disease or early myocardial changes. The thesis initially reviews the clinical aspects and pathophysiology of obese heart disease, emphasizing the independent role of excess weight, which may be a target for intervention. This is followed by a discussion of the current state of the art in echocardiographic assessment myocardial function, and potential new approaches which might allow more sensitive tissue characterization. The third chapter describes the metabolic testing, biochemical, vascular assessment and the other methodologies used in this thesis, with particular attention to the quantitative assessment of vascular function and structure. In chapter 4, new quantitative measures of LV long-axis systolic function (tissue Doppler, strain imaging and ultrasound backscatter), and conventional echocardiography, were assessed in 109 patients across a range of BMI with normal ejection fraction and free of cardiac symptoms, and compared with 33 matched controls. Obese and overweight patients had increased LV mass, reduced LV systolic tissue velocity, strain and backscatter parameters indicating systolic dysfunction, and reduced early diastolic myocardial velocity in a dose dependent manner across BMI groups. The severely obese subgroup has the most marked abnormalities in all parameters. These results indicate that excess weight is associated with diastolic dysfunction in particular, which may represent the earliest abnormality in obese heart disease. In addition, new quantitative echocardiographic techniques appear to be useful for evaluating subtle abnormalities of myocardial function in obese heart disease. In Chapter 5, we used these new techniques to assess the relationship of the number of features of the metabolic syndrome to early myocardial dysfunction and cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with metabolic syndrome. We studied 393 patients without cardiac symptoms, and screened to exclude significant coronary artery disease.. Myocardial systolic (myocardial systolic velocity, strain rate) and diastolic measures (myocardial early diastolic velocity) were highest in controls and became progressively lower in proportion to the number of metabolic syndrome components. The MS contributed to the reduced systolic and diastolic function in those with normal LV mass index. LV measures of strain rate and myocardial diastolic velocity (em) were independent predictors of exercise capacity. It was therefore concluded that reduced myocardial function is an independent predictor of exercise capacity in patients with metabolic syndrome and those who additionally have subclinical myocardial abnormalities and reduced cardiorespiratory fitness should be considered a potential target for primary intervention. Chapter 6, we evaluated LV torsion and rotational velocities by the novel method of speckle tracking echocardiography (STE). STE was proposed as a sensitive marker of LV function. We sought to evaluate the LV rotational motion and untwisting in obese subjects in comparison with tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). We demonstrated otherwise healthy obese subjects to have reduced global LV torsion as well as reduced regional rotation at the base and diastolic rotational velocities at both the base and the apex. Reduced LV torsion and rotational velocities were present even in those whose longitudinal function was preserved, indicating that the former abnormalities occur prior to any impaired systolic longitudinal function and the higher sensitivity of STE in detection of early myocardial disease. These results showed that the new ultrasound technologies enabled more objective assessment of left ventricular function. In Chapter 6, we therefore sought whether similar information could be obtained from myocardial velocities and strain indices of the right ventricle in obese subjects. We also sought to identify the determinants of RV dysfunction in overweight and obese subjects. Quantitative echocardiographic techniques similar to those used in earlier chapters were applied to 93 ambulatory overweight and obese subjects. RV tissue velocities and strain indices were reduced in obese patients irrespective of the presence and severity of sleep apnoea independent of age, gender, and blood pressure. These changes were shown to be associated with fasting insulin, adiponectin levels and reduced exercise capacity. In parallel with effects of obesity on the myocardium, obesity has effects on the vasculature. In order to understand the roles of the Metabolic Syndrome (MS) on the vasculature, in chapter 7, we examined whether MS clustering had similar additive impact on vascular structure and function beyond the atherosclerotic risk factors clustering. Components of MS synergistically impact vascular changes in patients with MS, although the clustering of atherosclerotic risk factors remains a better risk prediction for subclinical arterial changes. Next, we sought the relative prevalence of vascular and myocardial sequelae of obesity and MS. In chapter 8, we further examined the prevalence and associations of coronary artery disease (CAD), subclinical LV dysfunction (LVD), LV hypertrophy (LVH) and early vascular changes in 521 asymptomatic obese and diabetic populations in our community. The risk of CAD and vascular changes were disproportionably associated with DM as compared with MS. Both LV hypertrophy and LV dysfunction were prevalent in both diabetes and obesity. Finally, in chapter 9, the quantitative echo techniques which were validated as sensitive markers of myocardial dysfunction in chapter 4 were applied, together with vascular imaging, in an interventional study of the effect of weight reduction on early myocardial and vascular changes. Following lifestyle interventions of exercise with dieting, obese patients with successful weight reduction demonstrated increases in myocardial diastolic function, reduced myocardial tissue density and improved brachial arterial reactivity. This Increase in myocardial function was in turn related to improved exercise capacity. The results demonstrate that modest weight reduction through lifestyle intervention can modify myocardial function in metabolic heart disease and may provide a specific primary prevention strategy against risk of heart failure development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158469</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defining the Legal Contours of Academic Freedom of Educators in their Creation and Utilisation of Online Tools and Technologies in Higher E-Learning</field><field name="creator">Ramiscal, Noel</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the concept of &#147;academic freedom&#148; of educators and its legal application in tertiary education, particularly in higher e-learning. The research initially showed that the theories of academic freedom of educators were rooted in the theory of the university that found modern articulation in the Germanic concept of &#147;Freiheit der Wissenschaft&#148; in the 1800s. This was based on earlier notions that educators were the university, when they wielded the power to dictate the content and administration of learning. The research demonstrates that this concept which was carried over into the 20th century, provided the seeds by which the individual academic freedoms of educators to teach, research, disseminate their scholarly work and engage in other legitimate activities, can be controlled, curtailed and even repressed by states and institutions. The thesis examines and exposes the legal ontological flaw of theories of academic freedom of educators that are dependent on the autonomy of universities. A different holistic framework based on the human rights of educators is examined in the form of the 1997 UNESCO/ILO Recommendation Concerning the Status of Higher Education Teaching Personnel (1997 Recommendation). The thesis traces and analyses the underpinning legal principles, as well as the history and status of the 1997 Recommendation. It recognises that the 1997 Recommendation provides a basic legal framework that will protect the rights and freedoms of educators in higher education that can withstand the vagaries of technology, resist institutional encroachment and challenge state acts that violate educators&#146; freedoms. The 1997 Recommendation merely contains general principles on higher education, and the subsequent documents produced relative to it, did not elucidate on the academic freedoms of educators in higher e-learning. This is its major shortcoming, considering that e-learning is projected as a major means of solving logistical and legal concerns regarding access to education, which is considered a human right. Educators occupy a central place in this scheme. While the historic 100 million mark of tertiary students was reached in this century, there is a projected shortage of educators within the next decade. The status of educators and their academic freedoms as the research shows are far from certain. The thesis aims to address this lacuna. It is a multidisciplinary project that straddles three disciplines: law, technology and education. It uses technological and educational examples, case studies and legal controversies from several jurisdictions that include the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Philippines, and to some extent Canada, in expounding the Recommendation&#146;s principles and extending and applying them to educators in higher e-learning. The 1997 Recommendation was gravely deficient in another important area: it did not provide any standard for the protection of the intellectual property rights of educators over their creations. The thesis considers this issue in the context of e-learning and advocates for the validation of educators&#146; ownership of their digital works, by using a human rights perspective on intellectual property rights. This perspective is in accord with the general spirit of the 1997 Recommendation. Armed with this approach, the thesis critically scrutinises several institutional policies and practices in the jurisdictions selected for the study, and found that most of them violate the material and moral rights of educators as human beings over their creations. In light of this, the thesis advocates for the adoption of a standard, called the &#147;educator exception&#148; as a viable legal mechanism for protecting the rights of educators over their works, even if they were produced in the course of their employment. The thesis also examines the legal implications of educators&#146; utilisation of web tools like metadata and hyperlinks in their e-learning activities and creations. The thesis demonstrates how the creation and utilisation of these online tools can support, extend, and even safeguard the academic freedoms of educators as provided by the 1997 Recommendation. It also offers some findings gleaned from the research that contributes to the protection of educators in higher e-learning. The 1997 Recommendation was emphatic in its conviction that the standards it sets are applicable to all educators in higher education regardless of the political and societal environment they are in, for they grapple with and experience similar conditions. The writer trusts that the thesis contributes to a legal and practical understanding of the 1997 Recommendation&#146;s principles, elucidates on its shortcomings with the aim of remedying them, creates awareness and debate over the plight and status of educators engaged in higher e-learning no matter where they are situated, and contributes to the pursuit of truth which is the essence of academic freedom.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158683</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE ROLE OF FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR-1 IN HUMAN ADIPOGENESIS</field><field name="creator">Newell, Felicity Sara</field><field name="description">Obesity has developed into a world-wide epidemic highlighting the necessity for basic research into the mechanisms that govern adipose tissue growth. The accumulation of adipose tissue mass, termed adipogenesis, is the result of both an increase in the triglyceride content of mature adipocytes and the proliferation and differentiation of the adipocyte precursors, preadipocytes. The features of murine adipogenesis have been extensively studied using in vitro models of differentiation, however human adipogenesis is poorly understood due to a lack of available cell lines and the often poor differentiation capacity of primary preadipocytes. In our laboratory, we have recently demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor- 1 (FGF-1) reproducibly increases the differentiation capacity of primary human preadipocytes (phPA). FGF-1 treatment increases phPA proliferation and during this period also primes cells for subsequent differentiation. The highest levels of phPA differentiation are obtained following FGF-1 treatment during both proliferation and differentiation. However it is not known how FGF-1 mediates these actions, or whether FGF-1 has a similar effect on other human preadipocyte models. Furthermore the features of preadipocyte differentiation in response to FGF-1 treatment have not been examined. Therefore, the aims of this thesis were to further characterise the features of human adipogenesis in FGF-1 treated human preadipocytes and to investigate the mechanisms of FGF-1 action in these cells. The features of differentiation were examined in FGF-1 treated phPA and FGF-1 treated SGBS PA (a human preadipocyte strain derived from an individual with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome). These models were compared with the well-characterised murine 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line (3T3-L1 PA). FGF-1 upregulated the adipogenic program in phPA, with increased expression of adipocyte markers during differentiation. Moreover, phPA differentiated in the presence of FGF-1 were more insulin responsive and secreted increased levels of adiponectin. FGF-1 treatment of SGBS PA elicited similar effects on cellular proliferation and differentiation, resulting in increased expression of adipocyte genes and an increased number of functional adipocytes. For the most part the adipogenic program in phPA and SGBS PA paralleled that observed in 3T3-L1 PA. However there was no evidence of mitotic clonal expansion in phPA, a process that is postulated to be necessary for differentiation in murine models and to involve the activation of ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase). In this thesis it was demonstrated that FGF-1 induced robust phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in early differentiation in phPA. Furthermore, inhibition of ERK1/2 activity significantly reduced phPA differentiation demonstrating that ERK1/2 activation is necessary for human adipogenesis in the absence of mitotic clonal expansion. The work in this thesis therefore highlights the existence of species specific differences with respect to adipogenesis and demonstrates that FGF-1 treated phPA and SGBS PA represent useful in vitro models for the study of human adipogenesis. The mechanisms of FGF-1 action in phPA and SGBS PA proliferation and differentiation were subsequently examined. FGF-1 is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family and elicits many of its effects by binding to cell surface tyrosine kinase FGF receptors (FGFR) and subsequently activating downstream signal transduction cascades. In this thesis, it was demonstrated that phPA expressed four FGF receptors (FGFR1-4), and that FGFR activation was required for phPA proliferation. FGFR activation in proliferation resulted in the stimulation of a number of downstream signalling pathways including the Ras-MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) pathway and the PI-3 kinase (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) pathway. Long term FGF-1 treatment of phPA during proliferation primes the cells for differentiation. In this thesis it was demonstrated that this priming resulted in changes in gene expression in confluent phPA, with alterations in the expression of other FGFs as well as genes required for differentiation. The role of FGF-1 in phPA differentiation was also examined. It was observed that, following induction of differentiation, FGF-1 increased signalling through several signal transduction pathways (the PI-3 kinase and Ras-MAP kinase pathways) which have postulated roles in human adipogenesis. Therefore, the work presented in this thesis serves to build on our earlier novel findings of the adipogenic role of FGF-1 in phPA and provides further evidence of the requirement for FGF-1 throughout phPA development. In addition, FGF-1 treated human preadipocytes offer an attractive in vitro model to study many features of adipogenesis in a human model and provide further insights into the processes that ultimately lead to obesity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158470</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IDENTIFYING BARRIERS TO THE UPTAKE OF ICT IN A QUALITY MANAGEMENT CONTEXT: CASES FROM THE HONG KONG TRANSPORT SECTOR</field><field name="creator">Yau, Hon</field><field name="description">This study concentrates on the Hong Kong transport industry and the following six research questions will be studied: (i) To what extent and why do the organisational learning barriers, namely skilled incompetence; organisational defensive routines and fancy footwork, affect the organisational learning of new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)? (ii) To what extent and why do the on-the-job intervention methods, namely rotation principle, project work, change of payment and incentives, cope with the three learning barriers? (iii) To what extent and why will the benefits (in terms of new knowledge, new technology, education and training) be obtained from the technology absorption of ICT of telecommunication systems by the telecommunication staff? (iv) To what extent and why will the quality in the areas of (a) organisational culture, (b) product and process, (c) customer, be improved after the technology absorption of ICT? (v) To what extent and why will the organisational learning abilities, including ability to cooperate and participate; ability to communicate and achieve transparency; ability to analyse problems and solve complex issues; ability to store knowledge, be improved after the adoption of the quality assurance issue, namely continuous improvement and training? (vi) How do the components of the model correlate with each other? The study starts with a literature review of the organisational learning barriers; on-the-job intervention; technology absorption; quality improvement; improvement of learning abilities. The conceptual framework &#147;Information and telecommunication technologies absorption and organisational learning process model&#148; is introduced. The second part deals with the research design and methodology, including literature review of the research methods, instruments and procedure of data collection method, and data analysis method for the case study. A survey; interview and documentation have been for the case study. The third part includes the analysis and interpretation of the results. The thesis concludes by discussing the implications and recommendations of the study. This study finds that three organisational learning barriers, namely 1) skilled incompetence; 2) organisational defensive routines; and 3) fancy footwork, exert some degree of influence on the staff of a company, which impedes learning of information and telecommunication technologies. This study also finds that rotation principle and project work can cope with the three barriers effectively. However, the change in payment and incentive method cannot cope with them effectively. It is also one of the findings of the study that individual and company can benefit from the technology absorption on the information and telecommunication technologies. The following nine quality issues can be improved after the absorption of technologies: (i) Staff&#146;s involvement in problem-solving and decision-making; (ii) Teamwork; (iii) Skill and motivation of the workforce; (Iv) Downtime of telecommunication systems (e.g. radio system, CCTV system, PAS, PIDS and telephone system); (v) Quality of telecommunication systems (e.g. radio system, CCTV system, PAS, PIDS and telephone system); (vi) Productivity of telecommunication systems (e.g. radio system, CCTV system, PAS, PIDS and telephone system); (vii) Customer satisfaction; (viii) Service to internal customers and (ix) Customer service side of business The fifth part of the study finds that the learning abilities, including (i) ability to cooperate and participate; (ii) ability to communicate and achieve transparency; (iii) ability to analyse problems and solve complex issues and (iv) ability to store knowledge, can be improved by the introduction of quality assurance. Finally, the relationship of the components of the model is also studied.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158684</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface Modification of an Expanded Poly(tetrafluoroethylene) Implant</field><field name="creator">Chandler-Temple, Adrienne Frances</field><field name="description">Facial reconstructive surgery involves prosthetic implants. The success of these implants depends on the mechanical, architectural, and surface properties of the implant material. The mechanical and architectural properties of the material must mimic the tissue of which the implant replaces. Materials with good bulk properties rarely possess the appropriate surface characteristics required for good biocompatibility. One problem that can occur at the interface between a biomaterial and the living tissue is the formation of fibrous connective tissue. When connective tissue forms it separates the implant from the bone; causing poor osseoinduction. The ultimate ramifications include pain, loosening of the implant, damage to the local tissue, and revision surgery. Surface grafting techniques are common in the electrochemical industry and separation science; however, it is only recently that these techniques have been investigated in the area of biomaterials. Changing the surface properties of a biomaterial has the potential to improve biocompatibility, bioactivity, and most importantly, healing time. Radiation-induced grafting of methacryloxyethyl phosphate (MOEP) and monoacryloxyethyl phosphate (MAEP) onto expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (ePTFE) was achieved by simultaneous and post irradiation techniques in the presence of solvents and solvent mixtures. The modified surfaces were characterized using weight increase, XPS, ATR-FTIR, SEM, ToF-SIMS, and contact angle measurement. Grafting yield was found to be solvent dependent; displaying concentration dependent increases for grafting of MOEP in methanol and MOEP in MEK. For grafting of MAEP in various solvent systems low grafting yield by weight was observed. However, surface coverage of the copolymer was greatest for MAEP in water, followed by MOEP in MEK as determined by XPS. All grafting systems produced improved wettabilities, however, none of the modified surfaces produced were hydrophilic. Moreover, different solvent dependent grafting morphologies were observed from SEM micrograph images. The distribution of the graft co-polymer, both with respect to lateral distribution and depth into the membrane, was investigated using ToF-SIMS and MRI, respectively. The chemical nature of the homopolymers and graft copolymers were examined by ICP-AES, XPS, ATR-FTIR, and ToF-SIMS, concluding that the grafting process induces a number of events including: phosphate cleavage, cross-linking, and branching. Biocompatibility of the modified ePTFE was tested by in vitro protein adsorption and macrophage response studies. In vivo implantation of a biomaterial causes initially protein adsorption on the material&#146;s surface. Which proteins preferentially adsorb is dependent on the nature of the surface. It is the proteins on the surface to which cells respond: including macrophages that can signal either a normal healing response or a pro-inflammatory reaction. Proteins adsorbed onto surfaces incubated in foetal bovine serum solution were determined by surface-MALDI-ToF-MS. Two samples produced spectra with peaks of changed relative intensity and width compared to BSA at m/z = ~ 45 kDa. This peak potentially corresponds to four pro-inflammatory indicated proteins. Macrophage response was analysed by two methods using FACS analysis of RAW264.7/ELAM-eGFP cells and ELISA TNF-&#945; assays. These two analytical methods correlated well and showed high macrophage activation for the MOEP grafted samples. In addition, SEM was used to examine macrophage cell morphology. One MAEP grafted sample was found to produce a very low macrophage response. Moreover, this sample was one of those identified in the protein adsorption studies as preferentially adsorbing ~ 45 kDa protein(s), thus making this a key sample for future investigations. This work has provided grafting methods that reproducibly modify the surface properties of a current ePTFE implant. Control over position of the graft-copolymers on the membrane has been demonstrated. A thorough description of the chemistry of the homopolymers and graft-copolymers has been achieved. Furthermore, this study has identified a graft copolymer system that has potential as biomaterial implant material owing to its good biocompatibity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158471</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HOST-SEARCHING BEHAVIOUR OF A GENERALIST EGG PARASITOID &#150; RESPONSES TO ALTERNATIVE HOSTS WITH DIFFERENT PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</field><field name="creator">Brotodjojo, Raden Roro Rukmowati</field><field name="description">Trichogramma pretiosum Riley is a generalist egg parasitoid that is mass released in biological control programmes to control various insect pests on different plant species. The parasitism rates achieved by T. pretiosum vary across host species and across plant species, which suggests that the species of host and its host plant could both influence the host searching performance of this parasitoid. A comparative behavioural study across the eggs of two moth species, Helicoverpa armigera H&#252;bner and Spodoptera litura Fabricius, was conducted because these two host eggs have different characteristics. Helicoverpa armigera eggs are laid singly, whereas S. litura eggs are laid in clusters and are covered with fine scales from the moth abdomen. I tested how these and other differences in host species affect the behaviour of T. pretiosum females towards their host species. The ovipositional responses of T. pretiosum females, from different natal hosts and of different ages since emergence, to eggs of H. armigera and S. litura were studied in choice and no choice tests. Helicoverpa armigera eggs were consistently preferred over S. litura eggs, regardless of the natal host and adult age. When only S. litura eggs were available as hosts, they were parasitized at statistically similar rates to H. armigera eggs. The adult lifespan and lifetime fecundity of T. pretiosum were variable but were significantly affected by natal host species and/or host species to which they were exposed. The ovigeny index (OI) was significantly lower in the parasitoids exposed to H. armigera eggs than in those exposed to S. litura eggs, regardless of the natal host, indicating that H. armigera eggs sustain the adult parasitoids better, through host feeding, than S. litura eggs. Trichogramma females, like other egg parasitoids, use chemical cues that originate not only from their host plants and host eggs, but also from the adult insects that deposit the hosts. These last include the scales left by the ovipositing moths. These host-associated cues are used by parasitoids over long and short distances to find their hosts. Olfactometer tests demonstrated that the odours from moth scales and host plants attracted T. pretiosum females significantly, and thus function as long range cues. By contrast, the odour from host eggs did not attract them in this way. The strength of attraction was similar across the scales from H. armigera and S. litura moths. The female parasitoids responded most strongly to odours from tomato and cabbage, whereas odour from corn was not such a strong attractant. A non-host plant tested did not attract the parasitoids at all. The odours of moth scales from both H. armigera and S. litura were more attractive to T. pretiosum females than was the odour of the host plants tested. When parasitoids have followed these long range cues to the nearby vicinity of their hosts, they respond to short range cues to localise the hosts. Moth scales did not attract female parasitoids over a short distance, but they did arrest their movement so that they remained longer in the area with scales. Trichogramma pretiosum females took significantly more time to localise S. litura eggs than it took for them to locate H. armigera eggs. Time to locate hosts did not increase significantly when the eggs had been washed with hexane, which suggests that cues other than chemicals are associated with the eggs and play a more significant role in host finding over short distances. On their emergence, parasitoids are confronted by several options, including mating, searching for hosts, and seeking food. Season influenced the daily pattern of T. pretiosum emergence, with cooler winter temperatures extending emergence over two days. In summer they emerged earlier in the day and all parasitoids in the tests emerged during the first day. Parasitoids left their emergence sites by walking before their wings expanded fully. Adults of T. pretiosum visit flowers, presumably for nectar. Olfactometer tests showed that both males and females of T. pretiosum were attracted to the odor of alyssum flowers. The attraction to flower odour was significant for males when they had had no access to nutrients for 24h, but was less significant when they had just emerged. On the contrary, the attraction to food was more significant in newly emerged females. For 1 day starved females, cues associated with host plants (tomato leaves) and food (alyssum flowers) were equally important. Nutritional sources influenced the adult lifespan and reproductive performance of the parasitoids. Honey was the best source of nutrition for adults of T. pretiosum, resulting in the longest lifespan and the highest reproductive output, followed by alyssum flowers, tomato leaves and water. The results are discussed in relation to (i) understanding the entire mechanism of host searching behaviour of egg parasitoids, (ii) interpreting the behavioural interaction between generalist parasitoids and their different host insects and plants, and (iii) the better use of egg parasitoids in biological control.

Published and unpublished contributions to the Green debate on each issue are interpreted in terms of the claims they make concerning the lessons of history, and the pressures influencing these. The prominence of the Nazi past in these debates is shown to be at once a reflection of history&#146;s normative value for German foreign policy, its instrumental use in intra- and inter-party disputes, and its central role in Green identity, particularly for the 1968 cohort. This is a history of profound change in the political implications of the Nazi past. Chapter 2 traces the Greens&#146; changing perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: from a primary duty towards the Palestinian victims of oppression, stemming from an interpretation of the Holocaust as a by-product of generic fascism, to an understanding of the Holocaust legacy as entailing, above all, German responsibility for Israel. Chapter 1 shows the Greens rejecting violence in the name of German history during the euromissile dispute, while Chapters 3-5 chart ever-increasing challenges to pacifism and the growing belief during debates over Iraq, Bosnia and Kosovo that military force could, at times, be morally correct. It is argued that these studies reveal growing agreement between the German left and right on the lessons of history for German foreign policy, a pattern of change in Green attitudes to the Holocaust in which universal characteristics were first privileged, then de-emphasised, then reestablished in a different version, and the emergence of an argument for humanitarian military intervention grounded in the particular way the New Left and their political successors in the Greens engaged with the Holocaust. The process of confluence between left and right began with the euromissile dispute, when conservatives articulated policy goals in terms of the Holocaust legacy. This process continued throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, as increasing numbers of (mostly realist) Greens accepted conservative conclusions regarding: the undesirability of a pacifist German Sonderweg (if not a desirable normality); responsibility (as opposed to foreign policy guided by an ethic of conscience); the legitimacy of some uses of force based on the lesson of Munich, as well as the Allies&#146; war against Hitler and the need to prevent another Auschwitz; and the occasional moral irresponsibility of pacifism. The analysis highlights the tension between particularity and universality in Green interpretations of the Holocaust, and the associated questions of singularity and comparability. The Holocaust featured in Green anti-nuclear arguments as an example of modernity&#146;s destructive rationality and one of many horrors of the 20th century; its victims, alongside victims of these other horrors &#150; including the bombing war on German cities &#150; served to promote anti-militarism. At the same time, the influence of fascism theory and anti-imperialism on the new Green party ensured that Israel was not initially viewed as a haven for Jews persecuted by Germans, but primarily as a persecutor itself. From the mid-1980s, in response to nationalist universalising claims, Greens focused more on the German particularities of Nazism and the Holocaust. The narrative underscores the importance of acrimonious historical disputes of the 1980s: Heiner Gei&#223;ler&#146;s assertion that the &#147;pacifism of the 1930s first made Auschwitz possible,&#148; Helmut Kohl&#146;s notion of the &#147;grace of late birth,&#148; Bitburg and the Historikerstreit resonated throughout Green debates after the Cold War. In the face of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans in the 1990s, the Holocaust was universalised again as a source of transnational political morality in Green &#150; and international &#150; debates on genocide. Elements of universality and particularity came to the fore in debates over humanitarian military intervention, as Greens reexamined the antifascist imperative. These struggles over the correct lessons of the past are set against fundamental change in the international system and Green in-fighting, as they wrestled with questions of compromise then with the realities of power as part of the red-green coalition from 1998. Particular attention is paid to the realist faction&#146;s pursuit of Green acceptance of the core of West German foreign policy: integration into the Western community of nations, including NATO.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158472</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inborn errors of metabolism and hepatic disease</field><field name="creator">Coman, David John</field><field name="description">Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) have many clinical manifestations and often prove difficult to diagnose. Hepatic disease is a common feature of many IEM, and may exist in isolation or as part of a wider clinical constellation of multisystem pathology. In developed societies there a changing trend in the patterns of diagnosis of cholestatic liver disease in infants, with up to 20-30% of such cases now being recognised as due to metabolic/genetic conditions (Stormon et al 2001). In Asia, the lack of the availability of the appropriate diagnostic tests may lead to IEM not being recognised as the cause of liver disease. We tested the hypothesis that some Asian children with liver disease, of unknown cause, may have an inborn error of metabolism which could be diagnosed from a blood spot collected onto a filter paper card. This sample is logistically easy to transport to a tertiary laboratory with the capabilities of performing the appropriate analysis. Our aims were: (1). To determine from a literature review which inborn errors of metabolism, which can present with liver disease, can be diagnosed from a blood spot on filter paper. (2). To establish the appropriate tests in a central laboratory. The tests chosen would be those to which the Asian physicians do not have local access. (3). To determine the logistics of transporting blood spots on filter papers into Australia. (4). To liaise with one paediatric gastroenterologist in Asia to arrange collection of the filter paper blood spots from appropriate patients. (5). The ultimate aim is to establish a diagnostic service, which is economical and logistically easy to supplement the diagnostic tests available to the Asian physicians in their own countries. (6). To provide a free and rapid diagnostic screening service for IEM&#146;s known to cause hepatic disease and to which our Indonesian colleagues had no access. From a single newborn screening card blood spot, we used electron spray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (ES-MS:MS) techniques to screen for defects in the metabolism of fatty acid oxidation, amino acids, organic acids, the urea cycle, and peroxisomal biogenesis. SLC25A13 mutation testing was also performed from the sample newborn screening card blood spot. Tandem mass spectrometry techniques provide a rapid, cheap, and efficient method to screen for numerous IEM. ES-MS:MS has been widely implemented as a method for extended newborn screening in many countries around the world, including Australia. The ES-MS:MS techniques used in neoborn screening programes to screen for specific IEM will be utilised in this study. Citrullineamia type II (CTLN2) and neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD) are relatively newly discovered clinical phenotypes of defective urea cycle functioning. They are secondary to mutations in the citrin gene (SLC25A13). Nine mutations in the SLC25A13 have previously been documented in the medical literature, mostly in Japanese patients. No group has screened Indonesian patients for SLC25A13 mutations. Defects in citrin metabolism have recently been recognised in other South East Asian countries, therefore we offered mutation analysis for five of the nine SLC25A13 mutations, SLC25A13:c.851_851delGTAT, SLC25A13:c.1177+1G&gt;A, SLC25A13:c.1638ins23, SLC25A13:c.674C&gt;A, SLC25A13:c.1311+1G&gt;A , via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques from the same newborn screening sample collected for ES-MS:MS testing. We have enrolled 13 Indonesian patients and one local Queensland patient with liver disease into the study. No specific IEM were identified during the EI-MS:MS arm of the study, however 46% of the Indonesian population enrolled in the study displayed an elevated propionylcarnitine (C3) level which can be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. SLC25A13 PCR testing failed to identify any homozygous or heterozygous patients for the five mutations examined in this study. The absent findings of any specific IEM in the group is disappointing but not necessarily unexpected given the small number of the study cohort. IEM are pan-ethnic and are known to exist in our target populations. SLC25A13 mutations have previously been identified primarily in Asian populations. Our failure to uncover a specific IEM is more likely a reflection of the small number of patients enrolled in the study rather than a deficiency in the screening methods employed in the study, but may indicate that IEM are a less common cause of liver disease in Indonesian children than in Australia. Although this was a small study, it does, however, open the door for future collorborative research opportunities including: (1) enrolment of greater patient numbers from several Asian countries; (2) the broadening of range of disorders screening by including transferrin isoforms to detect congenital disorders of glycosylation, bile acids to detect disorders of bile acid synthesis, succinyl acetone to detect tyrosinaemia 1, alpha 1-antitrypsin activity with DNA confirmation for alpha 1- antitrypsin deficiency, galactose-1-phosphate for galactosaemia (in infants with neonatal onset) and lysosomal enzyme measurements to detect the lysosomal storage disorders and (3) testing the SLC25A13 mutation carrier frequency rates in heathly Indonesian population as well as mutation detection projects in patients suspected of having CTLN2 and NICCD. In the search for a patient diagnosis, negative results are still highly valuable, especially when the testing procedures provided by this study are not available locally for our Indonesian colleagues. The study has demonstrated that it is feasible and logistically easy to offer a service to our Asian neighbours to screen for the possibility of IEM in children with liver disease of unknown aetiology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158686</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of tirofiban with either low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin: a novel anticoagulation regime for patients undergoing PCI.</field><field name="creator">Walters, Darren Lester</field><field name="description">Background: An invasive strategy has become the preferred mode of treatment for patients with high-risk acute coronary syndrome.1-3 Adjunctive pharmacotherapeutic agents inhibiting platelet dependent thrombosis have improved the safety and efficacy of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in these patients.4 The glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor is considered the &#145;final common pathway&#146; for platelet activation and this receptor is blocked by glycoprotein inhibitors such as tirofiban and abciximab. These drugs have been shown to reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients undergoing high-risk PCI.4, 5 The use of tirofiban at a dose at 10 mcg/kg bolus followed by an infusion of 0.15 mcg/kg/min during PCI has been evaluated in two large multicentre trials with controversial results suggesting inferior outcomes compared to abciximab, the first agent of its type produced for commercial use.6, 7 It has been hypothesised that an inferior clinical result has been the result of subtherapeutic platelet inhibition due to an inadequate initial bolus dose of the drug.7-9 A bolus of 25 mcg/kg has been suggested as providing improved platelet inhibition. There is limited experience with the use of this drug at this dose, in combination with low molecular weight heparin during PCI. Methods: This study determined the degree of receptor antagonist induced GP IIb/IIIa receptor blockade with &#145;high dose&#146; (25 mcg/kg bolus) tirofiban (HD-tirofiban) as measured with a point-of-care platelet function assays using whole-blood platelet aggregometry. Additionally the effect of the drug on platelet activation markers including platelet expression of P-selectin and factor V/Va, monocyte expression of MAC-1, platelet monocyte aggregates (PMA) and platelet derived micro particles (PDMP) was determined from venous blood samples using by flow cytometry. Secondly, the study established the effect of HD-tirofiban therapy in PCI on platelet expression of CD40 ligand (CD40 L), soluble CD40 ligand and other inflammatory biomarkers such as von Willebrand factor (vWF), highly sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer. Finally, the study sought to evidence that low molecular weight heparin is superior compared with unfractionated heparins during percutaneous transluminal coronary intervention with GP IIb/IIIa receptor blockade by comparing measures of thrombus generation and biomarkers of inflammation. Results: A total of 60 patients undergoing high-risk PCI were enrolled in the study with 30 patients randomly assigned to receive HD-tirofiban with unfractionated heparin (UFH) and 30 patients receiving HD-tirofiban with enoxaparin. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups with all procedures beingconsidered successful and no major adverse events being reported. Platelet inhibition as assessed by whole blood aggregometry following HDtirofiban infusion was similar in both the UFH and enoxaparin groups. Consistently high levels of platelet inhibition using this novel dosing strategy were achieved with 94% of all patients achieving &gt;80% inhibition as assessed by whole blood aggregation at 10 minutes after administration. Compared to healthy controls, elevated levels of CD40 L were obtained at baseline and these were significantly reduced following PCI with HD-tirofiban and either heparin or enoxaparin. Similarly, post PCI there were significant reductions in other markers of platelet activation including P selectin, MAC-1, PMAs, PDMPs, and factor V/Va as determined by analysis of venous blood samples using flow cytometry. Inhibition of the coagulation cascade during PCI was more effective with enoxaparin than UFH as indicated by prothrombin fragment 1+2 and D-dimer levels which were less post PCI in the enoxaparin group compared to those patients receiving UFH. In addition, the enoxaparin group demonstrated lower levels of inflammatory markers compared to UFH after PCI. vWF levels and CRP were significantly less in the enoxaparin group when compared to the patients undergoing PCI with UFH. There were no major bleeding episodes noted in this study. Conclusion: HD-tirofiban provides consistently high levels of platelet inhibition soon after bolus infusion when combined with UFH or enoxaparin. This anticoagulation regime is associated with a significant reduction in elevated levels of CD40 L expression on platelets and soluble CD40 ligand in the plasma. This suggests that HD-tirofiban may have an effect to modulate the athero-thrombotic process beyond simply inhibiting platelet aggregation. One of the long-term mechanisms by which GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors reduce mortality may be explained by their effect on CD40 L. Finally, evidence was found that enoxaparin was a more effective anticoagulant than UFH. It was associated with reduced thrombus formation coupled with an attenuated inflammatory response compared to UFH.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158473</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IRIS: Integrated Referential Intensional Semantics</field><field name="creator">Omar, Ramy</field><field name="description">This thesis puts forward a semantic theory for the declarative aspects of natural language.

The families used in this study were ascertained through the Kathleen Cunningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer (kConFab). Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) analysis of the coding regions of these three genes was conducted in the index cases of a subset of non-BRCA1/BRCA2 breast cancer families. An additional 253 and 336 index cases from non-BRCA1/BRCA2 breast cancer families were screened for two previously reported breast cancer susceptibility alleles in BRIP1/BACH1 (p.P47A and p.M299I) and for putative pathogenic variants found in ATR, respectively. DHPLC analysis of the BRIP1/BACH1 gene identified one protein truncating variant, as well as four missense variants, a silent change and a variant in the 3' untranslated region. The two previously reported BRIP1/BACH1 mutations were not found in the 253 non-BRCA1/BRCA2 index cases screened. Mutation analysis of EIF3S6/Int-6 identified five novel variants, of which only one was located in the coding region, and another was predicted to affect splicing. Five missense variants, five silent changes, a predicted splicing variant and a large number of intronic variants were found in ATR. Apart from weak support for the ATR c.4846 T&gt;G (p.S1616A) variant, analysis of the truncating, missense and splicing variants of BRIP1/BACH1, EIF3S6/Int-6 and ATR in relatives of the index cases, and in a panel of controls, found no evidence of pathogenicity. There is no evidence that highly-penetrant germline mutations in BRIP1/BACH1, EIF3S6/Int-6 and ATR contribute to familial breast cancer susceptibility, although the ATR c.4846 T&gt;G (p.S1616A) variant may represent a low risk susceptibility allele. Large scale association studies will be necessary to determine whether any of the polymorphisms identified in these genes contribute to breast cancer risk.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158688</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of workplace stressors and employee adjustment: An organisational culture perspective.</field><field name="creator">Newton, Cameron John</field><field name="description">Occupational stress research can be characterised as embarking on a new chapter driven by varying work environments and job characteristics that have resulted from increased globalisation, changing socio-political developments, and technological advancement. Consequently, there is a need to ensure that theories of occupational stress remain relevant and current with respect to modern organisations and their employees. This situation has prompted researchers to propose new theoretical perspectives and methodologies in order to facilitate a better understanding of the work stressor-employee adjustment process in organisations. In this respect, researchers have identified the need to investigate the role of broader contextual factors within the dynamic transaction between the individual and the environment in order to more fully understand the occupational stress process (e.g., Cooper, Dewe, &amp; O&#146;Driscoll, 2001). One such potential moderator is organisational culture (i.e., the guiding assumptions, shared values, and artefacts that are representative of an organisation; Schein, 1985). Organisational culture has been referred to as an influential organisational force, pervasive and powerful (Howard, 1998). However, a review of literature reveals caveats in the knowledge of organisational culture and its relative influence on the experience of work stressors and the adjustment of employees. Research has yet to extensively examine the work stressor-employee adjustment relationship as a function of organisational culture. In this thesis, it is posited that different types of organisational culture might be associated with different stressors that influence employee adjustment. Such a proposition adds another dimension to existing occupational stress research. Overall, this thesis sought to investigate the relationships between organisational culture, workplace stressors, and employee adjustment. In order to conduct this research, Study 1 employed primarily qualitative methodology to initially explore potential differences relating to organisational cultures and workplace stressors. To further explore the potential relationships identified within Study 1, quantitative data (combined from three organisations) formed the basis for three separate sets of analyses presented in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Each study is briefly reviewed below. First, interview data was collected from six organisations representing the four organisational cultures (N = 77) identified by the Competing Values Framework (CVF: Quinn &amp; Rohrbaugh, 1983); a framework that combines two axes (structure - flexibility vs. control, and focus - internal vs. external) to create four organisational culture types. This study aimed to determine whether manifestations and perceptions of work stressors differed as a function of the four organisational cultures. For each culture type, between 13 and 24 employees were interviewed. The results revealed that work stressors within organisational cultures were manifested as a function of the primary organisational values, and that human relations culture stressors were additionally related to others not abiding the primary workplace values. Further, results revealed that several employees (within the flexible-type cultures especially) described workplace events more as a challenge than stressful, and that these employees reported a similarity between themselves and the organisation. These findings suggested that a person&#146;s fit or congruence with the organisational culture might be an important facet of the investigation of organisational culture, perceptions of work stressors, and employee adjustment. This exploratory investigation informed the three separate sets of analyses conducted in Study 2 of this thesis which were all based on combined data collected from three participating organisations (N = 256). First, Study 2a sought to further investigate the relationships between organisational culture, work stressors, and employee adjustment using questionnaire methodology in a sample of employees drawn from three different organisations (N = 256). Employees were grouped based on their dominant perceptions of flexible (i.e., human relations and open systems) and control (i.e., rational goal and internal process) organisational cultures. It was predicted that perceptions of a flexible culture would be associated with more favourable levels of organisational, job, and social stressors, as well as employee adjustment (employee health and job-related attitudes), compared to the group of employees who perceived their workplace to be high on control characteristics. Results of MANCOVA analyses in Study 2a revealed that ratings of organisational stressors (e.g., lack of resources) and social stressors (e.g., interpersonal conflict), and job-related attitudes (e.g., job satisfaction, organisational commitment, intentions to leave) were significantly more favourable for those perceiving flexible- compared to controltype organisational cultures. A significant multivariate effect was not found for job stressors or employee health; however, mean levels for all stressor and employee adjustment outcomes were more favourable in flexible- than control-type organisational cultures, overall. Responding to the themes of Study 1 relating to the notion of person-environment fit, Study 2b investigated the extent that person-organisation value congruence predicted employee adjustment. Drawing on scant research, it was first expected that highendorsement congruence of person and organisational values would be associated with higher levels of job-related attitudes. Extending the scope of existing research, Study 2b also sought to determine the effects of value congruence on psychological health and physiological stress-related symptoms. Providing some support for hypotheses, polynomial regression analyses revealed that congruence effects associated with jobrelated attitudes were generally most favourable for high-value endorsement congruence. This effect was not replicated with respect to psychological health, which was highest for only very high and very low value endorsement congruence. Overall, support for value congruence effects was relatively weak. Lastly, Study 2c further examined the &#145;person-organisation match&#146; theme and investigated the effects of direct perceptions of fit (i.e., subjective fit) with organisational goals and values. It was predicted that higher perceptions of subjective fit with the organisation&#146;s values and goals would mitigate the effect of work stressors on employee adjustment. The results revealed considerable support for the buffering effects of high subjective fit on the negative impacts of work stressors on psychological health, physiological symptoms, job satisfaction, and intentions to leave. Interestingly, results also revealed that the buffering effect favoured those perceiving low subjective fit on psychological health; those perceiving high subjective fit were not protected against the effects of perceived lack of training on their psychological health, suggesting that perceptions related to feeling under-trained had a more deleterious psychological impact on those who perceived themselves to fit within the organisational culture. This unexpected result is discussed in terms of a possible perceived breach of psychological contract for those perceiving high subjective fit with the organisational culture. Overall, the results of this program of research have several significant theoretical implications. First, the results demonstrate the considerable influence of organisational culture on work stressor-adjustment relationship as described by transactional theories of stress and coping (e.g., Lazarus, 1990; Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984). Indeed, this thesis provides evidence suggesting that organisational culture can have an influence on both perceptions of work stressors and employee adjustment. Second, whilst supporting the existence of the four CVF organisational cultures, the results also indicated that perceptions of flexible- and control-type cultural values were most influential on the work stressor-adjustment relationship. Lastly, the results of this thesis extend the scope and application of person-environment fit theories relating to value congruence and subjective perceptions of fit. As such, the findings suggest that an important element in the investigation of organisational culture and employee adjustment is the degree to which the individual matches the underlying cultural values and goals.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158151</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INFANTS&#146; PERCEPTION OF MOVING HUMAN BODIES</field><field name="creator">Christie, Tamara</field><field name="description">There are three levels of knowledge for the human body instantiated in the adult brain: sensori-motor knowledge which is defined as an on-line representation of one&#146;s own body in space; visuo-spatial knowledge which is defined as a structural description of the human body and its parts; and lexical-semantic knowledge which is instantiated in the verbal system and includes such information as names of body parts, their functions, and so forth.

Based on the finding that the superior temporal sulcus (STS) responds more strongly to moving than static body stimuli (Beauchamp et al., 2002), it was hypothesised that infants would recover interest to moving body stimuli at an earlier age than static body stimuli. Six-, 9- and 12-month-old infants were habituated to typical body shapes and then presented with scrambled body shapes whereby the limbs were in the incorrect location (e.g., arms appearing to &#147;grow&#148; out of the head of the pictured adult). All body stimuli in this experiment were animated such that the limbs moved constantly back and forth. Results revealed that infants were sensitive to violations of the human body shape from 9 months of age when the bodies were animated (cf. 18 months for static; Slaughter &amp; Heron, 2004). A control experiment in which nonbodily motion was incorporated into the stimuli, ruled out the possibility that 9- month-olds discriminated scrambled from typical human bodies simply because the displays involved motion. A subsequent study assessed infants&#146; ability to discriminate between typical and scrambled bodies when the body stimuli were real &#147;live&#148; moving humans. The results showed that 4- and 6-month-olds were sensitive to the transition from typical to scrambled bodies when the bodies were real and moving (cf. 9 months for static and real; Heron &amp; Slaughter, 2004). Next, a video control study was conducted using a videotaped version of the real moving bodies experiment as body stimuli. The 6- month-olds failed this task thus ruling out the possibility that the infants were simply responding to the awkwardness of the joins rather than the scrambled body shape. The findings across this series of studies demonstrated that movement contributes over and above realistic cues to visuo-spatial knowledge, possibly because of STS activation and involvement of the mirror system, both of which are discussed. A further aim of the thesis was to determine whether or not sensori-motor and visuo-spatial representations for the human body interact during the first 15 months of infancy, as they do in adults. Infants aged between 6 and 15 months were assessed on their motor ability, motor activity, imitation skill, and their sensitivity to violations of the human body shape in animated and static bodies. No significant correlations were found between the sensori-motor and visuo-spatial tasks, thus the results of thisexperiment found no evidence for a link between sensori-motor and visuo-spatial knowledge during infancy. Hence, it was concluded that sensori-motor and visuospatial systems may develop as distinct systems that come together later in development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158689</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE COTTON APHID APHIS GOSSYPII IN AUSTRALIA: PETROLEUM SPRAY OILS, ENDOSYMBIOTIC FAUNA AND HOST-PLANT INTERACTIONS</field><field name="creator">Najar-Rodriguez, Adriana</field><field name="description">The research reported in thesis was designed to (1) determine the efficacy of a petroleum spray oil (PSO) against the cotton aphid, A. gossypii and the main mechanism(s) behind its efficacy at killing aphids, and (2) develop a more detailed understanding of the host plant related ecology of A. gossypii. The ecological focus is on the behaviour of A. gossypii and relates to (a) the endosymbiotic floral composition across A. gossypii samples associated with two major plant groups (Malvaceae and Cucurbitaceae) and (b) the host plant finding and acceptance processes relative to the patterns of host-plant use on these hosts. These plant groups were selected for this purpose as most of the economically important host plants reported for the aphid belong to one of these two families, and aphids from these different plants have different insecticide resistance patterns from one another and reduced fitness on the alternative hosts. First, I assessed the potential of the PSO for use against A. gossypii. These assessments evaluated (a) the efficacy of direct applications of oils on aphid mortality and on their behaviour at the time that the oil makes contact with the aphids; and (b) the effects of the deposits of the PSO on the acceptance of cotton as host plant by the aphids, as well as on aphid mortality rates and the success of winged aphids in the establishment of colonies. Overall, the results show that both direct applications of the oil and the oil deposits left after application are highly effective in killing cotton aphids. Their impact is greatest early in the season when aphid numbers are relatively low. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that the PSO does not kill insects by suffocation, which is the widely claimed mechanism attributed to PSOs, but by a method that relates to its liphophylic properties. It includes a rapid penetration through the insect cuticle followed by accumulation in lipid-containing tissues, mainly those of the central nervous system, and finally penetration of the nerve cells themselves, with the subsequent disruption of normal nerve functioning. In the second part of the thesis, the relationships between the bacterial associations of populations of A. gossypii across different host plants (Malvaceae vs Cucurbitaceae) and across geographical localities in Australia and Japan were investigated. The results provide clear evidence of some degree of genetic structure within A. gossypii lineages across Australia and Japan with respect to their host plant of origin and that this structuring does not seem to be driven by the bacteria associated with the aphids. Finally, the A. gossypii alate behaviour in relation to their localization of host plants and their host acceptance processes across the two main host plant families (Malvaceae vs Cucurbitaceae) was characterised. The results show there is also behavioural differentiation across the two host-associated A. gossypii lineages tested that includes (i) differential performance of the alates from each lineage in terms of their landing and settling preferences and in terms of their fecundity (i.e. production of nymphs) and subsequent colony establishment (i.e. nymphal survival and development), and (ii) differential sensory abilities in their responses to plant-derived odours. Here the case is made that these lineages could well be separate biological identities, as suggested previously in the literature The results are discussed in relation to (1) the integration of PSO&#146;s into IPM strategies designed to control A. gossypii and the identification of future research prospects for A. gossypii ecology relevant to pest management and (2) interpreting the species status of the two host-associated A. gossypii lineages studied here.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158690</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE MEANING AND PLACE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN THE LIVES OF YOUNG MUSLIM WOMEN</field><field name="creator">Knez, Kelly</field><field name="description">Little is currently known about the place and meaning of physical activity in the lives of young Muslim women. The limited research that has been conducted in this area has tended to identify young Muslim women with a single (and often narrow) interpretation of Islam. This has resulted in a failure to consider the different and diverse ways in which young Muslim women shape their subjectivities through negotiating, resisting and/or taking up the different and often complex discourses within Islam. Additionally, previous research has mostly focused upon young Muslim women&#146;s apparent barriers to physical activity engagement, often citing religious clothing and the need for gender segregation as reasons for &#145;non participation&#146;. Whilst clothing and gender segregation are important considerations for many young Muslim women, they are not necessarily relevant for all young Muslim women or have a consistent impact across Muslim women. Indeed young Muslim women living in contemporary Western society move through a variety of social spaces on any given day. Consideration therefore must be given to the to the different ways in which discourses such as gender, ethnicity, heteronormativity, healthism and popular culture intersect with the way in which young Muslim women make meaning of and engage in physical activity. Thus this thesis sought to explore the meaning and place of physical activity in the lives of ten young Muslim women as they moved across home, school, recreational spaces and their religious practices. Ten young Muslim women, who attended two different state high schools in an Australian capital city, were each interviewed seven times over a two year period. Using semi-structured interviews, the young women were asked to speak about an array of topics including physical activity, health, fitness, families, school, friends, bodies, Islam, ethnicity and popular culture. These interviews were augmented through the use of diaries, maps, photos and magazines. Whilst in this instance, concerns surrounding confidentiality prevented the diary, photo and mapping artefacts from being analysed in their own right, the discussions which were stimulated by these proved in many cases to be just as valuable. The use of these varied data collection methods however, allowed for the participants to have more freedom to tell their own stories when compared with traditional structured interviewing. All interviews were transcribed by the author and the data analysed using both an interpretive and discourse analysis. It is argued that researching young Muslim women and physical activity in postmodern times requires a flexible theoretical perspective which allows for a focus on the gendered experiences of the young participants, a complex and layered theory of difference and an understanding of how their subjectivities were constructed by social structures, power and discourse. For these reasons, feminist poststructuralism was the chosen methodology as it offered a framework and tools to assist in the understanding of how the participants negotiated discourse in order to take up different ways of understanding and engaging in physical activity (see Chapter Three). It also allowed for notions of difference and diversity. The interpretive data analysis in Chapter Four highlighted the varied ways in which all of the young women were physically active. Significantly, the family was highlighted as one of the most important access points for the young women to engage in physical activity. Religious requirements were of little consequence regarding the young women&#146;s participation in physical education, with other factors such as gendered discourses having more of an impact on their non-participation. School sport however proved to be an important opportunity for many of the young women to be physically active in a team environment. The provisions of gender segregated spaces for the young women to be physically active was not a requirement which was spoken about by most of the young women, nor were issues to do with Islamic clothing, except when the young women spoke of others&#146; assumptions of how they believed clothing to impact upon their daily lives. The use of discourse analysis in Chapters Five, Six and Seven allowed for the complex intersections of physical activity with gender, race, ethnicity, religion, heteronormativity, healthism and popular culture to be explored. Indeed this analysis drew particular attention to the different and diverse ways in which the participants shaped their subjectivities and social relations in the context of physical activity and health. Chapter Five for example explored the different ways in which the participants constituted themselves as &#145;young Muslim women&#146;, supporting calls from some researchers for the need to move beyond understanding the hijab as a marker of subjectivity. Despite the re-occurring themes of difference and diversity throughout this thesis, Chapter Six highlighted the significance of dominant feminine discourses and physical activity positioning them &#145;other&#146; than male. Additionally, Chapter Seven revealed the implications of discourses surrounding healthism on both the meaning and place of physical activity in the lives of the eleven participants. Understandings of a healthy body as being slim were expressed by many, as were the moral implications of not having the &#145;correct&#146; body shape, with language such as &#145;lazy&#146;, &#145;unmotivated&#146; and &#145;unattractive&#146; used to describe those deemed to be overweight. The overall findings from this provide an important departure from much existing literature which situates young Muslim women as belonging to a homogenous group and understands their participation in physical activity through a deficit framework. The eleven participants were indeed physically active, in a variety of different ways, within a variety of different locations. Similarly the meanings which the young women ascribed to physical activity differed greatly, depending upon their access to discursive resources such as the media, education and Islam. This study points to the need for a more complex understanding of young Muslim women&#146;s engagement in physical activity by researchers, educators and policy makers. This is particularly important in a post September 11 society where images of stereotypical Muslim women are displayed daily.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158691</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sui Generis Protection of Traditional Knowledge of Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon</field><field name="creator">Vasconcelos, Rosa</field><field name="description">The basic problem addressed in this thesis is the increased misappropriation of traditional knowledge held by Amazonian indigenous peoples and the lack of effective mechanisms to protect that knowledge. This thesis critically examines whether and how, if at all, traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources can be protected. It focuses on traditional knowledge held or shared by different indigenous people. The ultimate aim of this thesis is to present a set of core recommendations for the creation of a regional sui generis regime for the protection of traditional knowledge held by two or more groups of Amazonian indigenous people. The thesis is divided into four parts. Part One introduces key concepts and ideas such as characteristics of traditional knowledge, its cultural significance and its interface with biological diversity. Part Two assesses the desirability and feasibility of protecting traditional knowledge. This thesis presents five reasons why Amazonian countries should protect traditional knowledge. These include the following: improve the livelihoods of traditional knowledge holders and to preserve the cultural integrity of indigenous peoples; promote social equity, equality and non-discrimination; recognize the valuable contributions of traditional knowledge and to promote its uses and development; promote the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity; and ensure compliance with international legal and moral obligations. Part Three of the thesis examines the different ways of protecting traditional knowledge. Firstly, the extent to which the patent regime may be utilized to protect traditional knowledge is evaluated and its limitations in accommodating traditional knowledge protection are identified. Secondly, the more prominent alternative sui generis regimes are examined. This analysis concludes that none of the existing alternative sui generis models provides a solution to the problem of traditional knowledge held or shared by indigenous peoples from different countries. Thirdly, the use of customary law as a means of protecting traditional knowledge is evaluated. The thesis concludes that the use of customary law to regulate access to, and protection of, traditional knowledge is desirable as it can help to protect indigenous peoples&#146; rights, as well as ensure a fairer application of the rule of law. One of the main recommendations of this thesis is that a common set of norms, rules and principles from customary law should be identified and used as the basis for developing a community protocol which should, in turn, be formally adopted under a regional sui generis regime. Finally, the current legal and administrative measures at the national, regional and international levels adopted by Amazonian countries to protect traditional knowledge are critically examined. This examination reveals that the Amazonian countries have made considerable progress in the development of a framework to protect traditional knowledge at a national level. However, there is neither a standard mechanism to ensure the effective articulation of different national regulations nor a mechanism to deal with overlapping of rights recognized and/or granted over the same, or similar, traditional knowledge to different holders. Further, there is no legislation dealing with traditional knowledge held or shared by more than one indigenous people. The current challenge for Amazonian countries is to create a framework to protect traditional knowledge held or shared by more than one indigenous people not only within national borders but also across borders of the Amazon region. Part Four of the thesis recommends that the Amazonian countries should establish a regional and unitary sui generis regime for the protection of traditional knowledge which is owned by more than one indigenous people. Such a regime should be the sole and the exclusive form of protection of traditional knowledge associated with genetic and/or biological resources held or shared by more than one indigenous people. It also recommends that rights over traditional knowledge should be vested in all indigenous peoples owning such knowledge and those who could have supplied the same, or similar, knowledge. In addition, it contains several other recommendations that it is hoped will assist the Amazonian countries to develop a suitable regional regime.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158692</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining theory with practice: governance case study lessons and insights for improving the functioning and decision-making of communitybased natural resource management institutions</field><field name="creator">Pero, Lionel V.</field><field name="description">International natural resource governance trends highlight the increasing popularity of participatory and collaborative governance approaches, in particular community-based forms thereof. While the proponents of community-based governance contend that it is well suited to dealing with the issues that typify natural resource management (NRM), they provide little supporting empirical evidence. As the popularity of community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) institutions increases, so too does the urgency of examining them. This thesis describes a novel transdisciplinary approach to examining, understanding and improving the ability of CBNRM institutions to promote and facilitate sustainable NRM outcomes. Australia&#146;s current regional NRM arrangements require CBNRM institutions in the State of Queensland to facilitate collaborative decision-making between all parties with a stake in the natural resources of their regions. The institutions are also required to promote and facilitate cooperation and collective on-ground action that supports sustainable NRM outcomes. This thesis&#146; research problem is framed by the widespread political and societal expectations that CBNRM institutions will accomplish these requirements, despite little being known about how they function, how they make decisions, and how they are governed. The expectations also appear to discount the social complexities associated with CBNRM institutions promoting and facilitating sustainable NRM outcomes. To compound the research problem, the theoretical discourses relevant to promoting cooperation, collaboration and collective action are fragmented among multiple social science disciplines and sub-disciplines, most of which tend to ignore each other&#146;s work. These issues are explored in this thesis through a critical transdisciplinary social science study of the functioning, decision-making and governance of two Queensland regional CBNRM institutions. The study combines critical ethnography with case study research. A transdisciplinary and deductive research approach is used to integrate interrelated and disjointed social science theory into a coherent and logical conceptual framework, the CIVILS framework, encompassing the following six dimensions: (i) culture; (ii) interpersonal relationships; (iii) values; (iv) institutional credibility; (v) leadership; and (vi) social identity. The six dimensions serve as theoretical lenses for examining, interpreting and comparing the two cases&#146; empirical results. The two institutions&#146; Boards of Directors served as the research informants. The empirical enterprise involved a 12-month longitudinal study that used mixed methods (i.e. a questionnaire survey; followed by three rounds of quarterly interviews with each research informant; and supplemented by participant observation and a review of select documentation) to collect qualitative and quantitative data. Source, method and data triangulation strategies added rigour to the research. Examining the cases through the six CIVILS framework lenses, the thesis shows how social factors have contributed towards the two institutions emphasising NRM outcomes that promote improved agricultural productivity and profitability. The research findings indicate that the case institutions will not succeed in promoting and facilitating sustainable NRM outcomes unless they are able to balance their emphases on private production-based outcomes with meaningful public environmental, particularly ecological and biodiversity conservation, outcomes. Institutional knowledge-transfer and information sharing suggestions and recommendations relevant to each of the CIVILS dimension findings are provided to enhance the two institutions&#146; ability to promote and facilitate sustainable NRM outcomes. These include emphasising the need to: (i) embrace cultural diversity; (ii) encourage pro-environmental practice change; (iii) foster and embed environmental values that recognise the mutual causality of nature and the inseparability of humankind from nature; (iv) maximise opportunities for face-to-face interaction among resource users and between them and NRM science and technical professionals; (v) promote harmonious interpersonal relationships and a common identity through encouraging dialogue, discussion and respect between parties; (vi) ensure equitable stakeholder representation and legitimacy; (vii) promote accountability, transparency, fairness and justice; and (viii) seek, train, appoint and support inspirational leaders as change agents and mentors. The lessons, insights and recommendations contained in this thesis are applicable to CBNRM institutions throughout Australia, and internationally. In summary, this thesis demonstrates the importance of learning from Australia&#146;s current regional NRM arrangements. It also demonstrates the CIVILS framework&#146;s theoretical and practical applicability, including its utility for examining institutional and governance aspects that traditional evaluations, audits and reviews do not normally consider. Finally, by demonstrating the value of transdisciplinary social science research for improving CBNRM outcomes, this thesis calls for an international research agenda that focuses on integrating research from multiple social science disciplines and sub-disciplines so that they may realise their collective contribution to transforming NRM institutions and their governance for the 21st Century.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158355</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of the Impact of Physical Education on the Attitudes and Exercise Behaviour of Lower Secondary School Students in Chiang Rai, Thailand</field><field name="creator">Lekkla, Phitak</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of physical education on the attitudes and exercise behaviour of lower secondary students in Chiang Rai province, Thailand. This study was designed in two phases of investigation. First, a quantitative study was undertaken using a questionnaire given to 500 students designed by the researcher that aimed to ascertain the attitudes toward exercise, exercise behaviours and problems in doing exercise. The aim of the study was to provide preliminary data on the likely aspects of the impact of physical education curriculum on the students&#146; lives. The second phase of the investigation was a qualitative study using an in depth semi-structured interview of 30 active and 30 inactive students selected on the basis of their responses in the first phase. Ten physical education teachers and five school administrators across the range of schools in the investigation were also interviewed. This phase aimed to examine the effectiveness of physical education teaching and learning especially with the implementation of the new PE curriculum. Data from Phase 1 were analysed using a Statistical Packages for Social Sciences for Windows (SPSS for Windows). The second phase was analyzed descriptively from transcriptions of the audio-tapes of the interviews and from these themes and category responses were developed. Inter-rater reliability was obtained. The findings from Phase 1 showed that students thought that PE provided in school was worthwhile for their life. Most students reported that they have positive attitude towards exercise and believed that exercise had health benefits. Also, in Phase 2 most students both active and inactive agreed that PE activities learnt from classes could help them to have knowledge and skills for a healthy lifestyle after they finish school. However, the most salient finding concerned students&#146; knowledge about the basic principles of exercise such as warming up, cooling down, duration and frequency of exercise for health. It is necessary to provide these content on physical education curriculum to fill these gaps. Three major factors influenced students&#146; exercise behaviour. First, students&#146; interests and motivation to exercise. Most of them exercised to have fun, have friends and becauses it was good for their health. Second, the content of PE curriculum provided in PE classes influenced their exercise behaviour. The majority of active students reported that they preferred sport as the first priority. In contrast, inactive students preferred recreation but sports would be their last choice. The last factor was perceived barriers to exercise. Generally, students did not have many barriers to exercise. However, poor sports skills and having to help their parents to do household chores were the major barriers for some students especially for inactive students.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158356</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression of hnRNPs A/B in cancer cells and their roles in carcinogenesis</field><field name="creator">He, Yaowu</field><field name="description">The identification of specific and reproducible biomarkers is critical for the early diagnosis of cancer, which has a profound effect the survival rate of patients. Comprehensive laboratory and clinical evidence needs to be collected to confirm the accuracy of the biomarkers prior to their clinical use. Heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2 and B1 have been suggested as biomarkers for cancer since 1988 when hnRNP A2/B1 overexpression was first linked with the occurrence of lung cancer. Later studies established a correlation between the expression levels of these hnRNPs and other cancers, such as breast, pancreatic, and lymphatic tumours. In this study, the expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, A3, and B1 has been investigated in various cancer cell lines. hnRNPs A1 and A3, in addition to A2 and B1, were found to be overexpressed in some cancer types. However, the overexpression of none of the hnRNP A/B proteins was universal, and their upregulation may be limited to a few cell types, suggesting they may be effective biomarkers for a subset of cancers. The upregulation of hnRNP A/B proteins in tumours and cancer cell lines led to the hypothesis that they are involved in the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer. According to our Western blot analysis, expression of the hnRNP proteins, A1, A2, and B1, is dependent on the cell cycle whereas no significant change was detected for hnRNP A3, implying that the former three are needed during certain cell cycle stages. The results, together with the transcription factor analysis of the promoter regions of the HNRPA1, HNRPA2, and HNRPA3 genes, suggest that hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 may have distinct regulatory machineries and cellular functions although they have high amino acid sequence identity. However, their mRNA levels were unchanged across the cell cycle, suggesting the cell-cycle-dependent expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, and B1 is modulated at the translational level. Previous studies showed higher expression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 in rapidly proliferating cells than in quiescent cells, suggesting a role of these proteins in cell proliferation. Though interruption of hnRNP A1 expression did not result in significant change in the viability of murine CB3 cells, simultaneous suppression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 caused apoptosis in a few cell lines. Consistent with this, suppression of hnRNP A1 or A3 expression in our study in Colo16 squamous cells using RNA interference did not affect cell proliferation, but simultaneous suppression of both caused slow cell proliferation. By contrast, reduction of the hnRNP A2 level alone slowed the proliferation of Colo16 cells. These results suggest that although hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 share some roles in cell proliferation, each of them may have distinct tasks. This conclusion is supported by the data from the comparative analysis of the downstream targets of hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3, which has shown that these three proteins share a limited number of common downstream proteins. The observed impact on cell proliferation of suppressing hnRNP A2 subfamily proteins is in accord with our finding that the downstream targets of hnRNP A2 are overrepresented by genes involved in proliferation regulation, as shown in microarray and real-time PCR analysis. These include cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, p21 and p27, and their regulatory proteins, such as Skp2 and Rpn10. Skp2 controls the ubiquitination of p21 and p27, and Rpn10 links them to the 26S proteasome, the complex that degrades these two CDK inhibitors. hnRNP A2 also regulates the transcription of securin and separin, which are essential for sister chromatid separation during late anaphase. In addition, hnRNP A2 can also influence cell proliferation through cell growth factors, including fibroblast, vascular endothelial, transforming, and insulin growth factors. Our gene array and real-time PCR analysis have shown that hnRNP A2 regulates the expression of these factors, their receptors, or associated proteins such as IGFBP7 and TGFBR2. The data presented in this thesis link the overexpression of hnRNP A/B proteins, in particular the A2/B1 subfamily, in cancer with their regulatory roles in cell division and cell proliferation. Our findings provide mechanistic evidence that these proteins may be a driving force for the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer, suggesting that some of hnRNP A/B proteins may be potential therapeutic targets for cancer. However, further studies are needed to obtain a global view of the roles of these proteins in cancer.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270201 Gene Expression</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158357</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Use of Hepatitis B Surface Antigen-Small as a Vaccine System for Delivery of Foreign CTL Epitopes</field><field name="creator">Woo, Wai Ping Yvonne</field><field name="description">The small envelope of hepatitis B virus (HBV) can self-assembles into virus-like particles (VLPs) and they are highly immunogenic. The use of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) as a vector to deliver foreign CTL epitopes has met with little success due to the constraints of HBsAg stability and secretion imposed by the insertion of foreign sequence into critical regions. In this study, the efficacy of the small HBsAg envelope protein to deliver foreign CTL epitopes using a protective CTL epitope of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was investigated. The strategy of deleting a DNA sequence encoding HBsAg-specific CTL epitopes at different sites and replacing with DNA sequence encoding RSV CTL epitope resulted in recombinant HBsAg DNA immunogens which elicited effector and memory CTL responses in vitro, and RSV protective responses in vivo when these recombinant HBsAg DNAs were used to immunised mice. These data demonstrate the efficacy of HBsAg DNA as a vector for the delivery of disease relevant protective CTL responses. They also suggest the applicability of the approach to derive recombinant HBsAg DNA immunogens simultaneously encoding protective CTL epitopes for multiple diseases. The use of HBsAg VLPs has been used globally as administered vaccine for hepatitis B virus infection makes it an attractive vector candidate to deliver immunogens for other diseases. Since the HBsAg DNAs we tested formed recombinant HBsAg VLPs, our results have implications for the development of vaccination strategies using either recombinant HBsAg DNA or VLP vaccines.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)</field><field name="subject">DNA vaccine</field><field name="subject">cytotoxic Tlymphocyte</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158358</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How much down the ditch? An assessment of N in River La Chaux catchment of Mauritius</field><field name="creator">Chung-Tze-Cheong, Maryse Jeanette Siou-Youn</field><field name="description">In the global strive for improved quality of life, sustainable and clean agricultural production is among one of the priorities. Mauritius, being a small island country, where sugarcane production predominates in the agricultural landscape, is aware of the delicate balance of preserving its fresh water supply, lagoon ecology, and the economic progress. Every year 11,000 tonnes of N is being applied to the sugarcane fields, which occupy 43 % of total land area. The perception that sugarcane production is a potential pollutant to the rivers and the lagoon is felt strongly. Though the findings from samples collected in River La Chaux showed that the N detected was not of agronomical significance, and was just within the threshold value for environmental concerns, refinement to these initial findings was necessary to verify possible undetected peak values, which were not revealed by the simplicity of a lumped model. The objectives of this study are: 1. To define a conceptual model for River La Chaux catchment hydrology, taking into account the water balance, and hence the transport of different forms of N within the catchment&#146;s sources and sinks. 2. To identify the sources and sinks of N, the key parameters which influence their transport in the catchment, through the integration of surface and subsurface hydrology model, where a conventional hydrology model would be limiting because of the complex volcanic geology of the island. The project study focus is to understand the processes of catchment hydrology and nutrient transport in River La Chaux catchment through a conceptual model, and to translate it to a catchment model that corresponds most to the conceptual model. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was chosen and tested for this simulation exercise. It is a physically distributed catchment model that caters for surface and subsurface hydrology interaction, including simulation of crop growth, the transformation processes of N nutrient, and its transport within the catchment. GIS processing facilities were used to define the sub-basins of the catchment into hydrologic response units (HRU), based on topography, land use, and soil type characteristics. The defined HRUs were coupled with the daily time series meteorological data to establish the hydrology components of the flow. This rainfall-runoff model enables simultaneous calculation of lateral and vertical flow through soil profile, in addition to the surface runoff. A commercial crop calendar was also linked to the model to represent the standard cropping practice of cane growers in terms of planting and harvest dates, land preparation, N input and expected crop yield. Since the sugarcane crop occupies 87 % of the catchment, the hydrology model hinges on realistic crop growth simulation in terms of water and nutrient uptake by the crop, and its subsequent influence to other hydrology components like run-off, lateral flow and percolation. Modifications to parameters in SWAT crop database with local values and recent findings in the sugarcane crop modeling improved the simulated biomass and evaporation values considerably. With the problem of incomplete climate datasets, two methods for potential evapotranspiration calculation were tested. The Hargreave method was found to give better potential evapotranspiration (PET) but lower biomass estimate than that of Penman- Monteith method, as it uses only the two predominant parameters: solar radiation and temperature, reducing parameters errors. However, for longer time series simulation Penman-Monteith method performed slightly better, giving satisfactory evapotranspiration and biomass simulation. Calibration of the catchment hydrology was done, using historical data of rainfall-runoff records, and the hydrology components were evaluated for the catchment. The results compared well with those obtained from the lumped model, Hydrology Simulation Program-Fortran (HSPF). It was found that rainfall in the catchment contributed to 14% runoff, 16% lateral flow, and 37% percolation, 31% of evapotranspiration, and 2 % as deep drainage loss. The surface run-off however was much more important in SWAT, and insignificant the deep aquifer loss, as opposed to the findings of HSPF. Comparison of simulated flow with measured flow, using the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency evaluation method, gave values between - 0.39 to 0.14, and the R2 value 0.7 - 0.8, with a systematic overestimation of 30 to 40 % of measured flow. Dilution of the model&#146;s efficiency was exhibited with long term historical data, indicating inherent measurement errors in these data. The model also showed that the upstream catchment boundary does not reflect the groundwater boundary. However despite the unaccounted transmission loss in geological faults and collapsed lava tunnel in the catchment, the majority of the fast moving base flow exits at River La Chaux estuary. The study highlighted the preponderant role of sugarcane crop in the hydrology of the catchment in attenuating run-off, and in ensuring the replenishment of the aquifer. Nutrient transport is mainly by base and lateral flows, which prevail even in dry period. Detailed water balance for each sub-basin revealed the difference in N transport pathways in the sub-basins: Percolation predominates in young lava soils, whereas lateral flow in intermediate lava soils. Erosion is not a problem in the catchment. Simulation results ranked the agronomic importance of N loss as follow: Leached N &lt;17.5%, lateral flow N &lt; 15%, and surface runoff N &lt; 2% of applied N fertilizer. Though the simulated N budget for sugarcane cropping system reproduced relevant N transformation rates, and showed the N sources and sinks in a predominantly sugarcane growing catchment. Insufficient representation of N immobilization by the model was noted for long cycle crop like sugarcane. The findings showed that &#145;wet season&#146; nitrate-N loss could be quite high in sub-basins where lateral flow and preferential pathways like drains were found. During the &#145;dry&#146; season, nitrate transport is negligible. From the &#145;snapshot&#146; sampling, insignificant N contribution of sugar industry to stream water is confirmed, whereas other activities done at the expense of the riparian vegetation seemed to increase N pollution considerably in the downstream area even during &#145;dry season&#146;. However, the hot spots of point source and non-point source N contribution in the catchment went undetected at next sampling point, as the nitrate was well assimilated by the stream, thus pointing to the necessity of research into &#145;untouched areas&#146; like stream ecology and the role of riparian zone, to complete the picture of catchment N dynamics in the future. The model showed how much gone down the ditch, but did not clarify the fate of N in the ditch. On the whole the objectives have been achieved. Better understanding of the flow and N transport pathways of this geologically complex catchment was allowed with the study. The underlying conceptual model of SWAT has been tested for non-point source pollution of the catchment, and can be adapted to Mauritian catchment for hydrology modeling.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158360</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population Pharmacokinetics and Enteral Bioavailability of: Indomethacin in Premature Neonates with PDA and Phenytoin in Neonates and Infants with Seizures</field><field name="creator">Alza'abi, Mohammed Abdullah</field><field name="description">Rational drug therapy is dependent upon an understanding of available data on the disposition and action of the drug in the body. The lack of such data during the infancy period has resulted in direct extrapolation of dosing for infants from children, and also adults. Moreover, drug therapy in neonates and infants is further complicated by the continuous process of development and growth of body and organ functions. Understanding age-related differences in drug disposition and their implication on pharmacologic effects is essential for optimising therapeutic response and minimising toxicity at different stages of growth. In this thesis, a population pharmacokinetic approach has been used to study the disposition of two drugs, indomethacin and phenytoin, used in the treatment of premature neonates with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and neonates and infants with seizures, respectively. Firstly, a rapid and sensitive method was developed for the determination of indomethacin in a small volume (0.025 mL) of neonatal plasma. The method used acetonitrile for protein precipitation and reverse-phase HPLC with UV detection. Separations were performed on a Hypersil C18 column and the methyl ester of indomethacin was used as an internal standard. The assay imprecision was less than 4.3% at 400 to 2000 &#956;g/L and less than 22.1% at 35 &#956;g/L. The inaccuracy ranged from -6.0% to +1.0% over the 35 to 2000 &#956;g/L working range. Calibration plots were linear (r2 &gt;0.999) and recovery was 93.0-113.3% from 25 to 2500 &#956;g/L. Population pharmacokinetic modelling was performed using a non-linear mixed effects approach (NONMEM). Prospective data for indomethacin and retrospective data for phenytoin were collected. For indomethacin a total of 90 premature neonates (227 plasma concentration samples) with PDA were enrolled while for phenytoin, data from 83 neonates and infants (161 samples) diagnosed with seizures were collected. Modelling was successfully performed for both drugs. For the indomethacin study, a onecompartment model was fitted to the data in conjunction with an exponential error model for between subject variability (BSV), and the residual unexplained variability (RUV). Population parameters were: clearance, (CL, L/h) = 0.0166 . (weight [kg] &#247; 0.936)1.54; volume of distribution, (V, L) = 0.484 . (weight [kg] &#247; 0.936)1.41; absolute enteral bioavailability = 0.986, absorption rate constant, KA (/h) = 0.786. BSV for CL and V, and RUV were 57.7%, 45.6% and 45.4% (CV%), respectively. Model robustness, assessed by bootstrapping (n = 500), with replacement, showed less than 3% deviation of all final model parameter values from the mean bootstrap estimates. Complete closure of the ductus occurred in 67% of neonates at different courses of indomethacin therapy. There was no apparent relationship between the plasma indomethacin concentration and the incidence of ductus closure. Variability in biological data between neonates is important in predicting the outcome of indomethacin treatment. In the second study involving phenytoin, a one-compartment model with an exponential error model for BSV, interoccasion variability (IOV) together with a log transform-bothsides RUV model was appropriate. Population parameters were: CL (L/h) = 0.826 . (weight [kg] &#247; 70)0.75 . (1 + 0.0692 . (postnatal age [days] &#150; 11)); V (L) = 74.2 . (weight [kg] &#247; 70)1.0; first-order absorption rate constant, KA (/h) = 0.167; absolute enteral bioavailability = 0.76. BSV for CL and V, IOV in CL and RUV were 74.2%, 65.6%, 54.4% and 51.1% (CV%), respectively. All final model parameter values deviated less than 9% from mean bootstrap estimates (n = 500). Weight and postnatal age were significant independent predictors of CL during infancy. Unlike adults and children, in neonates there was no evidence of non-linearity in the kinetics of phenytoin. The enteral bioavailability of phenytoin was almost 25% lower than in adults, which is important in switching between intravenous and enteral routes. The results of this work extended the knowledge on the disposition of indomethacin and phenytoin in neonates and infants. A new HPLC method was specifically developed for neonatal application. The indomethacin study identified the importance of biographic factors in dosing and predicting the outcome of therapy in premature neonates with PDA. Information on the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin was translated into a nomogram for optimal dosing and more rational prescribing of therapy in neonates and infants with seizures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158361</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ENCODING MICROSPHERE-BASED LIBRARIES USING FLOW CYTOMETRY: A SCALABLE METHOD FOR DIRECTED COMBINATORIAL SYNTHESIS</field><field name="creator">Miller, Christopher Robert</field><field name="description">Multiplexed microsphere-based assays are an increasingly attractive platform for biological applications such as gene expression analysis and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection. Microsphere-based libraries offer several advantages over microarray-based technologies, e.g. flexible library design, improved precision. However, existing optically-encoded microspheres used in flow cytometry are not compatible with the combinatorial split-and-mix synthesis of large libraries, e.g. loss of optical encoding occurs. Therefore, there is scope for the development of a new class of encoded microsphere compatible with both flow cytometry and combinatorial synthesis. A new instrumental technique has been developed as part of this thesis to use such fluorescently-labelled microspheres to produce large oligonucleotide libraries via a directed "sort-and-combine" process. A MoFlo flow cytometer was coupled with a customised sort computer that can theoretically encode up to 16 million sets of microspheres on the basis of their distinguisbble fluorescent properties. Using this sort computer, fluorescently-labelled microspheres can be: (i) decoded to determine which specific nucleotide (dA, dC, dG or dT) is required in the next synthesis step for its associated probe sequence, and (ii) sorted into the appropriate one of four available reaction vessels. Examples of model systems are provided to demonstrate how a microsphere-based assay containing only desired probe sequences could be produced. A novel emulsion-based synthetic route for the production of monodisperse, micronsized organosilica microspheres was also developed during the course of this study. Microspheres were synthesised via a two-step process: (i) acid-catalysed hydrolysis and condensation of 3-mercaptopropyltimethoxysilane (MPTMS) in water, followed by (ii) base-catalysed condensation with triethylamine (TEA). The polymeric species formed during the acid-catalysed hydrolysis and condensation step were characterised by 2 9 ~ i NMR. Acidic conditions were found to promote the formation of watersoluble linear short-chain species, e.g. hydrolysed monomer, dimer and trimers. The addition of TEA initiated a cross-linking reaction of these pre-hydrolysed short-chain species. This resulted in the rapid formation of an insoluble phase of monodisperse micron-sized droplets which continued to condense to form solid particles. Microsphere particle size was found to be dependent upon the monomer concentration and degree of polymerisation prior to TEA addition. Compared to conventional TEOS particles, these microspheres were shown to have a lower degree of crosslinking (r = 1.25), a larger average size (d = 5 pm) and a higher isoelectric point (pH = 4.4). MPTMS microspheres were observed to readily uptake and bind to thiol-reactive fluorescent dyes, e.g. isothiocyanates, succinimidyl esters and maleimides. Confocal microscopy of the dye-labeled microspheres showed an even distribution of dye molecules throughout the interior, characteristic of a permeable organosilica network. Optically distinct sets of microspheres were created by labelling MPTMS microspheres with different loading levels of ATT0488 or ATTO550 maleimide dye. Encoded microspheres were sorted by flow cytometry, and reanalysed to determine the reproducibility of the encoded signal. The encoded signal of each set was shown to be reproducible upon multiple analysis/sort cycles. Unlike existing polystyrene microspheres that are non-covalently encoded via a swellinglentrapment method, these covalently-labelled organosilica microspheres also possessed a reproducible encoded signal after exposure to the reagents and conditions involved in several cycles of combinatorial oligonucleotide synthesis. The robustness of these encoded organosilica microspheres thus enables a broader range of analyses to be performed by microsphere-based flow cytometric assays. Current and future applications of these encoded microspheres exist in the areas of multiplexed biomolecular screening such as SNP hybridization, enzymatic cleavage and RNA-protein interactions. Additionally, the scalable design of the instrumental technique described above can be combined with the four-way sorting capability of modem flow sorters to enable the directed "sort-and-combine" synthesis of oligonucleotide libraries.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158362</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Manipulation of the reproductive system of feral goats (Capra hircus) to increase the efficacy of Judas goats: field methods utilising tubal sterilisation, abortion, hormone implants and epididymectomy</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Karl Jay</field><field name="description">The use of Judas goats (JGs; Capra hircus) to locate remnant animals is a powerful tool for enhancing feral goat eradication efforts, being especially important to some island conservation programs. JGs are goats that are captured, fitted with radio telemetry collars and released. As goats are gregarious, JGs seek out and associate with other goats. JGs are periodically tracked down and any associated feral goats removed. JGs increase the efficiency of removing animals at low densities by reducing search time for hunters locating remnant herds, making JGs indispensable on large islands for detecting remnant goats and confirming eradication. However, current JG methodology falls short of its potential efficacy. Female JGs are often pregnant at the time of deployment or become impregnated in the field; pregnant females leave associated goats to give birth and may remain alone with their offspring for many months, causing downtime of JG operations. Further, male JGs may inseminate remnant females. Sterilising JGs prior to deployment removes these inefficiencies, provided that it doesn&#146;t interfere with normal goat behaviour. Two methods (epididymectomy for males and tubal occlusion for females) are described that sterilise JGs while still maintaining sexual motivation and other behaviours associated with intact animals. These surgeries are straightforward, time efficient, and may be conducted in the field by staff with minimal training. Terminating pregnancy in goats was conducted with PGF2&#8733;, terminating pregnancy from day four of conception until term. Pregnancy termination in female JGs prior to deployment compliments sterilisation of does pregnant at the time of their capture. Additionally, prolonged duration or increased frequency of oestrus in female JGs was hypothesized to increase their efficiency; does in oestrus actively seek out and are searched for by bucks, and are more active than non-oestrus does. Work was conducted to find out how to best induce a prolonged oestrus effect and whether this increased the efficacy of female JGs. Two experiments under controlled, farm conditions demonstrated that oestrus could be prolonged with one or two Compudose-100 implants (single dose 21.1 mg estradiol 17&#946;) or a single Synovex-S implant (200 mg progesterone and 20 mg estradiol benzoate). Two Synovex-S implants failed to significantly prolong oestrus. Single Compudose-100 implants provided the most dramatic effect with oestrus increased 6-16-fold over control treatment, and when combined with 15 mg PGF2&#8733; and sterilisation by tubal occlusion provided an effective means of terminating pregnancy, inducing sterility and prolonging oestrus with a single intervention. Sterilised single Compudose-100 implant treated does showed an 82-fold increase in oestrus activity compared to unaltered does (traditional JGs) that would typically become pregnant during their first oestrus. Single Compudose-100 treated does maintained a prolonged oestrus response until day 140, when the experiment ended. To compare the efficacy of sterile single Compudose-100 implanted female JGs (hereafter Mata Hari JGs) to sterile JG bucks and does a large-scale field trial involving 213 JGs was incorporated into the feral goat eradication campaign on Santiago Island, Gal&#225;pagos Islands, Ecuador. Mata Hari JGs associated with ~1.5 times more males than either sterilised male or sterilised female JGs. There was no significant difference in the probability of any treatment associating with feral does or all goats. Mata Hari JGs caused males to be removed early in the JG phase of the campaign, leaving more females; reproductive potential was limited by the lack of males, evidenced by many non-pregnant does without kids at foot. This is the first use of Mata Hari JGs and it demonstrates that a sex bias in associated animals is possible; other campaigns have shown no such bias. This field study also demonstrated that male and female JGs are equally effective, dispelling previous qualitative assessments which assumed that JG does were more effective than bucks at associating with remnant herds. JG programs are becoming technologically more advanced, however further applications of relevant technologies are required to solve specific inefficiencies and increase the cost effectiveness of JG programs. Given the widespread and deleterious impacts of non-native herbivores to ecosystems and the importance of Judas operations in detecting animals at low densities, sterilisation, pregnancy termination and hormone treatment should be applied routinely in JG (and possibly other species) programs to increase the efficacy of low-density control operations and eradication campaigns.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158363</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ways of Experiencing Sustainable Design in Engineering: A Phenomenographic Investigation</field><field name="creator">Mann, Llewellyn Martin William</field><field name="description">An understanding of sustainable design will be essential for engineers to practice responsibly in the future. It is now also mandated by Engineers Australia&#146;s Graduate Attributes as an essential outcome of Australian engineering programs. What sustainable design means in practice, however, is a contested issue, varying between engineering disciplines, industry sectors and even individual practitioners. How then can both current professional engineers and engineering students learn about sustainable design? This thesis reports on an empirical study to investigate qualitatively different ways sustainable design has been experienced by practicing engineers. The different ways of understanding sustainable design were found using a qualitative research method known as phenomenography. This research method revealed the critical variations in the ways twentytwo practicing engineers described their experiences of sustainable design. By examining the experiences of practitioners having to deal with sustainable design on a day to day basis, a clearer picture of sustainable design in practice was attained. The twenty-two engineering practitioners were interviewed using semi-structured, open ended approach. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, de-identified, and analysed phenomenographically. Five qualitatively different ways of experiencing sustainable design were identified: sustainable design as &#145;solution finding&#146;, &#145;reductionist problem solving&#146;, &#145;holistic problem solving&#146;, &#145;social network problem solving&#146;, and &#145;a way of life&#146;. Descriptions of each way of experiencing sustainable design are presented, including illustrative quotes from the practicing engineers and a hierarchy demonstrating the interrelationships. By understanding the different ways practitioners have experienced sustainable design, recommendations are made for how to both improve the practice of sustainable design and the education of engineering students about sustainable design. Implications for the practice of sustainable design include the need to: &#149; Focus on identifying clients&#146; problems in collaboration with the clients themselves, rather than accepting a set of declared requirements; &#149; Identify and solve all design problems within a larger societal and environmental context; &#149; Understand that different people have different ways of experiencing sustainable design that will influence their actions. Implications for improving the education of engineers about sustainable design include the need to: &#149; See professional development, including undergraduate education, as a combination of developing more comprehensive ways of experiencing practice, and skills development; &#149; Make explicit throughout engineering programs the focus on developing ways of experiencing the practice of sustainable design and engineering in general; &#149; Structure courses and programs around students reflecting on and challenging their own understanding of sustainable design, including from those experiences gained outside formal learning; &#149; Help students to develop more comprehensive ways of experiencing the practice of sustainable design; &#149; Locate skills development within the context of engineering practice; &#149; Develop academics&#146; ways of experiencing sustainable design, to enable them to improve the learning experiences they offer their students. The contribution of this thesis is in identifying the way practitioners see sustainable design practice. This can form the basis of a new model of professional development within engineering.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158364</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE NORTHERN TERRITORY AND AUSTRALIAN ART 1928 &#150; 2003</field><field name="creator">Murray, Daena</field><field name="description">This thesis argues for the substantial place that the Northern Territory, as a site and as an idea, has had in mainstream Australian visual art in the twentieth century. It contends that its presence is the result of two coincident tropes: first, the perception of the Territory as the surviving remnant of Antipodal imagining and, second, its construct as the &#147;essential Australia&#148;. It will be argued that in the twentieth century, notions of the outback, came to reside in the Northern Territory alone, and that Australian artists sought out the Territory as the arena in which these notions might be tested and transformed. Based on the idea that the antipodal journey to the Australian continent has come to a close with the settlement of the Northern Territory by non-Indigenous people, this thesis looks at what Euro-Australian artists have discovered there. Their journeys did not issue in a significance that would galvanise easy identification. The land and its original inhabitants were deemed to defy the usual European ideas of acculturation, where human artifice provides signifiers of &#147;civilisation&#148;. This thesis will explore the configuration of the landscape as pristine - full of promise or foreboding - and the perception of the Indigenous people as alien and vulnerable. It will be shown that the apparent superficiality of acculturation in the outback also led to an interrogation by artists of notions of civilisation, so that human interaction rather than human artifice became its primary signifier. Fundamental to the focus on the Territory has been the trope of the &#147;primitive&#148;. The thesis will, in part, look at how primitivism and its definition have underpinned Australian art discourse, in relation to art produced in response to the Northern Territory by Euro-Australians. In particular, the thesis will look at the essential relationship between primitivism and modernism in the Territory context. It will also address the connection between loss and primitivism, ensuing from the notional conclusion of the journey of promise, and will canvass the attempts to ameliorate such loss. Cultural constructions such as those identifying the Territory as the &#147;essential Australia&#148; provide another context for the development of Australian visual art in the twentieth century, as it shifted from antique European tropes to those made in our own image. These new tropes, ostensibly arising from knowing the land and people, came to be characterised by clich&#233;, especially spiritual clich&#233;. However, in significant ways, visual artists who actually visited the Territory provided nuanced responses to these constructions without jettisoning entirely a desire for spiritual import. Indeed these journeys to the Northern Territory saw the revisiting of spiritual motivations in Australian art by some leading artists, coinciding with those discerned in modernism itself. Through analysing work in a range of modes created by leading Australian artists of European descent, the thesis traces the impact of the Northern Territory in the Euro-Australian imaginary, both as a site of spiritual aspiration and as an arena of social contract. The Northern Territory is identified with Aboriginality in a way that no other part of Australia is. Indeed it is argued here that in the twentieth century there was and still is a cleavage of the Northern Territory from the rest of Australia, as the latter came to be regarded as Europeanised space. This has made contemporary art by non-Indigenous Territorians invisible. As a result of the emergence of the Aboriginal art industry from the 1980s, and the decisions of some Euro-Australian artists to become familiar with the Territory over time, various forms of social contract have been enacted as the basis for art practice post-Cyclone Tracy. This has coincided with and complicated post-modernism&#146;s challenge to mainstream Western art, which had, by the 1980s, reached Australia. The effects of post-modern plurality and &#147;decentring&#148; on the practice of these artists are also canvassed. This thesis concludes with the work of artists resident in the Territory who model a future for non-Indigenous art practice applicable in a broader context.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158365</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE EFFECT OF PREHARVEST NUTRITION AND CROP LOAD ON FRUIT QUALITY AND POSTHARVEST DISEASE IN MANGO (Mangifera indica L.)</field><field name="creator">Bally, Ian Stephen Edward</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to investigate how preharvest calcium (Ca) and nitrogen (N) nutrition, and low crop load during fruit development affect fruit quality and postharvest disease of &#145;Keitt&#146; mangoes (Mangifera indica L). Calcium, N and crop load were chosen because previous research and Gower reports implicate them as major factors in internal disorders, poor colour development, and postharvest disease in mangoes grown in the Mareeba district of Queensland. The symptoms and incidence of the internal fruit disorders seen in &#145;Keitt&#146; mangoes growing in Queensland were investigated to determine their similarity to other forms of internal disorders, and to develop a severity rating scale to assess fruit in later experiments. While the observed disorder in &#145;Keitt&#146; shared some symptoms with other named forms of disorders, not all symptoms were similar. The typical symptoms of patches of watery translucent flesh that breakdown and discharge cellular fluids in the more severe cases, are referred to as &#145;watery-pulp breakdown&#146; throughout this thesis. Watery-pulp breakdown-affected fruit had lower mesocarp Ca concentrations (0.05% dw) than healthy fruit (0.10% dw), but not N, K, P, and Mg concentrations. The severity of symptoms increased as maturity of the fruit increased, and early harvest may be a useful strategy to minimise the disorder. The first nutrition experiment investigated the effects of Ca, N and crop load on fruit quality in 6-year-old &#145;Keitt&#146; trees, between 1997 and 2000. Trees were fertilised with high (&gt;1 kg Ca tree-1 and &gt;300 g N tree-1) or nil concentrations of Ca and N, and natural or 70%-reduced crop loads. Fruit were assessed for watery-pulp breakdown, fruit colour, postharvest disease, fruit firmness, yield and average fruit weight. Although Ca was applied above the normal industry rates, there were no significant increases in fruit-Ca or leaf- Ca concentrations, or response in any of the fruit quality parameters measured. The factors influencing Ca concentrations in mesocarp were shown to be changes in dry matter accumulation and periodic reductions in Ca supply. Fruit from the high N treatment had significantly (p &lt; 0.05) greater incidence and severity of postharvest side disease lesions (mainly anthracnose) but not stem lesions (mainly stem-end rot). The high N treatments also significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced the percentage of yellow skin, and the percentage and intensity of red blush colour in ripe fruit. Watery-pulp breakdown, fruit firmness and average fruit weight were not significantly affected by the high N treatments. Reducing the crop load throughout fruit development significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased the average fruit weights and the incidence of watery-pulp breakdown, but did not significantly affect the other fruit quality parameters measured. Further studies on Ca uptake and distribution were carried out in 3 additional experiments. The effects of Ca supply on fruit quality were investigated in a similar manner to the first experiment, by varying soil-applied Ca. Increased rates (1726 g tree-1 Ca) and more frequent applications (fortnightly) of gypsum were used to overcome leaching. Although soil Ca concentrations at harvest (0 - 30 cm deep) were increased by the Ca treatment, no significant effects were observed on fruit quality. The effect of leaf transpiration on leaf and fruit Ca concentrations was investigated by reducing leaf transpiration with an anti-transpirant throughout flowering and fruit development. Reduced leaf transpiration did not significantly affect mesocarp or leaf Ca, N, P, Mg, K, B concentrations, indicating the balance of transpiration mass flow between leaves and fruit is not a major factor in mango fruit Ca accumulation. Temporal changes in uptake and distribution of Ca during flowering and fruit development were studied using elemental strontium (Sr) as a Ca analogue. Sr and Ca concentrations were not similar during the experiment making prediction of Ca uptake and distribution based on Sr uptake and partitioning unsuitable. The effect of high N in increasing postharvest fruit disease in the first experiment was further studied to confirm the earlier results and to identify the mechanisms involved in this relationship. Fruit with a range of N concentrations were produced from trees fertilised with a range of N rates (0 &#150; 417 g tree-1). The incidence and severity of postharvest anthracnose (C. gloeosporioides) increased as fruit-N increased, with significant relationships between anthracnose severity and exocarp-N concentration (anthracnose severity in sprung fruit = 163.18x2 &#150; 151.85x + 36.987, r2 = 0.97**). High N had a similar effect on the incidence of Penicillium sp., Rhizopus sp., Guibnardia sp., or Epicoccum sp., but not Dothiorella sp. (stem-end rot). The antifungal compounds 5-n-pentadecyl resorcinol and 5-n-heptadecenyl resorcinol were influenced by exocarp-N in two ways. Resorcinol concentrations were lower in fruit with high exocarp-N than low-N fruit, and concentrations decreased faster in ripening fruit with high exocarp-N. The differences in resorcinol concentrations between high- and low-N fruit was strongest in the sprung stage of ripeness, and positive exponential relationships were found between exocarp-N and concentrations of 5-n-pentadecyl resorcinol (p=0.006. r2= 0.92) and 5-n-heptadecenyl resorcinol (p=0.016, r2=0.82). There were also positive relationships between anthracnose severity and 5-n-pentadecyl resorcinol (p=0.003, r2=0.86) and 5-n-heptadecenyl resorcinol (p=0.003, r2 =0.87). No significant differences were observed in exocarp morphology to explain the N effect on postharvest disease incidence or severity. The effect of timing of application of N on fruit quality and disease was investigated in a field experiment on 8-year-old &#145;Keitt&#146; mango trees on which N was applied at flowering, at mid fruit development, 2 weeks pre-harvest, or not applied (control). N applied at flowering and mid fruit development, significantly increased the severity of postharvest Colletotrichum sp. (p&lt;0.05) Penicillium sp., Rhizopus sp., Guibnardia sp., and Epicoccum sp. (p&lt;0.01) in ripe fruit. N applied 2 weeks prior to harvest did not significantly affect postharvest diseases, with fruit having similar anthracnose severity and incidence to the nil-N (control) treatment. Fruit Ca concentrations were not able to be manipulated by imposing field treatments. The inability to easily manipulate fruit Ca concentrations indicates it is unlikely to be an effective tool to manipulate fruit quality in mango. Nitrogen was shown to greatly influence fruit quality, having a major influence on postharvest disease, skin colour and sunburn susceptibility, but not watery-pulp breakdown. Increased N was also shown to reduce concentrations of natural antifungal resorcinol compounds as fruit ripened, making fruit more susceptible to postharvest rots. The sensitivity of fruit quality to N makes management of N a critical tool in managing fruit quality and disease susceptibility. Reduced crop load had a major effect on the incidence and severity of watery-pulp breakdown, indicating tree management practices to maximise crop load will also reduce the severity of watery-pulp breakdown.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158366</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing Healthier Banana roots with mycorrhizae and rhizobacteria</field><field name="creator">Smith, Linda Jane</field><field name="description">Fusarium wilt of banana, also known as Panama disease, is one of the most destructive diseases of banana (Musa spp.) and is regarded as one of the most significant threats to banana production not only in Australia, but worldwide. The causative agent is the soilborne fungus, Fusarium oxysporum Schlechtend.: Fr. forma specialis (f. sp.) cubense (E.F. Smith) Snyder and Hansen (Foc) for which options of control are limited, with no commercially viable means of chemical control. Micropropagated bananas are increasingly being used by the Queensland banana industry. This is because they are the best source of disease and pest-free planting material and productivity on the farm can be greatly improved with their use. However, when planting into soils heavily infested with Foc, these plants have been found to be more susceptible than conventional planting material. It is believed that microorganisms such as bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which are not available to micropropagated plants raised in a sterile environment, may protect vegetative planting material dug from the field. Adding beneficial microorganisms to micropropagated plants in the nursery before planting in the field may provide some protection from soilborne diseases such as fusarium wilt and lead to improved performance. This research was undertaken to identify endophytic and rhizosphere inhabiting bacteria (including fluorescent Pseudomonas spp., Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR), spore-forming and chitinolytic bacteria) and fungal endophytes such as AMF that enhance plant growth and inhibit or reduce the infection of Foc in micropropagated banana plants. It is widely known that suppressive soils exist where fusarium wilt does not reach epidemic proportions. Laboratory results to date support a microbial basis for this suppressiveness. Wilt suppressive sites were located in Queensland and northern New South Wales and roots of banana plants were collected. Rhizosphere root washings and surface sterilised root segments were plated onto solid growth media to isolate both rhizosphere and endophytic bacteria. Bacterial isolates were initially evaluated using various in vitro tests including antagonism on agar, chitinolytic ability, production of fluorescent siderophores when grown on Kings B media, spore production and ability to lyse Foc mycelia using Foc as a sole carbon source. This process assisted with selection of isolates that may have the most biological control potential. Based on these tests 41 isolates were chosen for further investigation. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were isolated from banana roots growing in disease suppressive soils and were also obtained from a culture collection at the Gatton Campus of The University of Queensland. A total of 10 pot cultures were prepared using sunflower as a host plant. Mycorrhizal fungi produced typical intraradical structures (arbuscules, vesicles, hyphae) when banana plants were inoculated with AMF. To assess the biological control potential of bacteria and AMF against Foc, a reliable small plant bioassay system was required. Attempts by various researchers to develop a reliable bioassay have been made in the past however infection of banana plants by the pathogen was inconsistent. The inconsistencies of previous work may microorganisms in the growth of micropropagated banana plants and protection of young plants from disease. However, ability to reduce disease assessed by internal rating of vascular discolouration appears to be influenced by host genotype. While reduction in disease severity and promotion of plant growth was observed in glasshouse trials, this was not observed in field trials at harvest. If plants had been assessed for differences in growth and susceptibility to disease plus nutrient uptake at the early stages of growth following transplanting into the field rather than at harvest, differences between microbial treated and untreated plants may have been determined. In the field, environmental factors such as drought influenced disease development and plant growth of inoculated plants at the race 1 field site at Terranora in NSW, which was not irrigated. Six of the bacterial isolates tested (25, 26, 2bb, 3b-1, 48 and S-5) and two soilborne isolates of Fusarium oxysporum (Calcutta-1 and K17pi) significantly reduced plant height of cv Lady finger at harvest. Six bacterial isolates (4a, 4b, 84, 8-7, 92 and S-24) and AMF isolate LJS1 had no effect on plant growth. A reduction in plant growth following application of micropropagated banana with microbial inoculants was not observed at the &#145;subtropical&#146; race 4 field testing site that was irrigated. Further research is required to understand the influence of microorganisms applied to nursery grown plants on growth under different environmental and soil conditions when transplanted. The results of this investigation illustrate how selected rhizobacterial and arbuscular mycorrhizal amendments applied to micropropagated banana as a pre-plant treatment in the nursery could be used to enhance plant growth and vigour and reduce disease caused by the fusarium wilt pathogen, thereby improving root health in young plants following transplanting. However, further trials are necessary to determine if these microbial inoculants can be practically produced and applied to commercial operations in field soil conditions to improve root health.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300303 Plant Protection (Pests, Diseases and Weeds)</field><field name="subject">620205 Tropical fruit</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158367</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">STRUCTURE AND MOTION WITHOUT CORRESPONDENCES</field><field name="creator">Lehmann, Stefan</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates a novel paradigm to estimate motion and epipolar geometry constraints from orthographic images of a three-dimensional scene. This new paradigm tackles the challenges that conventional correspondence-based estimation approaches are inevitably exposed to, since reliable correspondences are hard to obtain in practice. The estimation problem is solved directly from either image sets or unmatched sets of feature points, without the need for correspondences and without imposing additional constraints on the data. Initially, a technique is proposed that deduces 3D motion information directly from a set of planar stereo images. This method operates in the Fourier domain and is based on the Fourier slice theorem commonly used in computer tomography. The foundation of the underlying theory is in the deployment of an integral projection scheme as a pseudo-measurement model to describe orthographic projection. Three different estimation methods are experimentally evaluated. The most robust approach among them is based on a maximum likelihood rationale and has been specifically designed to cope with distortions in the input data. The two main limitations of the proposed technique are analysed both theoretically and experimentally. They consist of the restriction of the technique to planar 3D scene objects and the limitation of the estimation accuracy resulting from inevitable signal processing artifacts. Both these limitations are avoided when the method is extended to sets of sparse features. It is shown that the epipolar geometry of the stereo configuration and thus the fundamental matrix can be derived from the parameters of interest estimated by the proposed method. The behaviour of the corresponding algorithm is then thoroughly evaluated using both synthetic and real image data.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158368</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Diversity, Culture and Evolutionary Relationships of Bacteria-Like Symbionts of Marine Sponges From The Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="creator">Lafi, Feras Fawzi</field><field name="description">In a comparative examination of the culturable diversity of microbial communities in two sponge species P. clavata, and R. globostellata we found that the bacterial community structure is similar in both sponge species. This similarity confirmed the finding of earlier studies (Webster et al. 2001a) where alphaproteobacteria strain (NW00) was the dominant bacterial isolate in marine sponges Rhopaloeides odorabile from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). At the phylum level Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were present in both sponge species. Most of the Proteobacteria in both sponge species belonged to the alphaproteobacteria and were most closely related to isolates from other sponge species alphaproteobacterium NW001 sp. and alphaproteobacterium MBIC3368. Members of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes divisions of domain Bacteria were also represented in both sponges. In terms of culturable organisms, taxonomic diversity of the community in the two-sponge species displays similar structure in terms of distinct phyla of Bacteria, and at a finer scale within phyla, isolates from both sponges often belonged to the same genus-level monophyletic group. Community structure and even taxonomic composition in the 2 sponge species P. clavata and R. globostellata share significant features with those of other sponge species including those from widely separated geographical and climatic regions of the sea. Now, there are three distinct sponge species from the GBR region known to possess such culturable NW001-like alphaproteobacteria, Rhopaloeides odorabile, P. clavata and R. globostellata. During our examination of the culturable diversity of microbial communities of the marine sponge P. clavata we encountered a co-culture comprising two different organisms isolated using a modified heterotrophic marine agar. This co-culture was found to consist of two phylogenetically distinct organisms. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis has shown that one of these organisms is a member of the domain Archaea (kingdom Crenarchaeota), clustering as a member of the marine group I Crenarchaeota. The nature of the culture medium may indicate that the organism is heterotrophic and aerobic. The other member of the co-culture was shown to belong to of the bacterial domain. Analysis of the the 16S rDNA sequence suggest that the bacterial isolate was most closely related to Kocuria palustris an aerobic heterotroph clustering within the Actinobacteria phylum. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the bacterial member of the co-culture clustered with high bootstrap support &gt;98% in all bootstrap analysis used (Distance, MP and ML). In recent years, molecular ecology studies of sponge microbial communities confirmed the existence of a universal &#147;core&#148; set of microbial community members (Hentschel et al. 2002). We have possibly witnessed the detection of sponge-specific groups such as in the newly discovered Poribacteria (Fieseler et al. 2004). In this study we further support this finding and extended some of the sponge-specific groups to new lineages of similar phylum and level divergence to the one discovered recently. The prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene was used to construct three libraries to investigate the microbial community structure of the marine sponge R. globostellata. Of special interest were those cells such as Poribacteria possessing unusual compartmentalised cell structure similar to or related to the Planctomycetes cell model. We constructed three clone libraries for domain Bacteria and domain Archaea and for the phylum Planctomycetes within the bacterial domain A total of 315 sponge-derived clones were clustered using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and unique representatives of RFLP profiles were sequenced and analysed. This revealed a wide bacterial diversity of 10 phylum-level divisions from both the Bacterial and Planctomycete clone libraries, including a new lineage related to WS3 (Dojka et al. 1998). In the archaeal clone library a member of the marine Crenarchaeota dominated this library with one single RFLP profile similar to other Crenarchaeota found in other marine sponges from different parts of the world. Within the bacterial domain we found members of the phyla Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria (both alpha and gamma subphylums), Planctomycetes, Poribacteria, Acidobacteria, Chlamydiae, and Gemmatimonadetes. A large proportion of the RFLP pattern profiles from the Planctomycetes and Bacteria clone libraries are dominated by Planctomycetes and Chloroflexi respectively. Both clone libraries contained members related to Acidobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes. Statistical analysis such as rarefaction analysis and the abundance curves confidence test suggested a high coverage of the diversity of the sponge microbial community. A fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) study on R. globostellata sponge homogenate revealed that the Chloroflexi was the dominating phylum in sponge homogenate with 99.9% of the total microbial community when compared to EUB mix probe based cell count or 55.5% when compared to total DAPI (4&#146;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) based cell count. The second most prevalent phylum was Planctomycetes accounting for 24.6% of the microbial community when compared to EUB mix probe based cell count and 17.8% when compared to total DAPI based cell count. WS3 related novel phylum WS3-RG was also detected in low numbers with 1.86% of WS3-RG assigned phylum detected when compared to total DAPI count and 3.5% of bacterial cells when compared to EUB mix probe count. Poribacteria were also present in low percentages, 2.44% of bacterial cells when compared to EUB mix probe count or 1.32% of bacterial cells when compared to DAPI count. In the archaeal domain we detected marine grop I archaea (Crenarchaeota) using two probes, an archaeal domain probe and a Crenarchaeota specific probe. Both probes showed that marine Crenarchaeota were in low numbers in the sponge tissue. Archaeal domain probe (ARC915) accounted for 1.2% when compared to total DAPI count and 1.9% of bacterial cells when compared to EUB mix probe count. Crenarchaeota-specific probe (Cren130) accounted for 2.15% when compared to total DAPI accounted and 1.2% of bacterial cells when compared to EUB mix probe count. Also our FISH experiments revealed that EUB mix probes (EUB I, II, and III) represented only 34.4% of the total microbial community when compared to the DAPI count, a much lower percentage than expected.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158369</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular studies on the neuroendocrine regulation of pubertal development in grey mullet, Mugil Cephalus</field><field name="creator">Nocillado, Josephine N.</field><field name="description">This research project was designed to advance our understanding of the molecular regulation of pubertal development in a late maturing fish, using the grey mullet as model species.

The significantly high relative expression levels of muGPR54, muGnRH1, muGnRH2 and muGnRH3 genes in the brain at the early stage of puberty (defined by low GSI, no apparent oocyte development and low, but detectable, plasma vitellogenin) pointed to a coordinated stimulatory role of these genes at the beginning of puberty. Data also suggested that muGnRH1 has the gonadotrophic role. In contrast to the expression profiles observed in the brain, expression levels of muGPR54 and muGnRH1 in the ovary were high at the advanced stage of puberty (characterised by high GSI, yolky oocytes and high plasma vitellogenin), suggesting a role of these genes towards sustaining gonadal development. The high expression levels of mudrd2 in the brain at the early stage of puberty and in the pituitary at both the early and intermediate stages, which correspond to a period of pronounced DA inhibition of reproductive function in grey mullet, indicated the role of mudrd2 in mediating the inhibitory effect of DA. Ovarian expression of muCyp19a and brain expression of muCyp19b increased during pubertal development, which implied the functional relevance of E2 biosynthesis to the pubertal process in those tissues. In conclusion, the results provide evidence that the molecular regulation of pubertal development in female grey mullet is contingent upon the functional integration of the regulatory signals coming from a suite of genes, including, at least, the genes characterised in the present study. The molecular tools obtained and the understanding achieved from the present research work provide basis for further investigations dealing with the manipulation of puberty in late maturing species of fish.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158370</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Locales Framework: Understanding and Designing for CooperativeWork</field><field name="creator">Fitzpatrick, Geraldine Ann</field><field name="description">The key challenge for the Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) community is how best to understand work for the purposes of design, and how best to design systems for the purposes of work. The lack of pervasive use of CSCW technologies despite widespread growth of networked computers, and over twelve years of CSCW research, indicates that we are yet to answer the challenge effectively. We suggest that a significant part of what makes building cooperative work support so hard is that CSCW design is a &#145;wicked problem&#146;, where there are no definitive solutions, and better solutions can only come about through an ongoing dialogue between understanding and designing activities. Thus far, the dialogue has been hampered by an absence of a set of shared abstractions among the stakeholders (designers, sociologists, users, etc.). Traditional computer science backgrounds do not equip designers to deal with the complexity and unpredictability of the social realm. Traditional social science backgrounds do not equip their proponents to translate descriptions of social life to the needs of technological design. This thesis takes up the challenge of continuing the dialogue between understanding and designing by evolving a new abstraction that can facilitate better communication between the two. Against a background of general CSCW experiences with understanding and designing, we report on our first hand experiences of the difficulties in designing and constructing a spatially-based system called wOrlds, and at the same time trying to understand the nature of work for a group of systems engineers for whom the system was to be deployed. This leads us to critique spatial metaphors in general as a basis for design activities and to search for a more appropriate abstraction that can serve both understanding and designing. For this we draw on our own and the general CSCW experiences, and on sociologist Strauss&#146; theory of action. The main contribution of this thesis is to present the Locales Framework and its five aspects of locale foundations, civic structures, individual view, interaction trajectory, and mutuality, as a principled approach that allows for construction of shared abstractions among stakeholders. The Locales Framework is based on a metaphor of place, with &#145;locale&#146; as its primary unit of analysis. &#145;Locale&#146; can function as a shared abstraction because it is constituted in the relationship between the interactional needs of a social world (group of people with shared purpose) and the &#145;sites and means&#146; it uses to meet those needs. Hence, locale only makes sense when we understand both the social and the technical. We argue that the Locales Framework can be used in a two phase approach, to understand social worlds and their locales as they exist now, and to design new or enhanced locales to better facilitate social world interactions. We show the use of the framework by applying it to understand the work of a group of distributed researchers, and for requirements analysis and design of a telehealth system connecting three Intensive Care Units. We also discuss a prototype CSCWenvironment called Orbit in which we interpret the implications of the Locales Framework aspects for generic toolkit environments. Finally, we reflect on the usability and usefulness of the framework, and lay out an agenda for future work for its evolution in the ongoing dialogue between understanding the nature of work and designing systems to support that work.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158474</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydraulic Sorting of Coastal Heavy Mineral Sands</field><field name="creator">Tomkins, Matthew Rowland</field><field name="description">Hydraulic sorting mechanisms responsible for the formation of coastal placer deposits enriched with heavy mineral sands are considered in this dissertation. The likely mechanisms concentrating heavy minerals, as currently formulated in the literature, are evaluated on their own merit as independent sorting mechanisms and in terms of their applicability in the coastal environment. While hydraulic equivalence is a valid conceptual framework to ascertain the likelihood of a particular sorting mechanism, the traditional formulation of equivalence relationships do not often capture the true nature of sorting conditions on the beach. New insight is provided through laboratory experimentation and results from the sampling of beach placer deposits. The sedimentation rate of sand grains in the hindered settling regime has been investigated to assess particle shape effects. The behaviour of various particulate systems involving irregularly shaped sand has been compared with the widely adopted Richardson-Zaki expression using existing published data and new data btained from experiments performed in a fluidisation column. The general form of the expression remains as a convenient means to describe the hindered settling of irregular particles (in the absence of shear). The sedimentation exponent in the Richardson-Zaki expression is however found to be significantly larger for these particles corresponding to an increased hindered settling effect. A simple method to evaluate the sedimentation exponent, and hence the hindered settling effect for sands of various shape is presented with the discussion furthered to consider the sedimentation of multi-component mixtures. The influence of selective entrainment on heavy mineral content in suspension has been studied through the measurement of sediment concentrations above a rippled bed under regular non-breaking waves in the laboratory. The normalized distributions of time-averaged suspension concentrations were found to be similar for the light and heavy minerals, despite their different clear water settling velocities. This is in contrast to the nature of concentration profiles expected under the traditional gradient diffusion process. The observed concentration profiles imply a convective rather than diffusive sediment distribution mechanism. Between the immobile bed and the lowest measurement level, the light and heavy mineral concentration differs significantly. This discrimination at the ripple face is due largely to selective entrainment. The concept of dispersive pressure to sort light and heavy mineral grains and the development of inverse grading for a granular layer under shear is applied to chute flow experiments. In contrast to the traditional view that &#145;shear equivalent&#146; combinations of grain sizes and densities provides no opportunity for sorting, strong particle segregation is observed. For a different scenario, where interlayer particle percolation is restricted, denser grains do not migrate towards the free surface, again in contrast to the response expected under the current shear sorting formulation. Both sorting scenarios are openly suggestive of an incorrect interpretation of the constitutive relations founding the shear sorting hypothesis. Kinetic sieving exists as a more appropriate mechanism.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158475</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Four Interpretations of the Biblical Crucifixion and Resurrection Narratives in the Latin West, c. 350-430</field><field name="creator">Bain, Andrew McEwen</field><field name="description">Traditionally, the exegetical works of the later Latin Fathers have tended to be described and compared in terms of where they fit into the polarity between a &#147;literal&#148; or &#147;historical&#148; reading of Scripture on the one hand, and a &#147;spiritual&#148; or &#147;allegorical&#148; approach on the other. For a large part of the Twentieth Century, the tendency to understand patristic exegesis within the framework of the senses of Scripture was heavily preponderant among scholars, thanks in some measure to the influence of Henri de Lubac and others as well as existing patterns of reading the Fathers. More recently, scholarly interests have diversified, and patristic exegesis has been explored using a wider range of categories. However, concepts such as literalism and allegory still hold pride of place within the field as a whole, even if their preponderance has been substantially lessened in some respects over the past thirty years. Most reference and introductory-level works continue to be dominated by the same old framework, as are many major studies. The majority of monographs that would not go quite this far still give the senses of Scripture in some form or another a substantial place in their analysis. This thesis does not wish to deny that the relationship between the literal and spiritual senses should continue to occupy an important place in future scholarship &#150; after all, this relationship is a substantial part of most patristic authors&#146; own, often explicit, conceptualisation of their exegetical work, as is well-attested. What it does seek to do is to question through a case-study whether the senses of Scripture ought to occupy quite the same central place that they do on the grounds of their usefulness to modern scholars in distinguishing between different exegetical styles. It argues that on questions of where particular authors sit on the literal-allegorical spectrum, the framework of the &#147;senses&#148; is not particularly helpful in the case of the later Latin Fathers because they all tend to be placed in roughly the same place: fundamentally literal, but with significant allegorical tendencies. This thesis therefore argues that what is needed are some additional categories within which the exegetical works of these Fathers can be analysed, distinguished, and discussed. Through an examination of how four major Latin exegetes, Augustine, Jerome, Ambrose and Hilary, deal with the crucifixion and resurrection narratives at the ends of the Gospels, several such additional categories are developed. The most important of these is the &#147;lens focus&#148; of the interpreter: is he primarily focussed on philological details in the text, events and other realities described by (&#147;behind&#148;) the text, authorial perspectives before the text, or something else? Other useful points of comparison which emerge from this case-study include the extent to which each exegete tends towards polysemy (multiple interpretations of the same text) or monosemy, how ordered or otherwise the interpreter is in moving through his text, how free-ranging he is in his choice of comments on the biblical sentence at hand, whether he is inclined to focus on Scriptural prophecy-fulfilment relationships, and how interested he is in practically applying what he has gleaned from his reading to his audience. The thesis concludes that scholarship on the exegesis of the later Latin Fathers would significantly benefit if the senses of Scripture received a little less attention than they have in the past, relative to other factors such as those identified through this case study. Its chief limitation is that its observations and recommendations may not fit as closely to works on other parts of the Bible as they do to the Gospels.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158476</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">COST-EFFECTIVE REDRESS FOR LOW-VALUE INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER TRANSACTIONS: CURRENT STATUS AND POTENTIAL DIRECTIONS</field><field name="creator">Gawith, Daril Jack</field><field name="description">This thesis considers whether cost-effective redress for post-transaction problems with low-value international consumer transactions is or can be achieved by any of the existing or proposed litigation-based or non-litigation-based redress methods.

My goal was to work in an empowering manner with clients to achieve structural change and social justice outcomes. When I entered the workforce, I gained first-hand experience of the reality of statutory social work practice with involuntary clients, but I was faced with the dilemma that I believe confronts many social workers, that is, how to work in an empowering manner in a statutory control role in fields such as youth justice and child protection. I found there was a gap between my framework and its underpinning theories, and the reality of using it in settings of social control. For example, theories that were useful in the context of community development, did not provide guidance on reconciling structural change and social justice agendas in statutory social work. When I worked in the youth justice field, I was fortunate to take part in the restorative justice (RJ) social movement through my work in conferencing. I noted that while social work practitioners were involved in implementing RJ techniques, these techniques were used without theoretical and practice guidance from a social work perspective. The risks of this are that the full potential of social work&#146;s particular adaptation of restorative theory towards structural change goals will not be realized, and further that RJ techniques could be implemented without incorporating social work&#146;s understanding of power dynamics and their potential abuse. My practice experience, combined with my social work and legal training, helped me develop the argument that RJ theory and practice have the potential to enhance empowering social work practice in statutory settings, in the same way they have benefited the criminal justice system. To achieve this potential required an integrated approach incorporating RJ theory and practice into a social work practice framework. To test this proposition I conducted an extensive review of the literature in both fields to identify the relevant RJ theory, then examined its usefulness for dealing with certain core social work issues as informed also by my practice experience. The main findings were that certain RJ theories are useful in this statutory social work context, and this thesis incorporates these findings into an integrated restorative social work practice framework. The next step would be to test the findings empirically by measuring the effectiveness of the application of this framework in practice settings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158478</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic and Environmental Sources of Covariation Among Cognitive Abilities</field><field name="creator">Wainwright, Mark</field><field name="description">The influence of general cognitive ability (g) on the performance of a wide variety of cognitive abilities is well established. The primacy of genetic influences on g (genetic g) also has firm empirical standing. This thesis aimed to investigate the influence of genetic g on a range of measures that had either not been previously investigated or had been indexed in different ways from those used here. In five empirical studies, I investigated: (1) word reading ability, (2) general academic achievement, (3) specific academic achievement skills, (4) chromosomal regions implicated in variation in academic achievement, and (5) the personality construct of Openness to Experience (Openness). Based on previous findings and accompanying theory it was hypothesised that genetic g would exert significant and substantive influence on irregular word reading ability, general academic achievement and specific academic achievement skills, and three particular facets of Openness known collectively as Objective Openness. It was also hypothesised that chromosomal regions reported as pertinent to variation in IQ would be germane to variation in academic achievement. For study 1, data were available from 500 (225 MZ, 275 DZ) twin pairs (mean age, 16 years). Two tests of reading words aloud were employed: the Cambridge Contextual Reading Test (CCRT) which measures irregular word reading skills and the Schonell Graded Word Reading Test (SGWRT) which incorporates both irregular and regular words. IQ subtests were drawn from the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery (MAB) and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R). Heritabilities of 0.54 and 0.65 were obtained for the CCRT and SGWRT respectively. Heritabilities for IQ subtests ranged from 0.47 to 0.65. A genetic general factor accounted for 13% of the variance in the CCRT and 20% of the variance in the SGWRT. Genetic influences of comparable magnitude were found for a genetic reading factor and a genetic verbal factor. The best fitting model suggested that genetic influences were principally responsible for the phenotypic correlation between IQ subtests and word reading, and that approximately a third of this influence was due to genetic g. For study 2, IQ data from 582 (256 MZ, 326 DZ) twin pairs (mean age, 17 years for IQ, 16 years for academic achievement) were analysed. Verbal IQ (VIQ) and Performance IQ (PIQ) were measured using the MAB and general academic achievement was measured using total score for the Queensland Core Skills Test (QCST). A trivariate Cholseky decomposition was used to examine genetic and environmental influences. Heritability of the QCST was estimated at 0.72 incorporating adjustment for truncate selection (upward bias) and assortative mating (downward bias). Common environmental influences were minor, as were unique environmental effects. Strikingly, there was no significant specific genetic influence on the QCST, indicating that genetic g sufficiently explains all genetic variation in total academic achievement on the QCST. For study 3, QCST data from 390 twin pairs (182 MZ, 208 DZ) and IQ data from 611 (VIQ) to 615 (Pairs) were used. IQ data were primarily included to adjust for truncate selection. The influence of genetic g on five specific academic skills which constitute the QCST was examined. Heritabilities of the specific academic skills ranged from 0.44 to 0.73 with limited common environmental influences being evident. Unique environmental influences were essentially specific to each measure. Genetic g accounted for all genetic variation in three of the five academic skills and approximately 90% of genetic variation in the two other academic skills: essay writing and mathematical problem solving. About 32% to 73% of phenotypic variation in specific academic skills was attributable to genetic g. It was concluded that genetic g is of primary importance in variation in specific academic achievement skills as measured by the QCST. For study 4, data from 210 families were analysed in a linkage analysis designed to locate chromosomal regions potentially implicated in variation in academic achievement. Data were analysed using Merlin-Regress to permit adjustment due to truncate selection. While no empirically derived significant or suggestive linkage peaks were observed for total QCST score, linkage was observed for a number of regions recently suggested to be involved in variation in IQ measures. Consistent with recent findings, linkage on chromosome 2 (LOD = 1.26) and chromosome 18 (LOD = 1.25) were observed for PIQ and FSIQ on chromosome 2 and dyslexia on chromosome 18. While empirically suggestive LOD scores for a number of specific academic skills were observed in other chromosomal regions the results were not considered sufficiently robust to warrant firm conclusions. For study 5, data from 754 families were analysed with the aim of investigating the genetic and environmental bases of the relationships among cognitive measures of Verbal IQ (VIQ), Performance IQ (PIQ), educational achievement (QCST), 2-Choice Reaction Time (CRT), and inspection time (IT), and Openness facets from the NEO-Personality Inventory Revised (NEO-PIR). The number of twin and twin/sibling pairs ranged from 432 (182 MZ, 350 DZ/sibling) to 1023 (273 MZ, 750 DZ/sibling) for cognitive measures, and between 432 (90 MZ, 342 DZ/siblings) &#150; 437 (91 MZ, 346 DZ/siblings) for Openness facets. The strongest phenotypic correlations between Openness and cognitive measures were between Ideas and the QCST (0.42) and Values and the QCST (0.32). Openness facets tended to correlate more strongly with verbal measures. However, Values and Ideas accounted for 3% and 8% respectively of variation in PIQ. Genetic g was shown to exert influence over five of the Openness facets (not Actions) as well as IQ and processing speed measures. The strongest influences from genetic g on Openness measures were for Ideas and Values with loadings of 0.51 and 0.38 respectively, thus accounting for 26% and 14% of their respective variances. The best fitting model was interpreted as suggesting that higher levels of general cognitive ability engender a small, albeit discernible tendency toward several facets of Openness. Overall, the five studies showed the primacy of the influence of genetic g on cognitive measures of academic achievement and word reading. Beyond exhibiting a genetic correlation between academic achievement and IQ, the linkage analysis provided evidence that the genetic correlation is due to pleiotropic genetic effects arising principally from regions on chromosome 2. The breadth of influence of genetic g was illustrated with its demonstrable effect on Openness personality variables, particularly the pursuit of a manifold array of cultural and intellectual interests (Ideas), and questioning of conventional norms and receptivity to unconventional values (Values).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158479</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">OMEGA-3 FORTIFICATION OF SAUCES</field><field name="creator">Lee, Kim Lian</field><field name="description">Fish oils containing omega-3 (&#249;3) fatty acids are known to provide beneficial health effects and are added to various foods to improve their nutritional status. This research investigated the challenges of incorporating two types of &#249;3 fish oil preparations into two commercially available fish sauces, namely abalone and oyster sauces, and examining the effects of such additions on sauce properties, acceptability and storage life. The &#249;3 supplements both contained eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The first &#249;3 supplement was refined non-winterised tuna oil and the second was microencapsulated tuna oil in which the oil was contained in microcapsules composed largely of caseinate. Both of these oils were incorporated at two levels of &#249;3 fortification in accordance with the guidelines of the Australian and New Zealand Food Authority Food Standards Code 2004. Fortification increased the &#145;fishy&#146; taste of the sauces, which was: (a) more pronounced in the fortified abalone sauce than in the fortified oyster sauce; and (b) more pronounced in sauces fortified with refined non-winterised tuna oil than sauces fortified with microencapsulated tuna oil. Fortification of the sauces with the latter at the lowest level for a fortification claim of equivalent to no less than 30 mg total EPA and DHA per 30 g serving was found not to cause any significant difference in taste or preference between fortified and unfortified sauces used as controls. However, sedimentation and oil separation occurred. Morphological studies found this the result of disintegration of the microcapsules caused by precipitation of the caseinate in the encapsulation material at the pH of the sauces (4.5 &#150; 5.2). The microencapsulated tuna oil was homogenized under different conditions to reduce the particle and oil globule sizes. The optimum fortification process was prior-homogenising the &#249;3 ingredient in water for one minute at 3000 rpm and adding it at the beginning of processing and cooking together with all other ingredients to a sauce. During a scale-up pilot production, &#147;thinning&#148; (in both fortified abalone and oyster sauces) and dramatic separation (within two weeks of accelerated storage of the fortified abalone sauce) occurred. Image analysis revealed the absence of starch in the separated phases of the fortified abalone sauce. Amylase was detected in the microencapsulated oil and its activity traced to two materials used for its encapsulation. The enzyme had an optimum activity at pH 5.4 and had 10 times higher activity at pH 5.19 (pH of the fortified abalone sauce) than at pH 4.55 (pH of the fortified oyster sauce). A laboratory experiment was carried out to modify the process of the pilot production. The modified process was scaled up for a second pilot production to produce a second batch of abalone sauce. It involved (a) changing the order of adding the prior-homogenized microencapsulated tuna oil i.e. adding it to partially cooked sauce at 85oC instead of adding it at the beginning of processing and cooking with all ingredients to a sauce, and (b) lowering the pH of the fortified abalone sauce from 5.2 to 4.8. The amylolytic effect of the heat-stable amylase during cooking was reduced and this led to marked product improvement and shelflife extension. &#147;Thinning&#148; no longer occurred and the fortified abalone sauce showed no decrease in sensory scores during 32 weeks at 35oC and 46 weeks at ambient. At 64 weeks at ambient the product still appeared stable, i.e. the Q10 was 2. No loss in total EPA/DHA was found. In contrast, the fortified oyster sauce of the first pilot production showed decreases in viscosity and sensory scores during storage and reached the end of its shelf life at 12.5 weeks at 35oC and 26 weeks at ambient, i.e. the Q10 was 2.1. There was a near complete loss in total EPA and DHA content. In a study to replace citric acid with ascorbic acid to serve the possible multiple functions of acidification, antioxidation and nutritional enhancement, 0.16 % ascorbic acid in fortified abalone sauce accelerated sauce separation. Its incorporation in abalone and oyster sauces (0.16% - 0.5%) reduced the Rancimat induction periods by 3- 21 times, compared with the respective sauces containing citric acid used as controls. Of the two sauces fortified, the fortification of oyster sauce was found to be less demanding. There were fewer taste, appearance and stability problems, attributed to the sweeter characteristics of the oyster sauce which helped to mask the fishy taste. The use of caramel as a second thickener also made &#147;thinning&#148; due to starch hydrolysis by amylase less pronounced. By comparison, fishy odour and taste were more detectable in the fortified abalone sauce due to the inherently fishier and less sweet characteristics of this sauce. This sauce was also more prone to separation as it depended primarily on starch as a thickener. The above findings would be of benefit to the sauce industry. Particularly, the optimal fortification process would reduce costs and wastage for any manufacturer planning to embark on &#249;3 fortification of sauces. Furthermore, various aspects of the above findings should be of interest to the food industry as a whole. For example, the finding that losses in total EPA &amp; DHA paralleled reduction in viscosity would assist low viscosity food processors to pre-empt problems arising from losses of the &#249;3 fatty acids when embarking on &#249;3 fortification.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158480</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defining the Membrane Organisation of Eukaryotic Proteins</field><field name="creator">Davis, Melissa Jane</field><field name="description">The property of membrane organisation captures the relationship of a protein to cellular membranes and is defined by the presence of signal peptides and transmembrane domains in the protein sequence. The membrane organisation of a protein will influence the way the protein is sorted by the cell, and constrain its eventual subcellular distribution. I have developed a computational pipeline, MemO, to automatically annotate the membrane organisation of entire proteomes from eukaryotic organisms, using high-confidence consensus algorithms to generate annotation of membrane, secreted and soluble proteins. In the pipeline, eight independent methods are used to generate raw data for the consensus algorithms, with specific attention to addressing issues of conflict between predicted features. The use of consensus methods rather than single prediction methods results in a highly reliable prediction pipeline that has been designed to generate biologically useful annotation. The MemO pipeline has been applied in a range of biological contexts, including functional genomics, developmental biology, cell biology, computational cell biology and comparative genomics. Specifically, three applications of the pipeline are explored, describing my use of MemO as an annotation tool, as a technique for target selection from expression array analysis, and as a tool to compare the properties of eukaryotic proteomes. Application of MemO to the mouse proteome, as recently defined through the sequencing of the mammalian transcriptome, lead to the discovery of considerable diversity in the use of signal peptides and helical transmembrane domains. It was observed that variation in transcripts, caused by variation in transcriptional start and stop locations and alternative splicing, resulted in the variable use of these features, with often dramatic impact on the resulting membrane organisation and subcellular location of the protein products. As a result of these observations, I analysed the variable use of genomic regions encoding these features in a set of &gt;8000 transcriptional units where two or more protein products were produced. I discovered that 39% of these transcriptional units containing predicted signal peptides also demonstrated differential use of this feature, while two thirds of transcriptional units that also contained predicted transmembrane domains either used variable genomic regions to encode transmembrane domains, or varied the number of transmembrane domains present, while 35% also encode a soluble protein. As multiple prediction methods are increasingly marshalled to provide insight into the function of unknown proteins, including the use of methods to detect protein domains and family membership, conflicts between predictions can sometimes occur. The observation that some domains known to be soluble contained predicted transmembrane domains led me to explore the extent of this problem. I discovered a set of soluble protein domains that confound transmembrane domain prediction methods and cause systematic errors in the annotation of membrane proteins across whole proteomes. I developed a method for resolving these contradictions based on the conflict profiles of the competing predictions, and established guidelines for resolving conflicts within more structurally diverse protein families. The result of this analysis provides a strategy for improving membrane protein prediction by identifying false positive predictions in domains that do not span the membrane. In conclusion, this work focused initially on the development of the MemO pipeline, which now provides a method for generating high confidence membrane organisation annotation in very large eukaryotic data sets. Then, the differential use of signal peptides and transmembrane domains in the variable protein products of transcriptional units was explored and characterised, and conflicting predictions between transmembrane domains and protein functional domains and families were explored and resolved. This work highlights the importance of predicting multiple features and resolving the resulting conflicts to characterise protein function, as the prediction of single features in isolation can be misleading. The work also highlights a surprising diversity in membrane organisation of proteins products and the extent of variable use of genomically encoded features in the mammalian proteome.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158481</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding The Role Of PPAR&#225; In The Regulation Of Lipid And Carbohydrate Metabolism In Skeletal Muscle Cells</field><field name="creator">Pippal, Jyotsna</field><field name="description">Nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) are agonist-dependent transcription factors that translate nutritional and physiological signals into gene regulation. The significance of NRs in human health is highlighted by the variety of medicinal drugs associated with dysfunctional hormone signalling, in the context of inflammation, endocrine and metabolic diseases (including dyslipidemia and diabetes). A subgroup of the NR family controls metabolism in a tissue/cell specific manner. For example, the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPAR) subgroup comprising PPAR&#225;, &#226;/&#228; and &#227; isoforms, regulate lipid storage, adipogenesis and lipid catabolism in an organ specific manner. For example, agonists such as the hypolipidemic&#150;fibrates and insulin sensitizer-thiazolidinedione (TZD), that modulate PPAR&#225; and PPAR&#227; respectively, have utility in the treatment of dyslipidemia and diabetes, respectively. Many NRs are expressed in skeletal muscle, a major mass tissue that accounts for ~40% of the total body mass and energy expenditure. This lean tissue is a major site for lipid mobilization and catabolism, cholesterol efflux, and insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. Moreover, this tissue expresses &#145;cytokines&#146; that regulate adiposity, and energy expenditure, in a process that involves reciprocal signalling between adipose tissue and muscle. Therefore, this peripheral organ plays a critical role in insulin sensitivity, the blood lipid profile, and energy balance. Accordingly, skeletal muscle has an important role in the progression of dyslipidemia, diabetes and obesity. Further, several studies demonstrate that NRs in muscle regulate carbohydrate, lipid and energy homeostasis. Therefore, NR and skeletal muscle are therapeutic targets in the battle against metabolic disorders. PPAR&#225; is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle, surprisingly, the precise role and function of PPAR&#225; in skeletal muscle cell metabolism has not been examined. Nevertheless, given the utility of hypolipidemic fibrate drugs, and the contribution of muscle to lipid homeostasis, the role of PPAR&#225; in skeletal muscle needs to be further investigated. Correspondingly, the objective of this study was to examine the differential effects of clinically utilized fibrates on metabolic gene expression in skeletal muscle cells. Furthermore, we were interested in identifying the molecular mechanisms that mediated the agonist specific effects on gene expression. Consequently, we utilized a number of clinically used hypolipidemic fibrates including fenofibrate, clofibrate, ciprofibrate and gemfibrozil to demonstrate that PPAR&#225;, can functionally regulate genes involved in lipid and carbohydrate homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells. We demonstrate that fenofibrate induces genes involved in fructose uptake and glycogen metabolism in skeletal muscle cells. Interestingly, fenofibrate represses the mRNA expression of SREBP1c and ABCA1, classical LXR target genes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the different PPAR&#225; agonists have similar, but distinct effects on gene expression. Each drug appears to have a unique regulatory footprint. These studies also suggest that the differential effects of fibrate esters and acids in skeletal muscle cells involves cross talk with the oxy-sterol dependent LXR signaling pathway. In addition, we show overlapping, and distinct effects of selective ligands for PPAR-&#225;, -&#226;/&#228; and &#150;&#227; isoform in skeletal muscle cells, where PPAR&#225; regulates expression of genes implicated in, TG hydrolysis, fructose uptake and glycogen synthesis, PPAR&#226;/&#228; isoform regulates expression of genes implicated in preferential lipid utilization, FA catabolism and energy uncoupling and finally, PPAR&#227; regulates genes involved in glucose uptake, FA synthesis and lipid storage. We utilized cDNA microarray expression profiling technology to rigorously characterize the genes that were upregulated or downregulated in response to the PPAR&#225; agonists. Unfortunately, due to several technical shortcomings we were unable to extensively elucidate the transcriptional program induced in response to the PPAR&#225; agonists. This is elaborately discussed in Chapter-4. However, we identified two genes implicated in lipid metabolism, Melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R) and Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST), which were differentially expressed in response to fenofibrate. In addition we observed Sortilin and Insig1 were differentially expressed in response to wyeth14643. MC2R belongs to the melanocortin pathway and is implicated in the process of lipolysis, while GST is an oxidative stress response gene that prevents the free radical formation, that are linked to the development of insulin resistance. Additionally, Sortilin and Insig1 are implicated in the insulin mediated glucose uptake and antilipogenic activity respectively. The differential expression of these genes provided us with a new direction by which PPAR&#225; may be regulating the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases as a manifestation of lipid imbalance. However, due to limited time for this study, validation of these results could not be performed. We had observed that fenofibrate repressed the expression of the LXR target genes, SREBP1c and ABCA1 in the presence and absence of the LXR agonist, T0901317. Therefore, we endeavored to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the regulatory cross talk between PPAR&#225; and LXR signaling pathways. Our studies utilizing the GAL4 hybrid assay suggest that fenofibrate antagonizes LXR agonist mediated activation. We hypothesized that fenofibrate antagonizes LXR activity by attenuating LXR mediated corepressor displacement and/or cofactor recruitment. However, in a mammalian two-hybrid assay, we observed that fenofibrate (in the absence of LXR agonist) efficiently induced corepressor displacement from LXR. In contrast, fenofibrate had an additive effect on LXR dependent cofactor recruitment. These studies presents us with a paradox, that although fenofibrate represses LXR activity, it does not prevent corepressor displacement or inhibit coactivator recruitment by LXR. These data suggest fenofibrate-mediated attenuation of LXR activity and LXR dependent gene expression does not involve cofactor displacement/recruitment. Further studies are therefore required to elucidate the precise mechanism of fenofibrate-mediated modulation of LXR activity and LXR dependent gene expression. In conclusion, the activation of PPAR&#225; in skeletal muscle and the transcriptional regulation of the genes involved in the lipid and carbohydrate homeostasis, suggests PPAR&#225; activation in skeletal muscle is an important site for the therapeutic effect of fibrates.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158482</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS FOR COMPLEX ECOSYSTEM MODELS</field><field name="creator">Pantus, Francis John</field><field name="description">Trying to cope with a growing human population and its demands on natural resources, we aim to manage the use of our ecosystems by applying concepts of connectedness and interactions. We build models that help us to manage our knowledge and to predict the effects of our management actions on these interconnected and structurally complex ecosystems. Often these models take the form of a collection of mathematical equations that summarise relationships and dynamics built on information and data gleaned from ecological field experiments and environmental monitoring. With the increased availability of computing power and numerical methods, relatively simple models that simulate various aspects of natural systems (such as hydrodynamics, physics, chemistry, physiology, population biology) are aggregated into increasingly complex ecosystem models. &#145;Complexity&#146; is used here in a structural sense and indicates the level of connectedness implemented by these models. As ecosystem models grow more complex, the need arises for tools to analyse their workings, detect conceptual and coding errors, estimate the uncertainty in their results and help to develop them further. Sensitivity analysis aims to quantify the relationships between model inputs (especially parameters) and the model&#146;s response. A major complication of sensitivity analysis is that a model&#146;s responses may depend not only on single inputs, but also on combinations of inputs (interactions). The number of interactions increases non-linearly with the number of inputs, a phenomenon referred to as &#145;combinatorial explosion&#146;. This thesis considers the sensitivity analysis of ecosystem models, specifically: (i) how to carry out sensitivity analysis of complex ecosystem models, (ii) how to include external forcings such as climate and pollution in a model&#146;s sensitivity analysis, and (iii) how to handle a model&#146;s sensitivity to spatial delineations such as size and shape of its spatial framework. Notwithstanding an extensive literature on sensitivity analysis and its applications on one side and ecosystem modelling and models on the other, there has been remarkably little work done on the sensitivity analysis of more complex ecosystem models. To determine the importance of parameters and their interactions, the high-dimensional space formed by the model&#146;s parameters needs to be sampled. Each sample from this so called design space is evaluated by a run of the model to measure its response. Given that complex models in general take a long time to run, the computational cost of sensitivity analysis becomes prohibitively high for many of the sensitivity analytical approaches developed to date. After an introductory chapter, in Chapter Two of this thesis, I develop and apply a new method for the sensitivity analysis of a complex ecosystem model called &#147;adaptive screening&#148;. Instead of working with a fixed experimental design, where the sampling regime of the design space is decided before the computer experiment is performed, adaptive screening is based on a series of small computer experiments that uses the information gained from one experiment to design the next experiment, thus adaptively finding its way through the design space. To test this approach, I use a complex marine ecosystem model with over one thousand parameters and initial values and over forty state-variables. On average the method was able to remove about 94% of factors at about 10% of the computational cost of a more traditional approach. Cross-validation experiments perturbing only the selected factors showed that on average 93% of the variation of the response variables could be reconstructed for about 10 years of model prediction. However, by prolonging the prediction period the ability to find a subset of parameters that scored well in the cross-validation diminished. This result, which I believe is a consequence of feedback within the model, triggered another line of study that led to some interesting results. To examine the influence of feedback mechanisms on sensitivity analysis, in Chapter Three I developed a new approach to examining the sensitivity within models. By constructing three basic models with increasing levels of connectivity (no feedback (open), single feedback, network), comparing the analytical expressions for their derivative-based sensitivity measure at the model&#146;s equilibrium shows that feedback introduces high levels of interactions. It shows that a state-variable becomes in principle, sensitive to all parameters in a feedback model. The more connections there are in a model, the more complex the interactions in the expression for the sensitivity become. This is not the case for a model without feedback. These findings were reinforced by an empirical sensitivity analysis that allows the resolution of high-order interactions, which confirmed the findings of the analytical work. In Chapter Three I also show that high-order interactions did contribute considerably to the empirical sensitivity measure when there were limiting processes. The second finding from the empirical work is that the higher-order interactions take time (model iterations) to come into effect. Both results help to explain our results from the adaptive screening method from Chapter Two. The results of Chapter Three have important consequences for the sensitivity analysis of complex models. If sensitivity analysis of complex models needs to include high-order interactions, and the number of potential interactions grows non-linearly with the number of factors in a model, it would put in doubt the feasibility of sensitivity analysis for such models. Also, the value of sensitivity analysis is to find a relatively small set of important factors. If a complex model&#146;s response eventually becomes sensitive to almost all parameters, the more fundamental question arises of how useful the input&#151;output sensitivity analysis is. The complications of input&#151;output sensitivity analysis invite us to ponder alternatives. In Chapter Four I present another way of examining the workings of a complex model that consists of perturbing the state-variables instead of the inputs, known as pulseperturbation experiments. Using this idea from ecological field experiments, I present a comparable computer experiment where each state-variable of a complex ecosystem model is perturbed, one at a time, and measure the response of the other state-variables. By sampling that response over time, I show that the dynamics of functional connections between statevariables helps us to better understand the working of the model and the ecological system it represents. I advance the pulse-perturbation method by de-coupling the direct and indirect responses to perturbations, allowing us to rank each state-variable based on its relative response time. Apart from being informative in its own right, such ranking has the potential to simplify input&#151;output sensitivity analysis if it directs the segmentation of a model into smaller models. In this chapter I have shown that pulse-perturbation experiments are a valuable alternative to input&#151;output sensitivity analysis of complex ecosystem models. This approach has not reached its full potential, and it is recommended for future work. The second part of this thesis deals with the sensitivity analysis of external forcing. Different kinds of external forcing (e.g. rainfall, nutrient inputs) are one of the mechanisms used to adjust a general model formulation to a particular situation. Often, external forcings are applied to a model as a time series of empirically obtained measurements and it may not be obvious how to include them in a model&#146;s sensitivity analysis. Traditional input&#151;output sensitivity-analytical tools do not work without adaptation for non-stationary inputs; in Chapter Five I develop and implement two approaches to incorporate external forcings into sensitivity analysis. The first approach is to convert the empirical time series into datagenerating functions with state-variables (such as rainfall) and parameters (such as daily average rainfall). The external forcing is not part of any feedback in the model, and hence the issues discussed in the previous section are not relevant and the sensitivity analysis becomes straight-forward. The second approach applies the responsiveness analysis discussed in Chapter Four, by perturbing the external forcing state-variables. The results of the responsiveness analysis indicates not only to which external forcings the model responds (nutrient pollution), but also which specific state-variables are likely to be affected by them. The set of state-variables that respond to particular external forcings is tracked over time and that allows us to study the dynamics of the responsiveness. I show that both approaches successfully include external forcings into a sensitivity analysis. I also show that responsiveness analysis is relatively simple to implement and its results are easy to interpret. This work also confirmed the earlier findings that input&#151;output sensitivity analysis becomes complicated when the sensitivities of model responses that are part of feedback connections where included. In the final part of this thesis I consider the problem of spatial sensitivity analysis. With the recognition that our environment is not homogeneous over geographic space comes the need to make space explicit in our models. Often, this is done by introducing grids or polygons to delineate homogeneous regions or to serve as reporting areas. The size and form of these spatial constructs are to a certain extent arbitrary and I show how to examine the sensitivity of a model to such spatial configurations. In Chapter Six I develop the ecosystem health index model. In this chapter I develop and implement a new method to report the ecosystem status for sections of Moreton Bay in SE-Queensland on the East coast of Australia. This method is based on combining the data from a monthly environmental monitoring program and the regional management objectives into a spatially explicit ecosystem health index (EHI). The basis of the EHI is the level of compliance of a region to its management objectives. As shown in Chapter Six, the EHI allows us to compare the ecosystem status across different ecosystems and different spatial configurations such as two-dimensional areas and one-dimensional rivers. The EHI has been successfully applied to report the region&#146;s ecosystem health in the form of an annual report card for SE-Queensland, Australia. The EHI model has an important spatial component, its reporting regions. To solve the question how to perform sensitivity analysis on spatial configurations such as reporting regions, the EHI model was chosen. The EHI model is a fairly simple and fast model with well-defined reporting regions that pose some interesting spatial challenges. The question addressed in Chapter Seven is how the EHI depends on the size and form of the reporting areas. The framework for the sensitivity analysis of spatial configurations that I develop in Chapter Seven is based on a vector space of all possible spatial arrangements and a spatially integrative mapping from the vector space onto a response surface. The gradients on the response surface are used as measures of sensitivity. This analytical framework provides the exact sensitivity of integrating functions to quantitative changes in the spatial configuration. The results of the analysis are reported as a hierarchy of sensitivity measures. Geographic and geometric constraints as well as interactions between vertices were taken into account and methods to address those issues are included in this thesis. The use of regression models to estimate the gradient vectors as part of the spatial sensitivity framework has been proven to be a powerful and flexible approach to include higher-order interactions without changing the analytical framework. The diagnostics that are also products of the regression analysis, such as R2- and p-values, are found to be of importance to judge the quality of the sensitivity results. The application of this spatial sensitivity analysis framework to the Moreton Bay regional EHI resulted in a clear hierarchy of sensitivities. For example, the EHI one of the reporting regions, Bramble Bay, was shown to be most sensitive to changes in its configuration and the Bramble Bay reporting region, is most sensitive to changes to vertex 5 and especially the latitudinal changes of vertex 5. Finally, Chapter Eight summarises the thesis&#146; conclusions and discusses the learning and suggests future work. It finishes with a short epilogue.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158483</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mobile Marketing Research: A Locales Framework Analysis</field><field name="creator">Lee, Dennis Chin Huat</field><field name="description">Mobile marketing is a new and emerging phenomenon, with little research performed to comprehend the interaction between elements and factors that will influence consumer participation. Current mobile marketing research only considers the perspective of how consumers react or behave towards the given type of mobile marketing materials, but they fail to consider how technology may help to improve the relationship between consumers and companies. These studies also often ignore the other stakeholders involved in the context of any mobile marketing campaign. As such, most current marketing research begins with the traditional marketing perspectives and replaces existing media with mobile technology. This approach is based on an historical perspective that does not arise from the capabilities of Human-Computer Interaction or Interaction Design. A broader and general overview to mobile marketing is required, as it can provide a better overall understanding of this phenomenon, not bounded by one discipline&#146;s research approaches. The thesis suggests that mobile marketing research take an Interaction Design approach, in which technology introductions or interventions are studied in use. The Locales Framework offers an alternative approach for investigating the context of mobile marketing. The research shows how such an approach can integrate marketing and new technology research, highlighting the issues and opportunities brought about by the technology within a domain context, i.e. mobile marketing. Given that there are not many theoretical based frameworks available to support mobile marketing research, the application of this framework provides a roadmap for future research in mobile marketing and helps build the body of knowledge in this field. Four individual studies were carried out to collect data on mobile marketing. These were conducted using a mixed method approach where qualitative and quantitative research tools were adapted. Study 1 was an experiment that examined how well mobile advertising is accepted by an individual when compared to magazine advertising. Study 2 investigated how people perceive mobile promotion. Study 3 was a phenomenographical study that examined how individuals experience mobile advertising. Study 4 was a case study that looked into the effectiveness of a coupon based marketing campaign. The data collection from all the studies was then populated into the Locales Framework for further analysis. This allows a richer and more holistic understanding of mobile marketing as compared to studies conducted using only one marketing research method. The implications and results of the new findings and new analysis method in mobile marketing are presented and discussed. A simple marketing strategy for mobile marketing is outlined. This is also supported with an agenda for future work in improving the effectiveness of mobile marketing can be measured and checked.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158484</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identity and Identification in Organisational Contexts: Towards an Interactionist Perspective</field><field name="creator">Mayhew, Melissa</field><field name="description">Concepts from the social identity approach, comprising social identity and selfcategorisation theories, are now widely acknowledged as important for understanding how the self-concept influences, and is influenced by, organisational processes. Yet many theoretical developments of the social identity approach, particularly from selfcategorisation theory, have largely been neglected by organisational researchers. Social identity theorists, on the other hand, have ignored the role of personal identity and individual differences in identity processes. The aim of this research is to address these limitations in an organisational context by examining the role of the individual in identity processes, in order to explain individual variation in identification under identical contextual conditions. In this thesis, therefore, I adopt an interactionist perspective, where context and the individual perceiver together explain identity processes. The theoretical framework for this perspective is derived from a reconceptualisation of the nature and structure of personal and social identities, which then allows for a consideration of the role of the individual. I propose, in particular, that individuals differ in their propensity to identify with social groups, including multiple organisational identities. This propensity, termed Need for Identification (nID), interacts with the social context in producing identification. In order to assess the role of the individual in identity processes, in Study 1, I developed and validated a scale to measure need for identification. Initial item development and content-validity review was followed by item reduction. A separate community sample (N = 204) was used to evaluate and further refine the measure, and to provide evidence for discriminant and convergent validity. The scale structure was replicated on a third sample (N = 180), which confirmed the two-component structure of the nID construct, while a final sample (N = 40) provided evidence of test-retest reliability. The first component&#151;Need for Identification-Self-Definition (nID-SD)&#151;captures the need for group membership in order to define and understand the self. The second component&#151; Need for Identification-Belongingness (nID-B)&#151;reflects group membership motivated by a desire for belongingness and affinity. In Study 2, I investigated the role of nID and identity salience on the cognitive and evaluative components of identification with a new group. Using a traditional minimal group experimental design, nID was measured prior to the manipulation of identity salience with 165 undergraduate university students. The results revealed that nID-SD was stronger than identity salience in predicting self-categorisation, the cognitive element of identification. Similarly, nID-B was a better predictor of the evaluative, group self-esteem component of identification than identity salience. Study 3 was designed to replicate and extend the results of the second study by examining the role of nID, identity salience, and salience simultaneity on multiple workrelated identities. A quasi-experimental survey design with 275 employed individuals measured nID and manipulated both organisational and workgroup identity salience. As I predicted, identity salience and nID were positively related to identification with the organisation and the workgroup. Supporting previous results, nID-SD and nID-B were stronger predictors of organisational and workgroup identification than was identity salience. The results also demonstrated a salience simultaneity effect, whereby two simultaneously salient identities further increased the strength of identification. In Study 4, I tested an interactionist model of multiple work-related identities by examining the differential antecedents and consequences of organisational and workgroup identification in the context of nID (N = 246). Path analysis supported the model, demonstrating relationships between nID-SD and organisational identification, and between nID-B and workgroup identification. The results further supported the theorised effects of organisational and workgroup identification on desirable organisational outcomes. Specifically, organisational identification was positively related to helping extra-role behaviours, while workgroup identification was positively related to voice extrarole behaviours. Only organisational identification was found to be associated with intrinsic work motivation, which was also positively related to job involvement and in-role behaviour. Overall, the findings of this research support the interactionist perspective, whereby the individual perceiver plays an important role in the development of identification with organisational groups. By incorporating a consideration of identity salience, and specifying how and why individual differences manifest in the identification process, this thesis makes a significant contribution to both the social identity and organisational literatures. In applied settings, the results of this research suggest that an individual&#146;s need for identification is just as important as salience inducers in eliciting employee identification. Finally, by investigating the impact of work-related identification on less-studied work attitudes and behaviour, such as specific discretionary performance, intrinsic motivation, and in-role behaviour, the research offers a greater understanding of how employee identity produces organisationally relevant outcomes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158485</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">History and Hermeneutics: A Historical Development of OT Studies in Korean Presbyterianism, 1884-1960, with Specific Focus on the History of the Appropriation of Western OT Hermeneutic Method</field><field name="creator">Park, Won-Ju</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates, both historically and theologically, the effects of the appropriation of introduced Western methods of OT interpretation by the Presbyterian Church in Korea, which resulted in conflict. The Protestant church in Korea commenced through the reading of the Bible, translated into Korean from outside the country, before any active missionary penetration and influence. In this historical context the reading of the Korean Bible has been of inestimable significance in the development of the Korean church and its theology. Conflict arose when missionaries introduced and used in theological training differing interpretive approaches. This thesis historically traces these streams of influence and the resulting theological clashes within the Presbyterian Church. Chapters one and two delineate the basic issues for understanding the historical background to the formation of the Korean Church and its theological orientation. Chapter one surveys the rise of Christianity in Korea. Chapter two discusses the background of OT hermeneutics in Korean Presbyterianism. In chapter three, the first period of appropriation of introduced OT interpretative perspectives is delineated as the first two decades of the twentieth century (1901-1920). During this period OT interpretative perspectives were introduced and diffused only by western missionaries to Korea. Chapter four then examines the first Korean response to the appropriation of those perspectives (1921-1931). A review then attempts to measure the extent of influence of that particular hermeneutical method. During this period it appears that there was only a slight movement toward a distinctive Korean response and a distinctively indigenous Korean hermeneutic. Likewise the paired chapters, five and six deal with the second period of appropriation (1932-1945) and the Korean response (1946-1960). This second period was the introduction and appropriation of the historical-critical method by some Korean scholars within Korean Presbyterianism. The endorsement of the method by a number of Koreans during this period raised strong and widespread conflict. Chapter six goes on to discuss the response to this second appropriation (1946-1960). It investigates the response of that period from the historical perspective of &#145;the ecclesiastical schism&#146; which resulted, and further hermeneutical and theological development. Chapter seven does two things. First it analyses the whole of the earlier discussion retrospectively. Then, in prospect, it will offer a suggestion for a possible way forward for reading and interpreting the OT in a non-Western context. This research is expected to give not only to Korean Presbyterian hermeneutical scholarship a relevant and useful method, but also to the third world of OT interpretive method, similarly to that which is appropriate to Korean Presbyterianism.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158486</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poetics in Translation: the Case of D. G. Rossetti's The House of Life in Russian</field><field name="creator">Nekliaev, Vladislav</field><field name="description">The House of Life, by the major Victorian painter, poet and translator, Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828&#150;1882), is a masterpiece of Victorian poetry and one of the few sonnet sequences enshrined in the English canon. Despite his prominence on the literary stage, Rossetti was virtually unknown to the Russian reader until recently. Only now is Rossetti's poetry beginning to be translated into Russian. This thesis provides the first complete Russian translation of The House of Life. It consists of three parts. The first part analyses problems of translation into Russian of The House of Life, and offers solutions. It proposes a detailed method for translation of Rossetti's sonnets into Russian. A number of major issues are addressed specifically to achieve the maximum adaptation of the Rossettian sonnet to the very different tradition of the Russian sonnet. These issues include meter, rhythm, rhymes, their structure and distribution, and alliteration. The analysis of the technical aspects of translation is followed by a more speculative investigation of the issues of faithfulness and the inevitable transformation of the original content in the process of adaptation of the Rossettian sonnet to the requirements of the Russian tradition of sonnet-writing. This part concludes with a detailed analysis of two translated sonnets, in order to demonstrate the practical application of the discussed theoretical issues. The second part contains the first Russian translation of The House of Life, a sequence of 103 sonnets, together with the English originals. The third part analyses the influence of the images of Eros on Greek vases from the collection of the British Museum on Rossetti's personification of Love, the central image of his love poetry. It shows the likelihood of Rossetti's exposure to these materials and provides parallels between the images of the Greek vases and Rossetti's poetry. It argues that this influence should be recognised as a significant source of Rossetti's imagery. The third part is closely connected with the first part through the image of Love which presents one of the major difficulties for the translator and the correct understanding of which is essential for a successful translation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158487</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rousseau&#146;s Rhetoric of Happiness in Julie, ou la Nouvelle H&#233;lo&#239;se</field><field name="creator">Temple-Smith, Annabel Louise</field><field name="description">This thesis takes as its starting point the modern assumptions that happiness is indescribable and cannot generate story. A spontaneous emotion, it is beyond language. Uneventful and repetitive, it cannot sustain narrative. In Rousseau&#146;s bestselling sentimental novel, Julie, we see the first assumption constructed and the second denied. Rousseau defines a degree zero of rhetoric and happiness, opposing spontaneity to artifice yet also elaborating a new and fashioned naturalness, in language as in an art of living portrayed. Attention to the rhetorical dimension of Rousseau&#146;s writing serves to link the history of ideas, moral philosophy and textual analysis (the &#147;what,&#148; &#147;ought&#148; and narrative &#147;how&#148; of happiness). It connects Rousseau&#146;s own self-fashioning (persona) with his literary position-taking (genre). Each chapter offers a different perspective, crossing between Rousseau&#146;s own writings or between various novels. (In particular, Cr&#233;billon&#146;s Les Egarements, Bernardin&#146;s Paul et Virginie, Stendhal&#146;s La Chartreuse de Parme, Sade&#146;s Justine and La Philosophie dans le boudoir, and Charri&#232;re&#146;s Mistriss Henley.) This thesis offers a richly layered approach to happiness. It foregrounds eighteenth-century concerns with theatricality, questions of credibility and exemplarity, practices of letter-writing and the framing of tableaux. It treats a rhetoric of happy ends concerned to affirm faith, and in Mistriss Henley, an eloquent failure of apology dismantling Rousseau&#146;s spectacle and construct. Responding to current happiness studies, which trace concepts or measure subjective well-being, this thesis seeks to show the importance of taking into account textuality, indeed, of revising the opposition between text and context. It sees in Rousseau&#146;s puff and polemic, his style and strategy, the very material of history.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158488</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TEACHER AGENCY : A grounded topology of CARE</field><field name="creator">Zavros, Agli</field><field name="description">This inquiry explores teachers&#146; beliefs about their capabilities to achieve both academic and social attainments for their students (teacher efficacy). In this inquiry teacher voices are used to explore teacher agency and polyvalent notions of care (where polyvalence refers to the capacity of a concept to connect with other concepts). As a teacher and as a researcher I highlight the danger of positioning teachers as delivering institutionalised care. It is this notion of care that is implicit in the teacher efficacy literature. Teacher efficacy, agency and care are explored in a movement away from traditionally quantitative studies of teacher efficacy that ignore or silence teacher voices. A review of the teacher efficacy literature emphasises a need for a qualitative exploration of the contextualised and complex nature of teacher efficacy, exploring the construction of teacher efficacy beliefs in relation to their networked lives and their work place experiences. Teacher efficacy, agency and care are further discussed in relation to polyvalent notions of &#145;the teacher&#146;. Drawing on my own experiences as a teacher and the representation of the self as a discursive process (Davies and Harre, 2000), I discuss this process as grounded in relational ties found in teachers&#146; networked lives. Acknowledging my own subjectivities, I conduct this inquiry from the autoethnographer&#146;s perspective. Despite the problematic nature of this approach, it enables the representation and discussion of teacher efficacy, agency and care in relation to existing discursive and ideological constructions of the teacher from the insider&#146;s perspective. Through this inquiry, I connect the personal to the social in a discussion of the relational nature of efficacy, agency and care, as socially constructed notions subject to relationships with people, places and events in time. I begin by informing my own construction of the relationship between teacher efficacy and the work place by conducting a survey of 167 teachers. Using descriptive and statistical data analysis, I explore the relationship between teachers&#146; experiences of leadership practices, work place autonomy, work group relations and school based egocentric (personal) networks in relation to their efficacy beliefs. The findings from the survey, in particular the teachers&#146; comments, inform interviews conducted with five teachers from my egocentric network. Grounded theory and constant comparative methods are used to analyse the interview data, in an exploration of teacher heuristic logic that informs teachers&#146; identity work (McCall, 2003) and hence their individuated constructs of efficacy, agency and care. Teacher identity work is also explored through Bandura&#146;s (1997) notions of social persuasion, vicarious and mastery experiences associated with their egocentric networks. Foreshadowed by the work of Charmaz (1990), this inquiry takes a social constructionist approach to grounded theory. The analysis and interpretation reflects a symbolic interactionist view of the phenomenological reality (White, 1992a) of teachers&#146; networked lives, which informs their identity work and subsequently their efficacy, agency and care. This perspective emphasises a way of knowing that focuses on the experiential, relational and empathetic nature of human activity. The main focus for the inquiry is to confront and challenge existing notions of care associated with teacher efficacy. The analysis of the data results in the development of a theorised landscape, or topology, with a core category defined as CARE. CARE is a set of subjective relationships between the individual and their environment that results in differentiated levels of action, inter-action, inter-reaction and in-action. CARE is represented in capital letters to denote that it subsumes all other identified categories and represents a polyvalent notion of care and caring evident in the data. It encapsulates that which matters and gives energy to the agent&#146;s actions. The significance of this inquiry is that it provides an insider&#146;s view of teachers&#146; critical consciousness and praxis. CARE is positioned as a foundation of teacher praxis, reflecting teachers&#146; thinking, feeling and doing. Exploring this from the autoethnographer&#146;s perspective provides an alternative understanding of teacher efficacy, agency and care, hence informing educational praxis, teacher education, educational reform and research into teachers&#146; working lives.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158489</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community Involvement as a Means of Developing Oral Communication Skills and L2 Confidence: The Case of Tertiary Students in an Intermediate Japanese Course</field><field name="creator">Imura, Taeko</field><field name="description">One of the ultimate goals of language learning is to be able to communicate effectively in real life situations with native speakers (NSs). Nevertheless, most foreign language (FL) courses rarely provide the opportunity for the learners to interact with NSs in the language curriculum. Furthermore, a large volume of research has shown that the speaking situation in the classroom can provoke anxiety for many FL learners when they are adolescents or adults who are self-conscious and apt to fear negative evaluation by teacher and peers. It appears that affective factors cannot be disregarded when teaching how to speak the language, as they can impact on the learning process and consequently on developing speaking skills in a FL. This research investigates the impact of interaction with NSs on the development of oral communication skills and L2 confidence when FL learners had an opportunity to use the target language regularly outside the classroom with NSs in the community: the Community Involvement (CI) project. The study also aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the CI approach in a FL curriculum. The framework for this research is based on foreign language anxiety (Horwitz, Horwitz, &amp; Cope, 1986; Gardner &amp; MacIntyre, 1993a; MacIntyre, 1999; MacIntyre &amp; Gardner, 1991c), the vicious cycle model (Baker &amp; MacIntyre, 2000), and willingness to communicate (MacIntyre, 1994; MacIntyre, D&#246;rnyei, Cl&#233;ment, &amp; Noels, 1998). So far, few studies have reported the effect of interaction with NSs on linguistic and affective outcomes in regards to FL context and the evidence is far from conclusive. Forty students, who were studying Japanese at an intermediate level at a university, had a matched NS partner and met for 10 hours during a semester outside the classroom (i.e., the CI project). The CI project was an integral part of the intermediate course. For the analysis, both quantitative and qualitative data were collected from the students. They completed a questionnaire on perceived competence and anxiety measures and took listening and speaking tests before and after the 10- hour interaction. The effect of interaction with NS was examined by comparing the scores on the pre- and post- questionnaires and tests by administering statistical tests. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the effect of interaction and account for the linguistic, cognitive, and affective changes which took place over the duration of the study, a total of 217 written journals collected from individual students after each meeting were analysed. The statistical results clearly show that interaction with NS had a significant impact not only on improving oral communication skills but also on affective factors. The findings suggest that perceived competence in speaking and listening increased and anxiety felt inside the classroom and outside the classroom decreased dramatically after the interaction (viz. increase in L2 confidence). The analysis of the qualitative data provided in-depth insight into affective and cognitive changes and lent further support to the statistical findings. It also revealed that linguistic development was difficult to dissociate from affective and cognitive changes, as they were strongly interrelated. Most students enjoyed the interaction and felt comfortable in using the language outside as well as inside the classroom regardless of their past learning experience and competence in Japanese oral skills. This suggests that the positive learning experience at a personal level made them transform internally by themselves, and these changes spread to the classroom context. Thus, the experience reduced students&#146; anxiety successfully and contributed to changing their feelings, beliefs and attitudes associated with using and learning the language. The study confirmed that the CI approach is effective in a FL curriculum. The present study has implications for FL teaching especially in developing oral communication skills. It has also made significant contributions to theoretical and methodological advancements by highlighting the importance of affective factors in the development of oral communication skills. Such insights are of particular interest to teachers of FL who are concerned about maintaining students&#146; motivation and researchers who investigate affective variables. When as little as 10 hours of interaction with NS &#147;outside the classroom&#148; makes remarkable differences to learners in linguistic and non-linguistic outcomes, the regular interaction with NSs is strongly recommended and should be made available to FL learners in a multicultural society.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158490</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Holding our breath': The experiences of contemplating PIT screening.</field><field name="creator">Hawthorne, Fiona Margaret</field><field name="description">This qualitative research examined the experiences of women who were contemplating undergoing nuchal translucency (NT) screening in their first trimester of pregnancy. Nineteen participants were recruited fiom doctors' waiting rooms and advertisements in local newspapers. These women were all pregnant and had not yet undergone NT screening in this pregnancy. Ages ranged fiom 24 to 42 years, with a mix of women in their first or subsequent pregnancies. Data were collected via semistructured conversations and iterative analysis was undertaken using the principles of hermeneutic phenomenology. The major findings fiom this research were the major role of family and fiends in influencing women to accept or decline NT screening; and how pregnancy is viewed as an essentially abnormal process involving major risks. In addition the concept of being a "good mother" was defined by actively rejecting their own mother's advice, and keeping quiet about a decision to terminate the pregnancy. Because these women are indeed so risk aware, it is recommended that labels associated with maternal age be abolished and that medical and midwifery practitioners become more aware about how people construct risk Finally, since the findings suggest that abortion is still a shameful option, clinicians need to investigate the views of the woman and her partner before the scan is undertaken.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158491</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The search for meaning in music education: Reflections on difference and practice.</field><field name="creator">Cuskelly, James Martin</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates issues of meaning in music and the ways in which music education can be organised and delivered to maximise the experience of meaning for students. Two key questions are pursued within this thesis. Firstly, what is the nature of meaning in music, both as it is reported by educators and students, and evidenced in the literature? Secondly, in what ways can music education curriculum be organised to maximise this experience of meaning for students, specifically in the core areas of listening, composing and performing? In recognizing the various ways in which concepts of musical meaning are employed within music education and in an attempt to clarify and more accurately define what is intended when referring to meaning in music, three specific terms-signification, responsification and socialification-are suggested. The use of these terms also provides important points of reference throughout the discussion. Employing an autobiographical and phenomenological approach alongside a critical analysis of music education philosophies, this study investigates the lived experiences of teachers and students in terms of meaning in music. The inclusion of personal histories-my own and the stories of the students whom I teach-within the methodological framework provides a unique vehicle for the capture of data given the highly personalised nature of much of the material to hand. Further, a consideration of the lived experience of teachers and students in light of contemporary research and thinking serves to firmly anchor the discussion within the educational context. This research has found that issues of meaning are layered, multifaceted and interrelated, that there are numerous elements that contribute to meaning and that what is significant in music may be diverse, varying from individual to individual, from group to group. Musical meaning may be highly personalized and /or culturally delineated, and meaning in music may not remain static; it may vary across experiences or over time. This research has identified particular practices and approaches which significantly influence the development of meaning in music; such educative practices are worthy of sustained consideration by those within the field.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158492</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of Children's Perceptions of Connectedness to their Families, School, and Peers on their Psychosocial Functioning</field><field name="creator">Law, Peter Charles</field><field name="description">This thesis tests a theoretical model hypothesizing that children's perceptions of parenting practices and family climate, and their family structure, influence their sense of family connectedness, which in turn, impacts on their psychosocial functioning. The model posits that family connectedness influences children's perceptions of school and peer connectedness, as well as the type of peer group to which they belong, and that these variables have an additional effect on their functioning. Few studies have investigated the combined influence of the family, school, and peers on children's well being. The thesis provides an original analysis of the interactive impact of those important social systems that influence child development. Given the high rate of mental health problems amongst our youth, the model, if substantiated, provides a basis for understanding more fully the ways in which young people's experiences within social settings impact on their general functioning. Student and parentlguardian scales consisting of previously established instruments, and a teacher student-adjustment index were administered to 563 students (attending Years 6 to 1 I in state schools located in the Brisbane metropolitan area), 266 caregivers, and teachers who provided adjustment ratings for 461 students. Developmental changes to the relationships identified in the model were explored by comparing students' responses across three cohorts: Years 617 (N = 205), Years 819 (N= 178), and Years 1011 1 (N = 180). The theoretical model was tested using two related statistical techniques: structural equational modeling, and factor analysis, multiple regression, and mediation testing. The theoretical model was substantially confirmed by the empirical data. Only family structure did not contribute to children's psychosocial functioning. Children's gender had no impact on the relationships, and the family's socioeconomic status was found to have a minor impact on children's well being only for younger children. It was established that children's positive perceptions of parenting practices and well functioning family climates create a strong sense of family connectedness, which was centrally important in influencing children's adjustment. Family connectedness was found to indirectly influence adjustment by regulating children's sense of attachment to peers, peer group type, and school. These factors had a mediating and combined impact on the relationship between family connectedness and children's adjustment. Additionally, school connectedness and family connectedness had an independent, and approximately equal, impact on children's adjustment. The identified relationships contribute significantly to the attachment literature by indicating the mechanisms by which young people form multiple attachments, and the impact these attachments have on children's functioning. The results also support ecological framework theory as those environmental influences closest to the child were found to have both a direct and interactive impact on children. Although the strength of the relationships varied somewhat across the three cohorts, relationships amongst the variables were consistent with those described for the total sample. Expected developmental trends were evidenced with the impact of family connectedness weakening with age and peer connectedness becoming more important for adjustment. Although older children were more likely to associate with an antisocial peer group, across the three cohorts, children's identification with antisocial peers was found to have only a minor, negative impact on children's functioning. While this finding runs counter to those studies that have found antisocial peer groups to be detrimental to children's adjustment, it may be that, within normative bounds, the affiliation established within these relationships outweighs the possible negative opportunities offered by such groups. Children's, caregivers', and teachers' views of children's adjustment were found to be weakly associated, with children reporting higher levels of maladjustment than caregivers. Children's views of family processes, compared to those of their caregivers, were more closely related to their adjustment reports. These results suggest the importance of understanding children's perceptions of events, and the impact their perceptions have on their functioning. The thesis makes a strong theoretical contribution as well as having implications for the prevention of and intervention with children at risk of adjustment problems. The empirical evidence regarding the centrality of family connectedness for children's functioning indicates the importance of interventions designed to enhance caregivers' parenting skills. These interventions should focus on promoting effective parent-child relationships and would be useful for families where there is some evidence of family dysfunction. As school is one of the few institutions attended by the majority of children, strategies that are designed to enhance the student-school bond are likely to improve the psychological functioning of younger people. These strategies may be particularly important for those at-risk children who are subject to on-going family dysfunction. Through developing a belongingness and connectedness to school and by identifying with the school ethos these at-risk children may indeed have a better chance of recovery than those who remain disengaged from their schooling experience.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158493</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"WE WALK INTO THE FUTURE BACKWARDS" A CASE STUDY OF MAORI PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY</field><field name="creator">Welch, Ruby</field><field name="description">My thesis analyses what is generally accepted in Western European societies as the "work ethic" and compares it with Maori people's motivations to work in New Zealand. I show that ideational systems, which direct people's expectations and perceptions about work, are comprised of shared ideas, values, beliefs, rules, and meanings that are expressed through social institutions. Ideational systems also influence the ways in which people organize their workplaces, which are, in turn, a sub-system of their broader society. I argue that industrial relations are, therefore, culturally shaped rather than solely determined by technological, industrial, or political considerations. Changes in societies, due to industrialization and technological innovation, do occur but they do not necessarily converge because actors in various social systems drive and adapt to social change in culturally specific ways. I used qualitative research methodology to interpret and describe the data presented to me by informants in interviews and through questionnaires in order to construct a detailed description and understanding of variations in attitude to the concept of work of culturally different peoples. My research was conducted in New Zealand during a period of significant change in the labour market. It shows how transformations in the labour market did not coincide with changes in people's ideas about work, in particular that the ideational constructs of Maori people's work contrasted greatly with those of mainstream New Zealanders (Pakehas). It demonstrates the distinctive individualistic ways of thinking about work in Western ideational systems as opposed to the holistic and all encompassing whanau principle that informs Maori ideational systems, actions, and economic development that frames industrial relations. It shows clearly that the ideational systems are separate and that rather than conforming to the integration efforts of consecutive New Zealand governments, Maori people have embarked on a course of self-determination that is shaped by their "culture".</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158494</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural Basis of Plant Disease Resistance in Flax against Flax Rust</field><field name="creator">Wang, Ching-I Anderson</field><field name="description">Plants do not possess an adaptive immune system and are unable to circulate antibodies. Therefore plants have highly coordinated defense mechanisms, which efficiently prevent the spread of infections by foreign pathogens. Plants use preformed antimicrobials, basal defenses and gene-for-gene resistance. Gene-for-gene resistance is initiated upon the direct or indirect recognition of pathogen-derived avirulence (Avr) gene products by the plant disease resistance (R) gene products. Recent studies suggest that the indirect recognition (guard theory) is mediated by one or several host components. While the Avr-R interaction has been very well characterised genetically for a range of plant and pathogen species, surprisingly little is known, especially at the molecular level, regarding the recognition mechanism between Avr and R proteins. Because the recognition of Avr by R protein is the key to activate the disease resistance, the interaction between Avr and R and the mechanism of resistance initiation are of intrinsic interest and importance, and are investigated in this study. This thesis covers the expression, purification, characterisation and crystallisation of four flax rust (Melampsora lini) AvrL567 proteins, AvrL567-A, AvrL567-B, AvrL567-C and AvrL567-D, with distinctive recognition specificities, and of their corresponding flax (Linum usitatissimum) R protein L6 and the closely related protein M. Significantly, AvrL567-A and AvrL567-D protein structures were determined. This allowed the interaction mechanism between AvrL567 and L proteins to be modelled. By using site-directed mutagenesis on polymorphic amino residues of AvrL567 variants to confirm the role of each individual amino acid residue in conferring recognition specificity, it was determined that the interactions between AvrL567 and L proteins were the results of cumulative effects of multiple contact points. The structures provided some insights into possible pathogenicity-associated functions as nucleic acid binding activity was observed in vitro. Importantly, this demonstrates that AvrL567 proteins may play a role in influencing host gene expression during infection. Furthermore, binding of the large subunits of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase / oxygenase (RuBisCo), which plays a crucial role in energy metabolism in plants, was also detected by pull-down assays. This highlights the possible virulence effects of these Avr proteins. This study highlights several aspects of Avr-R interaction at the molecular level and possible virulence functions of Avr proteins. The results imply a significant step towards defining the resistance response at a molecular level, bringing us a step closer towards being able to engineer new plant disease resistance genes to control diseases for which naturally occurring resistances are not adequate.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158816</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aerothermodynamic Simulation of Subscale models of the FIRE II and Titan Explorer Vehicles in Expansion Tubes</field><field name="creator">Capra, Bianca Rose</field><field name="description">Scale models of the terrestrial re-entry probe FIRE 11, and the proposed Titan aerocapture vehicle Titan Explorer, were tested with regards to their aerothermodynamic environment in the expansion tubes at The University of Queensland. Test models were sized from their respective flight vehicles using binary scaling to ensure similitude was maintained between the flight and experimental flowfields. The FIRE I1 model had a length scale of 1:27.7, maximum diameter of 24.28mm and nose radius 33.78mm. This model was orientated at a 0" angle of attack and was designed to simulate the flight heating environment 21.75s after re-entry, where radiation contributed an estimated 17% - 36% to the total heat transfer. The Titan Explorer test model was a 70" sphere-cone and was designed to simulate a peak heating condition occurring 253s into an aerocapture manoeuvre at Titan, where radiative heat transfer was estimated to contribute more than 80% to the aerothermodynamic heating. The model was sized to a length scale of 1:40.8 giving a maximum diameter of 94.46mm with nose radius of 22.37mm. The Titan Explorer model was tested at both a 0" and 16" angle of attack with lift-up in a simulated Titan atmosphere consisting of 5% CH4 and 95% N2. Both models were manufactured from steel and contained forebody heat flux instrumentation for measurement of the aerothermodynamic heating. A new gauge was developed for the separation and detection of the radiative component of heat transfer to the Titan Explorer model where non-negligible amounts of radiation were present on the test model. This gauge contained two thin-film nickel temperature sensing elements housed in a brass holder. Sensing elements were separated from direct contact with the flow via appropriate optical windows. All reflecting surfaces of the radiation gauge, with the exception of the nickel element, were painted in flat black paint to minimise spurious reflections. Total heat transfer on both models was measured with fast response type-E surface mounted thermocouples. From an analysis of both a transparent and absorptive gas it was proposed that absolute aerothermodynamic radiative heat transfer will remain invariant between an experimental model and the flight vehicle, provided binary scaling was maintained, and radiation was uncoupled or weakly coupled to the flow. This necessitated the treating of each mode of heat transfer independently when scaling flight data to the experimental models and vice versa. A parameter referred to as the reduced flight value was developed that allowed experimentally measured heat transfer to be directly compared with the appropriately scaled flight heating rates. The reduced flight value also allowed for estimation of flight vehicle heating rates from experimentally measured total and radiative heat transfer. Stagnation point results from the FIRE I1 testing successfully demonstrated the ability of expansion tubes to recreate the aerothermodynamic environment of flight vehicles. At this location an average of 14.28&amp;7%kW/cm2 of total heat transfer was experimentally measured. This was shown to have a good agreement of between 5% - 15% with both empirical convective heating correlations and the reduced flight values scaled from the flight data. Total heat transfer values measured at two radial locations 11.4" and 18.7" from the nose were 17.11&amp;7%kW/m2 and l7.14f 7%kW/cm2 respectively and were substantially higher than both the stagnation point and reduced flight values. The high heating rates experimentally measured at these locations were attributed to the boundary layer becoming turbulent on the test model as a result of surface roughness and was estimated likely to occur at approximately 8.4' from the stagnation point. Aerothermodynamic radiative heat transfer was successfully separated and measured on the Titan Explorer test model. It was shown that this measured radiative heat transfer was a direct result of the addition of CH4 into the test gas which promoted the formation of the strong radiating particle cyanogen, CN, in the shock layer. At the design orientation of a 16" angle of attack with lift-up in a simulated Titan atmosphere, 20.8% 14%W/m2 of surface radiative heat transfer was measured at the flow stagnation point. This represented 4% of the total heat transfer of 510&amp;7%W/cm2 recorded by the stagnation point thermocouples. A similar contribution of radiative heat transfer was measured with the model orientated at a 0" AOA when the radiation gauge was positioned 19.6mm vertically below the sphere-cone apex. In this orientation 21.6% 14%W/m2 of radiative heat transfer was measured compared to the local total heat transfer of 420W/cm2.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158495</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HAZARDOUS MEDICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT FOR THE STATES OF THE GULF CO-OPERATION COUNCIL (GCC): A CASE STUDY OF ABU DHABI, UAE</field><field name="creator">Bani-Hashim, Taghreed Ali Abdullah Al Habshi</field><field name="description">The Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) rich oil-states including the United Arab Emirates are countries in transition. These countries have become wealthy in recent years through the sale of oil and gas. They have radically changed from tribal lifestyles to become modem societies within a short time frame. The UAE has changed rapidly to become a wealthy modern state within a generation (less than 25 years). The oil revenues have flowed into the UAE starting from the federation of the country, which was in 1971, although oil was discovered in the 1950s in Abu Dhabi Emirate, the largest and wealthiest state in the country in terms of oil and gas resources. Modern medicine and healthcare facilities have recently arrived in the GCC countries; their health services have improved dramatically. As a consequence much more medicallhealthcare waste is being generated. Thus, the concept of medicallhealthcare waste, as well as the concern with such type of waste, have become new issues for these countries. This research focuses on healthcare/medical waste management in the GCC countries, taking the UAE as a case study. As these countries have changed dramatically and become wealthy very recently and rapidly, there has been no comprehensive or accurate literature or research on waste management systems in these countries and none related to medical waste management. Record keeping in hospitals/healthcare facilities or at waste facilities are not necessarily of a good standard because of the lack of monitoring and enforcement. Therefore, reports by government authorities or consultancy companies are neither comprehensive nor precise. An extensive field work inspection was conducted in hospitals and other healthcare facilities as well as to waste facilities, including waste contractors' facilities and waste dumpsite in Abu Dhabi Emirate, to explore the problems and failures in the management of medicallhealthcare waste that currently exist. Furthermore, a survey was conducted to a wide range of healthcare and waste facilities' workers to identify their knowledge, skills, attitudes and training regarding the handling practices and the management of medicallhealthcare waste. The inspections and surveys revealed that the problem is a managerial one not a technical one. State-of-the-art technology is affordable and can be purchased from any where in the world to be used for the treatment and management of medicallhealthcare waste. But as these societies have been changed from a tribal form to industrialized modern ones in a short time frame, they have not had the opportunity to develop management systems that go hand in hand with any modem technology that would be obtained; for example, training skilled personnel to deal with the rapidly changing situation. Consequently, these countries have to rely on immigrant personnel whom are brought from low cost countries. Various ranges of slulled, semi-skilled, and unskilled workers come to the UAE, and other GCC countries, to work in hospitals and elsewhere. The professional or skilled personnel who are brought to work in healthcare facilities have knowledge of hazardous-healthcare waste. But this is not the case with the poorly skilled or unskilled workers who work as waste handlers either in hospitals/healthcare facilities, waste contractors' facilities, or waste dumpsite. They have neither knowledge nor have the skills to handle hazardous waste. Moreover, the survey results reveal that both types of workers (i.e. skilled and unskilled) were not specifically trained to have the skills for handling such waste. They even do not have the awareness on most issues related to the medicalkealthcare waste treatment and management practices in Abu Dhabi emirate. As this research will illustrate these workers need training. A best management practice model for medicallhealthcare waste has been discovered in the Queensland experience, Australia. This has been taken as a yardstick to be followed in Abu Dhabi Emirate and the other Emirates and GCC countries. An environmental management system, based on both the Queensland model and the literature has been developed for hospitalslhealthcare facilities, waste contractors and waste dumpsite in Abu Dhabi. Once the lack of waste management knowledge was identified through the survey, it became apparent that a novel and fundamental feature of the environmental management system was training. A model waste tracking system for the hazardous-medical waste has been developed for Abu Dhabi based on the Queensland model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158496</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Thirty-two Major Marks of a Buddha</field><field name="creator">Stiebritz, Rudi</field><field name="description">The research of this dissertation focuses on the Thirty-two Major Marks (Sanskrit laksana, Pali lakkhana) of the physical body of the Buddha. According to Indian tradition these marks are already present at birth of any Great Personality or Great Being (Mahiipurusa), and they are also characteristics of the Buddha. Although the special marks (laksana) of a Great Being (Mahiipurusa) were present in many earlier Indian traditions even before the Buddha, all Buddhist schools developed this important concept further and the Thirty-two Marks of a Great Man (Sanskrit Mahiipurusalaksana, Pali Mahiipurisalakkhana) became a very important aspect of the buddha concept in all Buddhist traditions. The main purpose of this study is to investigate and compare the variations and differences in the descriptions and understanding of the Major Marks of the Great Man (Mahiipuvusa) as given in the texts of the early Theravada Buddhist tradition and the later Mahayana tradition of Northern India and Tibet. Such comparative research, using the Theravada and Tibetan sources, has to my knowledge not been done up tp date and it is the first attempt to analyse the descriptions of bodily marks of the Buddha, their karmic causes and the differences in their relative importance for the Theravada and the Tibetan Buddhist traditions.

Consequently, a real step forward in arc-magmatism research requires that the source (e.g., mafic or felsic crust, crustal melts or cumnlates, old or young crust, etc), mechanism (e.g., cumulate recycling, magma mixing, etc), location (upper or lower crust) and timing of crustal contamination be constrained. Accordingly, these parameters are targeted in this research into the modification of arc magmas by assimilation of crustal melt and mafic cumulates. The research conducted here is focused on the oldestpresewed record of Quaternary volcanism at the Tatara-San Pedro complex (TSPC), Chilean Andes. The 925-826 ka Mnrioz sequence is composed of two voluminous silicic units, the Mnrioz Dacite and Los Lnnes Rhyolite, and intercalated Sin Nombre mafic lavas and laharic breccias. The dacite, rhyodacite (a crystal-rich facies of the rhyolite) and rhyolite have trace-element characteristics that are consistent with gross contamination by a high Ba/Y and Rb/Y crustal source. The basalts and basaltic andesites are remarkably heterogeneous and comprise two important endmembers in the compositional range of mafic and intermediate lavas at the TSPC, including a high-Mg-number (-60) basaltic andesite and low-Mg-number (40-50) basalts. To improve constraints on mafic cumulate recycling and crustal melting, and the impact of these processes on arc magmas, the strategy employed here involves highresolution (textural, chemical and isotopic) interrogation of the mineral phases and matrix glass/gronndmass, set within an existing comprehensive stratigraphic, chemical and isotopic framework. Crystal-rich basalts and basaltic andesites, with variably disaggregated gabbroic inclusions, are the focus of investigation into the assimilation of mafic and ultramafic cumnlates. In these mafic lavas, coarse crystals of plagioclase, olivine and clinopyroxene have compositions similar to those in the crystal clots and have 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.70407- 0.70408) distinctly lower than the gronndmass (0.70415); thus, these coarse crystals are interpreted to be disaggregated from the gabbroic inclusions. This cumulate debris, which comprises 43 vol. % of the bulk-rock, is inferred to originate from a high-alumina basalt that crystallised under relatively cool (-110O0C), water-rich conditions (-6 wt%). In contrast, the host magma, as represented by gronndmass phases and crystal rims, was a hot (-1240&#176;C) dry (-2 wt% H,O) Fe-rich basaltic andesite with a modzfied Sr-isotopic composition. Dehydration melting along grain boundaries facilitated disaggregation of cumnlates, and incorporation of these interstitial melts resulted in various elemental (particularly incompatible) enrichments to the host liquid. Conversely, variable retention of refractory xenocrysts (primarily olivine, clinoproxene andplagioclase) drew the bulk-composition back towards a relatively MgO-rich and CaO-rich composition. Dzffusion modelling of zoning patterns in olivine andpyroxene indicate that entrainment and partial digestion of these mafic cumnlates occurred less than a year before eruption. The silicic magmas display chemical characteristics that are most consistent with an origin by partial melting of a gabbroic lithology, and so provide insight into crustal contamination of mafic magmas by assimilation of crustal melt. Relatively high K, Rb and Ba, low Y concentrations, and MREE depletion in these silicic magmas results from partial melting of gabbro that initially contained amphibole and phlogopite. Low to moderate degrees of partial melting, under water-undersaturated conditions, produced dacitic to rhyolitic melt and restite dominated by plagioclase and amphibole with minor orthopyroxene and magnetite. Fragments of this restite (amphibole, calcic plagioclase, Mg-rich biotite, phlogopite, orthopyroxene, ilmenite/magnetite) preserved in the silicic magmas reveal that partial melting occurred within the middle crust (-350 to 450 MPa). Partial melting at these relatively low pressures is dzfficult to envisage unless the gabbro was still relatively hot. Consequently, the silicic-melt protolith was probably composed of young water-rich mafic magmas that had stalled and crystallised within the middle crust. The Mg-number of restitic phlogopite (-87) is consistent with generation under relatively high water contents (12% H,O). As such thephlogopite may have formed as water-rich melt infiltrated and reacted with refractory minerals (such as orthopyroxene) within a mafzc cumulate pile; subsequent partial melting of this cumulate pile produced the silicic melts. In most cases, generation of silicic magmas is followed shortly thereafter by eruption (e.g., Z30Th-corrected Z38UfWPb zircon age within error of the 40Ar/39Ar eruption age), with only the rhyolite apparently stalling at shallow crustal levels ( 4 0 MPa). Therefore, interaction between ascending mafic magmas and crustally derived silicic magmas may be largely confined to the middle crust. Crystal-poor basaltic-andesite lava, with a chemical signature consistent with hybridisation through assimilation of silicic magma (e.g., unusually low TiO,, low Fe,O, and P,O, and high MgO, CaO and K,O), is used to illustrate the progressive contamination of a mantle-derived basalt during migration up the crustal column. This water-rich basalt (Mgnumber &gt;60 and 87Sr/86Sr &lt; 0.70387) contained forsterite-rich olivine (&lt; Fo,) and calcic plagioclase (An,,); olivine that had crystallised at the base of the crust or within the mantle (pressures derivedfrom Na-rich pargasite inclusions and variably crystallised melt inclusions containing Al-rich pyroxenes). At mid-crustal levels, large-scale contamination of the basalt occurred as it assimilated crustally derived silicic magma (mass balance estimates suggest -70% basalt and -30% dacite-rhyolite). This silicic magma had high Ba, Rb and K, and low Y concentrations and contained phenocrysts of relatively sodic plagioclase (An,,,,). In addition, the silicic magma contained fragments of restite, including orthopyroxenephlogopite crystal clots and calcic plagioclase. DzfSusion modelling of zoning patterns in olivine indicates that magma hybridisation occurred in the order of years prior to eruption. The hybrid magma also incorporated relatively Fe-rich olivine and clinopyroxene detrital fragments with conspicuously high 87Sr/86Sr (-0.7043 to 0.7045) in the weeks prior to eruption. The 87Sr/86Sratios of these xenocrysts and microxenoliths are within the range of the TSPC subvolcanic basement lithologies, possibly indicative of an upper crustal origin. In conclusion, in these arc magmas the crustal imprint was predominantly imparted as ascending basalt assimilated young precursor mafic magmas in the middle crust. Contamination occurred by direct assimilation, such as recycling of mafic cumulates, or indirectly as melts produced from these mafzc cumulates were incorporated (e.g., during magma mixing with crustally derived silicic magmas).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158498</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A New Institutional Economics (NIE) Framework for the Urban Informal Sector in Colombo, Sri Lanka</field><field name="creator">Shuaib, Ahmed Fikreth</field><field name="description">This thesis is about understanding the Urban Informal Sector (UIS)' phenomenon in Colombo, Sri Lanka. While there has been much debate about the UIS in developing countries, including Sri Lanka, it is evident that there has only limited research into ways to identify its importance and to find pragmatic ways to support it. Nowhere in Sri Lanka is the importance of the UIS more evident than in the urban landscape of Colombo City - the largest urban center and the commercial capital. In fact, the UIS is indispensable to Colombo, so much so that Sanderatne (1 99 1 :7 1) states that 'indeed, without the informal sector, food supply would diminish to famine levels, transport would grind to a halt, and urban basic needs such as food and clothing would be unaffordable for the majority of urban dwellers'. The UIS in developing cities like Colombo has increasingly been recognised as a key to promoting economic growth and employment to reducing poverty. However, at the same time, the UIS also poses serious problems including traffic congestion, public health and hygiene, and it is often seen as an eye-sore. In addition, UIS workers themselves face a number of problems as a result of a hostile institutional environment including: lack of legal status; poor access to resources, markets and services; and harassment and/or eviction. The role of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) and its ability to manage the UIS in Colombo City presents similar problems to the sector's management in most cities in developing countries. Much of CMC's problems associated with the UIS emanate from the institutional arrangements. The problems can be identified in the roles of the various 'players' in the city and their rules and regulations, and how these are enforced through incentives and transaction cost which in turn impact on the UIS. Whilst a number of theories are on offer to address these problems, the powerful concepts embodied in the theoretical foundations of the New Institutional ~conomics~ (NIE) provided the most promising framework. These NIE concepts include: 'players of the game' (including their assumptions and objectives); and 'rules of the game' (including their incentives and transaction costs). Based on these concepts, a NIE framework applicable to the UIS was formulated. This thesis adopts the case study research strategy propounded by Yin (2003) which entails a detailed qualitative analysis of selected case studies. Three case studies have been selected in Colombo, viz. street vendors, home-based workers and collectors of recyclable materials (botal pattaray). The qualitative data for analysing each of the three case studies has been derived from two sources. Firstly, through formal interviews and informal discussions with relevant players such as the CMC (eg. Mayor; Municipal Members of Council; and various departments and divisions); nationallcentral and provincial government ministries and departments; non-governmental organisations; media; private sector; trade unions; academic and research organisations; politicians; international organisations; the police; and the general public. Secondly, the results of these interviews have been checked for credibility, and where possible have been supported by, documentary evidence such as policies, regulations and newspaper articles. The qualitative data obtained through this method has then been organised and presented using the NVivo software. This NIE framework was then applied to each of the three selected case studies. The principal findings from the case study analysis are: first, the need to introduce a new assumption (referred to as socio-cultural orientation) that governs player behaviour; second, the distinction between formally espoused objectives and informal objectives followed by the players; third, the emergence of 'informal' players and their informally crafted rules that impact on the UIS; and finally, this study has demonstrated that the ' ~ a l ' rules that govern player behaviour rest in the complex relationship between the formal and informal 'rules of the game', and this relationship between the two sets of rules could be either 'substitutive' or 'complementary'. Using the principal findings from the case studies, the thesis proposes extensions to the NIE framework. The resultant framework from this study has important implications for urban local authorities in developing countries, particularly as an urban planning tool that can be used to understand and successfully manage the UIS. Areas for new research emanating from this study are also outlined.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158499</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growing a sense of place: Storythread and the transformation of a school</field><field name="creator">Tooth, Ronald Clifford</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational change</field><field name="subject">School management and organization</field><field name="subject">School improvement programs</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158500</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finding clues to the function of the unknown Arabidopsis gene AT2G47270</field><field name="creator">Ferris, Rebecca Leigh</field><field name="description">The sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome and the generation of multiple EST libraries has provided the scientific community with a huge amount of sequence information and has spurred the development of methods that can use this information to ascertain gene function. One such approach, undertaken in our laboratory, involved over-expressing or downregulating 89 different ESTs under the control of the 35S promoter and scouring the transgenic plants produced for growth abnormalities. The plentiful phenotype is the result of the over-expression of AT2G47270 and was one of the six abnormal phenotypes produced by the above approach. The plentiful phenotype is pleiotropic and has similarities to a large number of characterised mutants with shorter hypocotyls and roots, smaller, rounder rosette leaves and shorter inflorescences with reduced apical dominance. The shorter hypocotyls and roots of plentiful are due to a decrease in cell elongation and visual inspection of stem epidermal cells suggest that cell elongation is also reduced in plentiful inflorescences. Although our results suggest that cell expansion is reduced in plentiful rosette leaves, further evidence is required to determine whether cell elongation, cell division or both is reduced in plentiful. Downregulation of the PLENTIFUL gene was attempted using an RNAi approach but none of the transgenic lines showed a decrease in PLENTIFUL mRNA levels. Among the mutants with similarities to plentiful are those that have altered synthesis, sensitivity or response to the plant hormones auxin, ethylene, gibberellins, abscisic acid and brassinosteroids. The response of plentiful to IAA, the auxin transport inhibitor NPA, ethylene, the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor AVG, gibberellin, the gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol and abscisic acid were assayed. Results suggest that plentiful has a decreased response to auxin, ethylene, gibberellin and abscisic acid. Time constraints dictated that experiments assaying plentiful&#146;s response to brassinosteroids could not be performed. The expression pattern of a gene provides clues to its function. To this end, the expression pattern of PLENTIFUL was examined using a promoter-GUS fusion. The expression pattern of PLENTIFUL suggests a role in plant senescence. PLENTIFUL is expressed in aging rosette leaves, floral organs increasing with flower age, in the abscission zones of floral organs, in the valve tissue of siliques and in young primary and lateral roots. The expression pattern of PLENTIFUL in younger roots appears to contradict a role in plant senescence but may be explained if PLENTIFUL has a role in tissue desiccation or nutrient cycling. PLENTIFUL may be involved in nutrient mobilisation in senescing tissues and nutrient uptake in the root system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158501</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing Self-Reliance in Australian defence and alliance policy, 1966-2006</field><field name="creator">Lankowski, Michael James</field><field name="description">Self-Reliance has been a central principle of Australian defence and alliance policy since the Vietnam War. Since the late 1990s, however, the concept&#146;s influence on policy has become less dominant, as the Howard Government has developed a new national security strategy, and as analytical critiques of the Defence of Australia (DOA) strategic model have gained greater traction. This dissertation poses two questions about Self-Reliance in Australian defence and alliance policy. Firstly, it asks what were the strengths and weaknesses of Self-Reliance during its development and implementation from the late 1960s to the present. Identifying these strengths and weaknesses offers insight into the current status of Self-Reliance and its future viability. Following from that assessment, the thesis then asks if it is feasible for Australia to pursue a new concept of Self-Reliance compatible with enhanced US-Australian strategic interdependence and increased commitments to regional and global security. The initial hypothesis of this thesis is that Self-Reliance has demonstrated several key strengths by promoting concepts of national responsibility, agency and capability in Australian strategic policy. Yet the thesis argues also that Self-Reliance has exhibited serious weaknesses, related largely to the limitations of the DOA model. These weaknesses have become particularly inhibiting for Australian defence and alliance policy in the contemporary security environment. Self-Reliance as a basic principle has been sound but its implementation has been flawed. This leads to the second major hypothesis regarding the feasibility of a new concept of Self-Reliance compatible with enhanced US-Australian strategic interdependence and increased commitments to regional and global security. The thesis proposes that such a concept is feasible, based on the integration of Self-Reliance&#146;s core principles with a broader policy framework of strategic guidance and alliance/coalition cooperation. The thesis examines the development, consolidation and revision of Self- Reliance during 1966-2006. Chapter Three (1966-1972) examines the decline of &#145;Forward Defence&#146; and problems that constrained the development of Self-Reliance as an effective strategic concept. Chapter Four (1972-1983) examines how the Whitlam and Fraser Governments adopted different approaches to security policy, including the conceptualisation of Self-Reliance. It finds that the Fraser Government&#146;s approach was the stronger and more successful of the two, but strategic guidance and policy implementation were critical weaknesses in both Governments&#146; approaches to Self-Reliance. Chapter Five (1983-1996) examines the consolidation of Self-Reliance under the Hawke and Keating Governments, in the context of managing problems in the ANZUS alliance and complementing Asian engagement. Although this effort achieved significant progress, it was compromised by major conceptual and practical weaknesses in the DOA model adopted during this period. Chapter Six (1996-2006) examines how the Howard Government gradually articulated a new defence policy to synthesise Self-Reliance with a more active military posture and enhanced security interdependence with America. Chapter Seven assesses the major findings in previous chapters and summarises the major strengths and weaknesses of Self-Reliance. It concludes that the concept of Self-Reliance has demonstrated strengths that have benefited Australian defence and alliance policy, including a positive conceptual emphasis on &#145;self-help&#146;, clarity of policy guidance and setting a sound baseline for capability development. Against this, the DOA model used to implement the concept has been characterised by an excessively restrictive approach to strategy, capability development and security cooperation. Nor has the traditional approach to Self-Reliance guaranteed political commitments to provide adequate resources for defence. Accordingly, the thesis outlines a new concept of Self-Reliance within an integrated strategy that balances immediate regional, wider regional and global security interests. This new, reconfigured concept of Self-Reliance would not have the overarching quality of its previous manifestation but would instead complement emerging policy concepts of strategic interdependence and proactive engagement. This concept is better suited to the contemporary security environment. Ideally, it would promote also a synthesis between the competing traditions of interdependence and independence in Australian strategic culture.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158502</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EMPLOYEES&#146; PERCEPTIONS OF MULTINATIONAL ORGANIZATIONAL PRACTICES IN INDONESIA: CULTURAL DIFFERENCES AND SOCIAL IDENTITY</field><field name="creator">Dahesihsari, Rayini</field><field name="description">While there are a number of multinational corporations (MNCs) operating in Indonesia, only a few studies have addressed the issue of Indonesian employees&#146; work experiences in MNCs. How Indonesian employees perceive the foreign management practices within MNCs, and how these perceptions affect their work attitudes and behaviour remains unexplored. This research project is designed to investigate Indonesian employees&#146; perceptions of MNCs. More specifically, it examines the role of cultural differences and social identity in employees&#146; perceptions of MNCs and psychological climate, the mediating role of their perceptions of managers&#146; communication behaviour, and the impact of these on organizational identification and employee outcomes. The over-arching conceptual framework adopted for the study is that of Social Identity Theory. To achieve these objectives, this research used a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, including a survey and interviews. Three organizations with headquarters in Jakarta were selected for study; each of them had experienced recent organizational change connected with the multinational nature of the company and had different industry backgrounds and different origins of the parent company. Two hundred and six participants (all volunteers) from the subsidiaries of these three MNCs participated in this research. Initially, pilot interviews were conducted with a small number of people, selected using maximum variation sampling, to explore the organizational context and to establish the salient issues related to the cultural context of an MNC in Indonesia. After that, a survey was carried out with employees at all levels of the three organizations, to test hypotheses and to assess the generality of the findings uncovered by the interviews. Post-survey interviews were also conducted, to develop a deeper understanding of the variables examined in the survey and the complexity and contradictions in the data. Finally, follow-up interviews were conducted to clarify the results of the survey and to explore them further. All the interviews were examined through thematic analyses. Statistical procedures used included multiple regression analyses for each organization and for the entire data set. In general, the national employees had positive views of MNCs. They sought identification with the foreign management, which offered them a high status. The research also provides evidence that cultural differences and social identity influenced Indonesian employees&#146; perceptions of MNCs and psychological climate, leading to differences in organizational identification and employee outcomes. Issues of differences between Indonesian and MNC values were salient in all three organizations. There were a number of values, such as ethics, safety and direct style of communication, which raised cultural barriers to national employees in reaching MNC practice standards, demonstrating that it is important for MNCs to be culturally in tune with local customs and consistent with local expectations. Cultural differences have been found to be one of the main sources of perceptual bias in MNC practices and have been cited as a major reason for any problems that exist in MNCs. However, this research shows that cultural differences are able to be bridged by the adaptive fit to the multinational work environment that has been exhibited by national employees. A strong motivation to adapt helped employees to improve their understanding and acceptance of the specific cultural differences of MNC management practices. This led to positive views of foreign management practices, psychological climate, a strong organizational identification and positive employee outcomes. This research highlights the importance of managing the balance of power and of reaching relatively equal status between Indonesian employees and expatriates in organizational practice. Rather than MNC status, or foreign management practices per se, it was power imbalance that resulted in an intergroup climate based on national culture. The salience of cultural identity was thus an effect of inequality and power imbalance between expatriates and national employees in the organization. This study indicates that accommodative communication displayed by expatriate and national managers contributed to positive perceptions of MNCs and psychological climate, by bridging the differences in cultural values between the MNC and local employees. On the other hand, where managers&#146; communicative behaviour accentuated the gap and segregation between expatriates and national employees, this was likely to play an important role in stimulating cultural identification. The study also demonstrates that perceptions of foreign management practices affect employees&#146; work attitudes and behaviour. Perceptions of MNCs, psychological climate and organizational identification were significantly associated with employee outcomes (with the exception of intention to leave). In summary, this research suggests that the intergroup approach offers a sound framework for understanding Indonesian employees&#146; perceptions of differences in values and practice in the subsidiaries of multinational corporations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158503</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic variation in Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis: Virulence profiling and lateral gene transfer</field><field name="creator">Davies, Mark Robert</field><field name="description">The genus Streptococcus encompasses a range of species that have long been recognized as normal flora or pathogens of humans and other mammals. Due to its medical importance, group A streptococcus (GAS) is the most extensively studied species within the beta-hemolytic clade of the genus. In contrast, analyses of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (human group C and G streptococci, GCS/GGS), a close genetic relative of GAS have been minimal. GCS/GGS is historically described as a commensal organism or an opportunistic pathogen of humans. However, in recent years there has been an increase in reports associating GCS/GGS with diseases that clinically resemble those associated with GAS infection. Other studies have reported GCS/GGS to harbor &#145;classical&#146; group A streptococcal virulence factors which may have been acquired through inter-species lateral gene transfers (LGT). LGTs are of significant epidemiological and clinical importance as they may enable GCS/GGS to acquire genetic factors that assist in efficient colonization and survival in the host; thus, leading to pathogenic processes. In this study two approaches were employed to examine the difference in the genetic repertoire of clinical GCS/GGS. Firstly, representational difference analysis (RDA), was used to identify genomic differences that exist between a pathogenic GGS strain (NS3396) isolated from a patient presenting with recurrent acute pharyngitis that subsequently with acute theumatic fever, and a community isolate (GGS10) purported to be of low pathogenic potential. Through RDA, 125 DNA fragments present in NS3396, but absent in GGS10 were identified. Bioinformatical analysis revealed that these DNA fragments encode for 79 different gene sequences of which 35.4% were homologous to GAS and 34% to GBS. Strikingly, more than 80% of these homologues were associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs), particularly phage-like elements from GAS and transposon-like sequences from GBS. Further characterization of the phage-like and transposon-like elements resulted in the first complete nucleotide sequences of a bacteriophage (&#934;3396) and integrative conjugative element (ICESde3396) from GCS/GGS. &#934;3396 is 38.5 kb mitomycininducible bacteriophage with homology to previously described GAS &#934;315.1 family of bacteriophages. ICESde3396 is a 63.7 kb ICE harbouring up to six heavy metal resistance operons. Annotation of these genomes provided evidence of recombination events within these MGEs. In a PCR screening survey of 21 GGS and 22 GAS unrelated isolates as judged by emm-typing, only those from the GAS-endemic region harbored the &#934;3396-like phage. Thus, providing evidence that inter-species LGTs are ongoing in nature and are likely to be more frequent in regions of high GAS endemicity. Such events may have significant effects on the overall population structure of the genus and may result in rapid evolution of pathogenic streptococcal species. Due to the overlapping similarity of disease profiles and indentical colonizing sites of GAS and GCS/GGS, it is suggested that these organisms share disease causing genetic attributes. Therefore, in the second approach, a targeted microarray was used to investigate the distribution of GAS virulence genes in GCS/GGS. The array represented 218 genes encoding GAS virulence factors and/or putative extracellular proteins in a panel of 58 human GCS/GGS isolates, including 18 invasive disease isolates. One-hundred and five of the 218 genes were found in at least one GCS/GGS isolate, with each strain possessing between 23% to 45% of the genes represented on the array. However, no gene(s) were identified that correlated with invasive disease emphasizing the complexity of disease pathogenicity. Additionally, none of the classical superantigenic exotoxin genes purported to be involved in GAS invasive disease were detected in the 58 GCS/GGS isolates. Hierarchical clustering of GCS/GGS based on gene content also supports the proposition that human group C and G streptococci are genetically indistinguishable. However, the findings also suggest that two distinct lineages independent of group carbohydrate exist within GCS/GGS. These lineages are distinguished by 35 genes of which all are chromosomally encoded in GAS. Collectively, this study enabled unique insights into the genetic makeup of group C and G streptococci and their effect on the epidemiology of streptococcal diseases, especially in regions endemic for GAS infection.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158504</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parenting, Songwriting and Violence: Perceptions of Participants in Three Parenting Groups</field><field name="creator">Bruderer, Helen Margaret</field><field name="description">Parenting is a complex function for even well-resourced parents. For parents who have experienced abuse in their own childhoods it is often more difficult to understand and meet the needs of their children. Parenting education programs generally provide education relating to childhood development as well as teaching underlying principles about children's behaviour and other specific skills or strategies for managing children. The parenting program discussed in this thesis aimed to not only address the issues impacting on the parents' ability to parent safely and effectively but also give the parents an opportunity to find their voice and tell of the abuse that they endured throughout their childhood, and for the majority of the participants, throughout their adult relationships and its impact on their parenting. This thesis reports on participants' experiences in a parenting program for mothers andlor expectant mothers who had experienced abuse in their own childhood and who were identified as having harmed or were 'at risk' of harming their children. The program used the music therapy technique of song-writing as a tool to assist the participants to reveal their experiences, feelings and fears. The songs and verse written by the participants either individually or as a group were recorded onto compact disc. It was an educative and therapeutic approach to parenting. The project consisted of three parenting programs. Each program ran over a period of twelve weeks in a community venue in the northern suburbs of Brisbane. Qualitative methods were implemented in this exploratory study to gain the perspectives of 20 participants. Data were collected through focus groups and questionnaires. Participants overwhelmingly perceived their experiences as positive. They reported growth both personally and in their parenting practices. Participants perceived that the group environment was respectful wherein they felt safe and reported that they were listened to and believed. The study suggests parenting programs aimed at vulnerable parents need to be both educative and therapeutic. Meeting the needs of the parents is paramount to parents being able to meet the needs of their children that then reduce the risk of harm to the children. The study further identified that listening is a key skill in the facilitation of these programs, and being non-judgemental was identified as a core value for facilitators. To witness the women's journeys over 12 weeks was like witnessing a "rebirthing". The women were determined to change their lives for the betterment of their children, moving from being consumed by their powerlessness and hopelessness, and fuelled by anger, to being able to identify not only the needs and rights of their children but determined that these needs are met and their rights are upheld.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158505</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dimensional analysis approach to the scale-up and modelling of industrial screens</field><field name="creator">Hilden, Marko Mikael</field><field name="description">Screen modelling has traditionally been based on rudimentary empirical &#8216;factor&#8217; methods, or semi-empirical data-fitting techniques. Both of these methods have significant limitations in practice, and industrial screen optimization remains somewhat of an &#8216;art&#8217;. This thesis introduces the concept of dimensional analysis and scale model similitude to the problem of modelling vibrating screens. This leads to a new method of modelling industrial screens. A small-scale screen can be built at a more convenient scale in the laboratory, and used to predict the performance of a large industrial scale machine. Verification of the scaling theory is based on three separate methods: 1. Firstly, the scaling theory is developed by analysing particle-level forces acting in a dry granular system. It is shown that scale-up of granular systems can be achieved using Froude scaling: that is, if the geometry and operating variables in an experiment are scaled in a pre-defined manner, the behaviour of the particles in the full-scale can be predicted from the behaviour of the particles at the smaller scale. 2. Secondly, the scaling rules are applied to a number of idealized granular systems using numerical simulations via the discrete element method (DEM). The granular systems modelled include inclined vibrating feeders and inclined vibrating screens. It is found that simulations performed at different scales yield almost identical dimensionless responses when the geometry and operating conditions are scaled according to Froude scaling rules. 3. Thirdly, the scaling rules are applied to modelling physical screening data. A dataset obtained from a larger pilot-scale screen in a thesis by R. De Pretto (1992) is reproduced at a smaller scale in this thesis using a purpose-built laboratory-scale screen. The throughput, efficiency curves and cut size are shown to be predictable at all feed rates, despite the former dataset being based on a screen with a feed sample size of around 5000 kg per test and the latter dataset obtained using a feed sample size of less than 30 kg per test. The thesis also touches on modelling the screening efficiency curves. A fully dimensionless version of the proven and familiar Whiten screen model is proposed. Finally, some of the further possibilities of this theory are discussed briefly in a section on further work; these include further applications of the Screening Physical Model and the application of Froude scaling to the modelling of other granular systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158506</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Establishment risk modelling of invasive organisms: Solenopsis invicta as a case study</field><field name="creator">George, Charles Raymond Robert</field><field name="description">1. lnvasive species are a growing threat to global biodiversity and economic systems. Over the past decade, researchers have become increasingly interested in predicting sites at risk of establishment by invasive species. Establishment risk assessment can increase the efficiency and viability of sampling and control programs. However, the task of prediction is complex because of issues including: ecological interpretation, data availability, statistical model design, model evaluation, and working within complex anthropogenic frameworks. Consequently, one cannot predict with certainty the probability that an invasive pest will establish a site. I examine methodological gaps contributing to this problem using the invasive organism, Solenopsis invicta, the red imported fire ant, as a case study. 2. 1 address the problems of building predictive models designed for sampling and control purposes across four experimental chapters. First, I propose methods for assessing risks using ranked probabilistic models and high resolution multispectral remote sensed imagery. I integrate empirical, mechanistic, and cross-evaluation methods to resolve biological issues involving variably scaled dispersal processes. Second, I devise a method for evaluating the performance of the statistical component of a species distribution model. I characterise similarities and differences in the predicted fits of a ranked probabilistic model and a generalised additive model. This provides information regarding how confident we can be in each model. Third, I propose methods for testing the performance of high resolution predictive models when applied to new locations (that is, generalisability testing). Despite the propensity of invasive pests to disperse great distances, researchers rarely evaluate invasive species models for long distance generalisability. I examine how well locally fitted ranked probabilistic and generalised additive models predict an invasion in Hong Kong, China; I compare this with the performance of models extrapolated from Queensland, Australia. I propose a method for applying models over large distances that can guide control and eradication programs whilst assisting in the development of locally fitted models. Fourth, I identify 'sites' at risk of establishment from an anthropogenic viewpoint relevant to control and eradication programs. Specifically, I create a vector-based very high resolution establishment risk model from Quickbird imagery that is compatible with cadastral data. 3. 1 demonstrate numerous original outcomes.

Private sector investment in agricultural research institutions in developed countries averaged 55.2% of the total invested in 2000 while, in the same year, the investment in agricultural research in developing countries by the private sector was only six percent. In Brazil the government invested about 95% of the funds spent on agricultural research, while the private sector invested the balance. However, this study shows that, over the past 15 years, investment by the Brazilian government in agricultural research institutions has been declining, indicating that the government has not been able to maintain its capacity to invest in agricultural research activities. In recent years, the government has been signalling to the community, through the creation of legal instruments, the necessity of increasing private sector participation in the agricultural research and development process. This study endeavoured to identify why Brazilian agribusiness is still not participating as effectively as it might. The study was carried out to define what needs to be changed, and how to promote these changes, to increase private sector participation in agricultural research, and to improve the performance of the Brazilian agricultural research system. This issue was analysed by surveying stakeholders from two different industries in Brazil: cotton and dairy. The thesis is presented in three parts. The first part introduces the study and describes the analytical methods used in this research. In the second part, there is a descriptive analysis of the Brazilian Agricultural Research System, a comparative analysis of various international and other national R&amp;D systems, and an overview of the global markets for agricultural commodities and business environment in which Brazilian agribusiness companies operate. The third part presents the results from three focus group meetings analysis of and an electronic survey of 405 stakeholders in the Brazilian cotton and dairy industries. About 77% of respondents were from the private sector and 23% from the public sector. A prescriptive analysis of measures to improve participation by the private sector in the Brazilian agricultural research system is then presented. Finally, recommendations from the study are presented in four sections: Section 1 makes recommendations to develop and implement policies necessary to improve the Brazilian science and technology system which involves the entire government sector. Section 2 presents recommendations to be implemented by both federal and state governments, and also recommends involving the private agricultural companies. Recommendations concerning the restructuring of Embrapa are set out in Section 3, while Section 4 includes recommendations directed to Brazilian agricultural industries. It is believed that adoption of these recommendations this would create better prospects for the Brazilian agricultural research system to service agribusiness as they enter into increasingly competitive domestic and overseas markets.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158508</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbon sequestration in native rainforest tree plantations</field><field name="creator">Richards, Anna Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The recent rapid decline in tropical and subtropical forests and subsequent loss of biodiversity, coupled to the threat posed by climate change, has led to a requirement for sustainable forest systems. Large-scale monocultures supply timber that can no longer be harvested in sufficient quantity from natural forests in subtropical and tropical regions. However, there is a general perception that forest systems need to be managed to provide multiple production and environmental services, including carbon (C) sequestration, restoration of soil fertility, and biodiversity. Overall, traditional plantation monocultures cannot meet all of these new objectives, and native and mixed-species plantations may provide an alternative, when provision of ecosystem services, besides timber, becomes a priority. The objective of this thesis was twofold. Firstly to assess C storage in native rainforest tree (hoop pine, Araucaria cunninghamii) plantations, planted as monocultures in subtropical Australia. Plantations were examined to evaluate their potential as a sustainable forest system for provision of high-value timber products and C sinks. The second objective was to contrast the traditional monoculture system with a multi-species system, and a mixed-species rainforest tree plantation was studied. These systems are receiving substantial attention from private forest growers as they could provide economic benefits, including greater productivity, coupled to biologically desirable outcomes, such as higher biodiversity. The focus of the second objective was to improve the design of mixtures for maximum wood production and C sequestration, so that other ecological benefits could be realised. Subtropical native hoop pine monocultures did not store soil C into long-term storage pools as rapidly as adjacent native rainforest or pastures. In addition, substantial amounts of soil nitrogen were lost from tree plantations, indicating that with current management, these systems may not be sustainable in the long-term. Overall, total C storage, including soil and aboveground biomass C, was higher in tree plantations than pastures highlighting the potential of native tree plantations for C sequestration. The mechanisms behind lower soil C storage of native hoop pine plantations, compared with rainforest and pasture, may be related to differences in soil C stabilization. While native forest and pasture systems stored C within soil aggregates and through organo-mineral interactions, tree plantations did not show a strong aggregate hierarchy and most soil C was associated with mineral-sized particles. Because soil minerals have a limited capacity to adsorb soil organic C, they may limit the C storage capacity of the studied tree plantations. We conclude that changes to management of hoop pine monocultures, such as increasing plant diversity in tree plantations, may create conditions similar to the native forest and promote greater C sequestration in plantation soils by stabilization through both soil aggregation and organomineral interactions. Since traditional monoculture forest production systems may not provide the multiple benefits needed for sustainable forestry, an alternative mixed-species tree plantation was investigated. We examined the dominant paradigm that mixtures of two fast growing species (Grevillea robusta and Elaeocarpus angustifolius) compete for site resources, while mixtures of shade tolerant (Castanospermum australe) and shade intolerant (G. robusta or E. angustifolius) species are complementary. Contrary to predictions, there was evidence for complementary interactions between the fast-growing species in terms of nutrient uptake, nutrient use efficiency and nutrient cycling. Preliminary model simulations of interactions between species for light indicated that G. robusta maintained the highest rates of photosynthesis under different light conditions and may be combined with C. australe and the more light demanding E. angustifolius in mixtures. Overall there was evidence for tree species combinations which could potentially sequester more C, in addition to other benefits including higher biodiversity and improved use of soil resources, in mixed-species plantations. Such knowledge is useful to encourage implementation of these new timber production systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300600 Forestry Sciences</field><field name="subject">300803 Natural Resource Management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158510</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ELECTRICITY MARKET MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS USING ADVANCED DATA MINING AND STATISTICAL METHODS</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Junhua</field><field name="description">The deregulated electricity markets have been in operation in a number of countries since the 1990s. During the deregulation process, vertically integrated power utilities have been reformed into competitive markets, with initial goals to improve the market efficiency, minimize the production cost and reduce the electricity price. Given the benefits that have been achieved by the deregulation, several new challenges are also observed in the market. Due to the fundamental changes of the electric power industry, traditional management and analysis methods cannot deal with these new challenges. Novel electricity market management and analysis methods are therefore needed in the deregulated environment. Data mining is defined as &#147;the nontrivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from data&#148; and &#147;the science of extracting useful information from large data sets&#148;. The modern electricity market produces huge amounts of market data, in which highly useful information can be extracted to facilitate the market management and analysis. In this thesis, I employ data mining together with advanced statistical methods to analyze the data of electricity markets. The data mining and statistical methods are integrated with the market management and analysis techniques to solve several difficult problems in electricity market research. This research aims at developing novel methods to solve several notoriously difficult problems in the deregulated electricity market. The thesis consists of two main parts. The first part deals with extreme price volatility in the electricity market, and the second part studies power system contingency assessment and prediction in the deregulated market environment. In the deregulated electricity market, extreme price volatility, which is also known as the price spike, is one of the major challenges not yet solved. Given their significant influences to market participants, price spike forecast together with normal price prediction are highly important in a competitive electricity market for individual market participants as well as the system operator. In the first part of this thesis, a novel framework is proposed to handle the extreme price volatility caused by electricity price spikes. The framework is based on data mining and computational statistics, thus is able to process the large data amount of electricity price signals. In the framework, feature selection techniques are used to identify relevant factors of price spikes. Classification methods are employed to predict the occurrences of price spikes in the future. Based on the results of spike occurrence prediction, regression and time series models are used to forecast the value of the spike. In addition, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based forecasting model is proposed to estimate the risks involved in price spikes. I also develop a novel approach, namely Bayesian Classifier with Benefit Maximization (BCBM). The BCBM approach integrates the price spike prediction together with decision making of market participants, so as to achieve the maximum decision benefits facing spikes. In addition to the energy market, which is a complex economical system, the physical power system behind the electricity market is an essential integrated part of the overall market as well. In Chapter 7, the problem of power system contingency assessment and prediction is studied. In the deregulated market, the power system is operating under more stressed condition with much more uncertainties in comparison to the past. Following the recent devastating blackouts in USA, UK and Russia, power system stability analysis and contingency prediction has attracted significant attention from both the academic society and industry. In this thesis, a novel method developed for power system contingency prediction is reported. The proposed method consists of two major stages. In the first stage, a novel type of patterns namely Local Correlation Network Pattern (LCNP) is mined from the structure and system variables of the power system. Correlation rules, which are useful for the network operator to locate potentially instable components, can be further generated from the LCNP. In the second stage, a kernel based classification method is developed to predict the system instability. By testing on a real-world power network (the New England system), I demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in predicting system contingency and thus highly useful for blackout prevention. In summary, the major contributions of this thesis includes a price spike forecasting framework, a comprehensive empirical study of feature selection in electricity price forecasting, a novel statistical method for estimating the risks of electricity prices, a data mining based approach for making decisions on spikes, and a data mining based approach for power system contingency analysis. This research is finished with 14 publications in major international journals and conferences.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158511</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The behaviour and physiology of the gravid flatback turtle (Natator depressus)</field><field name="creator">Sperling, Jannie Bech</field><field name="description">The study describes for the first time the detailed behaviour of flatback sea turtles (Natator depressus) between nesting events within the same season. It includes both horizontal and vertical movements, obtained through satellite telemetry and with Time-Depth-Recorders, respectively. Two genetically and geographically distinct populations were studied; Curtis Island, Queensland and Bare Sand Island, Northern Territory. While the flatbacks at Bare Sand Island appeared to spread randomly out from the island, the flatbacks at Curtis Island made use of the protected waters of the Gladstone port and harbour area. The flatbacks&#146; vertical movements were compared to that of loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) nesting at Mon Repos Conservation Park, Queensland. Both species spent &lt;10% of their time at or near the surface and displayed dive types that could be referenced to terminology developed for sea turtle species. Most prevalent were dive types 1, 3 and 4, where the first is thought to represent dives during which turtles are inactive on the seabed. In the latter two turtles are thought to slowly ascend in mid-water, as a result of a slow increase in buoyancy, while swimming some distance horizontally. Dive type 1 was by far the most common dive type in the flatback turtle, while dive type 3 was equally as important as type 1 in the loggerhead. Dive type 1 was in both species more common in the middle third of the period, when eggs are maturing. There was some evidence of a diel pattern, with dive type 1 more common during the day in flatbacks and during the night in loggerheads. An important finding was that flatback turtles show long dives, up to 98 min. The mean duration of 50 min for dive type 1 is about twice as long as commonly seen in loggerheads and other large sea turtles, while comparable to the smaller olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) and hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata). Part of the explanation for long dives appears to include an oxygen carrying capacity at the high end of the range for diving reptiles and higher blood oxygen saturation at comparable partial pressures of oxygen. Internesting intervals were correlated negatively with sea temperature in both flatback and loggerhead turtles, but could not be described by a single correlation. The results showed that the modal temperature calculated for the egg maturation part of the interval, i.e. approximately the first nine days, depicts the temperature important to pre-ovipositional egg development better than mean temperature measured over the whole internesting interval.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158512</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of individual specimens Acanthaster planci in low density populations</field><field name="creator">Souter, David William</field><field name="description">This is the first long-term study of A. planci based on repeated observations of recaptured specimens living in three low density populations at Lady Musgrave Island Reef, Heron Island Reef and One Tree Island Reef, situated in the southern Great Barrier Reef. This study describes the growth of adult specimens, their dietary preferences, their feeding rates and their movements over periods ranging from days to more than three years. These data enable the ecology and life history strategy of A. planci in low density populations to be examined in detail for the first time. In addition, the results of this study enable a true comparison of the behaviour of individuals in low density populations with those maintained in the laboratory or comprising outbreaking populations in order to assess the applicability of previously held hypotheses, notions and beliefs concerning this starfish. The mean density of starfish at each reef ranged between 93.7 starfish&#183;km-2 at Heron Island Reef and 535.7 starfish&#183;km-2 at Lady Musgrave Island Reef and was well below that ascribed to outbreaking populations. Each population exhibited adult-dominated, uni-modal size frequency distributions with starfish ranging in size from 27 cm to 59 cm in total diameter. The mean size of starfish sampled within each population did not change significantly over the duration of the study and was 41.9 cm, 44.5 cm and 50.9 cm at Heron Island, One Tree Island and Lady Musgrave Island Reefs respectively. These results indicate that both adult mortality and recruitment within low density populations was low and/or unpredictable. The growth of 59 starfish ranging in size from 28 cm to 59 cm in total diameter and recaptured between 1 and 5 times, was recorded over periods ranging between 65 and 1252 days. The growth of these individuals was extremely plastic with the rates of change in size between encounters ranging between &#150;9.2 mm&#183;month-1 and 18.4 mm&#183;month-1 demonstrating that, in the field, A. planci normally exhibit periods of significant growth and shrinkage, which are interspersed with periods of stasis. Several starfish maintained rapid growth beyond 45 cm in total diameter and many demonstrated that specimens of A. planci have the capacity to grow significantly throughout their entire size range. Although the rate of growth tends to decline with increasing size, many of these starfish maintained large sizes for the duration of the study. This study showed that in habitats where food is not limiting, specimens of A. planci exhibit plastic asymptotic growth where the maximum size of a starfish is likely to be constrained by morphometry and physiological demands, but sub-maximal asymptotes can be temporarily imposed by the various environmental conditions experienced throughout the life of an individual starfish, particularly food availability. The achievement of large body sizes increases fecundity and confers greater resilience to predation and to periods of food limitation. Phenotypically plastic growth enhances the survival and fitness of individuals by allowing them to accommodate changes in environmental conditions throughout their lives. The mean coral consumption of each of 14 recaptured starfish at Lady Musgrave Island Reef ranged between 0 cm2&#183;day-1 and 974 cm2&#183;day-1, while at One Tree Island Reef the feeding rates of 20 starfish ranged between 4 cm2&#183;day-1and 570 cm2&#183;day-1. The majority of individuals did not show significant changes in their feeding rates between encounters or between seasons, although the great variation in the amounts of coral eaten by these starfish each day might have obscured any clear seasonal changes in the feeding rates of these starfish. At Lady Musgrave Island Reef, significant variation in the feeding rates of different individuals was recorded during 2 of 4 field trips and also within both summer and winter. Some of this variation can be attributed to the fact that larger starfish generally consumed more coral than smaller starfish at both reefs. The remaining variation was attributed to differences in the composition of the coral community within the specific habitats occupied by different starfish. Starfish occupying habitats in which preferred corals were abundant generally consumed a smaller area of coral per day suggesting that the return per unit effort foraging on preferred corals is greater, thus increasing the survival and fitness of individuals by reducing the time spent foraging and exposed to predators. The dietary preferences of 43 individuals were investigated. The diets of 10 of these starfish were recorded on multiple occasions. Twenty-four genera of scleractinian coral were recorded in the diet of these starfish. When eaten, Acropora and Seriatopora were universally preferred, while Stylophora was usually preferred and Porites was generally not preferred. Although regularly preyed upon, Montipora was often consumed in similar proportions to its availability. Pocillopora was more acceptable to individuals at One Tree Island Reef than at Lady Musgrave Island Reef and not preferred by any starfish investigated at Heron Island Reef. The dietary preferences of those starfish observed repeatedly did not change significantly between field trips or seasons. Significant variation in preferences between individuals examined during the same trip was uncommon at Lady Musgrave Island Reef and Heron Island Reef but occurred during each field trip conducted at One Tree Island Reef. These results indicate that A. planci does exhibit a hierarchy of preferences for various corals but the stability of this hierarchy is moderated by the dietary experience of the individual and the availability of preferred coral genera, such that when preferred corals, particularly Acropora, are abundant, there is little variation in preferences between individuals or within individuals over time. As the abundance of preferred corals declines, starfish consume a broader range of corals. The foraging behaviour of A. planci is consistent with a time minimising strategy and appears to conform to the predictions of optimal foraging theory. The mean daily displacement of individuals sampled ranged between 0 m&#183;day-1 and 6.8 m&#183;day-1 at Lady Musgrave Island Reef and between 0.2 m&#183;day-1 and 4 m&#183;day-1 at One Tree Island Reef. At both reefs, most starfish did not exhibit significant variation in their daily displacements between field trips or between seasons, but the daily displacements of different individuals varied significantly within 6 of the 7 field trips conducted, and also within summer and winter. Individuals occupying habitats with greater cover of live hard coral tended to exhibit smaller daily displacements. &#145;Homing&#146; to a refuge was common among starfish at Lady Musgrave Island Reef but rare in starfish at One Tree Island Reef. No relationship between starfish size and daily displacement or &#145;homing&#146; frequency was found at either reef. The mean daily displacement of the population sampled at Lady Musgrave Island Reef was significantly greater during summer than during winter, but such seasonal variation was not apparent within the population at One Tree Island Reef. The mean daily displacement of all starfish sampled at One Tree Island Reef was significantly greater than those sampled at Lady Musgrave Island Reef. The daily movements of A. planci in populations of low density are highly plastic and appear to be influenced by the abundance of preferred corals providing food, predation pressure and the cover of live hard coral providing suitable refuges. Over periods ranging between 140 days and 1249 days, individual starfish were relatively stationary. The mean rate of displacement between encounters for 41 starfish recaptured at Lady Musgrave Island Reef was 70.6 m&#183;year-1 and was 43.9 m&#183;year-1 for the 8 starfish recaptured at One Tree Island Reef. At Lady Musgrave Island Reef, almost 30% of recaptures occurred within 10 m of an individual&#146;s last recorded position and overall, greater than 85% of all recaptures occurred within 100 m. The furthest any starfish moved from its point of initial capture was 330 m in 734 days. Starfish that had traversed sandy habitats exhibited greater changes in displacement compared with those that had travelled across coral. Starfish located on reef slopes tended to navigate directional paths, which prevented retracing ground already covered, while the direction of movement of starfish located on reticulated or isolated patch reefs was more random. These results show that specimens of A. planci in populations of low density do not undergo long migrations and could potentially live their entire life within a small area of reef. A. planci demonstrate plastic phenotypic responses in growth and foraging behaviour to varying environmental conditions experienced throughout their life. These characteristics have evolved to counteract unpredictable recruitment while living in low densities by promoting survival and longevity of individual starfish. This allows A. planci to adopt an iteroparous strategy which enhances the fitness of individuals by enabling them adapt the level of reproductive effort to prevailing environmental conditions. Because the life history strategy of A. planci has evolved to ensure survival and longevity of individual starfish, the appearance and persistence of outbreaks is an inevitable consequence of circumstances that facilitate greater than usual fertilisation success. Identifying the mechanisms that might produce &#145;unnaturally&#146; high fertilisation success will be important in determining the causes of primary outbreaks.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158513</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Genetics of Albicidin Resistance and Biosynthesis in Xanthomonas albilineans</field><field name="creator">Hashimi, Saeed Mujahid</field><field name="description">Albicidins produced by Xanthomonas albilineans are key pathogenesis factors in the systemic development of leaf scald disease in sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids). They are also potent bactericidal antibiotics inhibiting prokaryote DNA replication. Low yields have slowed studies into the chemical structure of albicidins, their application as tools to study DNA replication, and their development as clinical antibiotics. Genetic analysis of albicidin biosynthesis and resistance mechanisms may help to overcome these limitations. Previous work used Tn5 mutagenesis to demonstrate that albicidin biosynthetic genes were in at least two gene clusters spanning more than 60 kb in the genome of X. albilineans. This project investigated the molecular genetic basis for albicidin biosynthesis and mechanism of albicidin resistance. The speed and specificity of inhibition of DNA replication by albicidin resemble those of DNA gyrase-inhibiting coumarin and quinolone antibiotics. Here I show that purified albicidin inhibited the in vitro supercoiling activity of E. coli DNA gyrase, with IC50 (40-50 nM) below most coumarins and quinolones. Albicidin blocks religation of the cleaved DNA intermediate during the gyrase catalytic sequence, and also inhibits the relaxation of supercoiled DNA by gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Unlike the coumarins, albicidin does not inhibit the ATPase activity of gyrase. Some mutations in gyrA, known to confer high-level resistance against quinolones or CcdB, confer low-level resistance or hypersensitivity in E. coli against albicidin. Within the albicidin biosynthesis region in X. albilineans is a gene encoding a pentapeptide repeat protein designated AlbG that binds to E. coli DNA gyrase and confers a 6-fold increase in resistance against albicidin in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that DNA gyrase is the molecular target of albicidin, and that X. albilineans encodes a gyrase-interacting protein for self protection. Having established DNA gyrase as the molecular target of albicidin, I sought to clone and purify the Xanthomonas albilineans DNA gyrase subunits. Degenerate primers based on the genome sequences of Xanthomonas campestris and Xanthomonas axonopodis were used to clone GyrA from X. albilineans. Analysis of the X. albilineans GyrA showed that it coded for a polypeptide of 935 aa with high similarity to GyrA from eubacteria. The X. albilineans GyrA contained one difference from the E. coli GyrA (Gln83) at a position previously implicated in quinolone resistance in E. coli. Furthermore, a unique 43 aa insertion and 7 unique aa residues were present in the C-terminal region, known to be involved in DNA wrapping and complex stability, but not previously implicated in antibiotic resistance. GyrB was previously isolated from X. albilineans and shown to have six variant aa residues at positions conserved across other GyrBs, including one difference (Gln136) at a position implicated in coumermycin resistance in E. coli. The cloned X. albilineans Gyrase subunits were isolated as His-tagged fusions after overexpression in E. coli, reconstituted, and shown to have supercoiling activity in vitro. The reconstituted enzyme showed ~10 fold lower sensitivity to albicidin compared to the E. coli control. Interesting, the enzyme also showed ~11 fold lower sensitivity to ciprofloxacin. This cross resistance between albicidin and ciprofloxacin in the X. albilineans DNA gyrase and in E. coli GyrA S83L/W mutants indicates that selection in X. albilineans for albicidin resistance has probably incidentally conferred ciprofloxacin resistance. Bioinformatic analysis of the sequence adjacent to the first-characterised albicidin synthase gene xabB revealed several likely biosynthetic, regulatory, and resistance genes. Interestingly, a previously isolated albicidin efflux pump AlbF was found in this major cluster. Sequence analysis indicated that the operon containing albF features multiple promoters and regulatory binding sites, consistent with the expected need for subtle control of AlbF production to match albicidin biosynthesis with export, while minimising damage from non-specific transport. In the operon adjacent to xabB is a residual transposase sequence thp, followed by a likely O-methyltransferase and an acyl-CoA ligase designated xabE. The predicted product of XabE is a polypeptide of 755 aa similar to benzoate-CoA ligase. Insertional mutagenesis of xabE disrupted albicidin production and complementation restored albicidin production. Furthermore, xabE mutants failed to induce symptoms of leaf scald in maize plants. XabE is likely to be involved in the activation of precursors for albicidin biosynthesis. An operon convergent with xabE contains genes for p-aminobenzoate (pabAB) and phydroxybenzoate (ubiC) biosynthesis. Inactivation of pabAB or ubiC did not block albicidin production. However, X. albilineans contains a second pabB gene which may provide sufficient p-aminobenzoate for albicidin production in artificial culture conditions. High concentration of p-aminobenzoate (PABA) inhibited growth of X. albilineans on SMG3 medium, and addition of p-hydroxybenzoate (PHBA) restored normal growth, indicating that PABA acts as a competitive analogue of PHBA. Therefore, co-expression of pabAB and ubiC is consistent with the need to supply PHBA simultaneously with elevated PABA production to counteract inhibition by PABA. The albicidin resistance gene albG is located between pabAB and ubiC, indicating that this self-protection mechanism is coordinated with albicidin production in X. albilineans. This study has shown that albicidin is a potent inhibitor of bacterial and plastid DNA gyrase with inhibitory concentrations comparable to quinolones and that X. albilineans encodes an albicidin resistant DNA gyrase. Understanding the molecular interactions of albicidin with DNA gyrase may open the possibility of engineering new and novel drugs with specific activities against DNA gyrase. Furthermore, biochemical characterisation of the biosynthetic genes for albicidin biosynthesis may provide the tools to overproduce albicidin in X. albilineans or a heterologous host and solve the chemical structure.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158514</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EFFECTS OF NUTRITION AND GENOTYPE ON MEAT QUALITY AND CARCASS CHARACTERISTICS OF AUSTRALIAN FEEDLOT CATTLE</field><field name="creator">Lawrence, Robert John</field><field name="description">Biotin was supplemented at three levels (0, 10 and 20mg/hd/day) to F1 Wagyu/Black Angus steers of known Grandsire and sire lines fed a wheat based ration to evaluate the effect on live animal performance, carcass composition, meat quality, blood metabolites, muscle mineral elements, liver and subcutaneous acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, hoof integrity and composition. One hundred and eight steers were assigned to three biotin treatments with each treatment replicated four times. The steers were composed of four known Grandsires (Itohana, KikuhanaA, KikuhanaB, Terutani) and sire lines and randomly allocated on Grandsire, sire and treatment using an unfasted liveweight of 410.5kg (SEM+2.27). A subset of 48 and 36 steers were selected for blood sampling at day 301 and monitoring of hoof growth respectively. Steers were assigned to three turn-off groups on the basis of live weight and maturity and exited the feedlot at 386, 414 and 442 days on feed respectively. Feedlot performance, hoof, organ, muscle and fat samples and carcass morphometric measurements and quality data were collected. Biotin supplementation had no effect (P&gt;0.05) on feedlot performance, carcass composition or quality. However, biotin at 10mg/hd/d tended to increase (P=0.0634) 5/6th rib fat (RF). In contrast, genotype and turn-off group had an effect (P&lt;0.05) on hot standard carcass weight (HSCW), rib fat (RF), eye muscle area (EMA), beef marbling standard (BMS) and intra-muscular fat (IMF%) concentration. A poor relationship existed between BMS and IMF% (R2=0.198). Genotype influenced adipose melting points and genotype and turn-off group had a significant effect on fatty acid (FA) composition of IMF. Total conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) had a highly significant (P&lt;0.0001) relationship to IMF% (R2=0.446). Biotin supplementation (10 and 20mg/hd/day) tended to increase (P=0.0805) blood serum biotin concentration, with a trend to increase blood insulin (P=0.055) and T4 (P=0.0896) concentrations. Grandsire significantly influenced insulin and with a trend towards for T4 (P=0.0508). A significant interaction occurred between biotin supplementation and Grandsire for blood serum insulin. Biotin supplementation had no significant effect on muscle mineral content, whereas Grandsire and turn-off group had a significant effect. Biotin supplementation had no effect on the activity level of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the liver, but had a significant effect on activity in subcutaneous fat. Hoof growth rates over time remained relatively consistent, whereas hoof wear rates increased (P&lt;0.0001) with rain events. Biotin supplementation at 10mg/hd/day tended to lower total hoof growth (P=0.0555), wear on day 251 (P=0.0643) and total wear (P=0.0829) and average monthly hoof wear (P=0.0649). Lesions were present on both the lateral and medial claws of the white line and sole, with a trend (P=0.1292) for the medial claw having a greater lesion incidence. Biotin had no effect on white line or FA composition. Grandsire had a significant effect on white line width of both claws, white line and hoof cushion FA composition. Turn-off group had a significant effect on both hoof and white line dry matter levels of the medial claw. Genotype had an effect (P&lt;0.05) on all live steer parameters and carcass characteristics, expect body condition score (BCS) and body length (BL). Grandsire had a significant effect on HSCW, carcass heart and liver weights. Turn-off group also had a significant effect on carcass measurements. Relationships between live animal and maturity parameters were highest with HSCW. Measuring a range of live animal characteristics related to growth potential early in feeding period may enable improved sorting of cattle into similar growth related groups and thereby increase the consistency and efficiency of feeding cattle to desired carcass or market requirements. The influence of a once only administration of HY&#183;D&#63720; on myofibrillar meat tenderness in Australian Brahman cattle was studied. Ninety-six Brahman steers of three phenotypes (Indo-Brazil, US and US/European) and with two previous hormonal growth promotant (HGP) histories (implanted or not implanted with Compudose&#174;) were fed a standard feedlot ration for 70 days. Treatment groups of 24 steers were offered daily 1g/head HY&#183;D&#63720; (1000mg 25-hydroxyvitamin D3) at 6, 4 or 2 days before slaughter. One other group of 24 steers was given the basal diet without HY&#183;D&#63720;. Feedlot performance, blood and muscle samples and carcass quality data were collected at slaughter. Warner-Bratzler (WB) shear force (peak force, initial yield) and other objective meat quality measurements were made on the longissimus dorsi muscle of each steer after ageing for 1, 7 and 14 days post-mortem at 0 &#150; 2oC. There were no significant effects of HY&#183;D&#63720; supplements on average daily gain over the experimental period. HY&#183;D&#63720; supplement given at 2 days prior to slaughter resulted in lower (P&lt;0.05) initial yield values. Supplements had no significant effect on meat colour, ultimate pH, sarcomere length, cooking loss, instron compression or peak force. However, ageing had a significant effect on meat quality parameters. There was a significant HY&#183;D&#63720; treatment by phenotype/HGP interaction for peak force (P=0.028). There were no detectable amounts of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the muscle of any cattle at slaughter. The HY &#183;D&#63720; treatment increased (P&lt;0.001) blood plasma 25-hydroxycalciferol content, but did not (P&gt;0.05) influence blood plasma or muscle (longissimus dorsi) calcium content. The HY &#183;D&#63720; treatment influenced plasma magnesium, iron and potassium. HY &#183;D&#63720; treatment had no significant influence on muscle cation concentrations. Phenotype/HGP interaction had a significant influence on all live steer and carcass parameters. Hip width appeared to provide a stronger indicator of eventual carcass weight than hip height. HY &#183;D&#63720; close to time of slaughter (2 days) had an influence on the calpain-protease system and reduced variation in muscle tenderness (initial yields) of different Brahman phenotypes. The HY &#183;D&#63720; treatment did not have a negative effect on live animal performance or carcass attributes as has been observed with other forms of vitamin D3 supplementation despite higher supplement concentration level (1000mg). The HY &#183;D&#63720; treatment did not remove or reduce the effect of ageing on improving tenderness. Changes in blood calcium may not accurately reflect changes in muscle calcium and initiation of a calpain response. Combining live animal measurements with skeletal measurements may provide efficiencies in feeding duration and sorting cattle for slaughter.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158515</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE IMPACT OF POST-CRISIS RESTRUCTURING ON THE BANKING SYSTEMS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</field><field name="creator">Thoraneenitiyan, Nakhun</field><field name="description">Banking crises are typically followed by bank restructuring, which is launched by regulators and designed to help recovery. During the last two decades, more than two thirds of the banking crises around the world took place in developing countries. However, there is no formal study to date that attempts to systematically analyse the impact of the post-crisis restructuring on the banking systems of such countries. This thesis investigates whether the post-crisis restructuring enhances the efficiency of banks in developing countries. The focus is on restructuring measures related to bank ownership, environmental factors, and to measure relative bank efficiency using frontier approaches. The results indicate that although the restructuring does not enhance the efficiency of entire banking systems, on average, the efficiency of restructured banks gradually improves after the implementation of restructuring. The results reveal domestic-merged banks to be more cost and technically efficient during the post-crisis period, whereas allowing for foreign bank entry does not produce more efficient banks as was expected. In line with the literature, banks under state intervention are found to be less efficient than those not subject to intervention banks. The results from the productivity analysis suggest that, on average, there is little improvement. Although Asian banks experienced an improvement in technical efficiency, this was partially offset by a contraction in their technology. Nonetheless, the total productivity of the restructured banks increased gradually and stood at a higher level than when the crisis emerged. This thesis also examines the potential influence of country-specific factors. The results indicate that country-specific conditions play a significant role in bank efficiency measurement. High interest rates and concentrated markets appear to be unfavourable influences on bank efficiency. The positive association between the overall level of economic development and inefficiency contradicts findings from studies on western countries. The results also indicate that levels of efficiency estimated from various frontier techniques are not comparable in terms of average efficiency scores. However, some similarities in implied rankings have been found. Finally, the directions of efficiency scores estimated by the frontier techniques are consistent with traditional measures of performance, although the correlations are not strong. In summary, this thesis provides useful guidelines for bank regulators in terms of the effectiveness of restructuring policies implemented following a banking crisis. The results from this thesis reveal that the effects of restructuring on bank efficiency are relatively low compared to the influences of macro-economic factors. Consequently, in order to deal with future potential crises, local and international bank regulators should put more emphasis on macro-economic policies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158516</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SHIFTING IDEOLOGY AND INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS: INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IN ENGLISH COUNTY CRICKET</field><field name="creator">Wright, April Lee</field><field name="description">First-class County cricket in England became socially constructed as an institutional carrier of an ideology of English moral character during the Victorian era from the 1850s. It was structured both as a field of cultural production and as a field of interorganisational collaboration. Located in the institutional theory literature, the thesis explores the theoretical issues of ideology, as a set of normative beliefs and values, and of institution, both as organisations infused with value and as social systems of shared taken-for-granted meaning. Cricket&#146;s ideology embedded particular logics for organising the domestic County game. A historical reconstruction of the institution of English first-class County cricket supports the premise that these ideologically-based logics, as manifested in the structures and practices adopted by County cricket clubs, changed substantively during the period from 1937 to 1967. This raises the questions of how institutional logics change and, more specifically, how new logics which contradict the ideology that constitutes a cultural institution become incorporated into the institution. These questions, along with the research design for the thesis, are framed as emergent from retrospective sensemaking, which was occasioned by paradoxical cues extracted in the early stages of data collection. Data were collected initially through interviews at three first-class County clubs in England and Wales. Refinement of the research question through sensemaking prompted the collection of archival data, in the form of original field-level documents held by the Marylebone Cricket Club, the game&#146;s administrators during the juncture of institutional change. These data were analysed using the method of &#145;documents in action&#146;, in which the production, consumption and content of documents are analysed as active agents in the construction and reconstruction of an institutional reality. This analysis focused on (i) the introduction of a knock-out cup competition, as a structural innovation which manifested the earthing of modern logics onto traditional ideology, and (ii) the instant qualification of overseas players, as a process of interest-seeking action at the organisational level to manipulate and redefine the institutional structure. The interview data, collected from County players and administrators 37 years after the rule for instant qualification for overseas players was approved, provided an opportunity to explore more deeply, at the microlevel, how actors negotiate, prioritise and subvert the different dimensions of rationality of institutionalised practices. The thesis concludes that the process of institutional change was an ongoing struggle, driven by functional pressures, between cultural and economic capital in defining the boundaries of County cricket as entertainment, as sporting competition and as vehicle for player development. New logics were earthed as interest-seeking County political action redefined the rules which carried the institutional structure and as actors evaluated the rationalities of those rules against prioritised interests.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158517</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Middle Managers in Organisational Change</field><field name="creator">Herzig, Sharyn Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Change is ever-present in today&#146;s fast-paced organisations (Lewis, 2000). Market demands, the introduction of new technologies and an internal push for growth are some of the major factors driving change in organisations. However the failure rate, reported as high as 50% (Majchrzak, 1988) to 70% (Burnes, 2002), needs to be addressed (Marks &amp; Mirvis, 2000). In particular, adequate coverage has not been given to the role middle managers play in organisational change (Huy, 2002; McKinley &amp; Scherer, 2000). Middle management can be broadly defined as managers holding positions between the first-level supervisors and the level of executives, below those who have company-wide responsibilities (Frohman &amp; Johnson, 1992). In the 1990s, middle management was typically viewed as resistant to change (Wai-Kwong, Priem, &amp; Cycyota, 2001). It is important to reduce negative views held of middle management and promote their positive input into organisational change processes. Middle managers have been identified as contributing to higher levels of organisational performance when involved in strategy-making (Wai-Kwong et al., 2001) and the positive emotional management of their employees (Huy, 2002). Thus, the aim of the current body of research was to make a contribution to the existing deficient literature on middle managers in organisational change by exploring the strategic role of middle managers. Factors which facilitate organisational change and several underlying psychological states were also investigated. In addition, a measure of perceived change success was developed. Three studies were undertaken to investigate the role of middle managers. Study 1 was an exploratory study investigating middle managers&#146; perceptions of their role in change. It was qualitative in nature and examined a number of different types of change. Study 2 also was from the point of view of middle managers, while Study 3 investigated the impact of middle managers&#146; roles on employees. Both Studies 2 and 3 were quantitative and focused on transitional change. Study 1 involved interviews with 40 middle managers from a range of organisations. Thematic analysis revealed that, at the pre-implementation stage, the psychological state of uncertainty experienced by middle managers focused on the strategic concept of the change. During implementation however, uncertainty related to the appropriate procedures to implement. Middle managers&#146; strategic role was classified into three categories labelled creators, designers, and implementers. Those with higher strategic input (i.e., the creators and designers), reported lower levels of uncertainty than those with low strategic input (i.e., implementers). The factors identified as being facilitators to uncertainty management (i.e., communication with senior management and their own staff, support from senior management, role conflict, and peer interaction) along with other psychological states (i.e., change efficacy and commitment) were expressed in themes in the qualitative study. From middle managers&#146; responses regarding their perceptions of change success, an outcome measure of change was developed and employed in Studies 2 and 3. Study 2 extends the findings of Study 1 by means of quantitative research. A questionnaire was utilised in a cross-sectional study of 123 middle managers to examine the role of middle management during organisational change at a large mining company. The change context was the implementation of Six Sigma projects. Change outcome variables included perceived change success and importance placed on Six Sigma values. In addition, an independent measure of success was provided by the company via an internal audit. Using hierarchical multiple regression, factors which facilitated the implementation of projects by middle managers were examined (including communication with leaders, support from leaders, communication with employees, peer interaction and training). The psychological states (uncertainty, change efficacy and commitment) were found to play a mediating role in some relationships between the facilitators and the change outcomes. Also of interest was the role middle managers adopted during change, determined by strategic design input and Six Sigma project member role. Analysis of variance (ANOVAs) revealed that higher levels of strategic input and higher level Six Sigma roles were associated with more positive perceptions of a number of factors (e.g., more positive perceptions of communication, support, perceived change success and reduced strategic uncertainty) compared to those middle managers with lower levels of strategic input and lower level Six Sigma roles. A third study was conducted to further examine the findings related to communication with employees and to further explore the effect middle managers have on employees during change. One hundred and six employees were surveyed at one point in time regarding their past experiences of technological change at a tourism organisation. A series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that, at the pre-implementation stage of change, communication from middle managers was positively related to employees&#146; perceptions of change success. This relationship was partially mediated by employee readiness for change. During implementation, transformational leadership and transactional leadership were introduced as factors of theoretical interest and both were found to be positively related to employees&#146; perceptions of change success and this relationship was mediated by communication from middle managers. Overall, these studies support the important positive role of middle managers in organisational change, including creating a readiness for change in employees and leading to more successful perceptions of change for both middle managers and employees. The findings suggest that a greater strategic involvement of middle managers was associated with more successful change outcomes. Also identified were numerous important facilitators to the role of middle managers and their relationship to psychological states. Another key contribution was the development of the organisational change outcome measure, titled perceived change success. The relevance of this measure for future research is discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158518</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Testing a Cognitive-Motivational Model of Drinking Behaviour in a University Student Sample</field><field name="creator">Butt, Julia Carol</field><field name="description">The overall aim of the current thesis was to develop and test a cognitive-motivational model of drinking behaviour in a university student sample. Cognitive-motivational theory (e.g., Cox &amp; Klinger 1988; Briener, Stritzke, &amp; Lang, 1999) provides a framework in which decisions about drinking can be evaluated. By developing an understanding how university students make decisions about drinking contributes to understanding the processes underlying drinking behaviour and consequently the complexity of alcohol use. Cognitive-motivational theory recognises that alcohol use is a goal directed behaviour in which people use alcohol to achieve certain outcomes; further, it emphasises both the importance of separating approach and avoidance to alcohol, and the role of different cognitive-motivational variables in predicting drinking behaviour. The variables discussed in the current thesis include: alcohol outcome expectancies, motives and inclinations. The literature on cognitive-motivation and alcohol use was reviewed in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2 of the current thesis, the measurement of drinking behaviour in university student samples was reviewed. Attention was drawn to limitations in previous research which has focused only on binge drinking in student samples. It was argued that drinking behaviour is multidimensional, and consequently to best understand decisions about drinking, and drinking behaviour, theory should seek to explain: usual frequency of alcohol consumption, usual quantity consumed, frequency of feeling intoxicated, peak quantity of alcohol consumed, and alcohol related problems. These dimensions allow theory to explore the multidimensionality of alcohol use in university students. Subsequent studies in the thesis used these measures of drinking behaviour. The assessment of cognitive-motivational constructs; namely: alcohol outcome expectancies, motives, inclinations and refusal self efficacy expectancies was reviewed in Chapter 3.. Psychometric properties of assessment tools were reviewed, and for questionnaires which had not previously undergone confirmatory factor analysis, the analysis was performed in the chapter. In Chapter 4 the separation of approach and avoidance motivation, which is a key premise of cognitive-motivational theory was examined. Analyses using a sample of 490 university students supported the hypothesis that approach and avoidance are conceptually distinct. This enabled the exploration of competing motivation. An evaluative space proposed by Briener et al. (1999) was employed to investigate competing motivation; the evaluative space resulted in the identification of four different motivational dispositions: avoidance, ambivalence, approach and indifference. The different motivational dispositions were found to have different patterns of drinking behaviour, and endorsed different patterns of cognitive-motivational variables. In Chapters 5 and 6 a cognitive-motivational model of drinking behaviour was developed and tested using path analysis and structural equation modelling. Initially in Chapter 5 the goodness of fit of both a two-pathway approach-avoidance model adapted from Cox and Klinger&#146;s (1988) motivational model and Briener et al.&#146;s (1999) ambivalence model; and a three-pathway strong approach-approach-avoidance model adapted from McEvoy, Stritzke, French, Lang and Ketterman (2003) was tested in a sample of 490 university students. The two-pathway model was a better fit to the data. In Chapter 6 the goodness of fit of a two-pathway model was tested in a longitudinal sample of 172 participants who had completed a seven month follow-up study. Results supported the goodness of fit of the two-pathway model over time. Expectancy theory (e.g., Bandura, 1978) highlights the difference between outcome expectancies and self efficacy expectancies, however to date only outcome expectancies have been included in cognitive-motivational research. The aim of Chapter 7 was to investigate the influence of drinking refusal self efficacy (DRSE) on the avoidance pathway of the two-pathway model. DRSE refers to the ability to resist drinking; therefore in the context of the two-pathway approach-avoidance model it was considered particularly important in understanding decisions not to drink. Thus, the influence of DRSE was investigated in relation to only the avoidance pathway. In the chapter both moderation and mediation hypotheses were tested. The results demonstrated that self efficacy both moderates, and partially mediates, the relationship between negative alcohol outcome expectancies and alcohol related problems. Further, DRSE mediated the relationship between avoidance motivation and drinking behaviour. The results were significant both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. In the final chapter of the thesis the findings presented in earlier chapters were consolidated. Theoretical implications of the findings were discussed in relation to Cox and Klinger&#146;s motivational model and Briener et al.&#146;s ambivalence model. Further, in the discussion the current findings were applied to understanding behaviour change, and to practical applications that can inform the development of interventions for heavy drinking university students. Finally, limitations of the present research and directions for future research were discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158519</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Vulnerability-Stress-Coping Model Of Adjustment To The Individual Negative Symptoms Of Schizophrenia</field><field name="creator">Watson-Luke, Annette Robyn</field><field name="description">This research program represents the first systematic exploration of the subjective experience of alogia, anhedonia, attention problems, avolition, and emotional blunting, and its relation to other objective and subjective factors in schizophrenia. Using a combined rational-empirical approach, a vulnerability-stress-coping model of adjustment to the 5 negative symptoms was developed and tested. Three aspects of appraisal were examined, the primary appraisals of symptom severity and distress, and the secondary appraisal of control. The dimensions of coping with individual symptoms were initially examined using a rational approach, and then empirically using exploratory factor analyses. The Appraisal and Coping with Negative Symptoms Interview Schedule (ACNSIS) was developed for use in Study 1. Both qualitative and quantitative appraisal and coping data were examined for 20 people with negative symptoms. Responses to the ACNSIS demonstrated that appraisals and coping responses varied across participants and individual negative symptoms. Previously employed categorisations of coping behaviour were used to examine and quantify coping. Negative symptom-specific differences were found in awareness of negative symptom presence, degree of agreement with objective ratings, appraisals, reliance on different types of coping, and relations with participant characteristics. Participant coping responses from Study 1 were used to construct the self-report measure used in subsequent studies. Study 2 involved the development, administration, and evaluation of the selfreport Appraisal and Coping with Negative Symptoms Questionnaire (ACNSQ). Both an electronic and paper version of the ACNSQ were developed. The ACNSQ was administered to 120 people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Participants were required to make severity, distress and control appraisals for each negative symptom they believed they were suffering from. Following symptom appraisals, a number of symptom-specific and general coping items were presented for each negative symptom. In Study 2A, the multidimensionality of coping responses and the nature of empirically derived subscales were explored individually for each negative symptom. Factor analyses of data from 119 participants resulted in 3 underlying coping dimensions for each symptom. These dimensions, which formed the basis of the ACNSQ coping subscales, were labelled as active, emotional, or avoidant forms of coping. Coping subscales were found to be moderately similar across symptoms. The subscales were shown to be internally consistent and largely independent within symptoms. It was found that the degree of reliance on particular coping subscales was negative symptom-specific, although participant coping was related across symptoms. In Study 2B, the nature of negative symptom appraisals and the psychometric properties of the ACNSQ were examined. There was evidence that the nature of appraisals varied according to negative symptom. Retest reliability analyses indicated that overall, ACNSQ appraisals had a low to moderate degree of reliability while coping subscales demonstrated a moderate to high degree of reliability. Differential associations between appraisal and coping and a range of theoretically related variables provided evidence of the construct validity of the ACNSQ. Study 3 used exploratory techniques to conduct cross-sectional tests of a vulnerability-stress-coping model of adjustment to individual negative symptoms based on the data of the 119 participants. Associations between the objective indicator of negative symptom stressor level, and the subjective experience variables of insight, appraisal and coping were examined in relation to adjustment using a multidimensional approach. Two models of the relations between negative symptom predictors and 3 separate domains of adjustment were investigated. Study 3A provided moderate support for a direct effects model for each of the 5 negative symptoms. Objective negative symptom level, insight, primary appraisals and coping subscales all had significant direct effects on one or more domains of adjustment. In general, higher objective negative symptom levels, higher severity and distress appraisals, and greater reliance on avoidant forms of coping were associated with poorer adjustment. The direct effects of active and emotional forms of coping were less consistent and varied across symptoms and adjustment domains. Study 3B extended these findings by providing a limited amount of support for a mediated effects model. Appraisal and coping were found to act as mediators in some of the relations between objective indicators and subjective experience variables for alogia, attention problems and avolition. There was evidence that the impact of insight on coping was partly mediated by control appraisals. Coping partly mediated the relation between stress and adjustment, and appraisal and adjustment. Overall, this series of exploratory studies make a unique contribution to understanding the subjective experience of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The proposed vulnerability-stress-coping model demonstrated utility in identifying variables important in the prediction of adjustment to individual negative symptoms, and in delineating the nature of associations between variables. Further research is required to improve the psychometric properties of the ACNSQ. However, it offers promise as an instrument with which to assess negative symptom appraisals and coping responses, in both clinical and research settings. The present findings have important theoretical and clinical implications concerning the role of subjective and objective factors involved in adjustment to the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. This research program provides a valuable foundation for future research to test the vulnerability-stress-coping model in its entirety.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">negative symptoms</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158520</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Endogenous Electrical Potential and Flow within and without the Human Body &#150; With particular reference to the bioelectric processes of Acupuncture, Qi Gong and Yoga</field><field name="creator">Nicoll, Edwin Peter Carter</field><field name="description">Traditional Chinese medical physiology, and Chinese-derived medical physiology particularly in Japan and India, extensively discusses the flow of Qi (energy) within the human body and also exchanged with the environment both through physical contact and breathing. The Qi within the human body flows along traditionally designated Qi channels (meridians). All physical activities are said to operate through Qi and to affect the flow and quality of Qi. There are treatments which have specific effect upon the Qi and the Qi channels, being breathing exercises such as Qi Gong; posture exercises such as Qi Gong and Tai Chi Chuan; and particularly acupuncture. In the West there has in recent years been a great amount of interest in &#145;alternative&#146; medicine in general and particularly in alternative therapies that rely on the traditional Chinese medical Qi physiology. As such, the concomitant use of two discordant medical physiologies of &#145;traditional Chinese medical physiology&#146; and &#145;modern scientific medical physiology&#146; has created a crisis of thought, as medical professionals are frustrated in their attempts to amalgamate the two competing physiologies. This thesis sought to resolve the crises by formulating and then testing two exclusive hypotheses (A and B) to explain the Qi and Qi channel traditional Chinese medical system. The hypotheses were: A. That Qi is electrical in nature and this explains why Qi and the Qi channels are invisible. B. That Qi is a synonym for the function of the nervous system and Qi channels are nervous in nature. This hypothesis represents the status quo from a Western medical perspective. This effectively means that there are three body control systems in hypothesis A, the humoral system (which includes the endocrine system and immune system), the nervous system and the additional system being an invisible electrical Qi channel system, while in hypothesis B, there are only two main body control systems, and the nervous system chiefly corresponds with the traditionally described Qi channel system of traditional Chinese medicine. This thesis utilised experimentation, mathematical simulation and calculation to test the two hypotheses. In hypothesis A, the electrical Qi system was considered as a body control system, and as such the electrical Qi signal pathways, electrical driving forces, signal transmission and signal reception were considered as important issues. In hypothesis B, the nervous system was already an established electrical control system and so the only important issue to be expounded was how acupuncture uses the nervous system to control the body. Hence the coupling of the acupuncture signals to the nervous system, coding of the acupuncture signal for nervous transmission, and control system adjustment by acupuncture were the issues for discussion. It was found that hypothesis A was not biologically plausible, since the Qi channels could not be electrically detected on the basis of differences in DC or AC resistance or on the basis of electrical potential difference. Further, available electrical signal driving forces were either too weak or did not drive the signal in the traditionally designated Qi channel pathway directions. Finally, there are unresolved issues of signal encoding, signal decoding and actuation of the control signals that were not explained by hypothesis A. In contrast, it was found that hypothesis B was biologically plausible, with the modern scientific medical physiology capable of satisfactorily explaining the Qi and Qi channel phenomenon with particular attention to acupuncture. It was noted that the published literature already contains a modern scientific explanation for acupuncture in nociception. This thesis sought to broaden the application of the existing neurophysiology to general body control rather than just pain control. The present thesis found that the acupuncture technique seems to be targeted towards the nervous system, with the development of a specifically enhanced and amplified acupuncture input circuit. This circuit formed as a result of the manipulation of the needle physically gathers in the surrounding nerves; initiates neurogenic inflammation with the resultant peripheral sensitization; and initiates wind up and central sensitization in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. It was also found that there was sufficient somatotopic information in an acupuncture signal to supply a unique control signal. The innervation of each acupuncture point when considering the site and the depth of the needle stimulation provides a wealth of spinal cord innervation segments and density of segments to the nervous system. This information can be further adjusted by adding extra points with differing density of innervation and differing segments of innervation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158521</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self, Race and Nation: White Narratives of Reconciliation in Australia and South Africa</field><field name="creator">Newman, Paul John</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses white reconciliation narratives in South Africa and Australia. Both countries have adopted reconciliation as a method for the generation of national unity, after extensive periods of white rule that enshrined racist policies designed to justify and protect white settlement. These narratives of reconciliation maintain an emphasis on managing symbolic closure &#150; of the colonial period, and of the racism of the dominant white society &#150; in the name of producing racial harmony. At the turn of the twentieth century, both Australia and South Africa demonstrate a common belief in a need to fill a gap in historical knowledge or consciousness. In addressing this gap, each country&#146;s version(s) of reconciliation become concerned with concepts of trauma, and the memory and testimony required in negotiating it. This thesis will locate its analysis of reconciliation at the intersection of the politics of history writing, formulations of nation, settler-colonial literature, and current theories in the areas of witnessing and trauma. including the Holocaust-derived witnessing theories of Shoshana Felman, the critique of trauma studies developed by Ruth Leys, and Ross Chambers&#146; theories of witness, autobiography, and whiteness. Jacqueline Rose&#146;s analyses of national traumas are also central. White responses to the testimonies received by the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, like those of Australia&#146;s Bringing Them Home, the report into the practice of Aboriginal child removal by the state, become part of an attempt to relate individual experience to new collective knowledge, and work to reconcile the self to/and the nation. White accounts of the reconciliation process, including Antjie Krog&#146;s Country of My Skull, Peter Read&#146;s Belonging: Australians, Place and Aboriginal Ownership, and Mark McKenna&#146;s Looking for Blackfellas&#146; Point, also participate in this process and use autobiographical elements to invoke the authenticity of experience. As this thesis takes up the perspectives, derived from Holocaust trauma theory and associated with different degrees of implied agency, of the victim, the bystander, and the perpetrator, I will also analyse the distinctive perpetrator narratives of each country; the thesis concludes with readings of investigations of the reconciliation narrative in J.M.

Its text works as an imaginary biography of this light, generated from the voices of two women's perceptual and imaginary experiences: one, a cloistered nun from tenth-century Europe, who interacts with the subtle light of lux as it erupts inside her body the other, a young woman, totally unbound as she crosses an Australian desert in the early50s, relates to light as it transpires across and on her eye. Both women watch, imagine, vision, speak, and dream themselves, reflected throughout by both the darkness and lght that exists inside and around them This text is composed of a range of writing approaches. It employs voice in many poetic forms that move through and across literary genres. As such it can be envisaged as a textual labyrinth or a cabinet of textual curiosities that restates 'the self' as myriad forms of articulated perceptual wonder. The accompanying exegesis, "Sounding the Ineffable," looks at the correlation between the subtle light of lux and a particular type of voice shaped by experience and the gaps of articulation. The disappearance of the term lux, I speculate seems to coincide with a closing down of a rich particular experience, an ecstatic relationship to wonder. The outcome of this repressed brilliance becoming a silenced aspect of the ineffable. This is a study of the discourses surrounding lux's emergence, disappearance and re-emergence in contemporary texts and how lux still influences what we see and experience. The exegesis begins with a detailing of the pre-Socratic naming of lux as an element of matter focusing on their struggling with definitions and realms of experience. 'The second chapter details a range of medieval mystical testimonies as they too struggle to find a language to detail their experience of lux as a first- hand ecstasy of inner- radiance. The third chapter raises the possibilities for articulation of the ineffable inherent in two of Gertrude Stein's work's, "Tender Buttons" and "Lifting Belly", where she creates a language in writing, "sounded" from her own body as sensorium. I see Stein's work in these texts has been to seek to open the frames defining the unspoken by examining and demonstmting language's capacity for a bright material self- reflection. As a writer, my interest in the subject of light and perception has grown out of my work as a visual artist initially in the use of it as a tool that one deals with in the depiction of form, but especially as it appears as the 'medium of depiction' associated with images of woman as 'the nude'. Light is the illuminater of woman as 'nude' as 'naked' and as such tells a particular story of that self as a she all aglow but in this instance without a voice.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158523</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Downstream effects of land use on shallow-water benthic microalgal communities in Moreton Bay, Australia and Marovo Lagoon, Solomon Islands</field><field name="creator">Grinham, Alistair Robert</field><field name="description">Coastal marine zones occupy the interface between terrestrial and deep ocean systems and are of fundamental importance to life on earth. These have undergone dramatic changes in many parts of the world with large scale declines in water quality, primarily due to development of coastal catchments, which results in increased terrestrial sediment and nutrient loading to nearshore waters. This generally increases pelagic primary productivity, increases turbidity and reduces benthic light availability. The benthic autotrophic community of these areas may undergo radical changes with the complete loss of macrophytic communities increasingly reported. The effects on the benthic microalgal community are less studied, primarily because changes in these communities are more difficult to observe due to their microscopic nature. However, they are a key component of shallow-water ecosystems, buffering the effects of nutrient enrichment and contributing up to 50% of primary productivity in coastal systems. The aim of this thesis was to determine the impact of catchment development on benthic microalgal productivity in two shallow-water lagoonal systems. The first system was Moreton Bay, located off the east coast of Queensland, Australia, where catchment areas are highly developed and changes in landuse have occurred over the past century. The second was Marovo Lagoon in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands which, although relatively undeveloped, has recently undergone major changes to land use in catchment areas. Subtidal benthic microalgal gross primary productivity (GPP) was strongly limited by light availability. In both systems catchment development was shown to have decreased benthic light availability in the degraded areas and this has caused significant declines in benthic microalgal GPP in these areas. In Moreton Bay winter increases in benthic light availability did not result in increased productivity as benthic microalgal GPP was shown to be strongly limited by water temperature during this time. The declines in subtidal GPP of degraded areas caused the annual contribution of benthic microalgae to primary productivity in the bay to be almost 3 times lower than previously thought and over a third lower than during pre-European settlement. In Marovo Lagoon subtidal GPP in degraded areas was 10 times lower than in unaffected areas. These findings suggest that catchment development has negatively affected benthic microalgal productivity in both systems and confirms the global trend in declining coastal zones. These fundamental changes in primary productivity of the coastal zone may reduce their role in buffering the effects of terrestrial sediment and nutrient input leading to the formation of coastal &#147;dead zones.&#148;</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158525</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rule-Extraction from Support Vector Machines: Medical Diagnosis, Prediction and Explanation</field><field name="creator">Barakat, Nahla Hosny</field><field name="description">Over the last three decades, data mining and machine learning techniques have been remarkably successful in extracting valuable knowledge from an ever growing number of medical databases. Support vector machines (SVMs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) are amongst the most successful machine learning techniques applied in this, and other areas. However, they produce black box models with little or no explanation capability. It has been shown in the literature that the explanation of a classification decision is a crucial requirement for the acceptance of black box models by end-users, especially in areas like medical diagnosis/prognosis. Therefore, several methods have been introduced for rule extraction from both ANNs and more recently SVMs. In this thesis, we review these methods and propose that a classification, similar to that used for rule extraction from ANNs be used for SVMs. This classification is based on the translucency of the approach, where translucency can be defined as the extent to which the internal components of the model are transparent to the rule extraction method. The most translucent approaches are termed &#147;decompositional,&#148; whilst the most opaque are the &#147;learning-based&#148;. Methods that utilise aspects of both approaches are termed &#147;eclectic.&#148; Considering the unexplored areas and shortcomings of the reviewed methods, we propose and investigate three methods for rule extraction from trained SVMs. Exploring the translucency dimension; we start with a learning-based method and end with a transparent approach in (SQRex- SVM) that extracts rules at the level of SVM components. In all three methods, the main objective is to extract high quality rules that are both accurate and comprehensible. In particular, we tackle the issue of finding measures of rule quality that are both more reliable and meaningful than the commonly used measures of accuracy and fidelity. In this context, we propose the use of the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for the evaluation of rule quality and go on to show that AUC is a reliable single figure of merit, that is independent of the class priors and misclassification cost. In addition, we also propose a novel method for the selection of most discriminative features as an integral part of the rule extraction algorithm, and a pruning methodology that utilizes AUC to quantify the trade-off between the rule set performance and comprehensibility. We evaluate the proposed rule extraction algorithms on set of public domain medical diagnosis data sets and show that the decompositional approach (SQRex-SVM) not only extracts the most comprehensible rules, but in general, these rules have superior performance compared to both the other rule extraction techniques and direct rule learners, such as C5. However, both the eclectic and the learning-based approaches are conceptually simple and also extract rules of reasonably high quality. The rules extracted by the eclectic approach are more sensitive to the noise in the data, as they are extracted from all SVM model support vectors (SVs). Similarly, rules extracted by the learning-based approach are, to some extent, dependent upon the size and the quality of the data set used for rule extraction. In addition, rules extracted by both the eclectic and learning based approaches are also influenced by the induction bias of the direct rule learner used to extract the rules. Furthermore, we propose a novel method for domain knowledge utilization for the purpose of rule set refinement. A virtual data set is created in addition to the original data set by applying domain knowledge to a specific subset of the model SVs to ensure that the correct class label is utilized during the training process. Unlike other methods proposed to overcome the scarcity of training examples, the purpose of this approach is to compensate for noise and uncertainty in the training data. Results are presented that show that utilizing domain knowledge in this way can significantly improve both the quality of the SVM model and the extracted rule set. Finally, all the proposed techniques are applied to a unique real-world data set for the prognosis of Diabetes Mellitus. The extracted rule sets from the decompositional approach in particular, are shown to be highly accurate, easily comprehensible and medically sound.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158526</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comprehensive Electrical and Optical Modelling of Microcavity based Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLED)</field><field name="creator">Chan, Jesse Chih-Sheng</field><field name="description">Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) have challenged Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD) as the preferred display technology due to their distinct advantages in offering self-emissive, thin and low power displays. However, device efficiency and long-term stability remain as potential obstacles awaiting solutions to enable further commercialisation of the technology. Over the past decades, the developments of novel materials and device design have been widely investigated to tackle these obstacles. OLED can be considered as an optical microcavity since the device thickness is of the order of a single optical wavelength and spontaneous emission can be altered and controlled by microcavity that further modifies its emission properties. Traditional design and the optimisation process of microcavity based OLEDs have been implemented via trial and error and combined methods which have been costly in terms of time and resources. Therefore, modelling provides an excellent platform for the design, simulation and optimisation of the device to avoid unnecessary experimental work. In the past decade, significant progress in device modelling based solely on either electrical or optical simulation has been documented. However, comprehensive device modelling incorporating electrical and optical simulation has been scarce. The main contribution of this thesis consists of, firstly, formulation of an electrical modelling platform using the commercially available Silvaco simulator and the development of an optical model that enables calculation of the electroluminescence spectrum based on wave optics and a transfer matrix method. Secondly, identifying the interaction and links between the electrical and optical processes in an OLED device, which can be achieved by using the exciton recombination profile, obtained from the electrical simulation, to the optical model to obtain a realistic electroluminescence. Thirdly, the formulation of device design guidelines can be achieved based on the success of the comprehensive model. Secondary contributions from this thesis are based on the design and analysis of various microcavity based OLED structures. Detailed optical analysis of the emitted radiation spectrum from Tris (8-hydroxyquinolinato) aluminium (Alq3) electron transport material as a function of the cathode material, the thickness of the organic layers and the position of the hole transport layer/emissive layer interface is demonstrated. Structures sandwiched between two metal mirrors were designed based on these guidelines and the comprehensive model was developed. Various designs of novel OLED structures that satisfied both electrical and optical requirements were demonstrated. Firstly, the performance of the device based on varying the anode was investigated, by replacing the experimentally unstable ITO anode with metal electrodes such as Ag. Significant improvement in out-coupled luminance was observed due to the microcavity effect. Secondly, the employment of a quantum well structure allowed a balance of carriers in the recombination region as well as a confinement of excitons. Finally, the design of a multilayer cathode top emitting diode was achieved via careful optical design to increase the light output from the device. The simulation work has been verified by experimental results obtained in collaboration with the University of Hong Kong.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158527</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">COMPACT BAND PASS FILTERS USING DIELECTRIC RESONATORS AND HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTING MATERIALS</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Richard Roy</field><field name="description">Mobile wireless service providers are facing a problem. Subscriber numbers are growing exponentially and the new services offered to mobile users require increasingly complex networks. Existing microwave filters cannot meet the emerging needs of higher filter selectivity combined with lower insertion loss, and new technologies must be found quickly. We need to ask what new technologies will provide microwave filters for mobile wireless services with superior performance? This thesis contends that new materials and innovative design can produce microwave filters with superior capabilities to meet the demands of the new generation cellular networks. It demonstrates that a novel integration of high temperature superconductor materials and new ceramics used as dielectric resonators will allow the design and manufacture of compact, very sharp, narrow bandwidth filters in the 800 MHz to 3 GHz range. Such filters are suitable for application in mobile wireless base stations. The thesis is a multidisciplinary study which builds on the theoretical models for high temperature superconductors and their application to microwave design, and on models of dielectric resonators in cylindrical cavities. High temperature superconductors, because of their low losses, enable the design of filters with high Qo, and consequently very low insertion loss. A relevant question is, "What properties of ceramic materials make them appropriate for microwave applications?" As a starting point, to determine the relative permittivity of ceramic materials at microwave frequencies, a test device was designed and built, and the microwave properties of a number of ceramic materials were studied. Since high temperature superconductor materials exhibit their superconducting properties at cryogenic temperatures, a test environment with cryocooler, vacuum chamber, and associated measurement and control electronics was designed and built for the study of microwave high temperature superconductor devices and cooled ceramic dielectric resonators. If ceramics are to be used with high temperature superconducting materials, it is necessary to understand their behaviour when cooled. The test environment can also be used to investigate a range of cryogenic cooling systems, metal filter holders, spacers and clamps, and thermal insulation materials and their performance, all at low temperatures under vacuum. Thin film microstrip filters suitable for receive filters and for moderate power throughput transmit filters, plus resonant structures with a ceramic dielectric resonator in a cylindrical cavity were built, measured using the c~yogenic test environment and analysed. For the investigation of the microwave properties of a dielectric resonator in a cavity, high-capability desk-top algebraic analysis software was first used to assist in determining the relative permittivity of the ceramic, and subsequently to identify the modes to be measured. The results demonstrate that substantial miniatusisation can be achieved with the use of high temperature superconductors and dielectric resonators, either separately or together. Such miniaturization enables the designer to combine the advantage of the high Q of high temperature superconductor material and certain ceramics and the consequent advantage of low filter insertion loss with the high selectivity that results from using a large number of resonators. Thin film high temperature superconductor filters, and dielectric resonator cavity filters are suitable for the design of transmit filters which need to handle higher power throughput. In the course of this work, further areas for study have emerged of significance to the ongoing application of these materials to microwave filter design. Will such filters meet the emerging needs of mobile wireless service providers? Extensive acceptance of high temperature superconducting products in commercial applications requires that cryocoolers be economically priced, reliable and appropriately priced for the application. Reported data indicate that cryocooling units in the field are reliable enough to be acceptable to wireless network providers. Consequently, the necessity for incorporating a cryogenic system will not be a barrier to wide application of the filters. This thesis shows that by exploiting the characteristics of high temperature superconductors and ceramics at cryogenic temperatures, filters with low insertion loss and high selectivity can be developed to meet the emerging needs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158528</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A PHYSIOLOGIC INVESTIGATION OF SPEECH MOTOR DEVELOPMENT</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Hei Yan</field><field name="description">To date, very little is known about the physiologic development of speech production. Information pertaining to tongue movements during speech in children and adolescents is particularly scarce. An improved understanding of the fundamental motor processes for speech will remarkably strengthen our ability to differentially diagnose and treat a number of speech and language disorders in chldren and adolescents. Using advanced instrumental techniques, this thesis aimed to comprehensively examine the developmental process of tongue movement during speech production over the age span of 6 years to adulthood. A total of 48 speakers participated in the current investigations, with six males and six females in each of the following age groups: (i) aged 6- to 7-years; (ii) 8- to 11- years; (iii) 12- to 17-years; and (iv) adults. All participants were native speakers of Australian English and achieved within age appropriate ranges on a battery of speech and oral motor tests. Two physiological assessments, electropalatography (EPG) and electromagnetic articulography (EMA), were conducted to determine the spatial and temporal characteristics and stability of tongue-tip and tongue-body speech movements in developing speech motor systems. EPG recorded details of the tongue motion and contact at the hard palate during production of lingual consonants. With age, there was a reduction of tongue-to-palate contact and an anterior shfi in the place of articulation for alveolar and post-alveolar sounds. Maturation of the velar consonant, in contrast, was primarily marked by greater stability of tongue-to-palate contact. In the timing domain, duration of the consonant closure phase (i.e., when the tongue is in direct contact with the palate) reduced with age, although no changes in duration variability was seen. A concurrent trend of declining duration and duration variability over entire sentences was also identified. Development of tongue-tip - tongue-body coordination was inferred fiom EPG examination of the transition of velar - alveolar articulatory gestures (i.e., during production of the /kl/ consonant cluster). With advanced motor control, older speakers demonstrated more coherently organized gestures within a phonetic sequence and increased differentiation of tongue-tip - tongue-body movement, resulting in phonetic segments that were more distinct and precisely timed. As EPG assessment focused primarily on tongue-to-palate contacts in speech production, EMA was used to identify changes in tongue motion (i.e., movement distance, duration, speed, acceleration and deceleration) in the closing and opening segments of lingual consonant production. In general, it was found that closing and opening durations decreased across the age spans studied; however, changes in movement distance, speed, acceleration and deceleration were less consistently observed. In contrast, the token-to-token variation for each parameter declined as a function of age. Additionally, adults continued to exhibit more stable spatiotemporal patterning of their tongue movements during sentence production compared to both children and adolescents. Lastly, given that the tongue and jaw appear to be closely related in speech motor development, EMA was used to examine the kinematic coordination of the two articulators during consonant production. Interestingly, development of tongue-tip and jaw coordination for speech was manifested in more tightly synchronized movements. In contrast, with maturity, tongue-body and jaw retained movement independence but developed a more consistent kinematic relationship from trial-to-trial. The present EPG and EMA findings suggested that continual, though nonlinear and nonuniform, changes are occurring in the speech motor system from 6 years, to adolescence, and into adulthood.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158530</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#147;We Just Want to Be Parents&#148;: Occupations in Parenting Children with Developmental Disabilities</field><field name="creator">Hanna, Karen Janelle</field><field name="description">This qualitative study investigated the experiences of parents of children with developmental disabilities living in a regional community on the New South Wales coast. The study aimed to understand the occupations engaged in by parents, to understand activities and occupations that contributed to parents&#146; sense of competency and self worth and to explore the participants&#146; experiences in dealing with services. Eighteen parents (eight parent couples and two mothers), whose children had a range of disabilities including cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities and autistic spectrum disorders, were interviewed. The interviews were transcribed and the data analysed to identify common themes, using a phenomenological methodology. Themes that emerged from the data were categorised into contextual dimensions and observable dimensions of parents&#146; occupations. Themes that reflected contextual dimensions of occupations were: knowing our child, finding acceptance and belonging, and an ongoing journey. Those themes that involved observable dimensions of occupations were: &#147;doing&#148; for our child, parenting and managing family life and dealing with services. Additionally, the data were explored and interpreted using a framework for occupation involving concepts of doing, being, becoming and belonging. Implications for occupational therapists working in clinical practice were also identified, highlighting the importance of collaborating with families and supporting and encouraging parents in their parenting occupations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158531</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EXAMINATION OF THE ROLE OF POSTURAL CHANGE IN VENTILATED INTENSIVE CARE PATIENTS. Current practice, investigation and guidelines.</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Peter James</field><field name="description">During periods of critical illness, significant proportions of intensive care patients are ventilated and immobile for extended periods. Alterations of body position during this time are believed to prevent and/or treat pulmonary pathology, improve respiratory function and combat the effects of immobility. Recent investigations have demonstrated the poor utilization of positioning in intensive care. This thesis aimed to: (i) examine the clinical application of positioning techniques applied within Australian intensive care units as part of the management of ventilated intensive care patients; (ii) ascertain the efficacy and safety of positioning practices using lateral, semi-recumbent and seated positions; (iii) develop an educational tool to promote evidence-based practice and which may improve the application of positioning. The aims of the thesis were met through four studies. In study one, we conducted a national survey of intensive care unit staff. We found educational and environmental issues impacted on positioning practices and while the use of full side-lie or lateral positioning was recommended in the management of a range of patient condition, its utilization was low. High levels of agreement for precautions and contraindications to positioning into full side-lie and sitting were also demonstrated. To ascertain the efficacy of lateral positioning, we conducted a systematic review of the literature (Study 2). Evidence was found for the application of lateral positioning in patients with unilateral pulmonary infiltrates, but the need for further investigations to assess the impact of longer periods of lateral positioning both on oxygenation and long term outcomes was identified. In order to investigate this, we undertook a clinical study, which assessed the effect of a two-hour period of lateral positioning on gas exchange, respiratory mechanics and haemodynamics (Study 3). It was demonstrated that lateral positioning had minimal effect on oxygenation, but was well tolerated and associated with minimal adverse events in the majority of patients. To investigate the effect of positioning as a patients clinical condition improves and weaning from mechanical ventilation commences, we also investigated the impact of a seated versus semi-recumbent position (Study 4). This study found no beneficial effect on gas exchange through the adoption of upright positions. However, the seated position may be preferred for patient safety and the prevention of pressure ulceration. This supports the mobilisation of patients out of bed as part of physiotherapy management when patients are being weaned from mechanical ventilation. Together, these studies build upon the knowledge and application of positioning by physiotherapists in the intensive care population. Additionally, we have described current practice within Australian intensive care units, and through combining current research evidence for positioning, we have created a positioning educational tool / guideline that can be used by clinicians to provide evidence-based positioning interventions. This may facilitate greater adherence to the application of positioning. Finally, in establishing the safety of the positioning interventions trailed, we have identified the need for and direction of future research activities that may clearly establish their role in improving long-term outcomes associated with mechanical ventilation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158532</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN ANALOGUE STUDY OF PARENT-ADOLESCENT CONFLICT: PROCESSESS AND OUTCOMES</field><field name="creator">Atkin, Sharon Doreen</field><field name="description">Conflict between parents and their adolescents has been widely acknowledged as a necessary forum for adolescents to develop their sense of self and make a successful transition into adulthood and as an important, and at times damaging, factor in adolescent adjustment. What constitute the negative and positive aspects of parentadolescent conflict and in what ways such interactions contribute to parent-adolescent relationships and adolescent adjustment is an important progression for such research. It would seem a positive step to begin with experimental investigations where aspects of parent-adolescent conflict communication can be controlled. Such an approach has a greater likelihood of providing information about which types of conflict are associated with which types of outcomes for adolescents and their families. The purpose of this study was to investigate specific styles of parent-adolescent conflict (coercion, demand/withdraw and mutuality) and the processes that link such conflict with parent-adolescent relationships and adolescent adjustment. An analogue approach was incorporated to capture the dynamics of the differing conflict styles (audio-tapes of simulated parent-adolescent conflict discussions), along with questionnaire approaches in regard to conflict behaviour. Participants were 58 two-parent family triads (mother, father, adolescent) and 27 singlemother family dyads (mother, adolescent). The adolescents were aged 12 to 16 years. Participants responded to questionnaires relating to their perceptions of, and affective responses to, the taped discussions. Family relationships were assessed in terms of the affection in their relationships, and parenting behavior (psychological control; behavioural control and acceptance). Adolescent adjustment was assessed in terms of internalising and externalising behavior and self-esteem. The validity of using an analogue method for research into parent-adolescent conflict was supported. In general, participants were able to identify the characteristics of the conflict styles and discriminate between them. The mutual style was perceived as the most likely to be resolved and the least likely to get worse, and the coercive style was perceived as the least likely to be resolved and the most likely to get worse. These results were more marked for the two-parent family members, as compared to the participants from single-mother families, who discriminated less between the styles. Based on an adaptation of Grych and Finchams&#146; Cognitive Contextual framework, it was proposed that adolescents&#146; understanding and experience of parent-adolescent conflict would be associated with their perceptions of their relationships with their parents which would in turn lead to particular adjustment outcomes. It was also proposed that for adolescents, either typically experiencing negative conflict interactions with their parents, or experiencing heightened negative affect during conflict interactions, would be associated with poorer relationships with their parents, which in turn would be associated with less positive adjustment outcomes. Mediation analyses allowing for multiple mediators were conducted. Results indicated that in the two-parent families, mothers&#146; and adolescents&#146; perceptions of their relationships mediated the associations between the typicality of the mother-adolescent coercive discussions and adolescent externalising behaviour and self-esteem. Also, fathers&#146; and adolescents&#146; perceptions of their relationships mediated the associations between the typicality of father-demands/adolescent-withdraws conflict and adolescents&#146; internalising and externalising behavior and self-esteem. There were no such associations found for the level of reported affect in relation to the taped discussions. Conversely, for the single-mother families, the typicality of the taped discussion did not show strong associations with mother-adolescent relationships and adolescent adjustment; however, perceptions of relationship quality mediated the relations between the level of affective response to the conflict and adolescent adjustment. Specifically, adolescents&#146; perceptions of their relationships mediated the associations between the adolescents&#146; levels of anger for single-mother-demands/adolescent-withdraws discussions and adolescents&#146; internalising behaviour. These adolescents&#146; perceptions of their relationships with their single mothers also mediated the associations between adolescents&#146; expectation that the mother-demands/adolescent-withdraws discussions would get worse and their self esteem. These results were discussed in terms of the current literature and the future directions of research into parent-adolescent conflict. The associations between parent-adolescent conflict, family relationships and adolescent adjustment in two-parent families revealed that the conflict dynamics that were associated with family relationships and adolescent adjustment were different for mother-adolescent and father-adolescent conflict. Results also indicated that single-mothers and their adolescents perceive conflict differently from married mothers and their adolescents. Future investigations could be aimed at exploring differences in conflict processes and outcomes between married mothers and fathers with their adolescents and married mothers and single-mothers with their adolescents in more detail, and with larger samples.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158534</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE EXOCYTIC AND ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING OF E-CADHERIN IN EPITHELIAL CELLS</field><field name="creator">Joseph, Shannon Rose</field><field name="description">Epithelial cells form the boundaries between discrete compartments or organs and between the internal and external environments of a multicellular organism. An important structural and functional feature of epithelial cells is their polarity &#150; which provides them with distinct apical and basolateral surface domains. As a key component of the adherens junctions on the lateral surfaces of epithelial cells, Ecadherin functions in both cell-cell adhesion and in epithelial polarisation. E-cadherinmediated adhesion is regulated by the trafficking of E-cadherin and other components of the adherens junction to and from the lateral membrane and by cadherin-catenin interactions at the junctions. This thesis examines the polarised trafficking of Ecadherin and catenins and their interactions during this trafficking. Exocytic pathways carry newly-synthesised E-cadherin to the surface and sorting within the pathway ensures the polarised trafficking of E-cadherin to the basolateral membrane. The polarised trafficking of E-cadherin to the basolateral membrane and the temporal assembly of the cadherin/catenin adhesion complex were studied. Findings reported here show that while &#946;-catenin binds early during synthesis to E-cadherin, these components do not connect with p120ctn or with &#945;-catenin until they reach the basolateral membrane &#150; showing that there is temporal and contextual assembly of this junctional complex. Use of a mis-targeted mutant of E-cadherin was an important tool in defining pre- and post-sorting events in this pathway. The E-cadherin targeting mutant was then used in more detail to define the role of Ecadherin targeting in cell polarity. Monolayers of MDCK cells expressing the mistargeted E-cadherin had distinctly altered morphology but retained sorting of basolateral markers. Further, when cells were grown in 3D-epithelial cyst cultures the overexpression and mistargeting of E-cadherin caused loss of cell lumens and prevented formation of apical and basolateral cell membranes. E-cadherin expression levels and missorting were thus identified as a key event in developing epithelial polarity. The endocytosis and recycling of surface E-cadherin was also studied as part of this thesis. A series of assays and conditions for inducing and manipulating the endocytosis of E-cadherin were set up and studied, including growth factors, calcium depletion and temperature blocks. Taken together, these results show that surface E-cadherin is first internalised into early endosomes, a key compartment, from which E-cadherin may then be trafficked either directly or via the recycling endosome to other internal compartments or recycled to the plasma membrane. The findings presented in this thesis have further clarified the temporal assembly, sorting, exocytosis and endocytosis of the E-cadherin-catenin cell adhesion complex. They also demonstrate the importance of E-cadherin expression levels and surface localisation to the development of correct polarity in mammalian epithelia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158535</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ADVANCING THE EVALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR COMMUNITY-BASED INJURY PREVENTION PROGRAMS: PERSPECTIVES FROM A CASE STUDY EVALUATION</field><field name="creator">Yorkston, Emily Kate</field><field name="description">Background: The traditional public health approach to injury prevention and control is founded on a causal model of injury that focuses on individual-level risk factors relevant to the exchange of energy that causes anatomical injury. Contemporary epidemiology recognises the role of macro-level physical and social determinants in injury aetiology and therefore the ecological approach, which examines the population level effects on health outcomes, has become more frequently employed. The ecological approach underpins the community-based model of injury prevention. Despite implementation of this model on a global scale, few evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the community-based model to reduce injury outcomes. Existing evaluations are limited by methodological flaws including inadequate evaluation timeframes, poor selection of community controls, use of poor quality data sources and failure to match the evaluation approach with the ecological nature of the community-based model. Current evaluation methods do not adequately account for the effect of social variables upon injury rates. Aim: The aim of the thesis is to advance evaluation methodology for community-based injury prevention programs by: designing and implementing a case study evaluation program consistent with current best practice methods for community-based injury prevention programs; using the quantitative data from the case study evaluation to illustrate threats to the validity of results obtained by this methodology; and developing an improved methodology for application to future evaluations of community-based injury prevention programs. Methods: A quasi-experimental study which measured changes in process, impact and outcome evaluation components in two matched intervention and control community pairs was conducted between May 2003 and September 2005. Program implementation activities were recorded by the project officers in electronic process logs. Impact evaluation included assessment of community capacity before and after program implementation using a Community Capacity Index, and measurement of pre- and post-implementation prevalences of safety behaviours and injury risk factors using self-report surveys. Outcome evaluation included injury data from emergency department and hospital admissions datasets for thirteen years pre-implementation and eighteen months after program implementation commenced. Effectiveness of the case study programs was assessed by comparing predicted and observed injury rates. A generalised estimating equation model of childhood injury rates was created using state wide data to control for changes in social variables within the two intervention communities. Results: The effect of the prevention program on the intervention communities was minimal. Little change in process activities was demonstrated. Community capacity improved slightly in both communities; however changes to safety behaviour and injury risk factor prevalence were limited. Many of the significant changes represented increased injury risk. Changes to outcome measures were also limited. Observed childhood injury rates were within predicted ranges for Intervention and Control Community One and Intervention Community Two, but increased beyond the predicted range in Control Community Two. The GEE model indicated the intervention was associated with statistically non-significant decrease of 0.07 injuries/10,000 0-4 year olds (95%CI: -0.24, 0.10) in logarithmically transformed injury rates (p=0.40).The GEE model found a significant relationship between childhood injury rates and first (p&lt;0.001) and second order time components (p&lt;0.001). Rurality was significantly associated with childhood injury rates, where childhood injury rates increased by 0.06 injuries/10,000 0-4 year with each increasing unit of remoteness (p&lt;0.001). The model found an increase of 2.69 injuries/10, 0000 0-4 year olds as the proportion of married people within the region increased (p&lt;0.001) and a decrease of 1.84 injuries/10,000 0-4 year olds as the proportion of Indigenous residents increased (p&lt;0.001). There was also a significant association between the proportion of Indigenous residents, time and childhood injuries (p&lt;0.002). When controlling for social variables, the intervention was associated with a decrease of 0.09 injuries/10,000 0-4 year olds (95%CI: -0.29, 0.11) in logarithmically transformed injury rates, however this decrease was not significant (p=0.36). Conclusion: This thesis has explored the need to consider the effect of social level variables on rates of childhood injury. The lack of identification, data collection and analysis of social variables when evaluating community-based injury prevention programs may explain the lack of observed effectiveness of community-based programs. The current best practice methodology for evaluating community-based injury prevention programs can be improved by ensuring the effect of social variables are accommodated with the analytic model of the evaluation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158536</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Travel Motivation, Satisfaction and Destination Loyalty: Taiwanese Group Package Tourists Visiting Australia</field><field name="creator">Kao, Chung</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to explore the travel motivations of Taiwanese tourists who visited Australia, their satisfactions, and destination loyalty, as well as examining the relationship between customer satisfaction, need satisfaction, and destination loyalty. This study is important because of the fact that the number of Taiwanese tourists to Australia has decreased since 1999; however, there have not been any academic studies to ascertain the travel motivations of Taiwanese group package tourists who visited Australia, their need satisfaction, and future intentions. Furthermore, the literature on tourist need satisfaction, customer satisfaction and loyalty has been categorised into discrete areas of study, with little integration of these three concepts in the tourism literature. Thus, the relationship between these concepts is an area of theoretical interest that has been examined in this study. To achieve the aims of the research, one research question and 11 hypotheses were developed. The research question specifically explored the travel motivations of the Taiwanese when visiting Australia. Two hypotheses were designed to test the differences between Taiwanese travel motivations and their need satisfaction, and the differences between travel motivation groups. In addition, nine hypotheses were used to examine the relationships between customer satisfaction, need satisfaction, and destination loyalty. A four-stage research methodology was used. Firstly, the study adopted a qualitative approach using focus group interviews of 33 participants to explore the motivations of Taiwanese group package tourists to Australia. Following the qualitative study, two pre tests including a pre and post survey were conducted in order to develop the scales for travel motivations, customer satisfaction, need satisfaction, and destination loyalty of Taiwanese tourists. Finally, a formal pre and post survey was administered. A pre and post survey design was used to consider the potential changes in tourist motivations after the trip. Cluster sampling was used to select the travel agencies, and five travel agencies agreed to participate in this research. The collection of data for the formal survey began in September 2005 and was completed at the end of February 2006. A total of 547 questionnaires were fully completed with a response rate of 72.9%. The validity and reliability of the various scales for push and pull motivations, destination attributes/services, group package tour services, perceived value, equity, emotion, overall need satisfaction, overall satisfaction, and destination loyalty were examined using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, as well as Cronbach&#146;s alpha, and all scales were found to be satisfactory. A total of 17 push and 18 pull motivation items were also determined. Taiwanese tourists had the highest travel motivation scores for &#145;travelling around the world&#146;, and &#145;having a comfortable trip&#146;, and were attracted by certain attributes of Australia, such as the &#145;sunshine and scenery&#146;, and &#145;a place to go for good value&#146;. The differences between travel motivations and motivation satisfaction were examined using a paired sample t-test, and the hypothesis was partially supported. Based on the results of these t-tests, importance-performance analysis (IPA) was used to analyse the motivation satisfaction levels, and the results showed that the main travel motivations of Taiwanese travellers to Australia were generally satisfied after the trip, with the push motivation factor &#145;having a comfortable trip&#146; and the pull motivation factor &#145;sunshine and scenery&#146; scoring highest on the satisfaction scale. Factor-cluster analysis was further used to segment tourists in regard to their travel motivations. The results revealed that there were four different travel motivation groups. These groups were significantly different in terms of their customer satisfaction and destination loyalty. The importance level of travel motivations of &#145;high motivation travellers&#146; before the trip was high compared to other groups and the customer satisfaction and destination loyalty were also high after the trip. Taiwanese tourists were generally satisfied with their trip to Australia; however, only two tourist groups: the &#145;high motivation travellers&#146; and the &#145;comfort/attraction seekers&#146; showed any interest in revisiting Australia in the future. The relationship between customer satisfaction, need satisfaction, and destination loyalty was also examined using multiple regression analysis. The results confirmed the hypotheses that customer satisfaction had a positive impact on need satisfaction; need satisfaction positively influenced overall need satisfaction; and overall need satisfaction and overall satisfaction both had a positive relationship with destination loyalty. This shows that tourist need satisfaction and customer satisfaction are related, and customer satisfaction is the antecedent of tourist need satisfaction. Furthermore, tourist need satisfaction is influenced by travel experiences, and destination loyalty is influenced by overall need satisfaction and overall satisfaction. This research has contributed to theory, methodology and to practice. A relationship between customer satisfaction, need satisfaction, and destination loyalty was found. As a result, this study has also successfully integrated the concepts of travel motivation, customer satisfaction, need satisfaction, and destination loyalty. A pre and post survey methodology was used in this research to obtain Taiwanese travellers&#146; original motivations and their satisfaction levels. Finally, the findings concerning the motivations of Taiwanese tourists to Australia, their need satisfaction, customer satisfaction, and destination loyalty have been found to be useful for tourism managers to assist them in making successful business decisions, improving services, and developing new promotional strategies to encourage Taiwanese visitors to travel to Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">travel motivation</field><field name="subject">push and pull</field><field name="subject">customer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">need satisfaction</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158537</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Metal Binding on Peptide Conformation</field><field name="creator">Bryant, Gavin Keith</field><field name="description">&#945;-Helical domains in proteins are important recognition motifs for macromolecular receptors and also act as structural scaffolds for protein folding. Short peptides (less than 15 residues) corresponding to these helices are, however, rarely helical outside of their protein environments. New techniques for stabilising short &#945;-helical peptides could make a significant impact on studies of protein folding, design of artificial proteins, and design of drugs that mimic or inhibit protein function. This study demonstrates that coordination of a metal ion (Pd(15en)2+) to histidine or methionine residues at each terminus of a pentapeptide (Ac-XAAAX-NH2, X = His or Met) forms a macrocyclic metallopeptide that is &#945;-helical in solution. The processes of peptides and proteins folding into their secondary conformations are reviewed in Chapter 1. The structure and stability of &#945;-, 310- and &#960;-helices is also discussed, along with the non-helical secondary structures; &#946;-strands, &#946;-sheets and reverse turns. Chapter 2 discusses the techniques used to determine the secondary structures of peptides and metallopeptide complexes. These techniques include multinuclear 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and Structure Determination with the use of a Simulated Annealing method. Chapter 3 reviews the interactions between metal ions and peptides, focusing mainly on the reactions of metal ions with peptides containing metal binding residues at positions of i and i+4. The experiments from this group on the formation of &#945;-helices following the reactions of palladium with peptides containing the sequence HxxxH, with histidines at this i, i+4 spacing is discussed in detail. Recent work on the use of lactam bridges to stabilise &#945;-helices is also discussed. The original studies in this field by this group focused on the reaction between Pd(15en)2+ and the pentapeptide Ac-HAAAH-NH2 (5.1). This showed the formation of three linkage isomeric complexes [Pd(15en)(Ac-HAAAH-NH2)]2+ (5.3a, 5.3b, 5.3c), with the dominant isomer, 5.3a (with Pd coordinated to the peptide via the N1 from the imidazole rings of both histidines, forming a 22-membered macrocycle), shown to be &#945;-helical in both DMF and water. The other two linkage isomers had formed 21-membered rings, with 5.3b having the Pd coordinated to the N1 of His1 and the N3 of His5 and 5.3c having Pd bound to the N3 of His1 and the N1 of His5. The use of peptides containing histidine residues where one of the potential metal-binding sites on the imidazole rings has been blocked, with the use of a methyl group, can exclusively produce either N1 or N3 linked Pd-His isomers. This means that if the N1 bound isomer is required, N3-methyl histidine is used. Chapter 5 discusses how the use of the N-methylated histidine (H* = N3-methylated, H# = N1 methylated) containing peptides Ac-H*AAAH*-NH2 (5.4), Ac-H#AAAH*-NH2 (5.6), Ac-H*AAAH#-NH2 (5.7) and Ac-H#AAAH#-NH2 (5.8) for reactions with Pd(15en)2+ allowed the selective production of the linkage isomeric macrocycles; [Pd(15en)(Ac-H*AAAH*-NH2)]2+ (5.5, equivalent to 5.3a) [Pd(15en)(Ac-H#AAAH*-NH2)]2+ (5.9, equivalent to 5.3c), [Pd(15en)(Ac-H*AAAH#-NH2)]2+ (5.10, equivalent to 5.3b) and [Pd(15en)(Ac-H#AAAH#-NH2)]2+ (5.11, equivalent to 5.3d, not produced for the 5.1). These compounds were fully characterised and analysed with the use of 1D (1H and 15N) and 2D (TOCSY and tr-ROESY) NMR spectroscopy, as well as CD spectroscopy. The NMR and CD spectral study of these linkage isomers not only showed that 5.5 was &#945;-helical, and that it corresponded to 5.3a, but that the isomer 5.10 (which corresponded to 5.3b) also showed evidence for &#945;-helicity. It was determined that the optimal ring size for the formation of an &#945;-helix was between the 22- and 21-membered macrocycles of 5.5 and 5.10 respectively. The focus of Chapter 6 was then on the reactions of methionine containing peptides, such as Ac-H*AAAM-NH2 (6.1) with metal ions. The metallopeptide formed following the reaction of Pd(15en)2+ with 6.1 would have an effective ring size between those of 5.5 and 5.10. This metallopeptide (6.5) was studied with both NMR and CD spectroscopy, with both techniques providing strong evidence for the formation of a stable &#945;-helix. A structure calculation was also conducted for this compound, providing further evidence for 6.5 being &#945;-helical. The use of the peptide Ac-MAAAH*-NH2 (6.3), with the positions of the histidine and methionine reversed, also produced a helical metallopeptide, though the increased steric hindrance caused by the palladium ion being brought closer to the peptide backbone caused a reduction in helicity. Attempts were also made to react platinum with these methionine containing peptides. The reaction of Pt(15en)2+ with 6.1 showed positive CD spectral results for helicity, though the NMR spectra showed that multiple different species had formed. Finally, in Chapter 7 the effect of varying the number of intervening residues between the two histidines in these metallopeptides was investigated. The reactions of Pd(15en)2+ with of Ac-His*-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-His*-NH2 (7.1), Ac-His*-Ala-Ala-His*-Ala-NH2 (7.2), Ac-Ala-His*-Ala-His*-Ala-NH2 (7.3) and Ac-His*-His*-Ala-Ala-Ala-NH2 (7.4) were all shown to produce large chelate rings. Following metal coordination, these peptide backbones were shown to have adopted a &#960;-helix, &#946;-turn, &#947;-turn and &#946;-strand respectively. This study showed that regardless of the number of intervening alanine residues, the palladium ion always bound to the two imidazole nitrogen atoms, as opposed to small chelating alternatives. Relative stability constant calculations in DMF showed that these four metallopeptides (7.5-7.8) were all of similar stability to the &#945;-helical peptapeptide 5.5.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158538</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns of development of regeneration of tree species in a subtropical rainforest</field><field name="creator">Song, Guo-Zhang Michael</field><field name="description">Factors relating to seedling establishment and the effects of selective logging on regeneration were investigated in a subtropical rainforest in south east Queensland, to determine the regeneration patterns of tree species. Along a 200m long and 0.5m wide transect, litter movement and accumulation were studied. Although litter movement was detected in every month, the total amount of litter accumulated varied slightly during the present study, due to the comparable amount of litter moved out and moved in. A larger amount of litter movement was observed with a smaller probability of occurrence. In terms of frequency, a biotic agent (the foraging behaviour of vertebrates) and abiotic agents (rain, wind and topography) respectively contributed to half of the movement of litter on the ground. Nevertheless, in terms of mean amount of litter being moved in every event, vertebrates moved significantly more litter than did abiotic agents. The understorey vegetation of this forest was dominated by a fern species ( Lastreopsis decomposita ) with a canopy height of 30-40cm. Lower light transmittance accompanied higher fern cover. The probability of being disturbed by vertebrates and covered by litter was significantly lower under the fern canopy than at the edge of fern canopy or in habitats without fern cover. The frequency of vertebrate disturbance and the amount of litter being moved in decreased as the extent of fern cover increased. In the 100 m2 transect area, even though mean growth rate of seedlings was positively correlated with light availability of habitats, over 70% of seedlings did not grow at all to their death or the end of the two-year study. Herbivory caused the largest proportion of seedling mortality (28.2%), followed by litter cover due to abiotic disturbance (27.8%), uprooting (15.4%), water stress (13.0%), vertebrate-induced litter cover (7.9%), pathogens (5.8%) and unknown agents (1.9%). Animals (herbivory, uprooting and vertebrate-induced litter cover) were responsible for more than half of seedling mortality. The effects of several factors on seedling survival were evaluated with survival analysis. The effects of herbivory, litter cover, light intensity, and litter thickness on seedling survival were not significant. Higher survival rates of seedlings were associated with greater initial height, older age and lower frequency of vertebrate disturbance. Due to a high risk of succumbing to animal disturbance, seedlings of three shrub species with woody or hard shoot structures had higher survival rates than did seedlings of canopy tree species. Understorey vegetation significantly reduced light availability and the risk of being damaged by vertebrate disturbance and litter cover. The negative effects of lower light availability were outweighed by the positive effects associated with reduced stress due to litter cover and vertebrate disturbance. As a result, seedlings in habitats with higher coverage of understorey vegetation had higher survival percentages. The 40-year vegetation records of an unlogged and a logged forest stand were compared. The selective logging operation in 1961 reduced species richness by 36.1%, the number of stems &gt;= 6m in height by 60.1% and stem basal area in the community by 62.7%. Species richness and the number of stems recovered in ten years, and the vertical structure recovered in 40 years. Nonetheless, due to the removal of large DBH trees, it is predicted that the pre-logging basal area will not be regained within 20 to 60 years. Early successional species contributed a higher proportion of stems and basal area in the logged than in the unlogged plot. Forty years after logging, there was no significant difference in ground level light availability between the two plots, which was attributed to the dense understorey in the logged plot. For the first 30 years after logging, most individuals markedly grew faster in the logged than the unlogged plot, but in the last ten years, the situation of growth was reversed. This change was attributed to the marked reduction in growth of the smaller trees in the very dense understorey of the logged plot. The seedling study suggested there were two principal modes of regeneration establishment. Shrub species with low fecundity established seedling pools with high survivorship as a result of having woodier plant bodies. High fecundity is necessary for the establishment of seedlings of canopy tree species due to their non-durable characteristics. The study of the logging plots showed that different requirements for regeneration environments between early successional species and later successional species. Large-scale disturbances are needed for regeneration of early successional species, whilst later successional species can regenerate in smaller gaps. The prevailing natural disturbances which mainly create small canopy gaps will unilaterally facilitate the regeneration of the later successional species.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158539</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular characterisation and detection of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. vasinfectum</field><field name="creator">Gulino, Lisa-Maree</field><field name="description">Fusarium wilt of cotton caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. vasinfectum (Fov) is a serious constraint to cotton production. Two unique vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) have been identified in Australia using traditional techniques (i.e. VCG 01111 and VCG 01112). A panel of 21 &#145;representative&#146; Australian Fov isolates were characterised and compared to a panel of 26 Fov isolates representing the various geographic and race/VCG distribution, utilising assorted molecular techniques. Techniques used in this study included: DNA Amplification Fingerprinting (DAF), Polymerase Chain Reaction &#150; Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), sequencing of the translation elongation factor (EF 1&#945;) and nitrate reductase gene (NIR) and mating type gene analysis. DAF analysis with ten eight-mer oligonucleotides uncovered two distinct clades for the Australian isolates that corresponded to the traditionally identified VCGs (VCG 01111 and VCG 01112). Similarly, Intergenic spacer (IGS)-RFLPs with Dpn II revealed a distinct haplotype for Australian VCGs of Fov. Five restriction enzymes could not clearly delineate Australian isolates from the other panel of Fov screened. Mating type analysis revealed that, isolates pertaining to the VCG 01111 tested positive for the presence of the MAT 1-1 allele, whereas, isolates pertaining to the VCG 01112 tested positive for the MAT 1-2 allele. Sequence analysis of the EF 1&#945; could not distinguish between the Australian Fov, however, a 33 bp insert was present in Australian Fov isolates that was not present in overseas Fov examined. Phylogenetic analysis uncovered a separate lineage for Australian Fov. Nitrate reductase gene analysis also revealed a separate lineage for Australian Fov. Concordance among the array of techniques demonstrated that it is evident that the two Australian VCGs previously classified, are unique when compared to other Fov from various geographic regions. Results support the theory that Australian Fov has evolved independently from other Fov found world-wide and that Fov is polyphyletic in origin. PCR assays were developed for identifying Australian strains of Fov. Two sets of oligonucleotides were designed, based on sequence data from the intergenic spacer region (IGS). These oligonucleotides were specific for VCG 01111 and VCG 01112 and were tested against DNA extracted from over 800 isolates, including Australian Fov, isolated from a variety of substrates (i.e. - soil, seed, plant, trash, weeds and irrigation water); non-pathogenic Fusarium oxysporum (isolated from cotton grown soil); overseas strains of Fov; and other formae speciales of Fusarium oxysporum, as well as additional Fusarium spp. and species from other fungal genera. Under the conditions defined, an amplicon of the appropriate size was detected in all previously characterised VCG 01111 and VCG 01112 isolates. The diagnostic assay was further enhanced and validated by adapting the PCR test to directly detect Fov from plant, seed and soil samples. For each sample type, DNA extraction protocols were assessed for their suitability to extract DNA efficiently from the various tissue types and the ability to provide quality DNA for the detection of Fov. DNA protocols were modified to be used in the Fastprep&#153; beadbeater machine, to reduce sample processing time. The method chosen for cotton stem DNA extraction was the modified method of Ziegenhagen. The optimum speed/time setting found for use in the Fastprep&#153; beadbeater, for this extraction method, was 6/30. The PCR testing, of DNA extracted from cotton stem samples, allowed for accurate detection of Fov after PCR parameters had been optimised. Specifically, the annealing temperature of both the VCG 01111 and VCG 01112 specific PCR tests had to be increased by 2 oC. The method chosen for cotton seed DNA extraction was the modified method of Kang. The optimum speed/time setting found for use in the Fastprep&#153; beadbeater, for this extraction method, was 6/20. The PCR testing of DNA extracted from cotton stem samples allowed for accurate detection of Fov, after PCR parameters had been optimised. Specifically, a nested PCR was required, to increase the sensitivity of the PCR. The first round of the nested PCR involved amplification of the IGS region. The second round of PCR, involved the VCG specific PCR tests. The final work presented in this thesis involved the direct detection of Fov from soil using the aforementioned VCG specific PCR tests. The optimal depth of soil to sample was found to be 0-10 cm and no optimal radius was determined. Soil sampling of the tail drain was found to be a suitable alternative to randomly sampling an entire field. Soil samples and dilution plating allowed for accurate detection of Fov from the tail drain, and acted as a benchmark for validation of the PCR test. Two soil DNA extraction methods were found suitable for the extraction of high quality and quantity DNA, these being the SARDI method and the PEG method. The PEG method was chosen to use for further soil testing as it was the most convenient method. The PEG method was modified to be used in the Fastprep&#153; beadbeater, and the optimum speed/time setting found for use in the Fastprep&#153; beadbeater, was 6/30. The PCR testing of DNA extracted directly from cotton soil samples allowed for accurate detection of Fov, after PCR parameters had been optimised. Specifically, a nested PCR was required, to increase the sensitivity of the PCR. The first round of the nested PCR involved amplification of the IGS region. The second round of PCR, involved the VCG specific PCR tests. These specific assays appear to be rapid and reliable tools for identification of Australian strains of Fov and may prove to be useful research tools for further research on the disease etiology and epidemiology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158540</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE AND COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (CAM) &#150; CONCORDANCE AND PERSPECTIVES OF CONSUMERS, HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND CAM PRACTITIONERS</field><field name="creator">Fejzic, Jasmina</field><field name="description">The concept of concordance is based on negotiation between equal partners in a therapeutic relationship to effect a therapeutic alliance. Its strength lies in respect for the patient&#146;s agenda and the creation of openness in the relationship. One field of therapeutics in which concordant relationships may be particularly valuable is the integration of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) into the conventional medicine paradigm. CAM is increasingly a reality in health care. Further, principles of holism and patient-centeredness in CAM parallel the principles of concordance, and exploring the two paradigms in concert was considered conceptually valuable. Review of the international literature identified a lack of research regarding concordance and partnerships in CAM, and concordance in general. The aim of this research was therefore to explore and improve the understanding of consumers&#146; perspectives and experiences with conventional medicines and practitioners (general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists) and CAM practitioners, in order to propose how relationships and therapeutic partnerships between all four parties may be enhanced. The initial research stage involved qualitative and quantitative data collection from a sample of 83 consumers with a chronic condition (cystic fibrosis) to determine their CAM use and issues relating to their relationships with their conventional and CAM practitioners. In this sample, 26% were consulting a CAM practitioner and 45% were using CAM; this was comparable with general population data. Findings of concern were failure to disclose potentially harmful CAM use to conventional practitioners, despite their positive relationships. This study emphasised the importance of communication between consumers and health care practitioners in therapeutic management. A second study explored beliefs and expectations of GPs, consumers and pharmacists to allow further insight into the principles of concordance in health care. This involved qualitative data collection through focus groups with seven consumers and nine pharmacists and in-depth semi-structured interviews with ten GPs in Brisbane. Discussion and interview topics were derived from the current concordance literature. The data were transcribed, independently checked, thematically analysed and used to develop a model to test the application of concordance in pharmacy and medical practice. Despite developing a method for the concordance initiative, attempts to recruit GPs and pharmacists for the trial were unsuccessful. Useful feedback was gathered from contacted GPs and pharmacists. To further explore perceptions on relationships, concordance and CAM use between GPs, pharmacists, CAM consumers and CAM practitioners, a subsequent problem detection study (PDS) was designed. PDS methods are increasingly accepted in health care, usually involving qualitative and quantitative survey research to explore similarities and differences in perceptions between groups of participants. The PDS method initially involved a further focus group with eleven CAM consumers to identify issues specific to CAM and relationships for this group. These qualitative data, in combination with the preceding focus groups and interviews, revealed seven common themes. The themes formed the basis of questionnaire research in GPs, pharmacists, CAM practitioners and CAM consumers. The questionnaire was self-completed and anonymous, and consisted of general demographic descriptors and 36 statements (derived from the seven themes) measured using a five-point Likert scale. Sixty CAM practitioners, 57 GPs, 83 CAM consumers, and 172 pharmacists responded. Analysis was performed by comparison of responses to the 36 statements between the four respondent groups. The findings were interpreted with respect to the original seven themes. In a confirmatory process, principal components analysis, a data reduction technique, was applied to the 36 variables to statistically assess underlying factors. This process identified six factors explaining 56% of the variance. Systematic comparison of the factors with the constituent variables and original themes identified some consistency between the factors and the initial seven themes, but also highlighted new and more congruent themes within the data. The various analyses within this PDS raised a number of issues with respect to challenges in achieving concordant relationships between the four groups, such as the importance of mutual respect and communication, and understanding of roles and limitations. A key recommendation from this research stage is to trial a practice-based concordance intervention/exercise involving both conventional and CAM sectors in Australia. In conclusion, this research has examined the views and experiences of consumers, pharmacists, GPs, and CAM practitioners regarding their inter-personal relationships and partnerships. The findings from the various research stages showed that CAM use was established in the sample populations, and that consultations with CAM practitioners are a valid consideration in the enhancement of concordant therapeutic relationships. Barriers to achieving concordance included lack of time and remuneration for quality interaction and information sharing between health providers and consumers, and current lack of &#145;system&#146; support for the implementation of the principles of concordance. However, the concept of partnerships (concordance) was favoured by all four groups in general, despite some considerable differences in opinion within and between groups. There is a place for advancement of the principles of concordance in both conventional and CAM fields of health care in future health care practice and research in Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158541</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NEURAL NETWORK TUNING OF PROCESS CONTROLLERS</field><field name="creator">Berry, Alexander Kent</field><field name="description">Considerable research has been performed on the tuning of standard proportionalintegral- derivative feedback controllers, with numerous methods of controller tuning having been developed. However, the number of methods for tuning feedforward-feedback controllers is significantly less. This research demonstrates that it is possible to train neural networks to effectively tune feedforward-feedback controllers. Neural networks that directly determine the controller values were developed, in addition to neural networks that were used in an iterative manner to adjust the controller values. The performance of the neural networks was based on the Integral Time weighted Absolute Error discrepancy (ITAE discrepancy) between the tuned controller ITAE and the optimum controller ITAE on sets of testing processes. To confirm the development concepts, proportional and proportional-integral feedback controller tuning was used, and tested. The performance of the neural network tuned feedback controllers indicated unacceptable correlations between the process values and the ITAE discrepancy. These correlations were shown to be primarily due to the effect of the process dynamics. The correlations were also shown to be similar to the correlations for the Yuwana-Seborg [1,2] method of controller tuning. The required accuracy of the controller values, based on a constant ITAE discrepancy, was shown to vary with the process values. The correlations were reduced for the direct determining neural network. This was accomplished by modifying the training set to bias the neural network training towards the training records that required a higher accuracy of the controller values. This was achieved by duplicating the training records that required the higher accuracy. This concept of duplicating some records of the training set was expanded to develop a modification to the neural network backpropagation training algorithm being used. This modification used a normal training set, and biased the training algorithm by utilising additional factors to represent the accuracy requirements of each training record. The accuracy factors were not used for convergence testing of the neural network training, but were only applied relative to each other to determine the biasing of each record for the training algorithm. This refinement achieved the same performance as a duplicated training set, without the associated significant increase in computation and inherent increase in neural network training time. The direct determining neural network for the proportional-integral feedback controller improved the ITAE discrepancy by 93.4% when compared to the Yuwana-Seborg [1,2] method. This result was on a validation set of processes, which had randomly selected process values that fell within the range of the process values used in the training set. The direct determining neural network for a proportional feedforward with proportional-integral feedback controller was capable of improving the combined ITAE discrepancies for a step change in the setpoint and disturbance variables by 77.3%, for the validation set of systems. This improvement was based on the controller tuning using the Yuwana-Seborg [1,2] method for the feedback controller values, and the feedforward controller gain being set to the ratio of the settling ratios for the uncontrolled steps in the manipulated and the disturbance variables. The best controller performance obtained during the iterative step based neural network tuning, when using starting controller values from the direct determining neural network, increased the combined ITAE discrepancy improvement to 95.5%. The direct determining neural networks for lead-lag feedforward with proportional-integral feedback controllers improved the combined setpoint and disturbance ITAE discrepancies by 37.4%, when compared with a traditional method on the validation set of systems. The best controller performance obtained during the iterative step based neural network tuning, when using the direct determined neural networks controller values as the starting points, improved the combined ITAE discrepancy by 91.7%. These improvements indicate a significant advantage in controller tuning. This research has shown that neural networks are capable of tuning feedforwardfeedback controllers effectively and therefore can be used as another method of tuning these controllers. The direct determining neural networks provide good control, while requiring only an uncontrolled step in the manipulated and disturbance variables. The modified neural network training algorithm is an effective method of improving neural network performance for applications where it is acceptable to have varying accuracy requirements of the neural network outputs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158542</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">UNDERSTANDING CORROSION IN HOT POTASSIUM CARBONATE (HPC) ACID GAS REMOVAL PLANTS</field><field name="creator">Harjac, Sandra Josipa</field><field name="description">A study was undertaken in order to understand corrosion in hot potassium carbonate (HPC) plants. A plant focused approach was also necessary which involved a review of historical plant based information and the development of a HPC plant corrosion risk register. The information fiom this study is useful to HPC plants to ensure adequate controls and defences are in place to mitigate corrosion risks to HPC plant integrity. A review of the operational history of HPC acid gas removal plants has shown that corrosion problems have been long standing. Usually a recalcitrant long-standing problem can be identified as occurring at a specific time and be linked with a change to process 1 plant operating conditions and hence it is beneficial to widely review the operating history of a process. Part of this study involved reviewing plant based reports and findings, years of operating history and inspection fmdings for the Santos Moomba gas plant in the Cooper Basin (South Australia) using certain aspects of the six sigma methodology. Review has shown corrosion may be triggered by a number of events. The possible root causes were identified as (1) inadequate concentration of anodic inhibitor, (2) the presence of hydrocarbons, (3) process conditions of high gas loading and/or fiothinglfoarning, (4) formation of a sulfide layer and (5) galvanic interaction. An overview of the Six Sigma methodology is included in this study together with a timeline of plant changes made during the mid 1980's. Electrochemical studies were also conducted and the work presented in this thesis introduces new findings that can be incorporated in HPC plant integrity management. This research studied the influence of steel surface condition and solution chemistry on the critical inhibitor concentration required for spontaneous passivation of carbon steel in solutions typical of those used in a HPC plant. The passivity breakdown of carbon steel in conditions typical of HPC acid gas processing plants was also studied. HPC solution is anodically inhibited. It was determined that the critical inhibitor concentration depended on solution chemistry and on the steel surface condition. An inhibitor concentration of 30 g/l may be required to ensure spontaneous passivation under all conditions. The spontaneous passivation of clean polished carbon steel surfaces required a critical inhibitor concentration of 0.5 to 1.8 gll. A minimum level of v5+ is required for inhibition, so that monitoring the v5+ concentration may be crucial to successfully managing corrosion protection in plant. The pitting potential, evaluated from polarisation curves, indicated resistance to pitting increased with increasing carbonate concentration. The critical chloride concentration was considerably above the maximum concentration of 0.1 wt% recorded in a typical HPC plant. Consequently chlorides should not usually be of concern to plant integrity, but plant chemistry limits should specify that solution chloride concentration be maintained below 0.5 wt% at all times. The presence of DEA has an inhibiting effect on HPC plant corrosion, lowering the corrosion rate of steel in rich solution (29 eqv. wt% K2CO3) by an order of magnitude.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158543</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Structural Basis for Interaction Between Colony-Stimulating Factor-1 and Its Receptor, CSF-1R</field><field name="creator">Hamwood, Tamarind</field><field name="description">Macrophages are white blood cells involved in many aspects of host defence, immunity, pathology and homeostasis. Colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) is required for normal proliferation, differentiation and maturing of macrophage lineage cells. CSF-1 binds to its proto-oncogene receptor, CSF-1R (also known as c-fms) to induce phosphorylation of cytoplasmic tyrosine residues on the receptor and activation, which initiates molecular signalling cascades leading to specific gene regulation. Given the central role of macrophages in immunity and pathology, CSF-1 and its receptor are obvious drug targets. This study involves the structural characterization of the interaction between CSF-1 and its receptor with the eventual aim of designing novel therapeutics to act antagonistically on CSF-1R. Three approaches were taken towards this aim. In Chapter 3, molecular modelling and inter-species cross-reactivity of CSF-1 was used to identify residues likely to be involved in the interaction between CSF-1 and its receptor. The crystal structure of human CSF-1 (PDB code 1hmc), a four-helix bundle cytokine, was used to create a model of murine CSF-1. The CSF-1R is a type III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), with five extracellular immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains, a single transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic kinase domain. The ligand-binding regions, located within the three N-terminal Ig-like domains of the receptor, were modelled on similar cell-surface receptors. An investigative comparison of mouse and human structural models identified seven residues on mouse CSF-1R as candidates for interaction with CSF- 1 based on structural location, solvent exposure, electrostatic complementarity, evolutionary conservation and prevalence in protein-protein interaction sites. To further explore these residues, mutated CSF-1R constructs were assayed in two independent systems. The first assay utilized endogenous signalling by CSF-1R that leads to transcriptional activation of urokinase plasminogen-activator (uPA). Mutant or wild type CSF-1R constructs were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter construct under regulation of the uPA promoter. Luciferase activity measured CSF-1-dependent CSF-1R signalling, to identify mutant receptors not capable of responding to CSF-1. Mutant receptors were also assayed for the ability to promote CSF-1-induced growth in the Ba/F3 cell line. Evidence from both assays confirmed that R127, Y238 and W140 are essential for CSF-1-induced activation of the receptor. Due to the complex disulfide-linkages and glycosylation patterns of CSF-1 and CSF-1R, obtaining crystallization amounts of pure protein required empirical study of different expression systems. As the interaction does not require the transmembrane domain, only the ligand-binding regions of murine CSF-1R were included in the his-tagged constructs. The first contained the entire extracellular region (F15), while shorter truncations contained either the N-terminal three domains (F13) or the second and third Ig-like domains (F23). In Chapter 4, these constructs and CSF-1 were expressed in bacteria as inclusion bodies, purified to homogeneity by metal-affinity chromatography and refolded in the presence of disulfide-exchange factors. While CSF-1 refolded with little aggregation, receptor proteins showed significant aggregation upon removal of denaturants. To overcome aggregation during refolding, receptor constructs were cloned into a baculovirus vector for expression as a secreted protein in a eukaryotic insect cell system. In Chapter 5, insect cell production of CSF-1R proteins for large-scale production was optimised. Chapter 6 describes various assays for protein integrity and activity that were undertaken on the proteins produced in Chapters 4 and 5. In particular, the native activity of CSF-1 to promote bone marrow macrophage growth was examined, as was the ability of soluble receptor and neutralizing antibody to prevent this activity. Additionally, an assay amenable to high-throughput screening for agents that interact specifically with the extracellular domains of CSF-1R was developed in the Ba/F3 cell line. This assay shows excellent dosedependent response to CSF-1, with maximal activity double the baseline activity, and may be used to identify both agonists and antagonists of the interaction.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158545</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vitro and In vivo Characterization of Cellular Responses to PHBV and Hydroxyapatite/PHBV Composites as Bone Biomaterials</field><field name="creator">Wu, Chiu-Ku</field><field name="description">The surgical repair of critical bone defects utilizes bone grafts or synthetic implant materials. Biodegradable polymers offer a variety of advantages for the development of new bone tissue engineering scaffolds. These include the ability to tailor the mechanical properties and degradation kinetics to suit the application of the material. Effective bone biomaterials provide structural support for bone regeneration and elicit minimal inflammatory and toxic effects when implanted. Poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co- 3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) is a biodegradable polymer extracted from bacteria that possesses suitable mechanical properties for use as a bone biomaterial and has a slow rate of degradation in biological environments. This study characterized the biocompatibility and osteointegration of both PHBV and a PHBV composite reinforced with hydroxyapatite (HA). The cellular responses to these materials were examined in vitro and in vivo in an animal bone defect model. The pro-inflammatory response by the murine macrophage RAW264.7 cell line to PHBV was determined in vitro by using a novel fluorescence assay and by measuring changes in a standard set of cellular inflammation markers. Cells were cultured on solvent-cast PHBV films, which induced a pro-inflammatory response that required direct contact between the material and the macrophages. The pro-inflammatory stimulus in PHBV was identified as contaminating bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by culturing with bone marrow-derived macrophages from LPS-hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ mice and CpG nonresponsive TLR9-/- mice. A series of purification/inactivation procedures were evaluated and a procedure was developed that combined solvent extraction and hydrogen peroxide treatment in solution. The optimized treatment substantially reduced the pro-inflammatory response to PHBV without adversely affecting the physical properties of the material. The incorporation of a reinforcing phase can improve the physical properties of polymers and if a biocompatible material such as HA is used then this may improve the biocompatibility of the material. The properties and distribution of the HA in solvent cast PHBV composite with HA (HA/PHBV) were characterized by scanning and transmission microscope and by surface analysis techniques. These studies showed that the distribution of the nano-sized reinforcing phase in HA/PHBV varied with the amount of HA incorporated. The pro-inflammatory response of macrophages to the HA/PHBV was less than for PHBV alone. In addition, the ability of osteoclast-like cells to attach to, proliferate, differentiate and resorb the PHBV and HA/PHBV composite films was assayed in vitro. Osteoclast-like cells could attach to all of the materials and differentiate in response to cytokine treatment but failed to form functional actin ring structures or resorption pits on either the PHBV or HA/PHBV films. The in vivo biocompatibility of purified PHBV and HA/PHBV composite was characterized by implanting cylindrical blocks of these materials into a murine tibial cortical defect. The defect was either filled with the implant or left unfilled as a control. Animals were sacrificed at one week and four weeks post surgery and tibiae were decalcified and paraffin embedded. Bone sections were examined using standard histological staining as well as immunohistochemical staining to determine the extent of the cellular response. Both PHBV and HA/PHBV implants induced a mild immune response one week post surgery, which reduced at four weeks. Bone remodelling occurred at the marrow cavity at the implant-tissue interface, with the formation of new woven bone and the presence of large numbers of TRAP+ osteoclasts. Inflammatory cells were visible at the implant tissue interface where the implant is not in contact with the marrow tissues four weeks post surgery suggesting the initiation of a foreign body giant cell reaction at this site. The in vitro data from this thesis confirmed that PHBV and HA/PHBV composite materials could be prepared and purified to reduce the cellular pro-inflammatory response. The in vivo data showed that the materials induced a mild macrophage related tissue reaction with no evidence of osteointegration occurring at the implant-tissue interface up to four weeks post-surgery. The mechanical, physical properties of these materials and the biological responses to them suggest that with further optimization, PHBV could be utilized as a bone biomaterial.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158546</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The RAGE Glycine 82 Serine Polymorphism and Cardiovascular Disease in Rheumatoid Arthritis.</field><field name="creator">Carroll, Lisa</field><field name="description">Over the last few decades, the importance of inflammation in the initiation and perpetuation of cardiovascular (CV) disease has become increasingly recognized. Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) have been shown to have an increased risk of premature death, occurring predominantly due to an increased rate of premature CV disease. The presence of an adverse risk factor profile in RA is well established, but does not fully explain the excess risk. It is clear that chronic inflammation is a major pathogenic mechanism in atherosclerosis, and this is likely to explain at least some of the increased risk of CV disease in subjects with RA. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) measured by ultrasound, is a good non-invasive approach to measurement of atherosclerotic burden, and is increased in preclinical atherosclerotic disease. cIMT is significantly higher in patients with RA than age and sex matched controls. The Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE) may be important for the perpetuation of chronic inflammation. This cell surface receptor molecule is upregulated at sites of chronic vascular inflammation, and can be signalled by a range of proinflammatory ligands as well as advanced glycation end-products. The gene has a number of polymorphisms, and the Glycine 82 Serine polymorphism has a prevalence of about 10% in Caucasians. Patients with RA are more likely to have this polymorphism than control subjects, as the gene is in linkage disequilibrium with DRB1*0401, one of the RA susceptibility alleles. There is evidence that ligation of RAGE in monocytes derived from donors with the Ser 82 allele signals an enhanced NF-kB and p38 MAP Kinase cellular response, associated with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this study, I hypothesized an association between the RAGE 82 Ser polymorphism of this receptor, which is enriched in RA, and the risk of CV disease in subjects with RA. To investigate whether RAGE 82Ser is associated with CV disease in RA, I examined events, risk factors, features of RA and RAGE 82Ser, in 232 patients with RA attending a tertiary referral hospital. Carotid intima-media thickness was measured using carotid duplex scanning in 137 of those patients. CV events, duration and severity of RA, and CV disease risk factors were determined using patient questionnaires, chart review, laboratory analysis, and radiographs. DNA was typed for HLA-DRB1 genes and the RAGE 82Ser polymorphism. Twenty percent of patients carried the RAGE 82Ser allele. More than 20% of the cohort had suffered a vascular event. Increasing age, elevated fasting glucose, a history of hypercholesterolemia, and a shorter duration of RA were significantly associated with events. RAGE 82Ser was protective against CV events in this cohort. RA patients with RAGE 82Ser had lower LDL levels and LDL/HDL ratio. cIMT was independently and significantly associated with increasing age, male sex, hypertension, low BMI, and the number of pack years of smoking, but not RAGE genotype. Multiple factors, both CV and RA disease-related, contribute to atherosclerosis in established RA. These data suggest RAGE genotype may contribute to the risk of CV events in RA. The role of RAGE genotype requires further study in inception cohorts examining CV events to better understand its contribution to RA-associated CV disease.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arthritis</field><field name="subject">Rheumatoid; Cardiovascular Diseases; Advanced Glycation End-Product Receptor;</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158549</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">REFINING THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF TRABECULECTOMY SURGERY WITH MITOMYCIN C</field><field name="creator">Chiang, Yu-Ming</field><field name="description">Glaucoma is the most important cause of irreversible blindness in the world. It may occur with little or no symptoms until severe and irreversible visual loss takes place. Despite recent advances in glaucoma detection and medical treatment, a percentage of patients still require surgical intervention to control their severe blinding disease. Trabeculectomy, an operation introduced in 1968, revolutionised glaucoma surgery and still remains as the &#147;gold standard&#148; surgical treatment for many types of glaucoma. Since then, significant modifications have evolved to increase the safety and efficacy of traditional trabeculectomy surgery due to the associated risk of failure and a substantial risk profile. To date, the nature of these technical advances and their impact on the safety and efficacy have not been clearly reported. We believe by having a thorough understanding of the evolution of trabeculectomy and implementing a total trabeculecomy system embracing the key advances starting from the pre-operative assessment, to intra-operative technique and post-operative management, a high success rate can be achieved with enhanced safety profile.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158550</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE IMPACT OF ECOLOGICALLY RELEVANT THERMAL STRESS ON GENE EXPRESSION AND MORPHOGENESIS IN HALIOTIS ASININA</field><field name="creator">Gunter, Helen</field><field name="description">There is an increasing weight of evidence that environmental cues influence developmental pathways to produce phenotypes that are not dictated solely by the genotype. The heat shock proteins (Hsps) are an environmentally responsive family that chaperone the members of a range of developmental pathways, thus they provide ideal candidates to study the role of the environment in regulating developmental processes. Heat shock proteins buffer organisms from environmental fluctuations, through preventing protein aggregation, actively refolding unfolded proteins and ultimately preventing apoptotic degradation. Additionally, Hsps are expressed extensively in tissues that are undergoing morphogenesis, rapid cellular division, and migration, throughout the development of a broad range of taxa. Moreover, exposure to elevated temperatures during embryogenesis can result in developmental abnormalities, particularly in the tissues that express the Hsps at physiological temperatures. I have studied the role of heat shock proteins in the development of the gastropod Haliotis asinina. The major Hsp genes - Hsp90, Hsp70 and the heat shock transcription factor gene, HSF were cloned and their expression was determined through in situ hybridisation. HasHsp90A, HasHsp70 and HasHSF are coexpressed in a dynamic and extensive pattern during early development in tissues that include the prototroch, foot and mantle. H. asinina were continually exposed to elevated temperatures throughout early development, which resulted in varying degrees of disorganisation of the tissues that normally express Hsps. Surprisingly, heat shock does not alter the spatial expression of HasHsp90A or HasHsp70, and the Hsps do not appear to confer significant protection to the tissues in which they were expressed. This finding supports the theory that heat shock may &#145;titrate&#146; the Hsps from their developmental roles, subsequently contributing to the heat-induced developmental abnormalities. Sustained exposure to heat shock resulted in complex and variable effects on tissue organisation. To pinpoint the most heat sensitive developmental processes, I performed brief heat shocks that focussed around specific stages of the development of a single tissue, the prototroch. Normal prototroch development was initially characterised for H. asinina through in situ hybridisation using Has-Cal, which encodes Calmodulin, a marker of prototroch development. Embryos were heat shocked during three different windows of prototroch development: two during putative trochoblast specification (1-16 cells and 16-64 cells), and one during trochoblast migration (4-9 hours post fertilisation (hpf)). The application of heat shock during the specification stages consistently resulted in disorganisation of the prototroch, however, heat shock during trochoblast migration did not. It was concluded that heat shock impacts the establishment of polarity in this tissue, which has downstream effects on migration, rather than migration itself. Embryonic exposure to heat shock results in the development of exogastrulae, which allowed the examination of normal inductive processes in H. asinina. Heat shock leads to the development of exogastrulae through an unknown mechanism, so the heat shocked exogastrulae were compared to exogastrulae that had developed as a result of pharmacological inhibition of the induction of 3D, the molluscan organizer. The two forms of exogastrulae share similar morphological characteristics, including an anterior constriction of the posttrochal region, disorganisation of the posttrochal ectoderm and quadri-radialisation of the pretrochal region. 3D inhibited larvae are also characterised by the absence of mesoderm, indicated by a lack of Mox expression, and subsequently muscle (indicated by an absence of F-actin) and the adult nervous system, (indicated by a loss of complexity in anti-serotonin staining in veliger larvae). Ironically, many heat shocked larvae that show stereotypical characteristics of 3D inhibition possess mesoderm, muscles, and an adult nervous system. This indicates that gastropod morphogenesis involves yet uncharacterised, organisational influences that are independent to 3D. A microarray study compared the global gene expression profiles of the 3D inhibited larvae to the morphologically similar heat shocked larvae. Of the 5547 clones on the abalone microarray chip, there was only one clone in common between 3D inhibited larvae and heat shock exogastrulae. Thus these treatments that produce similar morphological outcomes, have fundamentally different underlying gene expression profiles. The microarray experiment resulted in the identification of a broad range of heat responsive mediators of morphogenesis including cytoskeletal components, organisers of cytoskeletal components, and the upstream organizers of polarity and morphogenesis. It is likely that the observed alterations in the expression of these genes, contributed to the heat induced developmental defects of the prototroch, and the development of exogastrulae. Thus heat shock can impact morphogenesis in molluscs at many levels. This study provides evidence that the major heat shock proteins have an ancient and pleiotropic role in morphogenesis, and that heat shock impacts heavily on morphogenesis, possibly through the titration of Hsp function. This study also indicates that Hsps are an environmentally responsive family, which interact with a range of developmental pathways that may be useful in characterising a range of environmentally mediated phenotypes in the future.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158551</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GENOME CONTENT AND DEVELOPMENTAL EXPRESSION OF TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GENES IN THE DEMOSPONGE AMPHIMEDON QUEENSLANDICA: INSIGHTS INTO THE FIRST MULTICELLULAR ANIMAL</field><field name="creator">Larroux, Claire Marguerite</field><field name="description">Recent phylogenetic insights suggest that the body plan and life cycle of the oldest metazoans, sponges, may resemble the last common ancestor to all animals. While their adult body plan differs drastically from other animals, sponge development displays many metazoan hallmarks. Enabling a framework for the spatial organisation of a variety of cell types, the invention of a basic developmental program may have been the key step allowing the transition to multicellularity in animals. Novel transcription factors were likely to have been crucial to the increase in regulatory complexity that must have accompanied this step. Many developmental regulatory pathways are conserved throughout animal evolution and investigations into the molecular basis of eumetazoan development have led to reconstruction of ancestral developmental states. In this study, I investigate the genomic and developmental innovations that occurred at the base of Metazoa in view of reconstructing the first metazoan developmental program and identifying fundamental characters that enabled the transition to multicellularity in animals. As in other metazoans, in the haplosclerid demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica, fertilisation, cleavage, and gastrulation yield a larva with various cell types patterned along an anteriorposterior axis and into germ layers. Non-neural sensory structures enable the larva to respond to environmental conditions. Drawing on the recently sequenced genome of A. queenslandica, I show that this demosponge has a limited set of homeobox, Sox, Fox, T-box, and nuclear receptor transcription factors, which have important roles during eumetazoan development. Using in situ hybridisation on sponge developmental stages for the first time, I also analyse the expression of a subset of these genes during development. Remarkably, A. queenslandica possesses a clear NK cluster of ANTP genes but lacks Hox, ParaHox, or EHGBox genes. This suggests that an NK cluster was present in the metazoan last common ancestor and that a protoHox gene - progenitor to Hox, ParaHox, and EHGBox genes - arose from within this cluster after demosponges had branched off the main metazoan lineage. Importantly, this implies that Hox genes were co-opted into an existing system for anteriorposterior axial patterning. Using the completed genomes of A. queenslandica and the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis as well as preliminary genome traces of the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, I have analysed the origin and early evolution of transcription factors through phylogenetic analyses. Metazoanspecific transcription factor classes seem to have evolved before demosponges departed from the main metazoan lineage. It appears that these classes gradually diversified by duplication in different ways, particularly in the periods preceding and following the demosponge/metazoan split. Largely unlike cnidarians, sponges seem to constitute an intermediate stage in the evolution of the metazoan genome and, as such, the transcription factor genes present in their genome may have been part of a core developmental program sufficient for the transition to multicellularity. Many transcription factor genes are expressed during A. queenslandica development and a subset of these genes seems to display some conservation in their developmental expression between sponges and other metazoans. AmqHNF4 expression suggests that epithelium evolution went through a stage without a basement membrane. Based on AmqLim3 and AmqSoxB expression, neurons may be related to pre-neural cells associated with photo- and chemosensory structures. AmqBsh and AmqSoxF were probably involved in regulation of cell adhesion and extracellular matrix molecules during the development of the metazoan ancestor. AmqProx2, AmqPaxB, and AmqPoul expression is only detected in early embryogenesis while AmqSoxC, like most other genes in this study, may be involved in fate determination and differentiation of a specific migrating cell lineage throughout development. Expression data paint the picture of an ancestral metazoan developmental program where asymmetric cleavage participates in early cell fate determination and differentiation and where specified cells respond in different ways to signalling cues by following complex migratory trajectories throughout embryogenesis. From a genomic and developmental perspective, sponges appear to be an intermediate in metazoan evolution. The developmental program seems to have gradually increased in complexity in pre-Cambrian animals. However, the last common ancestor of all extant metazoans may have already utilised many of the same molecular tools during development in the same way as most contemporary animals. The evolutionary steps that occurred at the base of Metazoa and led to a relatively complex core developmental program do not seem to have been recorded until present day.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158552</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Music compositions and a critical commentary.</field><field name="creator">Medina, Luis Alberto Najera</field><field name="description">Consisting of two volumes comprising a critical commentary and a folio of scores (including sound recordings), this submission addresses a variety of compositional techniques and styles in the creation of programmatic compositions.

The program this research is based on was a parenting program that utilized the technique of song writing. It was aimed at addressing the issues of childhood abuse and its impact on parenting. In-depth interviews were conducted with five program participants. The women were asked to describe their experiences of the song writing process and reflect on the meaning for them of their song creations now. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using qualitative research methodology. The NVivo software program was used to assist with the organization of and thematic analysis of the data. The song writing process and subsequent recording and performing of their work resulted in many positive benefits for participants. The women found the process of creating, recording and performing their work in public contributed to a sense of pride and achievement, and for some provided closure on their childhood experiences. Participants also noted that group song writing had benefited others by informing them about the impact of childhood abuse. There were also some disappointing aspects of this process for some participants. These included having their words taken out of context or not used within group song creations and for one participant, a perceived inability to create music as powerful as her words. All participants had listened to their song creations since the program and had shared their songs with others. They did this to help people to understand more of their childhood experiences and the impact of these on their lives. A range of feelings are experienced by participants when listening to their songs now including happiness, sadness and anger. Overwhelmingly, participants expressed a sense of pride about their participation in the song writing process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158554</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the genetics and physiology of sugar accumulation in sweet sorghum as a potential model for sugarcane.</field><field name="creator">Ritter, Kimberley Belle</field><field name="description">Obtaining higher sugar yield is a major focus of sugarcane variety improvement programs, however the complex genome of sugarcane has hindered research and development of the crop. Sorghum and sugarcane are both members of the Andropogoneae tribe and comparative mapping has revealed a high level of synteny among the two closely related species. Sorghum is a diploid species with a small genome unlike sugarcane which has one of the most complex genomes of any organism. Particular varieties of sorghum, known as sweet sorghums or sorgos, accumulate high levels of sugar in stalk juice near the time of maturity, as does sugarcane. Based on this relationship between sorghum and sugarcane, this study aimed to investigate sweet sorghum as a genetic and physiological model for sugar accumulation in sugarcane. An F6 recombinant inbred line (RIL) segregating population with 184 progeny lines was developed from a cross between R9188, a dwarf conversion of the sweet sorghum line Rio, and R403463-2-1, a Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (QDPIF) elite grain sorghum R-line. The population was evaluated in two field trials for 16 agronomic traits and eight sugar-related traits. A genetic linkage map of R9188 x R403463-2-1 was constructed integrating 225 polymorphic bands produced by 38 AFLP&#153; primer pairs, 37 Xtxp SSR and six sugarcane SSR markers. The constructed map had 16 linkage groups (LG), of which 10 could be assigned a chromosome on the basis of shared markers between this map and previously published maps of sorghum and sugarcane, and spanned a total length of 2012.9 cM (including unknown LG). Eleven traits were analysed for QTL identification; seven sugar-related traits (sucrose content, glucose content, fructose content, sugar content, sucrose yield, sucrose to sugar ratio and Brix) and four agronomic traits (height, DTF, total dry matter and grain yield). Fifty-five marker were associated with the 11 traits from the two field trials, of which 15 were identified in both trials which is not unexpected considering the high heritability of the traits in the field trials. QTL generally colocated to five major locations. QTL from R9188 were found for sucrose content, sugar content and sugar yield on chromosomes SBI-01, SBI-05 and LG-U6. R9188 also contributed QTL for Brix on SBI-05 and LG-U6, and sugar content on SBI-03. QTL from R403463-2-1 were found for sucrose content and sucrose yield on SBI-10, and glucose content on SBI-07. QTL for height, days to flowering and total dry matter, were located on SBI-01 from R403463-2-1, and on LG-U6 from R9188. QTL for grain yield from both R403463-2-1 and R9188 were found on SBI-03. Three of the sorghum chromosomes (SBI-01, SBI-03 and SBI-05) that contained QTL for sugar-related traits, also contained sugarcane SSRs that mapped in sugarcane to three homology groups (2, 3 and 4) with strong QTL for sugar-related traits suggesting that similar loci for sugar-related traits are being detected between sweet sorghum and sugarcane. Field and glasshouse trials were conducted to investigate the accumulation of sugars spatially within the stem and developmentally at anthesis and post-black layer in sweet sorghums. A stem sugar profile in sweet sorghums had not previously been created at post-black layer and it was found that in the glasshouse trial, the sucrose increased toward the base of the stem, in the same manner of accumulation seen in sugarcane. Like sugarcane, the sucrose in the sweet sorghums accounted for 90% of the soluble solids (sucrose to total ratio) at the end of the crop cycle. A comparison of profiles was also conducted between a sweet and grain sorghum, fertile sorghum and their sterile counterpart, sweet sorghum and the dwarf conversion, and high Brix and low Brix progeny of the R9188 x R403463-2-1 population. At post-black layer, the sweet sorghum had higher sucrose than the grain sorghum, and higher sugars were found in the sterile versions compared to the fertile versions. Sugar accumulation had not been previously investigated in dwarf converted sweet sorghums; R9188, the dwarf version of Rio, was significantly lower in whole-plant sucrose at post-black layer, but no difference was noted in individual stem sections. No clear distinction could be made between the high Brix lines and the low Brix lines, sampled at post-black layer, for sugar-related traits at a whole-plant or stem section level. The genetic relationship of sweet and grain sorghums, within S. bicolor ssp. bicolor, was investigated for the first time. Ninety-five genotypes, including 31 sweet sorghums and 64 grain sorghums, representing all five races within the subspecies bicolor, were screened with 277 polymorphic AFLP&#153; markers. The sweet sorghum lines were largely distinguished from the others, particularly by a group of markers located on SBI-08 and SBI-10, and although the clusters obtained did not group clearly on the basis of racial classification; the sweet sorghum lines often clustered with grain sorghums of similar racial origin thus suggesting that the high stem sugar in sweet sorghums occurred independently or was independently selected in several different genetic backgrounds within S. bicolor ssp. bicolor. In this study, great steps have been made in determining the use of sweet sorghum as a genetic and physiological model for sugar accumulation in sugarcane. From a genetic perspective, similar loci for sugar-related traits were detected between sweet sorghum and sugarcane, thus indicating that sweet sorghum is likely to be a good genetic model for sugar accumulation in sugarcane. In sweet sorghum, the markers associated with the sugar-related traits will be a valuable resource for future markerassisted selection for these traits in a sweet sorghum breeding program. However, the diversity study suggested that the high stem sugar in sweet sorghum occurred independently or was independently selected in several different genetic backgrounds, which is in contrast to the possible monophyletic origin of high stem sugar in sugarcane. From a physiological perspective, the sucrose levels increased toward the base of the stem in sweet sorghum and accounted for 90% of the soluble solids at the end of the crop cycle, in the same manner of accumulation seen in sugarcane, suggesting that sweet sorghum could be a physiological model for sugarcane. Thus, sweet sorghum could be used as both a genetic and physiological model for sugarcane.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158555</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of surface properties on the attachment of Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli.</field><field name="creator">Rivas, Lucia</field><field name="description">Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) are important foodborne pathogens causing gastrointestinal disease worldwide. Understanding how STEC attach to food-related surfaces may provide insight into their potential persistence and contamination within food environments. Bacterial attachment is influenced by a number of bacterial surface properties, including physicochemical characteristics, surface structures, protein expression and modes of growth. The aim of this study was to characterise the surface properties of 17 STEC and 3 non-STEC strains representing a range of serotypes and to determine the role of these surface properties in the initial attachment of STEC to beef muscle and adipose tissue and stainless steel. In addition, investigations into whether initial attachment of STEC to stainless steel could predict biofilm formation were also performed. The physicochemical properties of the STEC strains, namely cellular surface charge, hydrophobicity and electron donor/acceptor potential were determined for all strains grown in planktonic and sessile culture. Cellular surface charge was determined using zeta potential measurements. Hydrophobicity of the isolates was determined using three hydrophobicity determination methods, while a microbial adhesion to solvents method was used to determine the electron donor/acceptor characteristics. No differences of surface charge measurements were found between planktonic and sessile grown cultures. Isolates belonging to serogroup O157 and serotypes O26:H11 and O111:H- were significantly (p&lt;0.05) less negatively charged than other STEC serotypes tested. All strains were hydrophilic by most methods and demonstrated a lower hydrophobicity in sessile culture compared to planktonic culture. All STEC strains were found to possess an electron donor and basic character. Combining the results of surface charge and hydrophobicity for planktonic and sessile culture by principal component analysis found that a combination of methods was able to differentiate between strains belonging to the O157 serogroup and other STEC/non-STEC strains. Initial attachment onto beef muscle and adipose tissue and stainless steel was determined for STEC grown in planktonic and sessile culture. For muscle and adipose tissue assays, viable counts for loosely and strongly attached cells were obtained and the strength of attachment (Sr) was calculated. All STEC isolates grown in sessile culture attached in higher numbers to muscle and adipose tissue than those in planktonic culture. The mean counts for strongly attached bacteria for planktonic and sessile cultures were significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher on adipose than on muscle tissue. However, some strains of STEC showed no difference in attachment to muscle or adipose tissue, particularly following growth in sessile culture. Sr values were not significantly (p&gt;0.05) different between STEC isolates for all assays. For stainless steel, the attachment of STEC was determined using epifluorescence microscopy. Five STEC strains attached in significantly greater (p&lt;0.05) numbers to stainless steel following growth in planktonic culture compared to sessile culture. In contrast, two clinical strains of O157:H7 attached in significantly greater (p&lt;0.05) numbers following growth in sessile culture compared to planktonic culture. Thirteen out of twenty E. coli strains showed no significant difference (p&gt;0.05) in attachment when grown in planktonic or sessile culture. The change of interfacial free energy between the bacterial strains and stainless steel was calculated and the influence of free energy in attachment was determined. Although a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) in free energy values was found between STEC strains, no correlation was found between free energy values and bacterial counts on stainless steel. In addition, no correlation was found between bacterial hydrophobicity and surface charge values or production of surface structures (type I fimbriae or flagella) with viable counts and Sr values for muscle and adipose assays and for counts obtained for the stainless steel assays. In order to determine whether initial attachment can predict biofilm formation, two biofilm determination methods (epifluorescence microscopy method on stainless steel and a microtitre plate method) were performed and evaluated using seven STEC and three non- STEC (in diluted NB, 25&#176;C, 24 and 48 h), grown in planktonic and sessile culture. The influence of surface structure expression (flagella, type I fimbriae and curli fimbriae) and the possession of antigen 43 (encoded by agn43) on biofilm formation were also investigated. No correlation was found between counts for epifluorescence microscopy on stainless steel and the absorbance values obtained with the microtitre plate method for planktonic and sessile grown cultures. Different abilities of individual STEC strains to attach to stainless steel and microtitre plates were found, with some strains attaching better to each surface following growth in either planktonic or sessile culture. All O157 STEC strains had low biofilm counts on stainless steel for planktonic and sessile grown cultures, however one STEC O157:Hstrain (EC516) had significantly greater (p&lt;0.05) biofilm production on microtitre plates compared to the other O157 STEC strains. EC516 also had greater biofilm production on microtitre plates following growth in sessile culture in comparison to planktonic culture. Strains expressing curli fimbriae were found to produce significantly greater (p&lt;0.05) biofilms on microtitre plates compared to the non-curli expressing strains. No relationship was found between the production of type I fimbriae, motility, agn43 and bacterial physicochemical properties and biofilm formation on stainless steel or microtitre plates. The outer membrane protein (OMP) profiles of four E. coli O157 and one non-STEC strain demonstrating different abilities to initially attach to stainless steel following growth in planktonic and sessile culture were obtained using 2D electrophoresis. Qualitative and quantitative differences in the total number of OMPs expressed between planktonic and sessile cultures were found for all E. coli isolates tested. Two of the five E. coli O157 isolates were found to express a greater number of proteins in sessile culture (80-111 proteins) compared to planktonic culture (53-54 proteins). The number of proteins expressed only in sessile culture was also greater (15-44 proteins) than the number of proteins expressed in planktonic culture only (3-7 proteins). Several proteins were also found to be up-regulated in either planktonic (3-7 proteins) or sessile culture (3-8 proteins), in comparison to the other mode of growth tested. Differentially expressed proteins spots were identified using matrixassisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). A flagella protein (FlgE) was found to be expressed in planktonic culture only, while ironregulating proteins (FhuA, FepA and YbiL) were expressed in sessile culture only. Other OMPs (MipA and OmpX) had lower expression in sessile culture than in planktonic culture The results of this study demonstrate that the surface properties of STEC strains (e.g. physicochemical characteristics, surface structure and OMP expression) can differ between strains grown in planktonic and sessile culture. STEC were also found to behave differently with respect to attachment to meat tissues and stainless steel, with some strains demonstrating a greater potential to strongly attach to a surface following growth in planktonic or sessile culture. Initial attachment of STEC to stainless steel does not appear to influence biofilm formation and differences between biofilm determination methods tested suggests that biofilm production on one surface may not be appropriate to represent other surfaces. A lack of correlation between the surface properties characterised and the attachment of STEC to surfaces tested in this study suggests that STEC may use a combination of known and unknown attachment mechanisms which in turn are influenced by the bacterial cell, the attachment surface and surrounding medium. Further investigations are needed to continue characterising bacterial and substratum factors involved in bacterial attachment and biofilm processes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158556</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of summer dormancy in improving survival of temperate perennial pasture grasses in drought-prone environments</field><field name="creator">Norton, Mark Roger</field><field name="description">The poor survival of perennial pasture grasses is a major constraint to agricultural systems where summers are characterised by long, severe droughts and high temperatures. The search for grasses with superior tolerance to these conditions has resulted in a re-awakening of interest in the summer dormancy trait leading to the recent release of several summer dormant cultivars. This has led to renewed questioning about the nature of summer dormancy particularly as the definition of the trait is unclear. Therefore, this research has aimed to strengthen understanding of summer dormancy in the pasture grasses Dactylis glomerata L. (cocksfoot), Festuca arundinacea Schreb. (tall fescue) and Phalaris aquatica L. (phalaris) by studying two cultivars contrasting in the expression of summer dormancy from each species. A range of field trials in the south of France aimed to identify key physiological mechanisms whereby summer dormancy enhances survival over long, dry summers by concentrating on the effects of different levels of summer water supply and plant maturity. Field trials in that region also compared and evaluated several methods to measure the intensity of summer dormancy and developed a new method based on herbage production from irrigated summer culture. Growth chamber trials with small pots studied the relationship between temperature and the expression of summer dormancy by comparing the growth response to a range of temperatures of two cohorts of plants contrasting in exposure to conditions aimed to induce summer dormancy. Finally, winter research conducted in pots in the glasshouse subjected plants to drying cycles to study dehydration tolerance and avoidance and related these to the expression of the summer dormancy which had been observed in the summer field studies. The component mechanisms of summer dormancy were clearly expressed under full summer irrigation by reproductive plants which had been vernalised and although present in younger, spring-sown plants they were approx. 40% less intense while the tall fescue cv only expressed dormancy if subjected to prior drought. Expression began in late spring/early summer and included growth cessation and herbage senescence resulting in substantially less summer evapotranspiration in the dormant tall fescue and cocksfoot swards compared to their summer active counterparts. The dormant cocksfoot under drought dehydrated to -6.7 MPa and even under irrigation dehydration to -3 MPa occurred . In contrast, under irrigation the dormant tall fescue and phalaris cvs remained hydrated. Dehydrin expression increased in all cvs as water deficit intensified but while expression declined after a storm in the non-dormant cvs (in response to increased water status), levels remained uniformly high in the three dormant cvs. The summer dormant tall fescue maintained full sward cover after summer droughts of 116 and 144 days whereas cover in the summer active cv fell by approx. 25%. Similar sward loss (22%) occurred in a summer active cocksfoot, in contrast to the summer dormant cv after a 144 day drought. No survival advantage for the summer dormant cv was measured in phalaris although this seemed to be due to unique field trial site characteristics. Five methods for summer dormancy measurement varying according to summer water availability, i.e., full irrigation, mid-summer storm and complete drought, and assessment method, viz., herbage production measurement or visual estimation of herbage senescence, were compared and evaluated. A method using the herbage harvested from irrigated summer culture was developed. Summer dormancy is best measured under non-limiting moisture, because assessing the trait under complete drought can result in false scores, e.g. Medly cocksfoot was moderately dormant under drought (6/10), but non-dormant under full summer irrigation or after a storm (1-2/10). Dormancy was scored equally well by measuring herbage production or by visually assessing the level of herbage senescence. The examination of the effect of temperature on summer dormancy questioned whether dormancy is independent of temperature or is simply a decline in growth in response to high summer temperatures. In cocksfoot the decline associated with summer dormancy (approx. 100%) was independent from any which occurred as a result of high temperatures. In tall fescue, despite indications that dormancy was a separate effect it was not possible to definitively separate the effects of rising temperature from prior dormancy induction suggesting the need for further research. Inconsistent and inconclusive results occurred in phalaris suggesting that small pot culture is inappropriate for studying dormancy in this species. Subjecting plants to drying cycles in a winter glasshouse environment demonstrated that dehydration tolerance, dehydration avoidance and summer dormancy are separate responses able to be independently expressed. In cocksfoot and tall fescue two highly dehydration-avoiding cvs also expressed high levels of dormancy in summer as reproductive plants although a summer active cocksfoot was also highly dehydration-avoiding. In contrast, the highly summer dormant phalaris cvs showed no greater levels of dehydration avoidance/tolerance than much less dormant cvs. The research has identified key mechanisms of drought survival as being component, defining characteristics of summer dormancy and has also demonstrated robust screening methods to extend utilisation of the trait in plant improvement.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158557</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HIGH-POWER ULTRASOUND FOR CONTROL OF HONEY CRYSTALLISATION</field><field name="creator">Rajapakse, Tikiri Bandara Jayampathi</field><field name="description">Honey is a supersaturated sugar solution, with the least soluble sugar, glucose crystallising as D-glucose monohydrate at room temperature or in cold conditions, in most floral types of honeys. Crystallisation is an undesirable characteristic during the handling, processing, storage and production of liquid honey. Honey that naturally crystallises during the production process is termed &#145;candied honey&#146; or &#145;granulated honey&#146;. The fundamental changes that occur in crystals at the microscopic level is not well understood, particularly why different honeys crystallise at different rates, how crystals grow with time, and why and how different sized crystals are produced in different floral types of honey. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the crystallisation process in different floral types of Australian honey was gained through the first detailed, microscopic study of the natural, D-glucose monohydrate crystallisation process in Australian honeys. Here, crystallisation studies of different samples of different floral types of Australian honey were carried out at the optimum crystallisation temperature of 14 &#176;C. Firstly, an image analysis method was developed for viewing individual crystals at the microscopic level. Secondly, samples of different floral types of honey were monitored for crystal formation and growth, with honey types selected for a replicated study. Thirdly, honey samples were liquefied using heat to dissolve crystals, and centrifuged to remove any nuclei that may affect crystallisation, prior to storage at 14 &#176;C. Here, the method for preparing the microscope slides containing one small drop of liquefied honey was critical. The cover slip must be sealed to prevent adverse effects of air and moisture movement. In this replicated study, crystal formation and crystal growth were monitored successfully at regular intervals during storage at 14 &#176;C, for selected honeys such as canola, Salvation Jane, spotted gum, red gum, and yellow box honeys, and a reworked mixed floral honey. Both needles and the uniquely shaped plate crystals form, including the conversion of needles to plates given the correct supersaturation conditions. The amount of supersaturation in any part of the honey drop can explain the type of crystal formations produced. Fourthly, fructose, glucose and moisture contents were determined for the honey samples used in the replicated study, so as to identify a correlation between the three crystallisation indices suggested by White et al. (1962) for predicting crystallising tendency, and the microscopic and normal visual observations of honey crystallisation. The granulating indicator of glucose/water ratio was able to explain most of the microscopic and visual observations of crystallisation in these honey samples. Direct heating of honey for long periods is the present method used to dissolve D-glucose monohydrate crystals during the honey packing process. However, this is a time consuming, energy inefficient, and not a cost effective means for liquefying candied honey. Therefore, an alternate novel means for liquefying candied honey using a shorttime high power ultrasound treatment, rather than the standard heat treatment, was studied in depth, with a view to producing data that could be used for the scaling-up for industrial application within the Australian honey industry. In this part of the project, the effect of high power ultrasound on cavitation of sugar solutions was initially studied so as to better understand the effect of ultrasound on honey. An experiment was carried with the aim of developing a method to determine cavitation by way of measuring the size of the cavitation bubbles generated by ultrasound. A literature method was tested to explore the possibility of measuring the cavitation bubble size by laser diffraction instrument, Malvern Mastersizer/E. The data of bubble fields were analysed and percentage frequency by volume versus particle size plots, and percentage undersize by volume versus particle size plots were obtained. The results of this experiment for pure water and fructose solutions showed that the size of the bubbles generated by ultrasonication is more than 600 &#181;m, which is the maximum measurable limit of the Malvern Mastersizer/E. Therefore, the experimental setup with Malvern Mastersizer/E can not be used for measuring cavitation bubbles generated by ultrasound. Another literature method for measuring cavitation was trialled; this involved calculating the cavitational yield by measuring the amount of iodine liberated by ultrasonication in aqueous potassium iodide solutions, as measured by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. However, the sensitivity of the spectrophotometer used was low and unable to measure the absorbance of 0.1 - 0.2 x 10 &#150;3 mg/mL iodine solutions, which is in the range of iodine produced by the ultrasonication of aqueous potassium iodide solutions. Therefore, the study of the effect of high power ultrasound on cavitation of sugar solutions was not continued further. Next, three major experiments were conducted in order to evaluate the effect of ultrasound on the liquefaction of candied honey, and for controlling crystallisation. A computer-controlled bench-top ultrasound processor was used. Firstly, an experiment was undertaken to select the type of ultrasonic sonotrode, from the three sonotrodes that were available, that better liquefies a sample of candied Salvation Jane honey. The 40 mm diameter sonotrode operated at a 12 &#181;m amplitude optimally liquefies candied Salvation Jane honey. Secondly, six ultrasound energy levels were used with the selected 40 mm diameter sonotrode operated at a 12 &#181;m amplitude, to determine the optimum energy requirement for liquefying candied Salvation Jane honey. The specific energy input required for complete liquefaction of 1 kg of candied Salvation Jane honey is 0.126 kWh, which is the basic design criteria required for the design of an industrial scale ultrasound processing system. The hydroxymethylfurfural concentration, and the diastase and invertase activities of ultrasound treated Salvation Jane honey were determined and compared with standard heat-treated Salvation Jane honey. There is no detrimental effect on diastase and invertase activities due to ultrasound treatment. In addition, the hydroxymethylfurfural concentration of ultrasound-treated honey was lower than that for heat-treated honey. These findings suggest that the ultrasound treatment needed to liquefy honey does not affect the chemical quality parameters relative to that produced by a heat treatment similar to that used in the honey industry. Thirdly, a study to see if ultrasound treatment of honey delays the crystallisation of liquefied honey. Here, &#145;candied&#146; reworked mixed honey (a very fast crystallising honey) was completely liquefied by the optimum ultrasound treatment conditions. The rate of crystallisation for ultrasound-liquefied honey was compared to that for heat-liquefied honey, when both were stored at the optimum crystallisation temperature of 14 &#176;C. Interestingly, ultrasound treatment delays the crystallisation in comparison with the standard heat treatment. Crystallisation is a desirable character in the creamed honey production process. Creamed honey is a rapidly crystallised honey that requires honey blends involving two types of honey: fast crystallising honey types and highly flavour honey types. Creamed honey is used as a spread and its spreadability is determined by the size of the D-glucose monohydrate crystals and how uniform is their size distribution. Currently, there can be variation in the quality of creamed honey produced by industry due to a lack of understanding concerning the creamed honey process. To study this process, a differential scanning calorimetric method was optimised for determining the crystalline D-glucose monohydrate content in creamed honey. Next, a laboratory creamed honey process was successfully developed and optimised based on the universally used Dyce method, resulting in the production of laboratory creamed honey that had a similar amount of D-glucose monohydrate crystals to that of commercial creamed honey. Application of short-time high power ultrasound in the creamed honey production was then studied, so as to optimise process parameters with the view of enhancing nucleation rates. The theory is that high-power ultrasound will reduce the size of the existing crystals and increase nucleation by incorporating cavitation bubbles, which act as nuclei in crystallisation. Due to the increase of number nuclei, a large number of fine crystals should be formed rapidly, producing high quality creamed honey. A more stable and smoother textured creamed honey then results from uniform crystal growth. Therefore, short-time high power ultrasound was used to treat starter (seed) honey prior to adding it to honey blends (canola/red gum and alfalfa/blue gum honeys), while the honey blends with added untreated seed honey were ultrasound treated during the crystallisation period. Comparison of the crystalline D-glucose monohydrate content of ultrasound treated laboratory creamed honeys with untreated laboratory creamed honeys showed that there was no significant difference (P&gt;0.05) in the crystalline D-glucose monohydrate contents. However, conditioning (storing at 30 &#176;C) of the laboratory creamed honeys produced a small change in the crystal content, finally producing a crystal content similar to that of commercial creamed honey. In addition, conditioning led to a softening and improvement in the spreadability of the laboratory creamed honeys. In conclusion, this study shows that high power ultrasound can be used to effectively liquefy candied honey while not effecting honey quality parameters, without the need for the long heat treatment that is presently used in the honey industry. In addition, ultrasound treatment converts candied honey to a liquid honey that is more stable to crystallisation during storage, than is liquid honey produced from candied honey by heat treatment. Further, liquefaction of candied honey by high-power ultrasound treatment has the potential to reduce the handling and energy costs for beekeepers and honey packers, which would produce great benefit for the Australian honey industry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158558</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regional planning as good governance: A central Queensland case study</field><field name="creator">Everingham, Jo-Anne</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1605 Policy and Administration</field><field name="subject">Regionalism -- Queensland, Central -- Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158559</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imago Germanici: Popularity, Iconography, Visibility.</field><field name="creator">Mack, Janet-Lynne</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the image of Germanicus Caesar from three different perspectives: that of popularity, iconography and visibility. It argues that the image of Germanicus was manipulated by interested parties both during his lifetime, and after his death. Ultimately this image was used for propaganda purposes, and this resulted in a perception of Germanicus which has lasted to the present day. The first section considers Germanicus&#146; popularity. There is no doubt that Germanicus was popular, but the thesis will show that the perception of this popularity came about through both political and historiographical devices. During an examination of the extant tradition on Germanicus, it will become evident that it was primarily through his posthumous reputation that this image of Germanicus came about. The fact that three of his descendants became emperors contributed to this perception, for Germanicus was placed at the centre of a program of familial regeneration by these emperors. This resulted in a strong image of his popularity, which then passed into the extant literary sources. These extant sources will be discussed, and it will become evident that writers on Germanicus, particularly Tacitus in his Annals and Suetonius in the Life of Caligula, presented an image of Germanicus which was fashioned to display their motivations for writing as well as their own literary prowess. Germanicus&#146; image was also manipulated at his death. The reaction at the death of Germanicus will be examined, and it will be argued that for each of the reactions which occurred at his passing, there already existed motivations for them, and that these were manipulated for propagandistic purposes. Assessment of the decrees setting out the honours granted to him after he died, the tabula Hebana and the tabula Siarensis, will show that although Germanicus was granted many honours, they were not unprecedented. However, he was granted many honours, and this created the impression that they were both unique and greater in number than those which had been decreed for others in the imperial family. The iconography of Germanicus will be covered in the second section. Germanicus was in the unique position of being equally related to both the Julian and the Claudian sides of the family, and as a result, his image was used by successive Julio-Claudian emperors as a means of promoting differing political and dynastic positions. Many sculptural portraits of Germanicus are posthumous, and this again shows that he was used politically as part of the familial regeneration policies of Caligula and Claudius in particular. Commemorative dynastic groups will be examined, as well as relief sculptures such as the Ravenna Relief and the sculptures from the Sebasteion at Aphrodisias. Examination will also take place of the political propaganda embodied in gemstones including the Gemma Augustea, the Gemma Claudia and the Grand Cam&#233;e de France, and on coins of the Julio-Claudian and Flavian periods. Germanicus&#146; image was also used as a means of disseminating imperial propaganda through the travel he undertook as part of his duties. His physical presence in areas removed from Italy and Rome was used as a means of representing the institution of the Empire. Thus the section on visibility will examine the peregrinations of Germanicus, who during his career travelled to Germany, Gaul, the East and to Egypt. A focal point for this section will be on the practicalities of these journeys, including which routes were taken, and who accompanied him. This last was particularly important, as the impression created by Germanicus&#146; entourage was vital in increasing his visibility, and thus that of the empire itself. This had implications for the maintenance of good relations with the provincials. The section on visibility will show that Germanicus was the public face of the empire, and that his presence became the image of the emperor and of Rome. To the Romans, image was everything, and this thesis argues that the image of Germanicus has passed into perception as a result of the fact that he was used by others to prove their own views and as a way of presenting the propaganda of the Julio-Claudian period.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158560</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE ART OF MYSTICISM : An Inquiry into the Notion of Ineffability in (Cataphatic) Mystical Experience</field><field name="creator">Martin, Paul Christopher</field><field name="description">One of the defining characteristics of mystical experience posited by the psychologist and pragmatist philosopher William James in 1902 is that of ineffability, or indescribability. In this thesis my aim is to inquire into this notion of ineffability, indeed to problematize its understanding, by relating it to concepts of art and aesthetics. It is a preliminary attempt to apply the terminology of these fields in a direct analogous way to the mystical state. In short, I want to demonstrate that the mystical experience is like an artistic and aesthetic experience, in its phenomenology and psychology. My focus is on western Christian mysticism. Initially, I shall clarify my approach as dealing mainly with cataphatic, or positive mystical experience, as against apophatic, or negative mystical experience&#151;although the demarcation cannot be absolute since there is a dialectical relationship between these particular modes. I introduce the terms &#145;happenstance&#146; consciousness and &#145;desire-laden&#146; consciousness, which roughly correspond to nature mysticism and theistic mysticism. The spiritual perception of God can be understood in terms of a metaphorical transposition of the mundane perception that is ordinarily involved with cognition of the world, and in this respect I appeal to the idea of the spiritual senses. I posit a distinction between the awareness of divinity, as the perceptual &#145;event&#146;, and the consciousness of divinity, as the imaginary &#145;experience&#146;, although acknowledging that it can only be a relative one. In positive (cataphatic) mystical consciousness, the imagination is of profound importance, as a means for realizing the presence of God; and accordingly, I shall survey ancient and modern thinking on the role of imagination and phantasy up to the eighteenth century. The work of Immanuel Kant in his Critique of Pure Reason (1781/87) presages a shift to non-imagistic propositional thinking about consciousness, one in which the imagination is a productive mechanism that works in conjunction with the understanding to make a judgement based on (empirical) experience. I interpret Kant analogically and metaphorically in order to argue that the mystical encounter with the noumenal God involves a perception of divine light by the sensible intuition of the soul, by dint of the spiritual senses, which is then represented phenomenally in the imaginary, and realized as the presence of God. This constitutive judgement means that the consciousness of divinity is available to be enunciated, and in that regard it demonstrates a recognition of God&#146;s presence. In the event of contemplating God mystics are intuitively drawing the outline of divinity (circumscribing the rounded light of divinity), and in this way the invisible God is pictorially represented in the mystical imagination, where it is coloured by the understanding. Divinity is painted on to the canvas of the soul. It is a work of art, and the result of a creative enterprise. As painted by means of the light of God, the divine presence is perspectivally realized, compositionally formed, and colourfully relieved by the mystical imaginary. The experience of God&#146;s being can finally be rendered as a tangible artwork, which is to say, enunciated, through the act of speaking and/or writing. One of the hallmarks of mystical consciousness is the sense of the beautiful and sublime nature of divinity. Utilizing Kant&#146;s Critique of the Power of Judgement (1790/93) I argue that the consciousness of divinity is tantamount to an aesthetic realization, and it is by virtue of the reflecting power of judgement that mystics are able to discern the presence of God. Further inquiry reveals that mystical experience as it is realized by an affective consciousness has some affinity with twentieth-century theories of aesthetic experience. Phenomenologically, the imaginary presence of God is an object that exhibits certain aesthetic properties or qualities&#151;with love and beauty being paramount ones&#151;and the medium by which the &#145;ineffable&#146; consciousness is made manifest is through the use of tropical language (figures of speech), in the enunciation. Ultimately, I argue that mystics are bound to articulate the experience of divinity, since it connotes a recognition of that presence of God which is realized in the imaginary; and thus, their protestations about ineffability are problematic.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158561</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY : The S-shaped curve applied to consumer demand</field><field name="creator">Woollett, Grant James</field><field name="description">&#145;Structural change&#146; in an economy refers to variation in the distribution of activity and resources between economic agents. This thesis seeks to add to a long tradition of research that employs the s-shaped curve to explain and model structural change in the economy. The S-shaped curve has a tremendously rich history, ranging across biology, sociology, economics, marketing, thermodynamics and, latterly, the theory of evolutionary systems and games. It is argued that the evolutionary economics literature, in particular, correctly treats S-shaped phenomena as underlying processes which only sometimes are manifested as S-shaped curves in the data. The particular structural change problem that is addressed in the thesis is that represented by the Engel curve: the relationship between income and the structure of consumer expenditure. Since Ernst Engel&#146;s seminal observations of family budgets in the 19th Century, there has been a long tradition of studies of the structure of consumer demand in the mainstream literature. However, it is argued that traditional methodologies (as exemplified by the Working-Leser model), while useful in an heuristic sense, have only limited theoretical underpinnings. Hence, given that the Engel curve is a non-linear model of structural change, the primary purpose of the thesis is to develop an alternative Engel curve that is inspired by theoretical insights from the literature on S-shaped curves. The main idea behind the alternative - or &#145;evolutionary&#146; - Engel curve developed herein is that the Engel relationship signifies inter-commodity competition for resources, and is therefore amenable to a methodology that is founded upon an explicit treatment of competition. The chosen methodology - the replicator equation &#150; is argued to be a fundamental and general representation of competition and structural change, as well as having some attractive properties in the expenditure system context. In attempting to apply replicator dynamics to the evolving structure of consumer demand, a number of conceptual and methodological problems are encountered, and the necessity to solve these is a major source of innovation in the thesis, and a major component of its contribution to knowledge. Along the way, the thesis augments a rather sparselypopulated area of the literature: evolutionary economics studies of the demand side of the economy; and empirical studies that use the replicator equation (of which there are only two at present). In the ultimate model, the basic replicator equation is significantly modified and extended, with the key development being the inclusion of a satiation effect. The model is applied to a system of 46 commodities based on data from the Australian Household Expenditure Survey. From this initial application, it is concluded that the replicator equation forms a potentially viable basis for an evolutionary Engel curve. The new model is well-behaved, and shows performance comparable with that of the foremost &#145;mainstream&#146; formulation of the Engel curve. However, more work is required to establish the generality of these results across different countries, demographics, and time periods.

(1990) 21 FCR 193 is the central thread of this thesis. Broadly, the subject matter of this thesis is concerned with those circumstances when an administrative decision-maker does not have the capacity to change the decision. This broad subject matter involves the consideration of two separate questions: (i) whether an administrative decision-maker can, in the exercise of statutory powers, express or implied, reopen an earlier decision either with or without the request of a person affected by that decision; and (ii) whether or not an administrative decision-maker can be estopped from reopening the earlier decision made in the exercise of the decision maker&#146;s statutory, common law or prerogative powers. In responding to these two questions, the writer has dealt with four main issues. First, the writer has considered whether or not an administrative decision-maker may, in the absence of an express statutory power, reconsider an earlier decision. In response to this question, the writer has developed a set of principles determinative of the circumstances where, in the absence of an express power, a power to reconsider may be implied in the terms of the statute. Secondly, the writer has reviewed what are proffered to be exceptions or qualifications to the general principle that estoppel cannot operate to sanction something otherwise prohibited by statute or prevent, hinder or fetter the proper performance or exercise of a statutory power, duty or discretion. Of these exceptions, the writer gives special attention to the sovereign and proprietary distinction and the policy and operational distinction. On the one hand, the sovereign and proprietary distinction purports to allow estoppel to be applied against an administrative decision-maker in the course of making proprietary (or commercial), but not sovereign (or governmental) decisions. On the other hand, the policy and operational distinction purports to allow estoppel to apply, so long as there is no issue of ultra vires or illegality, against an administrative decisionmaker in the course of making an operational decision that gives effect to or implements decisions made in the exercise of a particular government policy. Following a review of the authorities which have cited, applied, distinguished and rejected the policy and operational distinction, and the sovereign and proprietary distinction, the writer concludes that it is not necessary to characterise the type of decision in question to determine whether estoppel should lie against the government. The general principle that estoppel cannot operate to sanction something otherwise prohibited by statute or prevent, hinder or fetter the proper performance or exercise of a statutory power, duty or discretion is sufficient to dispose of any case of estoppel in this particular context. Also, the writer identifies what type of link (direct or remote) between the subject matter of the statutory discretion and the representation or promise is sufficient to demonstrate that the alleged representation would fetter, hinder or prevent the proper exercise of a statutory discretion. The writer concludes that the High Court has adopted a broad approach to resolving this question and that it is sufficient to demonstrate that the subject matter of the alleged representation or promise made by the administrative decision-maker falls within the ambit of, is a matter relevant to, or forms part of the chain of events relevant to, the exercise of the statutory discretion. Last, the writer has considered whether or not estoppel may apply to prevent, hinder or fetter the exercise of prerogative powers by the government. Laker Airways Ltd v Department of Trade [1977] 1 QB 643 is the only case on this topic. The writer concludes that the view of the court in this case should be accepted, namely, that estoppel should be precluded if the government is exercising its prerogative powers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158563</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IN YOUR FACE: Racialised Practices in a Diverse Community</field><field name="creator">Ford, Margot Winifred</field><field name="description">Racism is a fact of life in the multiracial and multiethnic community of Darwin, but for some Darwinians the popular narrative of Darwin as a laidback and tolerant community, also holds true. This seems to encapsulate the paradox of universalism versus particularism that Wallerstein (1991) argues, is philosophically unsustainable. This thesis sets out to explore this seemingly oppositional perspective in the local community of Darwin juxtaposed against a broader national debate that appears to favour universalism (Kahn 2001). A detailed socio-historical investigation of Darwin serves as a basis to examine contemporary practice. It is evident that past conceptualisations of race, ethnicity and culture inform contemporary discursive practices in a variety of ways. Older narratives are interrupted by more recent stories that pit the notion of globalisation against the notion of nationhood, of ethnic equality against hierarchies of &#147;civilisation&#148;, and finally, unmasks the myth of racial purity. This study demonstrates that indeed, the ways racialised practices are revealed through talk, is replete with paradox, built as they are on competing narratives. This study does not focus on the more overt forms of racist practice. Rather, it emphasises the normality of everyday talk, experience and practice. In common parlance, the majority of people would deny they are racist (Dunn 2003) and are resistant to it as an idea, so if there is to be dialogue, the nature of racism as understood in the vernacular, requires redefining. In this study, the notion of racialised practice is invoked, not as a euphemism for broad cultural practices, but as a distinct and separate concept. Racialised practices reinscribe the notion of visible markers of difference, such as skin colour, into a discourse that has privileged notions of culture for the last twenty years. Foucault&#146;s interpretive analytics acts as a methodological tool in this exercise, but his themes of social practices, played out as relations of power, are also important. Exclusionary practices are considered against inclusionary practices, forming a dynamic through which an examination is made of the everyday experiences of research participants&#146; lives in Darwin. This is possible because the research participants come from a wide range of backgrounds &#150; locally born Darwinians and incomers; Anglo and Celtic Australians, interracial Australians and Indigenous Australians; recent arrivals and those who migrated several decades earlier. The voices of youth and children also inform this analysis. Discussions with fifty-four participants were conducted in semi- structured, informal interviews with many of the youth and children electing to be interviewed in pairs. It seems impossible to shake off racialised practices, as echoes of a past imaginary influence current practice. Younger research participants articulate a sensitivity not seen in some of the older participants, so perhaps there is potential to imagine a distant future where the colour of a person&#146;s skin is simply that, with no socially inscribed meaning attached. Not yet though, not yet.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158564</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into the Role of the Lumbar and Hip Extensor Muscle Synergists during Trunk Axial Rotation: A Comparison between Subjects with Low Back Pain and Matched Controls</field><field name="creator">Pirouzi, Soraya</field><field name="description">Low back pain is a major problem for society in both health and economic terms. In spite of extensive research, the causes and sources of low back pain are not fully known with the majority being diagnosed with &#145;non specific low back pain&#146;. While stability of the lumbo-pelvic (L-P) region is important for the protection of this region during functional movement and exercise, poor muscle function is often considered as a risk factor for low back pain (LBP) with muscles failing to protect the joints and thus render the lumbar spine unstable. It has been considered that trunk rotation is a significant risk factor for LBP. The muscle recruitment patterns involved in stability of the L-P region during twisting are complicated and are not completely understood. Several muscles contribute to L-P stability through different mechanisms. Anatomical and biomechanical models have provided evidence that muscles attaching to the thoraco-lumbar fascia (TLF) are important for providing stabilization to the lumbo-pelvic region during trunk rotation. This has guided rehabilitation programs. The muscles that link diagonally to the posterior layer of the TLF have not previously been examined individually and compared during low level trunk rotation efforts in chronic LBP patients and matched control subjects. The main aim of this thesis was to examine for changes in recruitment of the hip and back extensor muscles during low level isometric trunk rotation efforts in chronic LBP subjects by comparison with matched asymptomatic control subjects. In order to establish a reliable estimation of levels of submaximal rotation torques for a study comparing LBP and control subjects, two separate electromyography (EMG) studies were undertaken prior to the main study. Study 1 investigated, in 10 normal subjects and using 5 trunk muscles bilaterally, 50% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) rotation efforts and its relationship with Body Mass Index (BMI). Study 2 investigated, in 10 normal subjects, 25% of MVC efforts and its relationship with both BMI and another algorithm based on anthropometric variables. Based on the results of these studies, study 3 (a study on LBP subjects and matched controls) used 25% of MVC for rotation to both sides. This level of torque was estimated through median values for age and BMI. EMG measures were found to be reliable and patterns of muscle recruitment were established in terms of prime movers, antagonists and stabilising muscles during the rotation efforts. Four levels of shoulder and hip stabilisation techniques were used in studies 1 to 3. Study 3 involved 30 chronic LBP patients and 30 matched control subjects who were assessed using surface EMG as they performed isometric rotation efforts at 25% of MVC while standing upright in a trunk rotation device. Muscles studied included the latissimus dorsi (LD), lumbar erector spinae (LES), upper and lower gluteus maximus (GM), and biceps femoris (BF) muscles. Study 4 involved 30 chronic LBP patients and 30 matched control subjects and the length of LD and hamstring (HS) muscles were also assessed. Subjects performed the rotation exertions with various levels of external trunk support, related to different functional tasks. Results of overall studies showed that there were significant differences in activity between muscles during right and left trunk rotation. The patterns of prime mover, antagonist, and stabilizer contractions for different trunk and hip extensor muscles in both sides were demonstrated during trunk axial rotation. Higher activity in the contralateral external oblique (EO) (in study 1), HS, and GM muscles and ipsilateral internal oblique (IO) (study 1) and LD muscles was shown in the present study. Symmetrical activity of the LES muscles especially in the lower level of effort was highlighted in the present study and confirms the stabilizer role of these muscles during trunk rotation. The EMG results of study 3 also demonstrated that subjects with LBP had significantly higher levels of recruitment for the lower and upper GM (p&lt;0.05), HS (p&lt;0.05), and LES (p&lt;0.05) during rotation to the left compared with the control subjects. In right axial rotation LBP patients exhibited higher activity of HS during two different positions. Despite these findings, results of study 4 showed that HS length was not correlated with the increased HS activity demonstrated in study 3. A main finding of study 3 was that there were increased levels of muscle activity in all muscles in the LBP group, especially the upper and lower GM, LES and HS muscles, when they were acting in the diagonal, antagonist patterns, rather than in their agonist rotation role. This result could indicate compensation by the global muscles for a loss of stability function in the local muscles or impairment in the passive subsystem. For the GM and LES muscles, increased activation could also indicate muscle fatigue and loss of endurance as suggested in other recent studies. Deficits in the muscles such as GM and LES may therefore need clinical &#145;muscle endurance&#146; testing to assess if in LBP subjects they require rehabilitative exercise to restore the efficiency of their pelvic supporting role. A limitation of the 3 studies was that only surface EMG was used. Further studies involving trunk rotation could also include fine wire EMG to record from the deep muscle system. This would improve our understanding of the complex interaction of muscles used to stabilize the L-P region and the different types of impairments which occur in LBP subjects in both local and global muscle system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158565</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PLAY SKILLS SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRE (PSSRQ) FOR 5-10 YEAR OLD CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS / CARERS</field><field name="creator">Sturgess, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Play has been a continuing focus within occupational therapy because it is understood to be an essential occupation of children and a mechanism for assisting and reflecting growth and development in physical, social, cognitive, and emotional dimensions. Despite this avowed focus there are few occupational therapy tools to assess children&#146;s play, particularly during the school years. Play may be judged differently by participant and observer. The fact that this difference exists suggests that both parent and child should be included in any assessment of play. Of the existing play assessments, there were none which asked the child about his/her play until 2004, when some items about play were included in broader assessments of childrens&#146; activities and preferences. Therefore, this thesis aims to address this lack and documents the design, construction and development of a self-report assessment of play skills for children aged between five and ten years. A parent or carer version was also developed and tested. The main body of the research was undertaken in two stages. Stage one explains the development of the Play Skills Self-Report Questionnaire (PSSRQ) and the supplementary parent version. Three sequential pilot studies which led to the final content and structural design of the PSSRQ were completed. The first was with expert therapists (n = 10), the second with mothers (n = 6), and the third with school-aged children (n = 10). A 30 item questionnaire was developed using an A5 booklet format, with one item per double page. Each item was supported by a specifically designed black and white line drawing. A four-point response scale of stars with faces was designed to allow the child to indicate whether they were &#145;very good&#146;, &#145;good&#146;, &#145;OK&#146;, or &#145;not good&#146; at the play skill. The parent version included the same items worded slightly differently, a miniature of the same graphic supporting each item and the same response scale. A sample of 176 typically developing children from a range of socioeconomic, cultural and geographic situations in South-East Queensland was selected from 14 different schools. These children completed the PSSRQ administered by the researcher, and their parents/carers completed the adult version which was sent home and returned to the school. A subgroup of 16 children and parents completed the two questionnaires a second time between 10 and 14 days later. Parents also completed a set of background information questions covering a range of independent variables relating to family composition, health of child, and play opportunities. It was hypothesised that children can contribute unique information and therefore parent and child would differ substantially in their views of the child&#146;s play skill ability. Statistical analysis of the data gathered centred around description of the sample and the pattern of responses by age and gender, similarities and differences between parent and child responses, and the influence of relevant independent variables on parent-child agreement. In brief, there were more items on which parent and child disagreed (n=17) than items on which they agreed (n=13). This was interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that child self-report would produce unique information about play skills. Stability over time for the small sample was shown for both parents and children. One item was found to be unreliable and will be removed from the questionnaire. Some independent variables exerted an effect on agreement between parents and children, although in many instances the group numbers were small. The variables were school year/grade, some aspects of family composition, ethnicity/language, some aspects of parent education and occupation, teacher identified child behaviour problems, current referral of child to a specialist and/or an allied health professional, available play space, and attendance at outside school hours care that included mornings. At this stage these are identified trends that warrant further examination. Discussion centres around the patterns of response and agreement and the influence of independent variables on children&#146;s self-reported play skills. Potential for the use of the PSSRQ questionnaires for occupational therapy assessment and intervention planning, and further research studies needed are outlined.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158566</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MAKING CHOICES: WHY PARENTS PRESENT TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR NON-URGENT CARE</field><field name="creator">Williams, Lesley Alison</field><field name="description">Introduction: Emergency department usage for non-urgent care has been identified as an issue worldwide. Many health professionals have an opinion as to why parents seek care for their children at an emergency department. In Australia, although it is known that there is increasing usage of paediatric emergency departments for non-urgent care; there is a paucity of research on the reasons for this high usage. Aim: This study aims to provide a better understanding of the motivations and actions of parents of children with non-urgent injury or illness who attend the emergency department (PED) at a tertiary paediatric hospital seeking care. Method: This study was designed as a cross sectional descriptive survey to ascertain information fiom parents about their care-giving and care-seeking behaviours prior to presenting with their child to the paediatric emergency department (PED) for professional assessment and treatment. Demographic characteristics were compared with those of the general population to ensure representativeness. Results: A total of 355 parents were surveyed in the three-month period between May and July 2005. This represented 8% of the parents/carers who had presented to the PED for nonurgent (Australian Triage Score Category 4 and 5) care of their child. Just over half of the children presenting were male (185 (53%)) with an overall mean age of 5.45 years (*SD 4.25). The factors the study identified as seminal as to why parents sought care for their child at the paediatric emergency department are that parents rated their child's condition as moderate to very serious (242 (68%)) and that two thirds of parents (234 (66%)) had sought advice prior to attending PED. Other pertinent factors identified were that 54% of children attended with an injury (137) presented promptly to PED (i-e. within four hours of injury) whereas of those presenting with illness (88 (41.3%)) presented within two to seven days of the onset of the illness. The majority of children attended with an illness (213 (60%)) and of these, 98% had medication administered prior to presentation to PED. The presenting child was most likely to be the youngest sibling. Conclusions: The results of the study highlight the accuracy of 'parental triage', that is that parents assess their child's health, and generally engage in appropriate care-giving and careseeking behaviours before presenting to paediatric PED. This study highlights the deficiencies in current primary care services available to families and the perception that not all cases deemed as non-urgent by the emergency department are able to be dealt with in a primary care setting. In recognising that presentation is multifactorial, an issue that needs to be addressed is that there will always be non-urgent presentations at the paediatric emergency department and service delivery and W i g models need further development to address the increasing paediatric requirements for care. In identifying these multiple factors, this study will provide a solid base for future planning within paediatric hospitals, the emergency department setting and in provision of care in the community.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Paediatric</field><field name="subject">child</field><field name="subject">emergency department</field><field name="subject">non-urgent care</field><field name="subject">triage</field><field name="subject">parent</field><field name="subject">carer.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158567</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE BENEFITS AND INJURY RELATED HARMS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN CHILDREN AGED 5-12 YEARS</field><field name="creator">Spinks, Anneliese Barclay</field><field name="description">Background: The prevalence of overweight status amongst Australian children has increased substantially and now approximates one quarter of the paediatric population. Proponents of physical activity have argued that this increase in partly due to decreasing activity levels, coinciding with an increase in sedentary behaviour. Consequently, a public health agenda to increase physical activity participation has emerged and Australian guidelines were published in 2004, recommending that children aged 5-12 years participate in a minimum of 60 minutes of physical activity daily and spend no more than two hours a day using electronic media for entertainment. However, an unintended consequence of physical activity is exposure to the risk of injury. To date, these risks have not been quantified in primary school aged children despite injury being a leading cause for hospitalisation and death in this population. Furthermore, the protective effect of &#145;sufficient&#146; physical activity against obesity remains uncertain, with a lack of consensus of an independent relationship between activity and weight status. A clearer understanding of the relationship between physical activity and the positive and negative outcomes is therefore warranted to inform public health policy and ensure that the potential benefits of increased activity participation amongst the paediatric population will not be outweighed by the risks and costs of injury. Aims: There were five main aims of the thesis: 1. To describe the distribution of BMI in children 5-12 years by age, sex and SES 2. To quantify the association between physical activity and obesity in children 5-12 years 3. to describe the distribution of physical activity participation in children 5- 12 years by age, sex and SES. 4. To describe the physical activity specific incidence of injury in children 5- 12 years, by age, sex and SES 5. To quantify the association between categories of physical activity and injury type sustained. Method: The Childhood Injury Prevention Study (CHIPS) was a prospective cohort study that collected data from a randomly selected sample of Brisbane primary and pre-school children aged 5 to 12 years. Data for each participating child were available for the following variables: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), socioeconomic status (SES) indicators (household income, maternal education, school area SES), family size, home play equipment availability, transport method to school, estimated time per week in various types of physical activity and sedentary leisure activities, and incidence of injury recorded prospectively over 12 months. Analytic strategies Logistic regression analysis was performed to 1) determine the protective effect of compliance with the Australian guidelines against obesity. 2) identify variables that were associated with insufficient (&lt; 60 minutes) daily activity. The age and gender distribution of injury rates per hourly exposure were calculated for all activity and for organized, non-organised and common specific activities occurring outside school hours. Additionally, child-based injury rates were calculated for physical activity related injuries both in and out of the school setting. Results: Compliance with physical activity guidelines and protection against overweight status Approximately 20% of the cohort was considered overweight according to international age standardised BMI charts. Non-compliance with activity guidelines was 15% for out of school physical activity participation, and 31% for excessive electronic media entertainment use. Non-compliance with the minimal physical activity guideline increased the odds of being overweight by 28%, however this difference was not statistically significant. There was, however a significant 63% increase in the odds of overweight status amongst children who overused electronic media for entertainment. Children failing the minimum activity participation recommendation were less likely to walk or cycle to school (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.43; 95% CI = 0.24 &#150; 0.77) or participate in organised sports or activity (OR 0.42; 95% CI = 0.28 &#150; 0.64) and were more likely to spend in excess of 2 hours a day watching television of using a computer for entertainment (OR 2.10 (1.16 &#150; 3.78). Harms of physical activity: exposure to injury risk A high number of injuries (89%) sustained by the cohort were directly related to physical activity and 34% of physical activity related injuries required professional medical treatment. Analysis of injuries occurring outside of school revealed an overall injury rate of 5.7 injuries per 10 000 hours of exposure to physical activity and a medically treated injury rate of 1.7 per 10 000 hours. The highest injury risks per exposure time occurred for tackle-style football, wheeled activities and tennis. Conclusion: One in seven children from the Greater Brisbane area are at risk for being insufficiently active according to Australian national guidelines whilst a third overuse electronic media. Given that overuse of electronic entertainment was positively associated with childhood obesity, these children should be the target of public health campaigns to promote alternative leisure time activities. Injury rates per hours of exposure to physical activity were low with less than 2 injuries requiring medical treatment occurring for every 10 000 hours of activity participation outside of school.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158568</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local Villains, Transnational Consequences: Human Trafficking and Organised Crime in South East Asia</field><field name="creator">Munro, Peter Maylen</field><field name="description">Young women and children moved into the local sex industries dominate human trafficking in the borderlands of Burma, Cambodia and Thailand. Some are trafficked beyond to the sex industry in Bangkok, Phnom Penh, Rangoon and even Sydney. The great majority of the trafficking takes place within the Greater Mekong Subregion to service the needs of locals. Groups supposed to protect vulnerable groups, such as the police and military, facilitate trafficking in the borderlands. This dissertation provides an analysis of the degree of involvement by these groups in the trafficking process and examines issues of active and passive corruption associated with the trade in people. The dissertation also considers the role of cross-border criminal groups who, in effect, operate transnationally. However, they are only considered within a domestic framework. This trafficking sociology has placed limitations on the ability of the international community to combat the trade. The borderlands environment makes it problematic to combat trafficking. Some groups operating in the borderlands have built substantial wealth upon the smuggling and trafficking of goods, including people. Central control is also weaker with provincial authorities and military officials operating &#145;fiefdoms&#146; in lucrative border provinces. The complex interplay of patronage networks, illicit border industries and accelerating economic development in border provinces has created a climate well suited to the trafficking of people into the local sex industries. As a way to understand this problem, the dissertation proposes the widening of the definition and understanding of transnational organised crime groups to include &#145;low order&#146; and &#145;high order&#146; transnational crime groups differentiating between high order groups such as the Russian Mafiya, and low order groups such as Cambodian crossborder criminals trading Vietnamese women in Thailand. This dissertation examines the groups operating in the borderlands, the dynamics behind the trade, and the regional influences facilitating the growth of this illicit trade.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158569</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SUCCESS ATTRIBUTES OF REGIONAL NRM SYSTEMS IN AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Williams, Jacqueline Anne</field><field name="description">The sustainable management of Australia&#146;s natural resource base is of national significance as reflected in the current public level of investment in natural resource management (NRM). Both financial and regulatory investments are currently at the highest level in Australian history. Despite this Australia&#146;s natural systems continue to decline. The concern about NRM in Australia presents itself in various forms and has driven NRM over time in a number of directions. These range from agricultural aspects of soil conservation; conservation and environment movements; resource degradation, and ecological thought and action. Since the late 1980&#146;s successive Australian and State Governments have invested in NRM with a focus on high public participation through Landcare and catchment based approaches. These have lead to the more recent 2002 model with 56 regional NRM bodies being established across Australia with the support of the Natural Heritage Trust 2 (NHT2) and National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (NAP) funding programs. This study examined whether NHT2 and NAP regional NRM systems in Australia are effective, efficient and enduring and if not, why not. The analysis was undertaken through the development of a model of critical success attributes of a regional NRM system identified from theory and practice. The model presents a process that is based on foundation attributes of good governance and regionalism progressing with agent interactions and &#145;means&#146; in the form of tools and systems to affect the &#145;end&#146; result of regional NRM recognised as resilient sustainable ecosystems, sustainable human communities and decentralised democracy. Testing of the model was undertaken in five stratified case study regions across Australia selected to ensure adequate coverage of differences in governance; landscape, and socio-economic factors. The comparative case studies provided knowledge of whether the critical success attributes were present and provided further insight into the differences in NRM approaches across Australia. The importance of people and their attitudes; organisations and their governance; the interpretation of regionalism, and the varying interpretation of the required &#145;means&#146; and &#145;ends&#146; of a regional NRM system were apparent. From the comparative case study findings and insights further research via focus groups predominantly within one of the case study region&#146;s was undertaken to clarify a number of key issues. The two completed studies then contributed to the design of a system, with national applicability linking sustainable agriculture to the delivery of regional NRM. Finally all these findings were used to design a national survey of all Australia&#146;s Regional NRM bodies Chief Executive Officers and Chairs. The execution, analysis and interpretation of this survey finalise the research. The study provides conclusions as to the effectiveness, efficiency and enduring nature of the current regional NRM models in Australia. It identifies problems with the new system in that many of the essential success attributes of a regional NRM system approach are missing in the current Australian NRM regional experiment and questions the validity of whether decentralised democracy is an appropriate objective to facilitate equitable sharing of public good regional NRM. The study provides recommendations in the form of a revised model of critical attributes required to improve NRM in the future.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158570</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Volume Weighted Average Price Options</field><field name="creator">Stace, Antony William</field><field name="description">In this work, we developed methods to price both fixed and floating strike Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) options. VWAP options have a payoff that is dependent on both the stock price and volume of stock traded over the lifetime of the option. We concentrate on the valuation of European style, fixed and floating strike call options. Little additional effort is required to adapt the results of this work to value puts. First, introductory mathematical material is presented, followed by a general overview of options and how they are priced. The VWAP is then formally introduced, and some examples of VWAP options in practice are given. Expectations and a partial differential equation that describes the price of the options are then constructed. Throughout, we assume the stock price evolves as a geometric Brownian motion process, and the volume is a fast mean reverting process. Upper and lower bounds are established for the price of both fixed and floating strike VWAP options. These bounds are given as analytic formulae and are independent of the volume model. The bounds are obtained from a simple put-call type parity. We then interpret these bounds further. The upper bounds represent the minimum cost of hedging all of the risk. A Monte Carlo investigation is then performed; this gives a vivid picture of how the VWAP options behave. It also allows later results to be benchmarked. In addition to vanilla Monte Carlo, some effective controls variates are found. We conclude the Monte Carlo investigation by finding the Greeks by the finite difference, pathwise, and likelihood methods. Next, approximations to the prices of the VWAP options are obtained by matching the first two moments of the VWAP to a lognormal distribution. For the fixed strike, a partial differential equation similar to the Black-Scholes-Merton one is obtained. When the market price of risk is constant, an analytic expression is found. For a non-constant market price of risk, a numerical method must be used. The floating strike case gives a two dimensional partial differential equation that needs to be solved numerically. In addition to pricing call options, we also demonstrate a method for the valuation of a VWAP digital option. The partial differential equation which describes the prices of the VWAP options is then solved using finite differences. We use explicit, Crank-Nicolson, and Alternating Direction Implicit schemes. Solving by finite differences is a challenging problem as there are four state variables as well as time, and an incomplete set of boundary conditions are known. Additionally, we report several similarity reductions which are effective in simplifying the partial differential equation for the floating strike option. In the final approach to pricing, a series solution to the price is assumed and the first two terms are found. The analysis assumes that the volume process is a fast mean reverting process. The first term of the series is described by a partial differential equation, which is very similar to the one that arises when pricing the Asian option. Numerical experiments established that the first term of the expansion approximates the true solution well when the mean reversion rate is high. Chapter 10 concludes this work with an overview of the results presented in this thesis, along with possible directions for further work.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158571</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">At-risk boys&#146; perceptions of masculinities and resilience</field><field name="creator">Tilling, Julia</field><field name="description">This thesis will address the need for gender issues and the discourses of power to be explored within resilience frameworks to achieve successful outcomes for at-risk males in intervention programs. Due to the western valorisation of traditional masculinities, the &#147;backlash politics&#148; debate internationally constrains challenges to the existing gender order within intervention programs. The discussion will deal with the notion of hegemonic masculinities and how boys with behaviour problems act out traditional masculinities to gain a sense of male power. It will focus on the notion of at-riskness, which defines these boys as the new victims of accepted social values and does not address the issues of how men victimise other men from different ethnic, class, and sexual preference minority groups, through violent and aggressive tactics (Connell, 1997). For these boys, exploring the interplay of hegemonic masculinities within society will enable them to move into connecting protective processes/factors within alternative programs and the community.

Access to social housing is increasingly problematic with demand for assistance far outstripping supply as a result of the reduction of affordable rental housing in the private market, changing human services policies and reduced public investment in social housing. This study analysed access to social housing through a case study of inner Brisbane, examining rationing policies and practices within a multi- provider system. It analysed rationing processes in a number of social housing organizations and took a systems view to assess how well consumer access arrangements operated across the local service delivery network. An analytical model was developed for understanding access to social housing across three domains: 1. government policy; 2. service delivery; and 3. consumer agency. The primary focus of the study was the service delivery domain, although the interactions with the other two domains were also examined. For the purposes of the study, access to social housing was defined as a set of rationing processes that operated within individual organizations and across the service delivery system. The analysis drew heavily on human services management and public administration literature relating to rationing, service integration, consumer choice and the role of front line workers in policy implementation. The research found that access arrangements in the case study area were fragmented and involved complexity and duplication of effort for applicants and service providers. While there was strong stakeholder support for reforms to address these problems, there was no consensus about the nature and scope of change needed. A major arena of contention was the appropriate balance between system diversity and system integration. The research challenges the adoption of a dichotomous integration-diversity paradigm in favour of an approach based on network theory. The findings present the challenge of coordinating access to multiple social housing providers as a problem of network management. Rationing policies, program design and investment decisions emanating from the government policy domain were identified as establishing the parameters and constraints within which access was rationed in the service delivery domain. Government relied on service delivery agencies to implement policy and these organisations, in turn, relied on frontline workers. The extent to which government policy could determine local rationing practices was dependent on how tightly those policies were specified and the governance arrangements in place to achieve compliance. Similarly, organisations relied on formal policies and procedures and varying levels of surveillance to manage the exercise of discretion by frontline workers. The study identified a range of factors that influenced how rationing policies were interpreted and implemented by service provider organisations and workers. A significant factor was local housing market conditions and how they impacted on service demand. The study also found that service delivery organisations and workers advocated strongly for the retention of local discretion in key access processes, especially in matching applicants with specific vacant properties. They emphasised the value of local knowledge and discretion rather than uniform procedures in achieving appropriate and sustainable housing outcomes. An important finding of the study was that reforms such as tighter rationing and improved service integration have limited potential to address underlying problems of inadequate supply or significantly impact on the total number of people who can be assisted. These demand management policies and practices do, however, determine who applies for social housing, which applicants gain access, the order in which applicants are housed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158573</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical management of diabetes mellitus in dogs</field><field name="creator">Fleeman, Linda Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis presents important new findings on glycaemic monitoring, and insulin and dietary therapy of dogs with diabetes mellitus, and so provides valuable evidence on which to base treatment recommendations. Improved protocols for sampling blood glucose concentration in dogs are described, including a new method for obtaining capillary blood that has fewer technical problems than existing methods. The serial blood glucose concentration curve that is commonly used for monitoring diabetic dogs is shown to have large day-to-day variability. Pharmacological evaluation of subcutaneous porcine insulin zinc suspension indicates that the majority of diabetic dogs will require twice-daily dosing with this insulin preparation. New information reveals that hyperglycaemia-induced insulin resistance is likely a clinically relevant feature of spontaneous diabetes mellitus in dogs and has important implications for insulin therapy. Traditionally recommended high-fibre, moderate-carbohydrate, moderate-fat diets are shown to not be advantageous for diabetic dogs compared with a commercial, adult maintenance diet with moderate-fibre, ultra low-carbohydrate, and high-fat content. Finally, new evidence is presented that subclinical exocrine pancreatic disease appears to be common in dogs with diabetes mellitus and seems to be associated with hypertriglyceridaemia. These findings are expected to improve the clinical management of diabetes mellitus in dogs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158574</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High Performance Saudi Football Coaches: A Case Study in Workplace Learning</field><field name="creator">Alsaleh, Basim Nasser</field><field name="description">Not available</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158575</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure-function relationships of the West Nile Virus protease NS3 and its cofactor NS2B</field><field name="creator">Chappell, Keith Joseph</field><field name="description">West Nile Virus (WNV) is an emerging pathogen with an expanding geographic distribution. Over the last decade it has been the cause of an increasing frequency of human outbreaks with associated severe human disease and fatalities. Currently, there is no approved vaccine or effective antiviral strategy available for combating WNV. One attractive target for antiviral development is a viral, trypsin-like, serine protease, which is encoded by the N-terminal 184 amino acids of NS3 and is only active as a heterodimeric complex with its cofactor, NS2B. This protease, NS2B/NS3pro, plays an essential role in the cleavage of the viral precursor polyprotein and disruption of this function has been shown to be lethal for virus replication. In this thesis I have examined the structure and function of WNV NS2B/NS3pro by using a recombinant WNV protease, which we previously generated (Nall et al., 2004), and a combination of approaches including site-directed mutagenesis, truncation studies and the screening of small libraries of peptide substrates and inhibitors. The results obtained have made a significant contribution to the fundamental understanding of the NS2B/NS3protease and the residues involved in substrate-binding, resulting in three international publications. The first publication, Chappell et al., (2005), comprises a mutagenesis study directed to the substrate-binding cleft, which was undertaken prior the resolution of the active crystal structure of the WNV protease by Erbel et al., (2006). Mutagenesis results were interpreted based on a homology model of WNV protease. While some of the results that were obtained are highly intuitive and provide an understanding of substrate binding, others have now been re-evaluated in the context of the crystal structure of the active protease and found to be located far from the substrate-binding cleft. This re-evaluation of the mutagenesis results is included in information supplementary to this publication. The second publication, Chappell et al., (2006a), encompasses a more comprehensive analysis of the substrate-binding cleft, which was undertaken after the resolution of the crystal structure of the active protease. This study uses both site-directed mutagenesis and screening of a small library of peptide substrates to investigate substrate binding and the results are interpreted by docking of substrates into the active crystal structure of WNV NS2B/NS3pro. The substrate specificity at the P2, P3 and P4 positions was thoroughly investigated as well as the individual residues of the NS3 protease and the NS2B cofactor involved in substrate-binding interactions. One particular residue within the cofactor was found to strongly influence binding preference of Flavivirus proteases for an arginine or lysine residue at P2. The results of this study provide an overview of substrate binding, in which the substrate is predicted to bind in an extended conformation, as opposed to that crystallographically demonstrated for a small inhibitor bound in the active site of WNV NS2B/NS3pro. The identified substrate-binding residues and the optimal tetra-peptide substrate provide a base for rational drug design of protease inhibitors. The development and analysis of aldehyde inhibitors based on the identified optimal substrate is discussed in the supplementary material. The third publication, Chappell et al., (2006b) focused on truncation and optimisation of the previously generated recombinant protease. This resulted in the generation of a highly stable construct which can be used in future studies including inhibitor screening and crystallisation trials. This construct has now been successfully crystallised in association with a potent aldehyde inhibitor and the resolution of this structure in the near future will provide valuable information for further inhibitor development. A stable recombinant protease incorporating the full length of NS3 was also generated and a comparison of the enzyme kinetics of the two recombinant constructs reveals that the C-terminal domain has only a small effect on protease activity. The information presented in this thesis provides a base for rational drug design of inhibitors of the WNV protease and has so far led to the development of aldehyde inhibitors which constitute the most highly potent, small peptide inhibitors identified to date. These lead inhibitors are suitable for future rational drug design and structural optimization. This has the potential to lead to the generation of broad spectrum antiviral drug candidates for the treatment of infections by WNV and other Flaviviruses.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158576</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GENETICS OF PRIMARY ALDOSTERONISM &#150; FAMILIAL HYPERALDOSTERONSIM TYPE II</field><field name="creator">So, Albertina</field><field name="description">BACKGROUND: Primary aldosteronism (PAL), caused by autonomous overproduction of aldosterone by the adrenals, is the commonest curable and specifically treatable cause of hypertension. There are two familial varieties. Familial hyperaldosteronism type I (FH-I) is glucocorticoid suppressible and caused by a CYP11B1/CYP11B2 "hybrid" gene mutation. Familial hyperaldosteronism type II (FH-II), which appears to be at least five times more common, is not attributable to the "hybrid" gene mutation and not glucocorticoid suppressible. FH-II is clinically, biochemically and morphologically indistinguishable from apparently sporadic PAL, which could therefore have a similar genetic basis. Since diagnosing PAL by currently available biochemical methods is difficult, finding a simple and reliable genetic test for FH-II which could also be applied to apparently sporadic PAL would simplify patient management. A genome-wide search performed previously had demonstrated linkage of FH-II to chromosome 7p22, consistent with this locus harbouring the causative gene/s for FH-II. AIM: The overall aim of this thesis was to elucidate the genetic basis of FH-II and thereby permit development of new genetic tests which will streamline the identification of individuals predisposed to developing of PAL. In order to achieve this overall aim, the specific aims of the thesis were to narrow the linked region at 7p22 by phenotyping and genotyping more FH-II families using markers more closely spaced than those utilized previously, and by sequencing candidate genes in the narrowed linked region for FH-II associated mutations. METHOD AND RESULTS: As a prelude to the FH-II studies, examination of a large FH-I family with 21 genetically-confirmed affecteds by linkage analysis showed that linkage results were markedly affected by phenotypic variability and decisions regarding affectation status criteria. This highlighted the need for careful consideration of these factors to enable location of significant linkage. Initially, five FH-II families (96 subjects) were carefully phenotyped and then genotyped using seven closely spaced 7p22 microsatellite markers. These studies confirmed linkage at 7p22 in a large Australian family and a South American family previously studied in the Supervisors&#146; laboratory and, in addition, revealed linkage at 7p22 in a second Australian family (combined LOD score 4.61 for the three families). Recombination events in two affecteds in the largest studied Australian family narrowed the linkage region by at least 1.8 Mbp and halved the number of candidate genes. Absence of linkage at 7p22 in two other Australian families was also demonstrated, consistent with FH-II being genetically heterogeneous. Subsequent microsatellite studies using seven additional 7p22 markers examining the three 7p22-linked families resulted in a further reduction of the linked locus by 0.5 Mbp. Two candidate genes in this linked region were then examined for mutations causing FH-II; the retinoblastoma-associated Kruppel-associated box gene (RBaK) and postmeiotic segregation increased 2 (PMS2) were selected as they are involved in cell cycle control and adrenal hyperplasia and adenomas are common in FH-II. Coding regions and intron/exon splice sites were sequenced in affected and unaffected subjects from a 7p22-linked FH-II family. Identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped to assess significance. For RBaK, the T allele of a synonymous 2565C&gt;T SNP was shared by all 15 affecteds from the three 7p22-linked families, but was also common in 16 unaffecteds (28%), seven affecteds from two 7p22 non-linked families (50%) and 20 non-PAL normotensive controls (43%), and is therefore unlikely to be causative. No other polymorphisms were found. For PMS2, 11 SNPs were found [two in the proximal promoter: -195T/C and -154C/G; four non-synonymous coding SNPs: C1408T (P470S), C1454A (T485K), A1531G (T511A) and G1621A (E541K); two synonymous coding SNPs: C288T and G780C; two in splice sites: 2006+6G/A and 2007-4G/A; one in an intronic region: 705+17 A/G]. These 11 SNPs were genotyped in 14 affecteds from the three 7p22-linked families, and in 14 non-PAL controls. None showed segregation of alleles with disease status. CONCLUSION: Work from this thesis has confirmed linkage of FH-II to chromosome 7p22 in three of five FH-II families examined. Recombination events in two affecteds from one family resulted in a substantial narrowing of the area of linkage and halving of the number of candidate genes needing to be investigated for association with FH-II. The finding that the gene responsible for FH-II might be located at 7p22 is supported by a recent report from the Framingham Heart Study showing genetic linkage of the aldosterone/renin ratio to the 7p region. Examination of two candidate genes (RBaK and PMS2) so far has shown no evidence of mutations causing FH-II.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158577</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children and adolescents with Asperger&#146;s syndrome: Validation of a new measure of symptomatology and a structural test of family and peer influences</field><field name="creator">Garnett, Michelle Sarah</field><field name="description">There is considerable debate about the core features of Asperger&#146;s Syndrome (AS), and valid and reliable tools for evaluating core features are lacking. Anxiety and depression may impact on the severity of AS, but there is little available research addressing this issue. Family and peer experiences are known to increase anxiety in children with other forms of childhood psychopathology. Notably, family conflict and cohesion, as well as supportive peer relationships and peer victimisation, are known to be linked with anxiety, depression, and levels of adjustment and/or psychopathology in vulnerable children. However, such associations may not generalise in their scope and strength to children and adolescents with AS, because of the unique problems of this group in terms of perspective-taking, understanding others&#146; emotion, rigidity in thinking and behaviour, and social difficulties. The principle objectives of this programme of research were threefold. In the absence of a suitable measure of core AS dimensions, the first objective was to develop and validate a new measure of core AS characteristics. The second objective was to use this new measure to examine the association of Asperger&#146;s/autism symptomatology (AAS) with psychological health in children and adolescents with a diagnosis of AS/autism. The third objective was to examine the links of family and peer relationships with levels of psychological ill-health and AAS in children/adolescents with a diagnosis of AS/autism. Method: Following an extensive literature review, consultation of international experts, and pilot testing, a provisional measure of 8 dimensions of AS was developed, the Australian Scale for Asperger&#146;s Syndrome &#150; Revised (ASAS-R). A secure website containing this and other measures was produced. A sample of eligible families was drawn from the databases of two clinics (one directed by the candidate) specialising in pervasive developmental disorders, and, of these, 856 were telephoned and invited to participate. Families who participated included 265 who had a child with AS, 96 who had a child with autism, and 53 clinically referred families whose child did not have either AS or autism. Results: The ASAS-R was found to contain five coherent and reliable dimensions &#150; understand and express emotion, fact orientation, sensory sensitivity, perspective-taking, and rigidity. On debated dimensions of AS (motor clumsiness, executive functioning problems, stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms), there was no clear evidence that these were core features of AS in terms of factorial clustering. A measurement model consisting of the five dimensions showed good fit to the data. There was a significant positive association of severity of Asperger&#146;s/autism symptomatology (AAS) and psychological ill-health, and this association was medium in magnitude. On the basis of a structural equation model building approach, negative peer and family factors (family conflict and peer victimisation) were found to predict psychological ill-health, and psychological ill-health predicted severity of AAS. Peer victimisation directly predicted AAS. Family cohesion did not directly influence child psychological health, but may increase the likelihood of family conflict, which was found to influence psychological health. Positive peer relationships were unrelated to psychological health or severity of AAS for the children in this sample. Discussion: The key contributions of this research were: (1) a consolidation of core and non-core dimensions of AS; (2) a valid and reliable measure of AS; (3) demonstration that anxiety/depression is correlated with AAS, (4) new findings regarding links between AAS and family and peer networks, (5) the suggestion that family conflict may not be directly related to AAS, but may influence AAS indirectly via psychological health, and (6) the suggestion that peer victimisation may directly impact on severity of AAS, as well as influence AAS via psychological health. The research has relevance to researchers and clinicians working in this area. The ASAS-R warrants future research as a promising tool that may ultimately prove helpful in guiding the foci of therapeutic/educational interventions. The research pointed to the potential value of assessing and treating family conflict, as well as peer victimisation, in the treatment of children/adolescents with AAS. Building family cohesion may be a fruitful way of indirectly influencing psychological health and AAS in this group. Further research is needed to evaluate the sensitivity of the tool to clinical change, and to use behavioural observation to assess the nature of family conflict as it affects children/adolescents with AAS. Limitations of the research are discussed in detail. These included reliance on parental report and a cross-sectional design.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158578</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Norman Lindsay : portrait of the artist</field><field name="creator">Ravenswood, Kathleen Grace</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the image of the artist as it is articulated in the work and life of the Australian artist, Norman Lindsay. Lindsay&#146;s vision of the artist is replete with all the mythic and romantic connotations that the term &#145;artist&#146; can conjure and guided by Nietzsche&#146;s doctrine of the self-creating power of the will, Norman Lindsay transformed his life itself into a work of art. This thesis is particularly interested in the work that myth does on the figure of the artist and the ways in which it is taken as a structural frame for aesthetic positions, such as Norman Lindsay assumes. Lindsay draws on the power of myth to imagine himself into being and to project this persona into the wider cultural sphere. In so doing he clearly writes himself into the western tradition of the artist and further develops this through an interpolation of Romantic tradition. Lindsay&#146;s major contribution to the on-going concern with Romanticism in Australia was his posture as genius loci. Norman Lindsay&#146;s aesthetic vision conceives of the artist as a moral exemplar whose ontological imperative is to give direction to Life. In order to do this the artist must &#145;know&#146; suffering and understand despair because only then can the artist celebrate the exaltation of Life. Lindsay&#146;s most complete articulation of the role of the artist can be found in his identification with the Romantic motif of the Promethean myth. In Norman Lindsay&#146;s attraction to the Titan we can see not only the artist&#146;s heroic aspirations but also his hero worship. Throughout his life Lindsay actively pursued exemplars of this ideal and &#145;performed&#146; their heroic gestures. Lindsay&#146;s obsession with the moral and heroic aspects of the artist has been fixed and enlarged through the many biographical accounts and approaches to this artist and his work. The artist&#146;s monograph, art history&#146;s most consistent format, owes much to the conventions of the artist&#146;s biography. We look to biography to provide us with examples of cultural meaning, thus Norman Lindsay &#145;becomes&#146; a text of national identity. While Norman Lindsay&#146;s projection of the artist-as-hero may have become a successful national icon, the same can not be said for Lindsay&#146;s own vision for Australian culture. Lindsay&#146;s edict for Australian culture is understood as a utopian site within the literature on this artist. However it was a utopia dependent not on the future but on the past and was characterized by a European imagining of the Golden Age. As a result, Lindsay&#146;s concept of the artist in the development of a &#145;civilised&#146; society is extremely elitist, essentially narrow and ultimately, conservative. As a subject of Australian art historical practice, Norman Lindsay has become something of a clich&#233;. However in focusing upon Norman Lindsay&#146;s project of self-determination and Lindsay&#146;s desire to, in effect, &#145;become&#146; the artist, I seek a richer and more nuanced understanding of this subject.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158579</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Energy efficient mineral liberation using HPGR technology</field><field name="creator">Daniel, Michael</field><field name="description">This study evaluates the effect of using high pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) in new comminution circuit designs in comparison to conventional comminution devices such as SAG and ball mills, in terms of energy efficiency. The total energy to achieve similar product sizes was measured directly in the process by using a new digital energy meter. The difference between the measured energy as a percentage of the conventional ball mill energy constituted the energy efficiency or energy saving of the circuit configuration. The analysis is based on laboratory data that compares the performance of hybrid HPGR/ball mill circuits against that of conventional grinding mill circuits. The circuits are evaluated in terms of the total comminution energy, resultant mineral liberation and the eco-efficient effect of significantly reducing grinding media consumption. Three different ore types are studied, viz. a lead/zinc ore, a bauxite/aluminum ore and a platinum/chrome ore. Total circuit energy is compared using both Bond&#146;s third theory and work index values, and a newly developed methodology of direct energy measurement. In order to validate the results of the digital energy meter, measured energy results made in the Bond ball mill were compared to several other energy evaluation techniques that included mill power models, DEM and Bond energy &#147;back-calculation&#148; methods. Comparable results have confirmed that the digital energy meter can measure specific comminution energy directly. Bond&#146;s empirical method is also critically reviewed. The Bond method which uses an empirical equation and the well known Bond work index to predict comminution energy requirements appears to be based on 60 J/rev (Bond, 1952a 1952 b). This so-called mill energy defines an equivalent net energy in the Bond ball mill test to realise the same for a 2.4 meter wet grinding mill. Bond&#146;s empirical equation results can thus be reproduced using 60J/rev and the mill test data. Bond&#146;s original paper published in 1949 stated that the net energy input to the laboratory scale ball mill is 93 J/rev (Bond, 1949). This is comparable to the digital energy meter measurement of 91.4 J/rev. Bond&#146;s empirical relationship thus suggests that there is a built in scale factor of 0.645 which accounts for the differences between dry laboratory milling tests and a full scale (2.4m) wet grinding mill and is the reason for the stated 60 J/rev. The digital energy meter was subsequently used to measure the energy consumption in the ball mill and compares this with the energy required to produce the same product size distribution in several hybrid HPGR/ball mill circuits. It was observed that on average a measured energy saving of 25-40% was achieved through the hybrid HPGR/ ball milling circuit when compared with the conventional ball mill circuit. Results obtained from measuring energy directly are compared with results obtained by using Bond&#146;s work index and third theory equation. When Bond&#146;s method is used, a method frequently used in research, negative energy savings sometimes result. The Bond third theory and work index should not be used under these circumstances. The characteristics of the liberated mineral products were measured using the JKMRC mineral liberation analyser (MLA). For each of the experimental circuit products, liberation characteristics concluded that the enhancement of liberated mineral through the use of HPGR technology was not founded. However, extensive particle micro-cracking was visible in the HPGR produces that were visible in the MLA backscatter images. This was not observed in the conventionally crushed products. The HPGR micro cracks are believed to be responsible for particle weakening and the resultant reduced milling energy requirements of ball mill processes that follow with the total circuit energy requirements significantly reduced. Greater eco-efficiency can also be realised by reducing the consumption of mill liners and grinding media. Though the &#147;dollar cost&#148; of comminution is normally accounted for as a direct electricity expense in the process and is rarely considered for its overall energy cost or &#147;embodied energy&#148; of manufacturing the steel which amounts to up to 4-6 kWh/t. Ecoefficient and sustainable development initiatives are linked to &#147;energy cost&#148; and not always &#147;dollar cost&#148; savings. Rather the direct and indirect energy cost savings and the impact on the environment should be targeted. Direct energy use in comminution processes is reviewed. It is shown that 0.56% (87 TWh) of the global net electrical energy consumption of 15,500 TWh per annum is used to crush and grind non-ferrous ores. Of this, 33% and 53% of the energy is required to process gold and copper ores respectively. This suggests that the HPGR should be targeted at gold and copper mining operations in the future to be effective in reducing carbon emissions. As such new eco-efficient flowsheets that use multiple HPGR&#146;s in series could be considered. HPGR would be employed as primary comminution devices followed by small ball mills.

Context-aware systems use context information to adapt their behaviour or the content they provide. The role of context management systems is to store, retrieve and evaluate context information on behalf of context-aware applications. Context management systems store context information in repositories, which can be distributed. This research addressed the problem of disconnections in context-aware systems. Disconnections in a context-aware system may occur because of node mobility, network failures or node failures. A research opportunity lay in improving the robustness of context-aware systems to disconnections. While traditional distributed systems methods of improving robustness in the face of disconnections can be applied to context-aware systems, the additional metadata available to context-aware systems may be leveraged to provide smarter caching algorithms. This research tested the above hypothesis by pursuing research into &#147;smart&#148; caching algorithms for context information. Many modern approaches to building context-aware systems use context models to capture relevant concepts and relationships between these concepts. These models are expressed using a modelling language. For the purposes of this research , we focus on the Context Modelling Language (CML), as it provides specific support for context-aware systems. CML supports sophisticated fact-based context modelling in which facts may be associated with a range of attributes, including its quality, classification as static, profiled, sensed or derived and temporal constraints. This thesis shows how these metadata can be used in conjunction with the inherent relational nature of CML to develop efficient caching algorithms for context information.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158694</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CODE COMPRESSION OPTIMISATION FOR VLIW PROCESSORS</field><field name="creator">Ros, Montserrat</field><field name="description">As computer programs become more complex for both embedded and large-scale applications, bloated code size continues to become an ever increasing problem. It is of particular concern in an embedded environment, where the size of the final object code greatly effects the space required for memory, which in turn contributes to overall cost. Code compression techniques have been devised as a way of battling large compiler outputs without the need to re-write hand-optimised code. The algorithms in this field require code-specific techniques (as compared with simple file or data compression) to maintain the integrity of the program and ensure its functionality. Code compression is a field where compression ratios (defined as the ratio of compressed code to uncompressed code) between compiler-generated code and subsequent compressed code are highly dependent on decisions made at compile time. Most optimisations employed by compilers tend to focus on parameters such as program performance, efficiency and minimising resource dependencies, though some effort has been made in recent years, to optimise for space as well as power savings. The effects these compiler output optimisations have on the code compression applied subsequently had not been investigated. This thesis presents the results of research into the effects of compiler optimisations on subsequent code compression for VLIW processors. The initial work looks at applying known RISC code compression algorithms to VLIW processors and investigating the effects of various levels of compiler optimisation. These compression schemes include Operand Factorisation applied to instructions, opcode/operand pairs and instruction words; simple dictionary compression with and without compression of single-use instructions; arithmetic coding as an example of a statistical compression scheme; and dictionary compression applied to single and multipleinstruction codewords. Various decompression methods are also considered based on serial decompression of individual instructions or parallel decompression of instruction fetch packets. It is shown that compression ratios are not a useful indicator of the best code size as the best results for smallest overall code size (after compiler optimisations and code compression) are obtained when the compression schemes are applied to compiler size-optimised code. Furthermore, it is shown that dictionary compression schemes are affected by compiler outputs much more so than statistical compression schemes. Program object code built with no optimisation compressed markedly better under dictionary compression rather than optimised code (a difference of 30%). However, compression ratios for statistical compression were largely independent of code optimisation. The technique of reordering parallel instructions within a VLIW compiler-issued fetch packet is also investigated, though it was found to only slightly improve compression in unoptimised code and did not affect the code compression when the benchmarks were already optimised for size. Various Vector Hamming Distance code compression techniques are investigated in this thesis, both for their own code size reduction potential, as well as how they are effected by the post-compilation technique of register re-assignment. The Vector Hamming Distance code compression technique is trialed with various dictionary selection methods including frequency, spanning and hybrid selection methods. It is shown that a dictionary selection method which considered both vector frequency as well as maximum spanning achieved better results than just considering either independently. The post-compilation technique for the greedy re-assignment of general purpose scratch registers is the final piece of research work in this thesis. The purpose of the technique is to improve Hamming distance based code compression by renumbering registers based on the register-pair frequency of the registers used by isomorphic instructions and employs a Gray coding scheme to reduce Hamming distances between similar instructions. Register reassignment had previously been successfully implemented in areas where the compiler optimisations do not include a particular metric, for example, power savings. Program values can be reassigned register numbers that reduce overall power consumption of the address bus and register file decoder, at no cost to code size or performance. This technique was shown to reduce the number dictionary entries required by over 9%.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158695</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PREDICTIVE DENSITY THRESHOLDS FOR MANAGING HOUSE MICE IN WHEAT AND SORGHUM CROPS</field><field name="creator">Kaboodvandpour, Shahram</field><field name="description">Outbreaks of house mice (Mus domesticus, L.) cause major crop losses in Australia and Central Asia. The extent of pest damage is theoretically related to the pest density and this leads to the concept of threshold pest density (DT). Prior to the present study the concept of DT had not been proven for vertebrate pests. I parameterized a predictive model of threshold mouse density for triggering control in sorghum and wheat depending on the farm-gate value of the crop and effectiveness of the control method in reducing mouse density. The two models are based on the estimated relationship between initial mouse density introduced to crops at early crop maturation (DI) in rodent-proofed pens and yield loss caused by mice (YL). Yield loss assessment was conducted at harvest and there were 49 days between the introduction of mice and harvest. This relationship was asymptotic exponential: YL increased linearly with DI until possible competition between mice occurred at densities in excess of about 500 mice ha-1 in both sorghum and wheat; and competition limited further increases in YL at densities in excess of 2,133 mice ha-1 in wheat and 3,000 mice ha-1 in sorghum. DT is 89 mice ha-1 in wheat and 178 mice ha-1 in sorghum for triggering aerial zinc phosphide baiting if this method is effective in reducing mouse density by 41.15% (wheat) and 52.58% (sorghum). I evaluated three methods to index/estimate mouse populations in the field and in pens. Population estimators based on capture-recapture data gave biased mouse density estimates and therefore could not be used to monitor DT. A track index was correlated with estimated population size in the field. The index was calibrated with known mouse densities in pens and the calibration provides a systematic relationship to predict mouse density in the field by measuring the track index. The track index was also systematically related back to YL. The demographic data collected from these experiments indicate that the cause of the asymptote in the mouse density/yield loss relationships is self-regulation, possibly through spacing behaviours caused by intra-specific competition for space. The self regulated density was 3,100 mice ha-1, which was independent of the crop type and occurred before mice could exhaust food supply from the crops. I used replicated manipulative experiments in the pens to determine that the numeric response of mice to cereal crops and their capacity to cause yield losses were affected by the sex ratio of the initial mouse populations but not by streptobacillary arthritis, a disease caused by natural bacterial infection. DT and the calibrated monitoring methods developed in this thesis can be used for improved strategies for managing YL in sorghum and wheat crops.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158371</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE NITROGEN ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION OF THE ORGANIC MATRICES OF CORAL SKELETON: A PROXY FOR HISTORICAL NITROGEN PROVENANCE IN TROPICAL COASTAL OCEANS</field><field name="creator">Marion, Guy</field><field name="description">This thesis established methodologies for analyzing the stable isotopic composition (K15N and K13C) of organic matter (OM) preserved within the skeleton of massive Scleractinian corals (Porites). The technique was applied to Porites coral cores collected from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), and provides new insights into the controversial issue of how pervasive, European-style land use change has altered water quality of the GBR Lagoon over centennial time scales. It was hypothesized that the isotopic composition of these skeletal organic fractions is primarily controlled by N species incorporated from seawater. A sampling approach was developed that allows preparation and analysis of up to 36 samples day-1, and yields relatively high precision data (1SE = 0.37&#137;) compared to normal ranges in marine K15N values (4-7&#137;). Validation studies were performed on Porites corals that were previously transplanted into a long-term nutrient enrichment experiment, and results indicated that the K15N of the acid insoluble skeletal OM reflects N species incorporated from seawater. An integrated catchment to reef study was conducted within a constrained tract of the southern GBR that included a major agricultural river system and coral reef sites ranging from 5 - 50km offshore. In the Pioneer River catchment of Mackay, Queensland, sugarcane farming occupies 71% of the lower alluvial flood plains, which are fertilized at globally high rates of 175 kg N ha-1yr-1. End-member input sources were identified within the catchment by isotopic measurements (K15N and K13C) of particulate organic matter (POM) at representative freshwater and marine sites. Biological transformations of fluvial N species during transport to the river mouth had a greater influence on POM K15N values than did the composition of the input sources themselves, which included runoff from forests, sugarcane fields, and urban areas, resulting in a latent pool of isotopically distinctive nitrogen (K15N O 9&#137;) in the lower river. Results suggest that the rapid discharge of enriched, fertilizer-derived nitrogen in river flood plumes would be distinctive from the measured range of inner and midshelf GBR values (4.9 &#150; 5.1&#137;). To determine whether anthropogenic N sources in river discharge is traceable in the skeletons of multi-century old Porites corals, reefs were cored along a transect ranging from 5km to 50 km offshore. Skeletal luminescence measured at 0.25mm increments (Q=490nm) showed that freshwater river flood plumes extend at least 33km offshore during non-drought years, with major floods reaching reefs 50km offshore every 3-5 years. Average K15N values of coral tissues and skeletal organic matter decreased significantly across the GBR shelf, ranging from 7.84 &#177; 0.24&#137; at the inshore reef to 3.82 &#177; 0.59&#137; by 50km offshore. An annually-resolved composite K15N time series was developed by averaging data from the three inshore Porites cores, spanning the years 1945 to 2004. Coral K15N values ranged from 4.84&#137; to 16.87&#137; and were positively correlated with Pioneer River discharge. Maximum values coincided with the floods triggered by cyclones &#147;Aivu&#148; (1989), &#147;Joy&#148; (1991), and a period of heavy rainfall in 2000. A highly coherent relationship was obtained (r2 = 0.71) by plotting K15N values from major flood years against time, which rose by 0.62&#137; per decade and correlated strongly with the increase in the amount of N fertilizers applied to Mackay sugarcane paddocks over that period. K15N systematics indicate that the corals incorporate recycled marine particulate nitrogen and senescent phytoplankton detritus stimulated by flood-associated influxes of terrestrial nutrient sources. One inshore coral K15N record was extended back to 1824, prior to the arrival of Europeans to Mackay in 1865. Until the late 1950s, K15N values consistently ranged between 4.61 and 8.90&#137; (av. = 6.90 &#177; 0.85&#137;). After 1958, average 15N values increased by 2.4&#137; during flood years and by 0.9&#137; during ambient flow conditions. Estimates derived from the approximately linear relationship that is obtained between modern coral K15N flood values and fertilizer application rates in the Pioneer catchment (r2 = 0.67, n = 16, p &amp;lt 0.001) reveal a 10 to 16-fold increase in accumulation rates of nitrogen delivered in river floods relative to natural baseline conditions. A 4-fold increase occurred even under ambient non-flood conditions, which is consistent with signs of chronic nutrient stress on reefs in this study and in the regional Whitsundays Islands (van Woesik et al. 1999). Elevated N accumulation rates in these nearshore coral reefs occurred over the last 40 &#150; 50 years. Agricultural conservation techniques introduced in the late 1980s (green cane trash blanketing) had no obvious effects on N accumulation rates in the inner reefs of Mackay. The aforementioned coral K15N records provide an isotopic link between anthropogenic sources of nitrogen, runoff from cleared coastal lands, and degraded nearshore GBR communities, demonstrating the feasibility of using coral K15N to assess baseline targets for water quality monitoring and remediation programs in Australia and worldwide.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158696</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING AND HUSBANDRY REQUIRED FOR TRANSLOCATION OF THE NORTHERN HAIRY-NOSED WOMBAT (Lasiorhinus krefftii)</field><field name="creator">Treby, Donna Louise</field><field name="description">The northern hairy-nosed wombat, Lasiorhinus krefftii, is listed as critically endangered and is restricted to a single population of approximately 90 animals in Epping Forest National Park (Scientific), in the central Queensland highlands. Epping Forest National Park has low rainfall and is regularly subjected to periods of drought and therefore is at risk from wildfire (Horsup 2004). A long term management goal of the northern hairy-nosed wombat recovery program has been to establish additional water sources, and to determine a range of supplementary feeds that the northern hairy-nosed wombat (NHW) will consume to minimise any negative environmental effects on the population. This study investigated the potential of providing supplementary feed and water to the NHW. The data collected have shown that the NHW will readily accept a supplementary diet. In addition, it has displayed preferences for certain feed types and will visit new sources of feed and water on a nightly basis. Rainfall was the only environmental factor found to have a significant impact on wombat activity at supplementary feed and water sites. Two macropod exclusion devices were also trialled in an attempt to reduce competition for supplementary feed and water from eastern grey kangaroos Macropus giganteus, and swamp wallabies Wallabia bicolor. One was a mesh roof over a water trough and the other a wooden box over a feed trough. Both were monitored by remote video cameras. The mesh roof was gradually lowered over time to allow the NHW to become accustomed to its presence. The roof was a success in that large eastern grey kangaroos could not gain access to water at a roof height of 27 cm. However, the NHW could still access water at this height. The wooden box was successful in that eastern grey kangaroos could not gain access to feed troughs. However, swamp wallabies could still enter boxes. The NHW ignored the box at one supplementary feed site, but entered the box at a different site. The first expected in-situ translocation of the NHW is scheduled to take place in 2007. During the translocation, the NHW may be held temporarily in a captive environment. There are currently no NHWs in captivity therefore there is no knowledge base to draw information from on the captive requirements of this species. The southern hairy-nosed wombat (SHW) and common wombat (CW) are currently held within a number of zoological institutions. The SHW is closely related to the NHW, and is often researched as an analogue species. A study of the current captive management and breeding programs of the SHW and CW within zoological institutions around Australia was undertaken, with particular emphasis on the SHW. This research has resulted in the compilation of a 'Wombat Husbandry Manual', to assist with the translocation and future captive life of the northern hairy-nosed wombat.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158580</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From river banks to shearing sheds: Thirty years with flying arts 1971 - 2001</field><field name="creator">England, Marilyn Irene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1905 Visual Arts and Crafts</field><field name="subject">Moriarty, Mervyn, 1937-</field><field name="subject">Flying Arts -- History.</field><field name="subject">Art schools -- Queensland -- History -- 20th century.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158697</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT: AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF INTERGROUP DISCRIMINATION AS A MOTIVATED RESPONSE TO REPAIR A TRANSIENT NEGATIVE MOOD</field><field name="creator">Baird, Leith</field><field name="description">Using a variant of the minimal group paradigm, five experiments examined the effects of transient mood, specifically negative mood, on intergroup discrimination. Despite recent interest in the role of affect in social cognition (e.g., Baron, 1987; Erber &amp; Erber, 2001; Forgas &amp; Bower, 1987; Giner-Sorolla, Mackie &amp; Smith, 2007), there has been little systematic investigation of the role of transient mood in intergroup processes. As an exception, Forgas and Fiedler (1996) reported evidence that the combination of negative mood and a personally involving group membership motivated discriminatory behaviour on the Tajfel (1970) matrices. The central aim of the thesis was to extend the research findings of Forgas and Fiedler via investigation of the joint effects of group status and transient negative mood on discrimination with a focus on the mechanism believed to underpin bias for negative mood respondents: motivated mood repair. Experiment One used a 2 x 3 experimental design. Participants (N = 93) were categorised into groups that varied in terms of mood (negative, neutral, positive) and relative group status (high, low) before distributing points to ingroup and outgroup members using the Tajfel (1970) matrices. Results indicated that, overall, high status group members were more discriminatory than members of low status groups and members in a negative mood were more discriminatory than members in an induced positive or negative mood. This suggested, as per Forgas and Fiedler (1996), that transient negative mood is an important factor in intergroup discrimination, at least when the ingroup imbues positive self regard. Most discrimination was evidenced for high status participants in a negative mood. Results examining between-groups differences in perceived mood repair and task enjoyment indicated that respondents in a negative mood high status condition, those who discriminated most, also reported enhanced mood improvement and task enjoyment. Further, mediational analyses revealed that, among members of high status groups, the effect of mood on perceived mood repair and task ease was no longer significant when ingroup bias was included as a covariate. Taken together, results from Experiment One provided initial evidence for motivated processing in the service of mood repair. Experiment Two used a one-way experimental design (N = 87) to examine more closely the potential for intergroup discrimination to effect mood repair. Respondents in a negative mood-high status condition completed the Tajfel (1970) matrices either after standard instructions for matrix completion or after instructions explicitly indicating that they should use a fairness, an outgroup bias, or an ingroup bias strategy. Results provided further evidence of a tendency to discriminate in favour of the ingroup in negative mood high status contexts. Results also confirmed that, relative to other possible responses (e.g., outgroup bias), the display of ingroup bias promoted mood repair, apparently via highly targeted, motivated processing rather than via slower, deliberative processing (cf. Forgas &amp; Fiedler, 1996). The third experiment in the series sought to explicitly test whether motivated mood repair acted as the driver for accentuated ingroup bias or whether mood repair was simply a collateral benefit of discrimination. Participants (N = 77), all of whom were classified as high status group members, were induced into either a negative or neutral mood state. Then, borrowing Manucia, Baumann and Cialdini&#146;s (1984) &#145;mood freeze pill&#146; paradigm, respondents were told that, having ingested a &#145;pill&#146;, their current mood could or could not be altered. Respondents in the fixed mood condition did not engage in the level of bias typically expected from sad participants and, further, they did not enjoy the same level of mood repair as labile mood respondents who showed significantly greater ingroup bias. Thus mood repair was identified as the direct driver of discrimination in this context. The fourth experiment (N = 92) examined the role of allocation norms (ingroup favouritism, outgroup favouritism) and mood (negative, positive) on discrimination and mood repair among members of high status groups. As predicted negative mood participants displayed more discrimination than their positive mood counterparts and participants advised of a norm supportive of ingroup favouritism displayed accentuated discrimination compared with their peers advised of a norm for outgroup favouritism. A complex but complementary pattern was reported on the mood repair and task ease measures, indicating that those who were supported by a norm for discrimination found the task easier and displayed more mood repair. The fifth and final experiment (N = 80) sought to examine the role of two simple behavioural checks on manifested discrimination for negative mood, high status respondents. A 2 (mood awareness: not aware, aware) X 2 (response latency: spontaneous, delayed) experimental design was employed and results confirmed the efficacy of both manipulations in attenuating bias on the minimal group matrices. Presumably, mood awareness and longer decision timeframes triggered less urgent mood calibration efforts (e.g., Forgas, Ciarrochi, &amp; Moylan, 2000). The final chapter presents key theoretical and practical implications of the research findings, including: confirmatory support for the notion that, in a negative mood high status context, mood repair is a potent driving force for discriminatory behaviour; specific evidence that, in selecting a cognitive processing strategy, the perceiver is sensitive to a hierarchical series of cueing variables (including status, relevance and mood); initial indications that relatively simple interventions can attenuate the typical effects of negative mood on discrimination; and the continued importance of social norms and education that emphasise the potential influence of mood on intergroup behaviour and the social value of parity in intergroup relations. Finally, strengths and limitations of the experimental approach are acknowledged and suggestions proffered for future applied testing.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158698</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Strategic Reformation: Change and Stability in Post-11 September Australian Strategic Policy</field><field name="creator">Hirst, Christian</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to determine if the central paradigmatic assumptions that shaped Australian strategic policy prior to the 11 September (S11) terrorist attacks on the United States shifted over the four years between S11 and the end of 2005. To this point, the debate surrounding Australia&#146;s strategic posture has not been informed by a rigorous and independent investigation into the post-S11 trajectory of Australian strategic policy. The core question this study will seek to answer is: has S11 produced a paradigm shift in Australian strategic policy? Methodologically, this study is presented as a single case study of intrinsic importance. Although the study has a narrative quality, it is essentially an investigation into Australia&#146;s policy response to S11. The case study method will be employed primarily to deepen academics&#146; and policymakers&#146; understanding of what has been a crucial era in the history of Australian strategic policy. As such, the most appropriate theoretical approach is that of Foreign Policy Analysis (FPA). Unlike other theoretical paradigms, FPA does not seek to limit the range of actors or factors considered in the analysis of policy action. It is this flexibility and FPA&#146;s ability to allow for thick and rich descriptions of the factors affecting a state&#146;s policy trajectory that endear it most to this study. The study has found that, as a result of the perceptual shock of S11 and the subsequent efforts of key political and bureaucratic actors, the Australian government&#146;s formalised view of the security environment has transformed and its perceptions of the role and utility of Australia&#146;s Defence Force (ADF) and the United States alliance have changed in important ways. Despite this, budgetary, political and cognitive stabilisers have prevented the formal enunciation of new post-S11 strategic posture. Despite claims to the contrary made by senior members of Australia&#146;s strategic policy community, this study shows that there is little doubt that the worldview underpinning the Australian government&#146;s approach to strategic policy in late 2005 was significantly different from that which shaped Defence 2000, the government&#146;s last formal expression of strategic doctrine prior to S11. Such a change is indicative of a paradigm shift. While no new coherent strategic policy paradigm has yet taken the place of pre-S11 guidance, the strategic ideas and strategic actions of the Australian government between 11 September 2001 and the end of 2005, in the judgment of this study, are representative of the early stages of a major reformation in Australia&#146;s strategic orientation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158699</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SATURN RETURNS An Exploration of Narrative Structure in Film Writing</field><field name="creator">Schinkel, Vicky Jahann</field><field name="description">Saturn, the planet of limitations, takes nearly 29 years to first return to its position at birth. Some philosophers see birth as the first major crisis in the evolution of self ... when Saturn returns we face the second ... Brilliant neuroscientist and researcher, Emma Thale has her world turned upside down after an unknown saboteur blows up Emma, her experiment and her laboratory. Emma loses everything important to her on the night of her 29th birthday. Sunk in depression she retreats to the home of Josie to recover. Instead of dying when she tips an electrical appliance into her bath, Emma instead develops strange neurological powers. With a new sense of direction, and determined to discover who destroyed her experiment (and why) she ends up in the bowels of the sinister Neurocon, a marketing conglomerate that provides consumer analysis to the world. Emma struggles to come to terms with her developing powers, explores the strange neurological developments in the Company Laboratories, faces up to the sinister Ms Lily and tries to figure out who, if anyone, she can trust. She realises the stakes are much higher than she thought, and she unexpectedly stumbles upon the answer to the secrets of her past, and an answer to the riddle of her parents' disappearance. The critical essay assesses the role formal models of narrative structure in film play in the scriptwriting process, using the 3-Act Model advocated by Syd Field as a benchmark. The different models arise from the work of critics, theorists and writers themselves. The ways in which models are used by film-makers and writers suggests that their most valuable contribution is at an editing and script analysis level. Further, the 3-Act model in particular provides a common ground of discourse for filmmakers, critics and viewers of film. In the process of writing Saturn Returns this writer discovered that developing back-story for characters (by writing stories) and stimulation of the imagination through research and day-dreaming contributed more to the finished script than did adhering to, or following a scriptwriting model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158700</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Funding Hospital Services: A Critical Analysis and Feasibility Study of the Casemix Funding Model in Iran</field><field name="creator">Ghaffari, Shahram</field><field name="description">Background Hospitals in Iran have mainly been managed in a centralised system and funded historically through annual budgeting with little autonomy at hospital level. The current annual budgeting system is inequitable and is not reflective of hospital activity. Hospital resources are not distributed with regard to efficiency indicators and lobbying and political power of the managers are common issues influencing budget. Evidence suggests that hospitals in Iran will be even further challenged due to the growing and aging population. Reform of funding policy, particularly in hospitals, is now being considered as a critical step to improvement of Iran&#146;s health system. Objectives This is a study of the theoretical and practical aspects of the implementation of casemix funding of hospitals in Iran. It aims to identify the knowledge and attitude of hospital managers and staff about the feasibility of casemix; to investigate availability, reliability and completeness of hospital discharge and financial data; to measure the appropriateness of the Australian Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (AR-DRGs); to build up a basis for further studies on casemix funding of hospitals; and, to assist the efficient use of scarce resources among and between hospital systems. Methods First, a descriptive survey, using an eleven-item questionnaire, was conducted to assess the level of knowledge and attitudes of hospital managers and key staff about casemix funding and its appropriateness. Second, patients&#146; clinical and demographic information were collected from the discharge system of a single study hospital, to evaluate the accuracy and completeness of these data for adopting casemix in Iran&#146;s hospitals. This information was used to classify patient episodes into DRG classes using the LAETA Grouper and AR-DRGs. Third, DRG cost weights were calculated based on the internationally accepted principles of 'activity-based' cost accounting and cost-modelling, taking into account current realities of hospital accounting structures, availability of data, as well as time and budget constraints. To identify whether there is any association between modelled cost weights and length of stay at the DRG level, two statistical measures, the Pearson correlation coefficient and regression coefficient were calculated using the STATA statistical package. Finally, a total of 465,531 acute inpatient separations, from 35 hospitals, was used to examine the performance of AR-DRGs in the study environment. L3H3; IQR; and 10th- 95th percentile methods were used for excluding extreme cases. The coefficient of variation (CV) and reduction in variance (R2) were used to measure the degree of homogeneity achieved by the classification system and the extent to which the dispersion of lengths of stay could be explained by grouping the cases into the discrete DRG classes. Results The staff survey results showed that 75% and 58% of the participants had not ever heard of the terms casemix and DRGs, respectively. The majority of the participants described casemix and DRGs as a cost allocation and/or funding tool rather than a classification system useful for management and performance measurement. The most common barriers to casemix implementation outlined by the participants included: the lack of good foundation knowledge; difficulty in data access; and lack of or incomplete knowledge of the chief managers and staff about the casemix. The data quality study findings suggest that the accuracy and completeness of the available data in the study hospital is variable and not highly reliable. The grouper identified invalid records of principal diagnosis, age, sex, and length of stay for 4% of total separations. No complication and comorbidity effects were recorded for 93% of cases. Although general practitioners are employed as gate keepers to control coding accuracy, there is no standard quality control to secure the accuracy and consistency of coding either at the physician or coder level. Coders, except in a few cases, have not been formally trained. According to the data study, the estimation of DRG cost weights using a clinical costing approach is almost impossible due to inadequate financial and utilisation information at the patient level, poorly computerised 'feeder systems', and low quality data. In contrast, the cost modelling approach, using Australian service weights resulted in the average DRG cost weight of 2.723 million Iranian Rials (equal to US $295). A regression coefficient of 0.14 (CI = 0.12 &#8722; 0.16) suggests that the average cost weight increases by 14% for every one day increase in average length of stay. Classifying a total of 465,531 acute inpatient separations using AR-DRG resulted in 579 DRG classes. Although reduction in variance (R2) for untrimmed data was low (R2 = 0.17) for LOS, trimming by L3H3, IQR, and 10th-95th percentile method improved the value of R2 to 0.53, 0.48, and 0.51, respectively. Low values of R2 for DRGs within several MDCs such as MDC 02, 05, 10, 15, and MDC 20 were identified. Conclusion This study concludes that the implementation of the casemix funding of hospitals in the Iranian health system and in Iranian Social Security Organisation in particular, is quite feasible and that AR-DRGs would provide a useful basis for introducing casemix in the system. However, the effective implementation of casemix in Iran would depend on a number of factors including: active cooperation and contribution of hospital staff at all levels and in all departments in the implementation process and provision of reliable data; updating hospital information systems; improving the quality of costing information; adopting an appropriate classification system, and, finally, adequate scrutiny of health care providers&#146; behaviours through the regular assessment of hospital performance and quality of care.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hospital funding mechanisms</field><field name="subject">casemix</field><field name="subject">DRGs</field><field name="subject">feasibility study</field><field name="subject">cost</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158701</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EARLY-AGE CRACKING OF CONCRETE</field><field name="creator">Dao, Vinh The Ngoc</field><field name="description">Early-age cracking, which occurs during the first several hours after casting of the concrete, is of considerable economic significance in the concrete construction industry. It can have serious consequences in respect of the durability, strength, and aesthetics of concrete structures. This is of particular concern in those structures with high exposed surface areas, such as highway pavements, bridge decks, industrial and residential floors, wharves and parking structures. The current trend of increasing use of concrete mixes with lower water-binder ratios, lower bleed capacities, and higher contents of cement and fine materials, increases the susceptibility of concrete structures to early-age cracking, especially if they are insufficiently cured. Early-age cracking is the result of a complex interaction between many variables that change rapidly over time. Therefore, despite the significant expenditure of much research effort by earlier researchers, there remain many areas that should be investigated further. Specifically, there is currently a lack of basic understanding of suctions and their effects on the early-age cracking of concrete. There is also a serious lack of reliable data on the properties of early-age concrete, particularly those relating to its tensile behaviour. The main objective of this thesis is to address these issues. In order to achieve this, a combination of theoretical, experimental, and numerical approaches was adopted. The major contributions of the work reported in this thesis can be summarised as follows. First, the thesis unifies and clarifies the concepts underlying the equations commonly used to estimate the total, matric, and osmotic suctions, which are important for the study of the behaviour of early-age concrete, including early-age cracking. The thesis then demonstrates for the first time the negligible role of osmotic suction in early-age cracking of concrete, and thus justifies the focus of earlier researchers on matric suction only. A special test apparatus and experimental procedures were developed for the thesis that provided reliable data on the complete tensile stress-strain curves of concrete specimens at ages as early as 1.5 h after mixing. A number of mechanical properties and fracture characteristics of concrete at these very early ages that are crucial for the study of its earlyage cracking were evaluated using these data. These include the age-dependent stressdisplacement curve, tensile strength, Young&#146;s modulus, strain at maximum stress, characteristic length, fracture energy, and their inter-relationships. Importantly, the high fracture energy obtained, which is an order of magnitude or more greater those of its major constituents, suggests strongly that early-age cracking of concrete involves a significant zone of plastic straining or microcracking in the vicinity of the crack tip. The above findings of the thesis provide more solid scientific background to and improved theoretical understanding of the problem of early-age cracking, and hence enable a better control and minimisation of its occurrence. Parallel research was also undertaken to assess the effectiveness of two different types of admixtures purported to reduce the permeability, and hence enhance the durability of concrete, including cracked concrete. The results obtained suggest that the incorporation of an admixture characterised by hydrophobic and pore-blocking effects improves considerably the durability of concrete in respect of chloride-induced corrosion. The inclusion of an admixture characterised by crystallisation activity, however, seems to have almost no detectable effects.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158702</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Retribution to Reintegration: Drug Courts in Australia</field><field name="creator">Cappa, Clare</field><field name="description">Drug courts are a recent, but apparently compelling, addition to the criminal justice system, designed to positively influence the drug-crime nexus. They operate as a specialised criminal court, involving cooperation between the courts and drug treatment professionals, by streamlining drug-related cases away from traditional processing and punishment into an intensive drug treatment program. The very proliferation of drug courts renders them deserving of study. While there are surveys of individual Australian courts, there has, to date, been no comparative study across the various Australian jurisdictions. This thesis fulfils this need. Although there is increasing debate in the United States about the theoretical basis of drug courts, this debate is largely taking place after their creation. Australian drug courts have largely been implemented without reference to any philosophical underpinnings. This thesis places the drug court phenomenon within its political, social, and philosophical environment, and provides an explanation of the legal contexts within which the drug court process operates. There are many untested assumptions about drug courts, most importantly claims that they are successful. If drug courts are going to continue to operate and become more widely accepted, it is necessary to recognise their underlying rationale and to identify the link between the social, political, and theoretical bases and the actual outcomes. The indicia for success within the drug court context have never been definitively articulated, and by identifying key elements of success, and then categorising the relationships of those elements to contexts and processes, this thesis will go some of the way towards defining drug court success. In other words this thesis attempts to provide answers to the questions &#8211; do drug courts work? And if so, what makes them workable?</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">189999 Law and Legal Studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158703</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Business Process Enforcement Using Harmonized Messaging Technology</field><field name="creator">Ma, Dat</field><field name="description">Business Process Management (or BPM) has emerged recently as one of the most prominent technologies in enterprise systems. Generally, BPM aims to provide business process modelling, enactment, and monitoring. BPM attempts to create general frameworks, which avoid the &amp;quothard-coded&amp;quot approach to application integration. It leverages the logic of business processes in the hands of process stakeholders, by abstracting from the data and application implementation details. However, despite the interest of various parties and the development of the technology, BPM solutions have not always delivered successfully. There reside many challenges and difficulties in BPM, which include the scalability, volatility, autonomy, heterogeneity, reliability, and security issues. A wide range of information technologies has been proposed to respond to these issues, but many limitations and challenges still exist; particularly, providing process support for collaborative business processes that are characterised by autonomous processes, asynchronous business activities, and message-based process communication. This thesis is motivated by the requirement to build a new approach for BPM to tackle the challenges of collaborative processes. We propose to integrate Messaging Oriented Middlewares and Rule-based technology into a new so-called Harmonized Messaging Technology (or HMT). The HMT utilises a messaging mechanism empowered by rules for supporting collaborative business processes. In particular, the HMT is intended to bridge the gap between the communication-oriented approaches and rule-based approaches for process management. The technology considers the abstraction of the process logic and the automation of the process management through an ordered flow of messages. In this thesis, we propose a temporal first-order language, which is called Harmonized Messaging Calculus and forms the formal foundation for rules governing the business process execution in HMT. For verification purpose, we consider the correctness criteria for such HMT rules, which help to avoid inconsistencies and unexpected behaviour in executing HMT process models. In addition, this thesis will present the architecture of the systems, which manage business processes through HMT. The functionality of HMT in process modelling and enactment is also investigated. Finally, the flexibility of HMT process models in supporting the new functionality is discussed. We conclude the thesis with the indication of directions for future work, which focus on the issues related to the deployment of HMT. In particular, we raise issues in design interfaces, analysis tools, audit trail data, transactions support, and security.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158704</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mothering school aged children with and without disabilities in Singapore: The lived experience</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Michelle Inn Inn</field><field name="description">In order to provide best practice occupational therapy services, time needs to be taken to establish partnering relationships between therapists and parents. Therapists need to understand mothering and how the mother child relationship is enacted for each individual client. This enables the provision of contextually relevant therapy in order to increase clients&#146; participation in meaningful occupations. Qualitative studies on the lived experiences of mothering with different types of mothers provide therapists with further understanding of this important life role. This qualitative research study sought to explore the lived experience of Singaporean women who mother school aged children with or without disabilities. In-depth interviews were utilised with fourteen Singaporean mothers to explore the experiences of the role and occupations related to mothering in order to gain an understanding of the meaning of mothering for these women. Two groups of participants were recruited for the study: mothers of children without a disability (seven) and mothers with at least one child with a disability of school age (seven). Results and discussions are presented based on descriptions of: (1) the role of mothering, (2) the lived experience of mothering and (3) the similarities and differences between the two groups of mothers. The predominant themes that emerged from this study are: (1) mothering children with disabilities is not dis-similar to mothering typically developing children and (2) mothers of school age children with disabilities are able to participate in home therapy programmes. The implication of these results is that it is important for health care professionals to empower mothers of children with special need to &#147;mother individuals&#148; who are unique with their own strength and weaknesses rather than mother a &#147;child with disabilities&#148;. Other significant themes which emerged from this study were categorised as: (1) &#147;sameness&#148; of the mothering experiences, (2) mothering children with disabilities affords these women expanded roles, opportunities and experiences, (3) significant mothering roles for Singaporean women are being a teacher and decision maker, and (4) mothering creates positive life and self development opportunities. It is proposed that important therapy goals for health care professionals working with families of children with disabilities of school age include: (1) education programmes that empower mothers to vision and direct therapy services for their child with special needs, (2) developing and enhancing community participation and engagement for families of children with disabilities via the utilisation of community social supports such as religious organisations, self help groups and by strengthening inter-generational family ties and (3) promoting the participation of &#147;normalising&#148; family occupations. These include participation in meal times, family leisure activities, community engagement and celebration of festive occasions. This enables maintenance of positive and healthy family interactions for families with a member who has a disability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158705</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation and Consequences of Alternative Splicing of the Breast Cancer Susceptibility Genes</field><field name="creator">Pettigrew, Christopher</field><field name="description">Splicing is an integral component of post-transcriptional processing of pre-mRNA transcripts. Alternative splicing is the process where multiple mRNA isoforms are generated from a single gene, and is an important gene regulatory mechanism. Dis-regulation of alternative splicing may contribute to disease, with aberrant splicing potentially more detrimental to gene function than changes to the amino acid sequence. This thesis investigates the role of alternative splicing in normal BRCA regulation and also the effect of single nucleotide changes on splicing. The breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA) are tumour suppressor genes that have a wide range of functions including DNA repair, transcriptional activation and chromatin remodelling. Inheritance of a mutated allele of either BRCA gene confers an increased lifetime risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Functional insufficiency of either of the BRCA genes leads to genomic instability, and can contribute to tumourigenesis. Both of the breast cancer susceptibility genes generate a number of splice variants in addition to their full length transcripts. A number of these isoforms retain functional characteristics of the full length, while other functional isoforms possess altered functional properties. Some exon-skipping events result in a loss of the open reading frame (ORF) leading to premature termination codons (PTCs). Alternatively spliced transcripts containing PTCs are rapidly degraded by the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, and as a consequence are unable to generate significant amounts of protein. Nonsense, missense and translationally silent single nucleotide changes can inactivate genes by influencing splicing efficiency and or accuracy. Nucleotide changes affecting splicing are not limited to the splice site consensus sequences, with mutations located within exons able to cause exon skipping. These sequence changes disrupt exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) sequences which aid the spliceosome in recognising proximal splice sites. Using a bioinformatics approach, a number of putative ESEs were identified in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Reported sequence changes in both genes colocalise to these predicted ESEs and determining the effects of these sequence changes on splicing is critical to determining their pathogenicity. Splicing is a highly conserved process, however it is unclear whether the conservation of splicing related sequences and factors translates to conservation of alternatively spliced transcripts. BRCA1 has been reported to express over 30 different splice variants, however it is unclear how many of these transcripts are also expressed in the mouse. Understanding the expression of splice variants across species is critical for determining their function and significance. Analysis of Brca1 alternative splicing in the mouse mammary gland identified a number of novel isoforms, including Brca1-IRIS and Brca1-&#916;22. These transcripts are expressed by both the mouse and human BRCA1 genes. Preliminary functional analysis of the BRCA1-&#916;22 protein product suggests that it retains some functional characteristics of the full length BRCA1, but not the transcriptional activation activity. This thesis addresses the role of splicing in BRCA gene expression and contributes to the understanding of alternative splicing processes in general. The identification of sequence variants that may affect splicing of BRCA genes may contribute to classification of unclassified variants and improved genetic counselling of patients carrying sequence variants. The identification of additional BRCA1 splice variants has implications for understanding the complicated and varying phenotypes associated with Brca1 knockout mouse models as well as understanding the functions attributed to BRCA1.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158706</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ROLES OF hnRNPs A2 AND A3 IN TELOMERE BIOLOGY</field><field name="creator">Sara, Sergio Andres</field><field name="description">Telomeres are specialised structures present at the ends of linear chromosomes, composed of tandem repeats of short G-rich sequence (TTAGGG in eukaryotes) and associated proteins. In addition to ensuring the complete DNA replication of chromosome ends, they also impart protection of chromosomes from end-to-end fusion and nucleolytic degradation. Telomeres, which are predominantly double-stranded DNA, terminate in a 3&#146; single-stranded overhang. With each successive cell division, progressive telomere shortening occurs in normal somatic cells, and eventually induces one of three fates: proliferative senescence; apoptosis; or continued proliferation followed by genomic instability. In immortal germline cells, replication-dependent shortening of telomeric DNA is counteracted by telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein complex with an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. This reverse transcriptase mediates the synthesis of single-stranded telomeric repeats to the 3&#146; end of chromosomes. Telomere-associated proteins appear to regulate telomeric structure, thereby determining whether and how telomerase gains access to the 3&#146; overhang. Mammalian telomeres have been shown to end in a large t-loop structure, which mediates protection of the 3&#146; hydroxyl and limits the ability of telomerase to access its substrate. The presence of a 3&#146; G-rich overhang suggests that single-stranded DNA binding proteins play a pivotal role in telomere function. Several observations suggest hnRNP proteins are important for telomere biogenesis, including their ability to bind not only telomeres, but also telomerase. In this study, in vitro affinity pull-down assays, UV-crosslinking, surface plasmon resonance and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed hnRNPs A2 and A3 specifically interacted with telomeric DNA. This interaction, which was mediated through both the sequence-specific and non-specific binding sites of hnRNP A2 and A3 proteins, was demonstrated to be of high affinity, obtaining a dissociation constant of 24.8 nM. Furthermore, while the tandem RRM domains of the hnRNP A/B proteins were necessary and sufficient for an interaction with telomeric DNA, the presence of the glycine-rich domain was shown to increase the affinity. While other experiments had shown a co-localisation of hnRNP A/B proteins with telomeric ends, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed these proteins directly bind telomeric DNA in vivo. Additionally, immunoprecipitation experiments showed hnRNP A2 and A3 proteins specifically associate with endogenous telomerase. This association seems to be mediated by binding a 31-nt region within telomerase RNA, rather than the protein component. This study has further supported the view that, hnRNPs can function as an adaptor molecule between telomeric DNA and telomerase. These proteins, which are highly abundant in the cell nucleus and perform many redundant roles, are likely to influence telomere biogenesis by their overall presence, rather than by their individual association.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158707</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FACTORS AFFECTING MELON FARMERS&#146; BEHAVIOUR IN ADOPTING BALANCED FERTILIZER PRACTICE A CASE STUDY IN SHANSHAN COUNTY, XINJIANG PROVINCE, CHINA</field><field name="creator">Su, Zhuo</field><field name="description">The Xinjiang Hami melon industry has experienced unprecedented challenges since 1995. Before 1995, Xinjinag was the only area in China in growing Hami melons, and enjoyed the advantage of the sole supply to markets. The advantage faded when other provinces in China started to grow them. Even worse for the Xinjiang melon industry is the quality of melons is deteriorating by using chemical fertilizer without integrating adequate organic fertilizer. As a result market share of Xinjiang melon has dropped dramatically and farmers&#146; margin has been reduced. Balanced fertilizer use has been regarded as one of the effective approach to improving melon quality and increasing the competitiveness of the Xinjiang melon industry. Since 2000 efforts have been made by Shanshan government to diffuse this practice to melon farmers. However the adoption rate was unsatisfactory and more than half of melon farmers had not paid their attention to the balanced fertilizer practice (Li, 2003). This research focuses on the identification of factors that affect melon farmers&#146; adoption of balanced fertiliser practice. Through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, 26 potential factors that could affect farmers&#146; adoption of balanced fertilizer practice were identified. Based on content analysis of data from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, a series of hypotheses about the association between those identified factors and adoption behaviour was proposed. A standard questionnaire was developed and 500 melon farmers in Shanshan County across 7 townships were surveyed. From them, 399 useable questionnaires were used for quantitative analysis. The survey data were analysed using factor analysis, twoway relationship analysis and stepwise regression analysis. Two-way relationship analysis was used to test the proposed hypotheses. Results revealed that of the 26 preliminary factors 12 showed significant correlation with melon farmers&#146; adoption of balanced fertilizer practice. These 12 factors included (1) local extension service, (2) land size of melon farmers, (3) farmers&#146; subjective perceptions of their soil conditions, (4) farmers&#146; market channel, (5) demonstration households, (6) farmers&#146; origin, (7) farmers&#146; income, (8) farmers&#146; perceptions of melon quality affecting price, (9) farmers&#146; perceptions of the cost of balanced fertilizer practice, (10) farmers&#146; satisfaction with their dealers, (11) farmers&#146; duration with their dealers and (12) opportunistic behaviour of dealers. Further examining the 12 factors using stepwise regression revealed 6 were the most influential and explained 78 percent of the behaviour of melon farmers in adoption of balanced fertilizer practice. Of these 6 factors 3 were subjective which measured farmers&#146; perceptions to the statements of &#147;melon quality affects sale price&#148;, &#147;my dealer is opportunistic&#148; and &#147;balanced fertilizer use is costly&#148;. The rest were objective factors which were farmers&#146; market channel, extension service and farmers&#146; origin. Farmers&#146; behaviour in technology adoption in China has rarely been studied previously. This research is the first attempt to understand how Chinese farmers make decisions on technology adoption by using both qualitative and quantitative data. The findings revealed that factors affecting adoption behaviour not only come from farmers&#146; social, economic and biophysical conditions and technology itself as most previous studies suggested, but also from farmers&#146; marketing channels and their relationship with their dealers. The latter one has not been paid much attention by researchers or local government and extension services in China. This thesis highlights the importance of considering these issues, particularly in horticultural industries where farmers&#146; profit is highly dependent on market channels and systems. The findings of this thesis have many implications for local government and current extension approaches in Shanshan County, where government and extension services have paid great attention to the introduction of balanced fertilizer practice. They have focused on educating farmers in the benefits of balanced fertilizer practice on improving melon quality by stimulating its adoption. Little attention has been given to making high quality melons more profitable. The results of this study suggest that government and extension agents need to take a new approach which focuses not only on balanced fertilizer practice itself but also on the linkage between farmers and marketplaces. By doing so, adoption of balanced fertilizer practice can be converted into farmers&#146; profit, and farmers&#146; incentive in adoption can increase.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158708</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc></add>
