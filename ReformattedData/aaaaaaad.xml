The purpose of the study is to evaluate the implementation of the 1999 Queensland HPE syllabus in three BCE primary schools of varying enrolment numbers. The research problem is:.How developed is the implementation of the new HPE syllabus in BCE schools?. The data collection was guided by the following research questions:- How are teachers in these BCE schools implementing the HPE curriculum documents? What readily accessible resources do schools have to assist with the implementation of Health and Physical Education?. What are teachers. perceptions with regard to the HPE Key Learning Area? What are the children.s perceptions of the HPE Key Learning Area? What implementation strategies are required to optimize HPE practices in BCE schools? This study is significant for the feedback it may provide to BCE of the HPE syllabus implementation process and in informing BCE of the current status of the HPE key learning area within a sample of systemic Catholic primary schools. The findings have the potential to contribute to the BCE Strategic Renewal Framework currently occurring within BCE schools for all curriculum areas and planned for completion by the end of 2006. This research has been designed within a constructionist paradigm. An interpretivist study was conducted employing symbolic interactionism. This qualitative, interpretive study is most appropriate as meanings were constructed. The case study methodology was chosen to construct meaning through capturing the context of each school. The sites for the three case studies involved: one small sized BCE primary school (less than 200 students); one medium sized BCE primary school (200 - 400 students); and one large sized BCE primary school (over 400 students). The participants included teachers and students from the respective schools. The data gathering strategies used were; semi-structured and focus group interviews, reflective journal note taking, observations, questionnaire and document analysis. The research concluded that factors which led to the decline in Australian HPE during the 1980s and early 1990s may have contributed to impeding the implementation challenges formulated by BCE. This was evidenced within the three BCE primary schools by unequal allocation of teaching resources, equipment, facilities, HPE teachers and HPE teacher release time for sports coordination. It appears that the implementation process ceased prematurely before all schools had had sufficient time and preparation to design whole school HPE programs. Teachers lacked understandings of practical ways to implement the social justice underpinnings of the syllabus and some school principals were unaware of the necessity of employing qualified HPE specialist teachers. The research revealed that school principals play a significant role in the implementation of the 1999 HPE syllabus, a role made more imperative by the absence of BCE HPE Curriculum Officers and systemic HPE professional development. Therefore, the HPE key learning area requires further system level support and attention so that the 1999 HPE syllabus can be implemented successfully in all BCE primary schools, enabling curriculum change to occur.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic primary schools</field><field name="subject">Health and Physical Education syllabus</field><field name="subject">Curriculum development</field><field name="subject">Educational chang</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp96.04092006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploration of the Relationship Between Teacher Leadership and the Principalship in Nurturing Student Learning</field><field name="creator">Madden, John Henry</field><field name="description">The concept of instructional leadership has become a growing interest in the discourse on school leadership. Effective schools studies in the 1970s and early 1980s found that principals who were strong instructional leaders significantly influenced school performance. While this thesis predominately focuses on the relationship between principal, school curriculum officer (hence forth as SCO) and teacher, it focuses heavily on the role of the principalship in fostering the growing emphasis on multiple leadership approaches throughout the school. The specific purpose of this study is to explore how teacher leadership and the principalship nurture student learning. It highlights the professional culture which principals nurture to engage teachers in school improvement issues. The notion of teacher leadership potentially empowers teachers to exercise professional responsibility for student learning and promotes a focus on teacher professionalism. The literature illuminated several key themes, which formed the conceptual framework underpinning the research. These included school improvement, encouragement of learning communities, teacher commitment and motivation, changing roles of principals and promotion of teacher leadership. Given the purpose of this study it seemed fitting that the approach of the study should be predominantly interpretive and orchestrated through multiple site case study. The research results confirmed the findings of the literature in terms of leadership. The response of schools to improve student learning was strongly influenced by the principal and SCO who were able to articulate school vision and engage staff in meaningful whole school decision-making practices. This study concluded that the support of the principal for the role of the SCO was a major determiner of the SCO&#8217;s success in implementing school-wide pedagogical reform. The findings also affirmed the role of principals as being able to influence student learning through their interactions with class teachers. Furthermore it is essential such interactions are school wide, agreed upon and implemented via a close working relationship with the principal and the SCO. The findings also highlight that specific work conditions had an influence on the motivation and commitment of teachers to ongoing school reform.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational leadership</field><field name="subject">Instructional leadership</field><field name="subject">School principals</field><field name="subject">Teaching and learning</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp155.30052008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frequency of in-season strength and power training for rugby league</field><field name="creator">Masters, Haydn</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of different in-season strength and power training frequencies to strength and power performance over the course of a 22 week rugby league competition period. Twenty-eight male (n=28) participants, with both high and low strength pre-training status, were divided into three groups following a 15 week pre-season strength and power training programme. A four week periodised in-season strength and power training programme, with intensities ranging from 75-100%, was cycled for the 22 week competition season. Strength and power training was conducted one day.week(-1)  by the first high pre-training status group (HTFL, n=11), and two day.week(-1) by the second high pre-training status group (HTF2, n=9). The low pre-training status group (LTF1, n=8) performed the same strength and power training frequency and programme as HTF1. Training intensity (% 1RM) and volume (sets x repetitions) of in-season strength and power training sessions were standardised for both groups during each training week. Strength, power, and speed data were collected pre-season, and four times during the in-season period. No differences were found between HTF1 and HTF2 in performance variables throughout the 22-week in-season period. Both HTF1 and HTF2 displayed similar significant detraining effects in strength, power, and speed, regardless of in-season training frequency (p&lt;0.05). LTF1 showed no change from pre-season strength and power performance following 22 weeks of the competition period (p&lt;0.05). It was concluded that in-season strength and power training frequency may have a limited role in determining the success of the in-season strength and power training programme in highly trained footballers. The results of the present study suggest a number of factors other than in-season strength and power training frequency may affect in-season strength and power performance and detraining in high strength pre-training status athletes. The effect the start of a competition period has on dynamic athletic performance needs further investigation.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rugby League</field><field name="subject">Pre-training status</field><field name="subject">Pre-season strength</field><field name="subject">Power training programme</field><field name="subject">Power training frequency</field><field name="subject">In-season strength</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp8.25072005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contribution of Saltmarsh to Temperate Estuarine Fish in Southeast Australia</field><field name="creator">Mazumder, Debashish</field><field name="description">Saltmarsh is an important coastal habitat located in the littoral zone of estuaries. Australian saltmarsh area is decreasing due to agricultural and urban development and invasion by mangrove. The aim of the study was to assess the contribution made by saltmarsh as a habitat and a source of food items for fish. Three saltmarsh sites were studied, with Towra Point chosen as a site for detailed ecological study. When corrected for water volume, fish densities were found to be higher within the saltmarsh compared to the adjacent mangrove. Although the fish assemblages in saltmarshes differed significantly from mangroves the overall ratio between commercially and ecologically valuable species in these habitats are similar, a result suggesting the importance of temperate saltmarsh as habitat for economically important fish. Significant export of crab larva from saltmarsh (average crab larval abundance 2124.63 m-3 outgoing water) is a positive contribution to the estuarine food chain supplementing the nutritional requirements of estuarine fish. While the diet of the crabs producing this larvae seems dependant on the saltmarsh environment (given the contrasting isotopic signatures of Sesarma erythrodactyla in saltmarsh and mangrove, and the similarity of isotopic signatures in the saltmarsh for Sesarma erythrodactyla and Helograpsus haswellianus), the crabs do not seem to be dependent on any of the common species of saltmarsh plant, but rather depend on particulate organic matter (POM) derived from local and other sources. Crab larva are a prey item for many estuarine fish, including commercially important species, as evidenced by gut content analysis of fish visiting the saltmarsh flats during spring tides. The results strongly suggest that emphasis be given to ecosystembased management for an estuary rather than component (e.g., vegetation) based managed as defined by the Fisheries Management Act (1994) and the State Environmental Planning Policy 14.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian saltmarsh</field><field name="subject">Saltmarsh environments</field><field name="subject">South eastern Australian coastal habitats</field><field name="subject">Estuaries</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Estuarine fish</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp47.09042006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relational Person Within a Practical Theology of Health Care</field><field name="creator">McArdle, Patrick</field><field name="description">Aim: The aim of this thesis is to elaborate a theological understanding of health care at its most vulnerable point: the meaning and exercise of personhood itself. Personhood, as I develop the concept, is understood in relational terms. Through this exploration of the relational dimensions of the human person, I provide a conceptual framework in which health care is able to derive fresh vigour and inspiration. This approach accomplishes two things: it establishes a role for theological insights in the public discourse of health care; secondly, it demonstrates that theology is able to assist health care to better understand itself and renew itself. As an exercise in Practical Theology, the investigation is interdisciplinary in nature, drawing on insights from philosophy, health care and various dimensions of theology. Scope: Historically, the focus of theologically motivated contributions to health and medicine has been on ethical dilemmas that arise in clinical practice. In this thesis, however, the focus is on bringing theology and health care into dialogue in order to advance the conversation between the two disciplines. The thesis, therefore, has three elements that determine its scope. Firstly, advancing the place of the human person in health care theory and practice: hence, this thesis is an exercise in practical theology. Secondly, situating theology in a field of engagement with wider contemporary culture&#8212;especially the culture of health care&#8212;in a genuinely interdisciplinary manner. Thirdly, critiquing current theory and practice in health care, and reinvigorating the central meanings and values that inform and motivate health care. Conclusions: There are five substantial conclusions deriving from the research and argument of this thesis: Firstly, and the basis for other conclusions, the theology developed in the thesis argues that a relational model of the human person is indispensable to contemporary health care. Secondly, while relational personhood is not a panacea for all the dilemmas posed by modern health care, thinking about personhood in relational terms opens the possibility of a dialogical approach to ethical dilemmas in health care. Thirdly, relational personhood represents a fundamental shift in the discourse of health care and of theology. Fourthly, a focus on relationships inspires a priority for the vulnerable and gives rise to an ethic of responsibility. Fifthly, a practical theology of relational personhood can bring about a rapprochement between religious concerns and health care.As I note in the conclusion to the thesis: &#8220;These are not dramatic claims but they do have the capacity to transform both disciplines and to enable them to more adequately meet their own goals.&#8221;</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health care</field><field name="subject">Personhood</field><field name="subject">Practical theology</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp140.17052007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Ethical Implications of Incorporating Managed Care into the Australian Health Care Context</field><field name="creator">McCabe, Helen</field><field name="description">AIMS  Managed care is a market model of health care distribution, aspects of which are being incorporated into the Australian health care environment. Justifications for adopting managed care lie in purported claims to higher levels of efficiency and greater &#8216;consumer&#8217; choice. The purpose of this research, then, is to determine the ethical implications of adapting this particular administrative model to Australia&#8217;s health care system. In general, it is intended to provide ethical guidance for health care administrators and policy-makers, health care practitioners, patients and the wider community.  SCOPE  Managed care emerges as a product of the contemporary, neo-liberal market with which it is inextricably linked. In order to understand the nature of this concept, then, this research necessarily includes a limited account of the nature of the market in which managed care is situated and disseminated. While a more detailed examination of the neo-liberal market is worthy of a thesis in itself, this project attends, less ambitiously, to two general concerns. Firstly, against a background of various histories of health care distribution, it assesses the market&#8217;s propensity for upholding the moral requirements of health care distributive decision-making. This aspect of the analysis is informed by a framework for health care morality the construction of which accompanies an inquiry into the moral nature of health care, including a deliberation about rights-claims to health care and the proper means of its distribution. Secondly, by way of offering a precautionary tale, it examines the organisational structures and regulations by which its expansionary ambitions are promoted and realised.  CONCLUSIONS  As a market solution to the problem of administering health care resources, the pursuit of cost-control, if not actual profit, becomes the primary objective of health care activity under managed care. Hence, the moral purposes of health care provision, as pursued within the therapeutic relationship and expressed through the social provision of health care, are displaced by the economic purposes of the &#8216;free&#8217; market. Accordingly, the integrity of both health care practitioners and communities is corrupted.  At the same time, it is demonstrated that the claims of managed care proponents to higher levels of efficiency are largely unfounded; indeed, under managed care, health care costs have continued to rise. At the same time, levels of access to health care have deteriorated. These adverse outcomes of managed care are borne, most particularly, by poorer members of communities. Further, contrary to the claims of its proponents, choice as to the availability and kinds of health care services is diminished. Moreover, the competitive market in which managed care is situated has given rise to a plethora of bankruptcies, mergers and alliances in the United States where the market is now characterised by oligopoly and monopoly providers. In this way, a viable market in health care is largely disproved. Nonetheless, when protected within a non-market context and subject to the requirements of justice, a limited number of managed care techniques can assist Australia&#8217;s efforts to conserve the resources of health care. However, any more robust adoption of this concept would be ethically indefensible.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Managed health care model</field><field name="subject">Australian health care</field><field name="subject">Ethical guidance</field><field name="subject">Administering health care resources</field><field name="subject">Access to health care</field><field name="subject">Market research</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp48.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Principals&#8217; Understandings of Aspects of the Law Impacting on the Administration of Catholic Schools: some implications for leadership</field><field name="creator">McCann, Paul</field><field name="description">This study explored the interface between the leadership of Catholic schools and the legal framework of the social/cultural context of Australian Society. Specifically, the study investigated the legal issues impacting on Catholic schools, principals&#8217; understandings of these legal issues and the sources used in gaining these understandings. The congruency between these understandings and the current interpretations of areas of the law were also examined, along with the influence legal issues have on principals; in particular, their perceptions of how these legal issues relate to carrying out their leadership roles aligned with the characteristics and ethos of the Catholic school. In this overall context, the influence of a number of variables such as school complexity, location, and primary and secondary school environments was also examined. The study commenced with an examination of the development of Catholic schools within the Australian social/cultural context, an exploration of leadership as it relates to Catholic schools and a survey of the literature indicating the scope and nature of the legal matters impacting on schools within the Australian legal framework. To gather data relevant to the purposes of the study, a Survey Questionnaire was constructed and distributed to principals of all systemic Catholic schools administered by the Brisbane Catholic Education Centre. The quantitative and qualitative data provided via this instrument was supplemented and corroborated by information gathered through discussions, observations, and reference to documentation and records. The findings of the study confirmed that Catholic schools were involved with a wide range of legal issues, involvement being more pronounced in some areas than others, and like all legal issues within the Australian social/cultural context, those impacting on schools were subject to regular renewal and development. In relation to the latter, participants identified emerging areas of the law which were starting to have an impact on their schools. Principals&#8217; overall understandings of current interpretations of legal issues were not of a high standard. However, some understandings, particularly relating to statue law were more accurate than understandings of common law issues. Principals used a wide range of sources to gain legal understandings, and interactions with fellow principals and personnel within the Brisbane Catholic Education System who supported and supervised principals, featured prominently. However, access for principals to designated legal practitioners for advice on legal matters was a need revealed. Involvement of principals in formal and less formal professional learning experiences relating to legal matters was limited, and participation did not have a significant influence on developing more accurate understandings of legal issues. Nevertheless, the need for continued personal and professional learning with regard to legal issues was highlighted by this study, especially considering the continued renewal and development of the law, and the stress created by the lack of legal understandings. The findings indicated legal matters were having a large impact on Catholic schools; 90% of participants experienced stress associated with legal matters, and 70% saw this as an increasing phenomena. While a number of variables inter-relate to form a cumulative effect contributing to stress, participants ranked the most prominent source of stress as lack of legal knowledge. The impact of legal matters was not confined to addressing legal matters per se, but a constant threat of legalism overshadowing principals in their leadership roles. Overall, there was a high compatibility between the ethos of the Catholic school and the resolutions reached, and the process used in coming to a resolution of legal matters. However, participants were more confident in their perceptions of a high compatibility with the resolutions reached than with the processes used.No one variable examined, had an overall significant influence on the understandings, involvement and impact of legal issues on the leadership of Catholic schools. However, a number of significant relationships were identified with particular aspects of the study. Surprisingly, the study did not reveal a significant relationship between the length of time spent as a principal in a Catholic school and the accuracy of understandings of legal issues impacting on schools. It was suggested that the development of principals&#8217; understandings of legal issues could be closely related to the continued personal and professional learning and growth of leaders within Catholic schools, particularly within School Leadership Teams. Suggestions to support this growth and learning were offered as part of the overall development of leadership within Catholic schools.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic schools</field><field name="subject">Catholic school principals</field><field name="subject">Catholic school leadership</field><field name="subject">Law</field><field name="subject">Legal issues</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp129.17052007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Na&#239;ve and Yet Knowing: Young learners portray beliefs about mathematics and learning</field><field name="creator">McDonough, Andrea M.</field><field name="description">This is a report of an investigation of children&#8217;s beliefs about the nature of mathematics, the nature of learning and helping factors for learning mathematics. The study aimed to investigate whether beliefs held by eight learners of eight to nine years of age could be articulated and portrayed. It aimed also to develop procedures to facilitate this process, to portray children&#8217;s beliefs from their responses to the research procedures, to provide insights into possible complexities and subtleties of young learners&#8217; beliefs, to reflect upon the significance for the mathematics classroom of the insights gained, and to reflect upon the value of the procedures developed for the study.  The research took the form of individual case studies of four girls and four boys of eight to nine years of age from two schools in suburban Melbourne. Four children were teacher-perceived low achievers in mathematics and four were teacher-perceived high achievers in mathematics.  The children were each interviewed on ten occasions over a five-month period using thirty semi-structured, creative interviewing procedures that were developed or adapted for the study that included drawing, writing, discussing scenarios presented through photographs, video snippets and other children&#8217;s drawings, ordering of descriptors, and responding to questionnaires presented verbally. The interview data consisted of transcripts and artefacts. Some class administered tasks, lesson observations and interviews with the mathematics teachers provided background information.  Analysis of interview responses was undertaken through a criss-cross examination in which themes were drawn from each child&#8217;s data. Responses were not judged for correctness or for a match to any predetermined categories and the researcher sought to take a stance of neutrality to the phenomena under study.  The research suggests that teachers and others involved in the education of young learners of mathematics should know that: it is possible to gain insights into children&#8217;s beliefs about maths (the term used most commonly by the children), learning, and helping factors for learning maths; to gain insights into young children&#8217;s beliefs, it is important to have dialogue with the children to avoid making assumptions about their interpretations or meanings; the creative interviewing procedures developed for the present research are helpful as they can stimulate reflection and prompt conversation; young children&#8217;s beliefs can be complex, subtle, broad and deep; young children&#8217;s beliefs are individually constructed and differ from child to child; children may not see mathematics concepts in the same ways as their teachers and other adults; beliefs are sufficiently diverse and significant to affect the way children see the mathematics learning situation; although the beliefs of children of eight to nine years of age may, on the surface, appear simplistic and na&#239;ve, they are not necessarily so. Young learners are able to reflect on their own and others&#8217; experiences and often construct complex beliefs. There is a lot happening in the minds of these children.  The research suggests also that it is important that educators do not to make assumptions about: what children see as maths (or mathematics); what children see as learning; and what children see as helping factors for learning maths.  A key factor facilitating children&#8217;s reflection and expression was the range of visual, verbal, and text-based creative interviewing strategies developed for the present study. The individual procedures provided suitable prompts to allow young children to articulate or represent their beliefs. The semi-structured procedures, through which ideas were explored on multiple occasions, followed by theme-based, criss-cross analysis of interview transcripts and artefacts, resulted in rich and trustworthy portrayals of beliefs, increasing the validity of the findings.  The research provides the education community with insights into young children&#8217;s beliefs that are unlikely to emerge within the day to day activity of the classroom and, through the availability of the research procedures, facilitates further gaining of insights into beliefs either by classroom teachers or other researchers.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children&#8217;s beliefs</field><field name="subject">High achievers</field><field name="subject">Low achievers</field><field name="subject">Mathematics concepts</field><field name="subject">Mathematics learning</field><field name="subject">Mathematics teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp21.16082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How is Religious Leadership Understood and Practised by Principals in Catholic Secondary Schools in South Australia?</field><field name="creator">McEvoy, Francis Joseph</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the religious dimension of the role of the principal in the Catholic Secondary Schools of South Australia. The study is set in the context of a complex and changing environment. Society is becoming increasingly secular, and religious values are on the wane. The role of the principal has become progressively more encumbered by government regulation and policy and an increased level of accountability for a wide range of school outcomes, many of these outside the core purposes of the school (Fullan, 2003). In Catholic schools, the numbers of the professed religious men and women, traditionally the backbone of those schools, has declined dramatically in the last two decades and lay persons have taken over from members of religious congregations as principals in most Catholic Secondary Schools in South Australia This represents a paradigm shift in leadership in the Catholic schools. It has resulted in an increased focus from within both the Church and the Catholic Education System on the essential Catholic nature of those schools, and the role of the Principal in nurturing and managing this. The study found that principals had a deep sense of the importance of this dimension of their role, but that they felt a real need for more support and formation, especially in the scriptural and theological aspects of leadership. Most felt pressured by the &#8216;normal&#8217; routine of principalship, and were looking for ways to &#8216;make time&#8217; for reflection in order to better ground their actions and decisions in the core values of the schools, the System and the Church. As a result of this research, a series of recommendations are offered to Church and System authorities, to principals and to those aspiring to be principals in the Catholic Secondary Schools in South Australia. These relate to professional practice in such areas as defining the nature of the Catholic schools, and recognizing their particular charisms; developing leadership succession strategies and preparation courses for aspiring leaders; exploring alternative approaches to the principal selection process, and developing a mentoring program and professional support networks.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Religious Leadership</field><field name="subject">Catholic schools</field><field name="subject">Catholic school principals</field><field name="subject">Religion</field><field name="subject">Religious Leadership</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp125.25102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making &#8220;Magic&#8221;: an exploration of the relationship between teacher leadership and boys&#8217; academic motivation in the Year 8 classroom at a Catholic school</field><field name="creator">McGoran, Neil Alexander</field><field name="description">This research explored the understandings and perceptions of teacher leadership in the Year 8 classroom, as expressed by teachers and students at a Catholic school, and the relationship between this leadership and boys&#8217; academic motivation. The researcher assumed that the classroom is an organisation (Cheng, 1994) where all teachers, perhaps even unknowingly (Crowther, 1996), exercise leadership and, furthermore, that this leadership results in positively influencing boys&#8217; willingness to learn. The research was targeted at Year 8, the first year of high school in South Australia, because academic motivation is considered most problematic during and after transition into high school (Maehr &amp; Midgley, 1991). The research was interpretivist, with symbolic interactionism as the theoretical perspective. The methodology adopted was case study, and data were collected using: a) Focus group interviews with eight members of the Year 8 &#8216;core&#8217; teaching team on issues pertaining to teacher leadership in the classroom and how this positively influences boys&#8217; academic motivation. b) A survey questionnaire about academic motivation, distributed to thirty-nine specially identified Year 8 students. c) Interviews with five key Year 8 student informants about teacher leadership and its impact on boys&#8217; academic motivation. Data were analysed using a &#8220;general analytic strategy&#8221; (Yin, 1994, p.102), which included the adoption of a method of &#8220;successive approximation&#8221; (Neumann, 1997, p.427). Five categories of teacher leadership in the Year 8 classroom were identified: service; authenticity; transformation; empowerment; and community. The research also established that each category involves an array of qualities that help teacher leaders strengthen relationships in the classroom, and a set of actions that enable teacher leaders to help boys complete classroom tasks. Further, results indicate that by strengthening relationships and supporting boys to complete tasks, teacher leaders positively influence boys&#8217; academic motivation. In addition, the research presents a framework for understanding and discussing the relationship between teacher leadership and boys&#8217; academic motivation. This framework draws attention to the relational qualities and task specific strategies in each category of classroom leadership that positively influence boys&#8217; academic motivation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teacher leadership</field><field name="subject">Classroom leadership</field><field name="subject">Academic motivation</field><field name="subject">Catholic secondary schools</field><field name="subject">Year 8 boys</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp85.09042006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stories of Buoyancy and Despondency: five beginning teachers&#8217; experiences in their first year in the teaching profession</field><field name="creator">McKenzie, Meagan Louise</field><field name="description">This case study research explores the experiences of five beginning teachers within four Catholic secondary schools in Australia. The research employs a qualitative approach framed within an interpretative paradigm, drawing on perspectives of symbolic interaction to interpret interview and journal data. These perspectives are used, in conjunction with a conceptual framework derived from the relevant literature, to interpret the experiences of five new teachers against the relevant data. The literature typically investigates the stages of teacher development, where the first year is often seen by researchers as a survival year. Key literature themes include the development of self image and the impact school culture has on beginning teachers. There are two other features less often present in the literature but central in this research. One is the life history of the beginning teacher. A second, which is the major notion employed in this study, is that of professional identity and specifically how identity develops once the novice teacher is immersed within the school organisation. Each teacher was interviewed several times during their first year and each kept a journal. The discussion includes matters of comparison and contrast between the five teachers&#8217; experiences. The symbolic interactionist framework seeks to identify the meanings individuals construct of their experiences. These meanings are located from the journal and interview data gathered. Each text is examined both independently, in relation to other texts and in the light of the conceptual framework. A key procedure is to identify critical events which are then analysed and connections made to the experience of other teachers and literature themes. The key findings of the research include developing a new model for understanding the experience of beginning teachers. The research suggests that the current literature on beginning teachers is limited. It neglects beginning teacher individuality and in particular agency and competency and centrally the dynamic and complex interaction between culture and identity. This research seeks to add significantly to the beginning teacher literature.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Beginning teachers</field><field name="subject">Catholic secondary schools</field><field name="subject">Teacher development</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp97.29052006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The &#147;limit&#148; experience of senior high school students: A study across four catholic high schools</field><field name="creator">McQuillan, Paul</field><field name="description">The purpose of the research reported in this thesis is to investigate the occurrence and recognition of &#147;limit experience&#148; among some Catholic High School students in their final year at selected secondary colleges in Brisbane. &#147;Limit&#148; experience was defined as an experience that reveals a reality of life beyond the self, beyond the here and now. It may be recognition of our own fragility and vulnerability as much as a joyous awareness of a reality beyond our normal encounter with life.&#148; The research work of the Alistair Hardy Research Centre and of Hay (1987) in particular has centred on the question, asked in various ways: Have you ever been aware of, or influenced by, a presence or power, whether you call it God or not, which is different from your everyday life? The survey instrument for this research was designed to divorce questions on such experiences from the direct reference to the term &#147;religious&#148;, although individuals might indeed interpret them as &#147;religious&#148;. To approach the issue, an extensive open-ended survey was administered to senior high school students. It was designed first to determine the extent of recognition of such experiences among the students and second to examine whether factors such as home background, regular religious practice, type of school, subject choice or co-curricula activities may make a difference in enhancing the awareness of such experience. This research has also been designed to enable comparison with similar studies. Major research in Australia by Flynn (1975, 1985, 1993) highlighted the factors above as influencing student achievement. Flynn also made connections to religious practice and attitudes to church but not to religious experience as such. Robinson and Jackson (1987) had undertaken extensive research on religious experience in Great Britain that also has important parallels to this research. Some of the techniques of both studies and in some cases actual questions have formed part of this research instrument. This research has gone further than both studies by incorporating the Hay (1987) categorisation of types of religious experience to form the basis for direct questions on student experience. The data gathering, treatment and analysis focused on four catholic secondary schools in the Brisbane Archdiocese. While the research focus was by definition limited, and while the results have of necessity to be treated with some caution before wider generalisation, the outcomes of the research do illuminate some of the important issues identified in the literature. The results of the survey showed that over 90% of the respondents could affirm some association with a &#147;limit&#148; experience along the lines of the Hay (1987) framework. With significant strengthening of criteria to allow for meaningful statistical analysis, this reduced to 76% of respondents. Results for this smaller group were shown to be essentially independent of home background, type of school attended, co-curricula programs and level of religious practice. With the significant exception of religious education, their recognition of &#147;limit&#148; experience was also independent of subject choice. This last is in contrast to the earlier work of Robinson and Jackson (1987). Exploratory analyses of the data enabled comparisons to be made with a suggested framework for &#147;spiritual sensitivity&#148; and the context of &#147;relational consciousness&#148;, both of which were first proposed by Hay and Nye (1998). This suggests some possible directions for further research into adolescent spirituality. The exploratory analyses also highlight some of the conflict between the reality of these experiences for students and their experience of dissonance with institutional religion.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Limit experience</field><field name="subject">Senior high school students</field><field name="subject">Student experience</field><field name="subject">Student achievement</field><field name="subject">Religious experience</field><field name="subject">Adolescent spirituality</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp9.25072005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thinking and Acting: an exploration of Australian early childhood teachers&#8217; beliefs and practice regarding learning, teaching and religious education</field><field name="creator">Meehan, Catherine Jane</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to explore the beliefs and practice of early childhood teachers in Catholic schools in Australia. In particular, the research investigated the teachers&#8217; beliefs about teaching, learning and Religious Education. Also examined in this thesis was the classroom practice of early childhood teachers and the factors that impacted on their stated beliefs and translation into classroom practice. Whilst there are empirical studies that explore early childhood teachers&#8217; beliefs and practice, there were no studies which explore early childhood teachers&#8217; beliefs and practice with regard to learning, teaching and Religious Education in Australia. This study was conducted within both positivist and interpretivist paradigms, using a mixed methodological approach to data collection. Phase One was a large scale (n=540) use of a questionaire to ascertain teachers' beliefs. The Early Childhood Teachers' beliefs about learning, teaching and Religious Education questionaire was developed specifically for this study. Early childhood teachers from 6 states of Australian Catholic schools were surveyed using the Early Childhood Beliefs about Learning, Teaching and Religious Education Questionnaire. Following the quantitative analysis, four teachers were purposefully selected to develop rich, descriptive case studies. Classroom practice was observed and documented providing further insights into beliefs and practices with regard to Early Childhood and Religious Education. Analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data was conducted using three computer software packages including: SPSS, Leximancer and NVIVO. The analysis of data revealed both differences and similarities that exist between teachers&#8217; stated beliefs and classroom practice and in particular their pedagogy with regard to Religious Education Key findings of the research included a confirmation that early childhood teachers&#8217; in Catholic schools generally taught in accordance with their beliefs. It was highlighted specifically that a range of factors impact on teachers&#8217; practice, which both support and constrain their practice. Some of the implications for teachers, teacher educators, providers of professional development are delineated. There is evidence presented in the results that supports the hypothesis that teachers' beliefs do underpin their classroom practice and that there are factors that constrain or support teachers' in their efforts to teach according to their beliefs about learning and teaching. The study highlighted implications for Religious Education in the early years of schooling, for the continued professional development and curriculum development for Religious Education in the early years of schooling. In summary, this thesis examined the role of Early Childhood teachers&#8217; beliefs about learning, teaching and Religious Education and the relationship to classroom practice. It critically explored the impact that a range of factors have on teachers&#8217; ability to implement practice that was consistent with their stated beliefs</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="subject">Teaching</field><field name="subject">Early Childhood Teachers</field><field name="subject">Religious education</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp161.10062008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reimagining the Catholic School: an exploration of principals&#8217; responses to changing contexts of the contemporary catholic school</field><field name="creator">Mellor, Graeme J</field><field name="description">The focus of this research project was the changing perception amongst practising Catholic school principals of the nature and purpose of the contemporary Catholic school. This examination was set within the changing social, ecclesial and educational contexts within which the Catholic school has operated in the decades following the Second Vatican Council (1962&#8211;1965). The research which was conducted amongst principals in the Archdiocese of Brisbane, Australia, was focused by two research questions. These were:How do principals currently perceive the purpose of Catholic schools? How do they perceive Catholic schools changing? The review of the literature examined elements of the changing environment of the contemporary Catholic school. It also surveyed the ways in which that literature described the effects of changing social, ecclesial and educational contexts upon the sense of purpose amongst principals of Catholic schools. The demise of &#8220;inherited meanings&#8221; and the reconstruction or reimagining of a new meaning structure provided the conceptual template for the study. Since the study explores the perceptions of leaders concerning their schools in times of extensive and foundational contextual change, it involved an interpretive research design. An epistemological stance of constructionism was adopted because it acknowledges the impact which engagement with the research exerts upon participants&#8217; construction of meaning. An interpretivist theoretical perspective served to structure the research in a manner that was congruent with the philosophical foundations of the research questions. The employment of the research orientation of symbolic interactionism was appropriate because it holds that meaning and interpretation of phenomena are to be understood by listening to the voices and perspectives of the participants within a given context. A case study approach was utilised in the execution of the research design which allowed for flexible, systematic and continuing data collection, analysis and participant feedback. Data were collected through the use of personal, open-ended questionnaire, semistructured interviews, critical review interviews, focus groups and independent review and were analysed using constant comparative method. The research led to the conclusion that in the contemporary Catholic school, a high priority is given to the offering of a holistic educational experience to students. This, in turn, is predicated upon an anthropology which adopts a more unitive rather than dualistic view of the human person. This represents a significant conceptual movement within the period under study. A greater emphasis is also placed upon the evangelising role the Catholic school, which, in turn, acknowledges the increasingly secular environment within which it operates. At the same time, there is a strong, expressed belief amongst its leaders that the contemporary Catholic school offers an experience of a redemptive community in which its members can find acceptance, inclusion and a sense of the spiritual dimension of life which transcends the status of affiliation with the institutional Church.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic school principals</field><field name="subject">Change</field><field name="subject">Australian Catholic schools</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp114.25102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Burden of Care: Ageing in urban China and Japan: Gender, the family and the state</field><field name="creator">Miller, Elizabeth Jill</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how rapid demographic, social and economic changes are impacting on traditional care for the urban aged in China and Japan as both experience world record rates of ageing caused by greater longevity and lower birth rates.

Natural Law provides a person-centred ethic that draws on a number of human goods that emanate naturally from the human person and lead in practice to human flourishing. This theory empowers towards making ethical decisions in the interest of human persons. Aristotle explained the human being as a substantially existing entity with rational powers. By means of his form-matter scheme he handed on, by way of Boethius, to Aquinas, a ready model for the Christian belief in the dual nature of the human person as an ensouled body or embodied soul. Applying the new scientific method to the question of the human self David Hume concluded that he could neither prove nor disprove her existence. By so reasoning Hume indirectly pointed to the need for other disciplines than empirical science to explain the human person. Emmanuel Levinas has drawn on the metaphysical tradition to draw attention to the social and ethical nature of the human person as she leaves the trace of her passing through the face of the other person who is encountered with an ethical gravitas of absolute demand. The genesis of the human person most naturally begins at conception at which point and onwards the human embryo grows continuously through an internal, animating principle towards a full-grown adult person. The main conclusion is that biblical anthropology and metaphysical philosophy provide the needed structures and concepts to explain adequately the full meaning of the human person and to establish the moral right of the human person at every stage to respect and protection.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human person</field><field name="subject">Biblical anthropology</field><field name="subject">Metaphysical philosophy</field><field name="subject">Biomedicine</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp148.26072007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Latin Texted Motets of Guillaume de Machaut</field><field name="creator">Montefu, Jennette Lauren</field><field name="description">Guillaume de Machaut&#8217;s motets constitute a cycle. This study focuses upon Machaut&#8217;s six Latin texted motets and their influence upon these cyclical contexts. Former research into these motets has uncovered references to contemporary poetry, liturgical texts, literary sources, particular persons, and historical events. Through an examination of recent research into the cyclical nature of the motets it is possible to critically evaluate these hypotheses in the light of the past historical, codicological, liturgical, musical and poetic analysis of these works to create a rounded picture of each motet. In this way it was found that many of the previously researched aspects of the motets follow in line with recent theories surrounding motet grouping structures. In this way when placing these works within a mystical theological literary context their sacred nature, evident within the tenor chant fragments upon which many of them are built, becomes evident and a greater plan apparent. Beyond this, with an examination of Machaut&#8217;s life and the events which occurred in his lifetime the context for composition of the remaining motets is unearthed. Within these motets elements have now been identified which link them to Machaut&#8217;s canonries at both Saint Quentin and Reims as well as the events of the Hundred Years&#8217; War. In this way the deep connection between Machaut&#8217;s motets and all levels of his life is becoming increasingly apparent.  Through an examination of these six Latin texted motets it is found that a liturgical context is key to the analysis of all voices. This is apparent in the mere use of vocabulary idiomatic to the liturgy present within these texts. In this way the selection of words within motet 21 points to a Marian allusion and the apocalyptic, drawing motet 21 even closer in context to motets 22-23. This apocalyptic reference is also seen in specific words within in triplum text of motet 22. Furthermore, the Marian allusions discovered throughout these last three motets in their upper voices are apparent only with a close examination of the Salve Regina texts. In this way the influence and importance of liturgical context to the analysis of the motet has been extended to all voices.  This study has also uncovered allusions to other fourteenth century works in the analysis of Machaut&#8217;s motets. In the case of motet 9 a connection between its chant tenor and another from the Roman de Fauvel reveals a political context which brings an added richness to the interpretation of these texts. Furthermore, as with motets 18-19, it may be gleaned that as Machaut and Vitry were both canons at Saint Quentin that perhaps it was here and with these two motets that Machaut began his tutelage with the older master of the motet. These conclusions may be drawn by the striking similarities between Machaut&#8217;s works and those believed to have originated from within the Vitry circle.  In the course of this study there have been additions to evidence the necessity of looking to all aspects of Guillaume de Machaut&#8217;s motets in their analysis. This includes use of numerical symbolism in varying aspects as shown in motet 9 as well as a thorough exploration of Machaut&#8217;s use of vocabulary within his texts to find its literary, historical, motet, and liturgical allusions. The identification of these sources may either serve to reinforce or expand the context of the motet leading to a deeper understanding of its purpose within a group of motets or individually.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Guillaume de Machaut</field><field name="subject">Motets</field><field name="subject">Motet analysis</field><field name="subject">Motet grouping structures</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp37.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sing to the Lord a New Song: a Study of changing musical practices in the Presbyterian Church of Victoria, 1861-1901</field><field name="creator">Moore, Laurence James</field><field name="description">The latter half of the 19th century was a time of immense change in Presbyterianism worldwide in respect of the role of music in worship. Within this period the long tradition of unaccompanied congregational psalmody gave way to the introduction of hymnody, instrumental music (initially provided by harmoniums and later by pipe organs) and choral music in the form of anthems.  The Presbyterian Church of Victoria, formed in 1859 as a union of the Church of Scotland and the majority of the Free Presbyterian and the United Presbyterian churches and numerically the strongest branch of Presbyterianism in Australia, was to the forefront in embracing this tide of change.  Beginning in 1861with the proposal for the compilation of a colonial hymnbook, issues associated with musical repertoire and practice occupied a prominent place in discussions and decision making over the next 30 years. Between 1861 and 1901 hymnody was successfully introduced into church worship with the adoption of three hymnals in 1867, 1883 and 1898. Programs of music education were devised for the teaching of the new repertoire and for improving the standard of congregational singing. A hallmark tradition of Presbyterianism was overturned with the introduction of instruments into worship, initially as a support for congregational singing but in time as providers of purely instrumental music also. The profile of the choir changed dramatically.  Making extensive use of primary sources, this study aims to document the process of change in Victoria between 1861 and 1901, exploring the rationales underlying decisions taken and historical factors facilitating change. Musical developments in Victoria are viewed in the context of those elsewhere, especially Scotland and of general changes in aesthetic taste. The study concludes that the process of musical change shows the Presbyterian Church of Victoria to have been a forwardlooking and well-endowed institution with the confidence to take initiatives independent of Scottish control. It is also concluded that changes in musical practice within the worship of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria reflect developments taking place in other denominations and the changing aesthetic tastes of the Victorian era.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Presbyterian Church of Victoria</field><field name="subject">Australian church music history</field><field name="subject">Australian Presbyterianism</field><field name="subject">Musical practices</field><field name="subject">Role of music in worship</field><field name="subject">Music educaton</field><field name="subject">Victorian era</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp49.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Levinas, Von Balthasar and Trinitarian Praxis</field><field name="creator">Morrison, Glenn</field><field name="description">1. Aim   The thesis aims to explore Emmanuel Levinas&#8217; philosophy as a fertile resource for Christian theology. In this general context, we focus specifically on the way Levinas opens the possibility of a language of alterity, or radical &#8220;otherness&#8221;, in theology, in a manner which escapes the limitations of such categories as objectivity, presence and Being. Recent attempts to employ Levinas&#8217; philosophy for the benefit of Christian theology have hesitated to go beyond onto-theology. This thesis, however, aims to show how Levinas&#8217; philosophy opens up a style of thinking and suggests a vocabulary of expression that can serve Christian theology, especially by intensifying its sense of encounter with Christ and of the Other in him. Accordingly, the thesis will make use of a number of Levinasian notions to critique and complement the theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar. This will lead to the development of what we call a &#8220;prolegomenon to a Trinitarian praxis&#8221;.  2. Scope  The thesis firstly remarks on Christian theology&#8217;s discovery of Levinas&#8217; philosophy. We then go on to introducing three of the major influences of Levinas&#8217; philosophy, namely Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger and Franz Rosenzweig. This will be followed by an introduction to the life of von Balthasar. But the major part of the thesis will be made up of three extensive explorations.  The first introduces a number of key terms and concepts in Levinasian thought, taking into account their possible contribution to the theology of von Balthasar. Here we examine especially the notions of &#8220;otherness&#8221; and &#8220;passivity&#8221;.  The second exploration takes us into what might be called a recontextualisation of the major sections of von Balthasar&#8217;s theology (aesthetics, dramatics and logic) through Levinasian analysis. We will concentrate especially on von Balthasar&#8217;s treatment of Holy Saturday, the Resurrection, Trinitarian and Soteriological &#8220;Inversion&#8221;, and truth as participation.  The third exploratory exercise attempts to develop a prolegomenon to a Trinitarian praxis. Intrinsic to the very understanding of this Trinitarian praxis is the notion of alterity to such a degree that ethical transcendence is the very inspiration for theology if it is to go beyond the limits of objectivity, Being and presence. This prolegomenon will, therefore, contain an articulation of Trinitarian praxis in the context of ethical transcendence, eschatology and soteriology. To this end, we employ Levinas&#8217; ideas of passivity and otherness to critique von Balthasar&#8217;s eschatological conception of Christian existence and his soteriological understanding of the eucharist.   Because Levinas and von Balthasar have both used the writings of Husserl, Heidegger and Rosenzweig as sources, there will be abundant references to these writers at various junctures in this study. Likewise, the views of a number of Christian theologians who have been influenced by Levinas (Purcell, Ward, Barnes and Ford) will be critically examined.  3. Conclusions  The thesis concludes that, with the aid of Levinas&#8217; ideas, theology is offered the possibility of breaking out of the limits imposed by traditional notions of objectivity, Being and presence. In reaching such a conclusion, the thesis contests von Balthasar&#8217;s prioritising of the beautiful by resituating his use of analogical thought. In this context, our study suggests new ways of speaking of Holy Saturday and the Resurrection, in a non-phenomenal manner. It means developing a theology of Gift to understand the unity between Christ&#8217;s missio and processio. Here we highlight the deepest problem to be faced by a theo-logic as one of giving priority to the ethical over the ontological. In short, the thesis argues for a conception of Christian life that goes beyond the categories of ontology and experience. From what we have learned from Levinas, we propose a notion of Trinitarian praxis in which we come to God by way of ethical transcendence.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emmanuel Levina</field><field name="subject">Christian theology</field><field name="subject">Christian philosophy</field><field name="subject">Hans Urs von Balthasar</field><field name="subject">Trinitarian praxis</field><field name="subject">Eschatology</field><field name="subject">Soteriology</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp50.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Virtuous Nursing: More caring than science and more scientific than care</field><field name="creator">Morrison, Kristine</field><field name="description">Western nursing has been deeply influenced by Christianity and more latterly by the Nightingale ideal of the good nurse. Both views have, as their foundation, the belief that there is an objectively knowable good way to live. This belief presents problems to the modern nurse and has, in large part, been rejected. However, the rejection of this objective moral foundation for nursing has resulted in a crisis of confidence about the best way to articulate what it is to be a good nurse. Two new ways have emerged in recent times. A scientific approach to nursing has elevated the work of nursing to increasingly complex levels and resulted in significantly improved health outcomes for patients. This scientific approach to nursing has manifested itself in two ways. It has resulted in the development of theories of nursing based on psychological concepts. Parallel to this approach has been the tendency for nursing itself to become increasingly scientific and nurses in turn to be technologists. It was thought that nursing that was increasingly shaped in scientific terms would achieve professional status because it presented a scientifically verifiable knowledge base. At the same time, however, it has resulted in an understanding of what counts as being a good nurse being reduced to the nurse&#8217;s ability to perform tasks to a high level of clinical precision. Alternatively, nursing as a care-based activity has made a caring attitude the moral centre point of nursing. On this view objective standards of practice are regarded as secondary to the emotional care that the nurse brings to the patient. This belief arose in part because notions of the objectivity of science were challenged as ideological rather than the dispassionate form of knowledge that scientists claimed. It was fostered by the emergence and dominance of phenomenology and the influence of the feminist care ethic. There was also some anxiety about what had been lost in nursing by the embrace of science. In addition, the care ethic seemed to promise the possibility of defining nursing in its own terms in order to make nursing a distinct professional body. However, the demands of an ethic of care have proven elusive and, in the minds of some, unattainable. Given these criticisms of both these ways of thinking about nursing it is proposed that nursing think of itself as a virtues-based activity. Virtues theory incorporates within it the strengths of the two formerly mentioned ways of describing nursing without being subject to the limitations of each. Virtues such as love friendliness, compassion , courage and conscientiousness and the intellectual virtue of prudence or practical wisdom enable nurses to realise that goal in their practice. In this thesis virtue theory will be analysed and applied to nursing in the following way. Some Aristotelian concepts will be identified and their application t professional ethics by contemporary virtue theorists will be discussed. This involves and explication of some virtues that enhance shared conceptions of the practice of nursing. The significance of the good nurse in the shaping of good nursing practice will be considered alongside a reflection on the place of moral luck in nursing practice. It is argued that when nurses think of themselves as participating in a tradition of health care they find meaning in their work, Finally an understanding of nursing as a virtue-based activity clarifies good practice in such a way that nurses are able to elicit from it the qualities needed for its good practice.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="subject">Nursing theories</field><field name="subject">Nursing practice</field><field name="subject">Nursing ethics</field><field name="subject">Nursing care</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp69.25092005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neither &#8216;Less&#8217; Nor &#8216;Free&#8217;: A long-term view of couples&#8217; experiences and construction of involuntary childlessness</field><field name="creator">Moulet, Christine</field><field name="description">Childlessness, whether voluntary, involuntary or circumstantial, is becoming more common in our society. Statistically, greater numbers of Australian women and their Western counterparts will not bear children, thereby creating a larger quantum of couple families. The unwelcome socio-economic consequences have prompted research into reproductive intentions and behaviour to address barriers to reproduction. Studying those who are childless by &#8216;choice&#8217; or &#8216;infertile&#8217; provides important &#8216;reference points&#8217; but also creates a myopic view of the childless that often overlooks circumstantial factors or ignores the fluctuating nature of fertility intentions. Moreover, the medical discourse on infertility has conditioned our thinking and focused research on the psycho-social effects and impacts of assisted reproduction treatment and its failure. This has blurred and obscured the distinction between infertility and involuntary childlessness. Too often these are viewed through the same prism of grief and bereavement as a temporary but pervasive &#8216;crisis&#8217; and as impediments to adult development in the long term. The thesis provides new insights that challenge our conventional ways of thinking particularly its findings that although infertility and childlessness are related, they are separate phenomena. This has wide-ranging implications, especially for reformulating related clinical practice and counselling. There are several important considerations. One is the finding that the grief and bereavement model has its limitations beyond the infertility stage. Another is the theoretical reconstruction that the thesis provides of the grief that the involuntary childless experience. Finally, it makes a strong case for a more appropriate alternative which the thesis argues should be based on a growth-oriented model. The time point at which the information for this study was collected has rarely ever been used before. This adds significant weight to the findings and applications that potentially derive from them. The thesis also examines gender issues including the complexities in differential experiences, amongst and across gender categories. It builds on the existing body of knowledge on the gendered experience of involuntary childlessness and offers additional explanations for the variations found, around which clinical interventions should be framed. Overall, this study makes an important contribution to our knowledge and understanding by documenting the transitional process to involuntary childlessness in broader terms than has hitherto been the case. Contrary to conventional thinking related to adult development, the findings underscore the importance of viewing involuntary childlessness as an alternative developmental pathway.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Involuntary childlessness</field><field name="subject">Voluntary childlessness</field><field name="subject">Infertility</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp129.05022007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the Meaning and Function of Prayer for Children in Selected Primary Schools in Melbourne Australia</field><field name="creator">Mountain, Vivienne</field><field name="description">Prayer is a central element of all religions (Coleman, 1999; Engebretson, 1999). Alongside the sense of the theological importance of prayer there has been increased recognition of the psychological function and personal benefit of prayer for adults (Pargament, 1997). This thesis reports on research that investigated the theological and psychological perceptions of prayer held by children, shown through their understanding of the meaning and function of prayer.  This thesis contributes to the research field of children&#8217;s spirituality. As there is little existing research literature on children and prayer, the findings of this study provide valuable new understanding and propose new aspects of theory with implication for professionals involved in the education and the welfare of children. The research reported in this thesis represents the first Australian research on children&#8217;s perception of the meaning and function of prayer.  The choice of participants reflects the diverse philosophical and religious traditions found in the Australian, multifaith society. Semi-structured interviews were video-recorded with 60 participants from primary school Year Five (10-12 years). Five male and five female participants were selected from each of six different schools in the Melbourne metropolitan area. These were: the Catholic, Independent (Christian), Christian (Parent-Controlled or Community School), Jewish, Islamic and the Government schools. Students completed a drawing exercise and a written sentence completion exercise as part of the interview, and the three sources of data were analysed qualitatively using the method of Grounded Theory. The data was interpreted in the light of a detailed literature review on the nature and function of prayer as part of children&#8217;s spirituality. The review also examined relevant sections of the literature of religious education and literature on contemporary Australian life.  This study has provided Australian data on the meaning and function of prayer for children as part of children&#8217;s spirituality. Considerable agreement has been observed through the data, between children educated in a variety of school systems which embraced different philosophical and faith traditions. In the multicultural Australian community said to be secularized, prayer for these children has been shown as a valued aspect of life. The personal experiences of prayer for many were seen to be associated with the community of faith to which the participants belonged, and for others, prayer was learnt eclectically and practised in a private individualistic manner. All participants indicated that they had prayed and all contributed ideas about prayer through the interviews. All participants perceived prayer to function as an aid in life. Prayer was used by participants at significant moments in their life, and the words or thoughts in prayer helped to clarify and articulate deep feelings. Eight elements of theory (in accord with the literature on Grounded Theory ) have been generated through this research which are presented as recommendations for professionals engaged in religious education and student welfare.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children&#8217;s spirituality</field><field name="subject">Prayer</field><field name="subject">Victorian Primary schools</field><field name="subject">Multifaith society</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp51.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Comparison of the Stanford Model Chronic Disease Self Management Program with Pulmonary Rehabilitation on Health Outcomes for People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in the Northern and Western Suburbs of Melbourne</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Maria Clare</field><field name="description">Previous researchers have identified that participation in a pulmonary rehabilitation program improves health outcomes yet, continuation in a weekly maintenance program yielded mixed results. Self-management programs have had reported use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A meta analysis has identified that no self-management program had evaluated the effect of this type of intervention on the functional status of the participant with COPD. Reduced functional status is well reported as an indicator of disease progression in COPD. Adjuvant therapies for people with COPD need to demonstrate an effect in this domain. The Stanford model chronic disease self-management program (CDSMP) had been reported as a program that may optimise the health of people with chronic health conditions. However, its utility has not been formally evaluated for people with COPD. There have not been any reports of a comparison of the Stanford model CDSMP with pulmonary rehabilitation via a randomised controlled study in COPD. Aim: To compare and evaluate the health outcomes from participation in nurse ledwellness-promoting interventions conducted in the ambulatory care setting of a metropolitan hospital. Participants were randomised to either a six-week behavioural intervention: the Stanford model CDSMP or, a six-week pulmonary rehabilitation program and results compared to usual care (a historical control group). The efficacy of the interventions was measured at week seven and repeated at week 26 and 52. Following the week seven evaluation, the pulmonary rehabilitation program participants were rerandomised to usual care or, weekly maintenance pulmonary rehabilitation for 18 weeks and, followed up until the study completion at week 52.Little is reported about the costs of care for people with COPD in Australia. This study prospectively evaluated the costs of the interventions and health resource for the 52 weeks and undertook a cost utility analysis. Methods: Walking tests (The Incremental Shuttle Walking Test) and questionnaires asking participants about their health related quality of life, mood status, dyspnoea and self efficacy were assessed prior to randomisation to either six week intervention and repeated at weeks 7, 26 and 52. The implementation of these adjuvant therapies enabled all costs associated with the interventions to be prospectively examined and compared. Results: During the two years of recruitment 252 people (54% males) with a mean age 71 years (SD 11, range 39-93 years) were referred to the study. Student&#8217;s ttests identified that there were no statistically significant differences (P=0.16) between all those referred by age and gender as compared to all those admitted to Hospital A with an exacerbation of COPD. Ninety-seven people (51% male) with a mean age of 68 years (SD 9, range 39-87 years) agreed to participate in the study. Follow up in the study continued for 12 months following enrolment with only a modest level of attrition by week seven (3%) and week 52 (25%). Following the six-week interventions, both the pulmonary rehabilitation and CDSMP groups recorded statistically significant increases in functional capacity, self-efficacy and health related quality of life.Functional performance was additionally evaluated in the intervention arms with participants wearing pedometers for the six-week period of the interventions. There were no statistically significant differences between steps per week (P=0.15) and kilometres per week (P=0.17) walked between these two groups in functional performance. The Spearman rho statistic identified no statistically significant relationship between functional performance and the severity of COPD (rs (33) = 0.19, P = 0.26). No significant correlation between functional capacity and functional performance was identified (rs (32) = 0.19, P = 0.29). This suggests that other factors contribute to daily functional performance. The largest cost of care for people with COPD has been reported to be unplanned admissions due to an exacerbation of COPD.In this study there were no statistically significant differences between the three intervention groups in the prospective measurement of ambulatory care visits, Emergency Department presentations and admissions to hospital. The calculation of costs illuminated the costs of care in COPD are greater than the population norm. In addition, maintenance pulmonary rehabilitation generated a greater quality adjusted life year (QALY) than a six-week program. Despite the strength of the participants preferences (as measured by the QALY) for maintenance PRP, there were no significant differences in use of hospital resources throughout the study period by the three intervention groups, which suggests some degree of equivalence.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stanford Model Chronic Disease Self-Management Program</field><field name="subject">Pulmonary disease</field><field name="subject">Disease management</field><field name="subject">Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programs</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp165.22072008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ADHD, a Social Construct?  The Experience of families who have a child diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</field><field name="creator">Neophytou, Koula</field><field name="description">The diagnosis of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has increased over the last few years in Australia. ADHD is currently understood largely through a medical perspective, and in that context, the treatment recommended is stimulant medication. ADHD is a mental health label given to children who exhibit challenging behaviour. These children are diagnosed according to the categories stated in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM) &#8211; IV.  To date, there is no medical test children can undertake to show that they &#8216;have&#8217; ADHD. This research focuses on an alternative view of ADHD. Focussing upon families&#8217; experience of ADHD, and the medicalisation of children&#8217;s behaviour, it argues that behaviour is socially influenced and constructed.  It is because insufficient attention has been given to the family experience and the social implications of ADHD, that the child is often seen as &#8216;the problem&#8217;. The gap in our understanding of ADHD is situated in our understanding of the broader social context. To challenge this I will explore perceptions of the &#8216;good child&#8217;, &#8216;good mothers&#8217; and the social consequences of inappropriate behaviour.  Each family was interviewed five times every three months over a two-year period. Their stories and experiences are presented in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</field><field name="subject">ADHD</field><field name="subject">Child behaviour</field><field name="subject">Challenging behaviour</field><field name="subject">Family experience of ADHD</field><field name="subject">Medicalisation of child behaviour</field><field name="subject">Social construction</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp52.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring Pastoral Leadership in the Context of an Australian Chinese Congregational Church</field><field name="creator">Ng, King Hung</field><field name="description">The study is an exploration of pastoral leadership from the perspectives of members of the congregation within an Australian Chinese congregational church. The congregational form of church government is one of the governing structures within the Protestant churches. This kind of church operates under a democratic voting system in which each member of the congregation has an equal voice regarding church administration. Most Australian Chinese congregational churches consist of different generations of Chinese Christians. Research indicates that Chinese Australians&#8217; length of residence in Australia is closely linked to their identification with Australian culture. As such, the values, beliefs and attitudes of different generations of Chinese Christians might be different as a result of acculturation. These generational differences will in turn affect the decision making processes of church administration and the approaches to pastoral leadership of the senior pastor. In the past, issues of pastoral leadership have mainly been discussed from theological perspectives. Nowadays, studies of pastoral leadership have been more varied. However, there is still relatively little scholarly empirical research concerning pastoral leadership in a congregational church setting, especially from an intergenerational perspective. In this study, four dimensions of pastoral leadership are identified, namely the personal, organisational, religious and cultural dimensions. The epistemology and theoretical perspective governing the research study is constructionism and interpretivism respectively. Case study has been employed as the methodology. The strategies of data collection include questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, direct observation and document analysis. Rich data is analysed by using the framework of Spencer, Ritchie and O&#8217;Connor (2003). The findings of the research revealed differing perceptions among different generations of Australian-Chinese Christians about the pastoral leadership of the senior pastor within an Australian Chinese congregational church. Differences in the perceptions about the pastoral leadership of the senior pastor were also found between groups of lay leaders and church members. Results indicated that a variety of leadership approaches were used by church pastors when they were dealing with different generations of Australian-Chinese Christians in the church. The findings identified the personal characteristics of the senior pastor as the most influential factor in the pastor&#8217;s leadership effectiveness, with the organisational, religious and cultural factors also perceived to influence the leadership effectiveness of the senior pastor within the research context. The research presents a conceptual framework for the exploration of pastoral leadership which may be useful for further research. This framework draws attention to the four dimensions of pastoral leadership, namely the personal, organisational, religious and cultural dimensions. The research findings suggest that attention given to these dimensions may enhance both the leadership of church pastors and the growth and development of churches in similar contexts.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pastoral leadership</field><field name="subject">Australian Chinese Congregational Church</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp146.280806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Theory of Informed Consent in Medicine: problems and prospects for improvement</field><field name="creator">Nieuwkamp, Garry Anthony Aloysius</field><field name="description">Practice and law around informed consent in healthcare have undergone a revolution for the better over recent decades. However the way we obtain informed consent remains problematic and is imbued with irreducible but not ineliminable uncertainty. The reasons for this uncertainty are varied. The uncertainty is partly due to the conceptual opacity of important core concepts. The complexity of communication in clinical encounters is another. The role of autonomy, and the changing nature of the clinician patient relationship, have also contributed to this uncertainty remaining. This thesis is not a panacea for these difficulties. However there have been two quite profound revolutions in healthcare over the last decade or so, namely, the introduction of evidence-based medicine into clinical decision making, and the institutionalization of clinical governance and the application of quality improvement philosophy. I have examined ways in which these two &#8220;movements&#8221; can help in reducing some of the uncertainty in the practice of informed consent.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Healthcare Practice</field><field name="subject">Healthcare Law</field><field name="subject">Patient Clinician Relationship</field><field name="subject">Informed consent</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp166.22072008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Call Above Duty: The Portrayal of the South Pacific Missionary in Children's Literature 1800 &#8211; 1935</field><field name="creator">Nolan, John</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to examine the portrayal of the South Pacific missionary in children's literature published between 1800 and 1935. It examines how hagiographic literature was used to suggest to young readers that the missionary was both an emissary of Western civilisation and the incarnation of Gospel values. It seeks to document the nexus between contemporary anthropologica1 thought, colonialism and religious beliefs which underpinned the views and values presented to the child reader.The thesis examines the years 1800 to 1935 as this period was characterised by intense public interest in the exploration of the region and gave rise to the greatest volume of publications for children featuring the South Pacific missionary. The thesis analyses biographies published for children of the more famous missionaries, including John Williams, James Chalmers, John Paton and Coleridge Patteson. Attention is also given to the missionary in fictional literature and adventure stories, in particular the popular writings of R. M. Ballantyne (most notably The Coral Island). Comparisons arc made with the depiction of the missionary in children's literature using other locations, specifically Africa and China. The thesis also examines how women were portrayed, the connections between trade and missionary activity and the cultural bias evident in the portrayal of indigenous people and their societies. The thesis concludes that the portrayal of the South Pacific missionary between 1800 - 1935 was designed to enhance the status of the missionary by depicting them as being superior to secular heroes such as Captain Cook. By drawing on the imagery of the medieval knight and through the trope of 'Muscular Christianity' the missionary was depicted as having the courage of the explorer, the wisdom of a leader, the nature of a gentleman and the faith of a martyr. The indigenous people were infantilized and the trope of cannibalism was utilised to dehumanise them. Western style housing, clothing, literacy, work ethics and technology were advocated as indicators of the superiority of Europeans, while their adoption by indigenous converts separated them from the 'heathen' of their race. This 'superiority' of Western culture was attributed to the influence of Christianity and the Bible in particular, The missionary was shown as not only redeeming the indigenous people from sin through the revelation of the Gospel, but also as being their friend and protector who gave them the benefits of European living. In particular the 'medicine man' or spiritual leader of the indigenous reIigion was demonised and his influence and position assumed by the missionary who often formed a political alliance with the social leader, or Chief. The presence of the missionary was often further legitimised through the enthusiastic testimony of converts and indigenous teachers' pleading for more missionaries to come to the region. Other Europeans, such as traders and beachcombers, were denigrated as exploiting the islanders and their actions were often condemned as being worse than the 'savages. ' The publications sourced and studied were all Protestant in origin, suggesting a lack of children's Catholic material on missionary endeavour in the region. Similar to the traders, the Catholics were also denounced as interfering with and complicating the task of conversion and redemption. The role of the European female as wife of the missionary was minimised and they were usually relegated to the minor role of passive assistant to the ever-adventurous male. The publications were a vehicle for inculcating the religious and social beliefs of a triumphant Western society and for encouraging children to support the missions. either through their own vocation or through the giving and collecting of money. While they ostensibly promoted Christianity and the activities of Missionary Societies by paying homage to the faith and valour of the missionary, undoubtedly they also justified to the young reader the European cultural dominance and colonialism of the era.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Christian missionaries</field><field name="subject">Children&#8217;s literature</field><field name="subject">South Pacific</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp1.24082006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leading Educational Change in Primary Teacher Education: a Papua New Guinea study</field><field name="creator">Nongkas, Catherine Matmadar</field><field name="description">Papua New Guinea gained its independence from Australia in 1975. However, as a developing nation, PNG has continued to depend on external assistance for its development programs. Extensive foreign aid has been expended primarily to enhance the quality of education. To explore the issue of foreign aid and its impact on PNG as a postcolonial society, the dependency and postcolonial theories were adopted to guide the discussion. The theorist Beeby argues that in order to improve the quality of education, the level of general education and training of teachers in developing countries must be raised. This has occurred in PNG but it has not significantly enhanced the quality of education. Consequently, the issue explored concerns the type of educational change occurring in PNG primary teachers&#8217; colleges (PTCs) and its leadership. Globalization processes were adopted to guide the exploration of the education reform and its impact on the quality of education in primary teacher education in PNG. The following questions focused the content of the study:1. What is the quality of education being experienced in the Catholic Primary Teachers&#8217; Colleges? 2. What are the lecturers&#8217;, students&#8217;, and recent graduates&#8217; perceptions of the recent Primary and Secondary Teacher Education Project innovations occurring in the teachers&#8217; colleges? 3. How is the curriculum in the teachers&#8217; colleges perceived by the lecturers, students and recent graduates? 4. How is leadership demonstrated in the three Catholic Primary Teachers&#8217; Colleges? The epistemological framework of the research was constructionism adopting an interpretivist approach. The specific interpretivist perspective employed was symbolic interactionism because symbolic interactionism places emphasis on the importance of understanding, interpretation and meaning. A case study approach was adopted as the methodology for this research because of the nature of the research purpose. This study involved a total of 166 participants consisting of staff and students from the three Catholic primary teachers&#8217; colleges, representatives from the Catholic Church, National Department of Education (NDOE), Primary and Secondary Teacher Education Project (PASTEP) and other education officers. The data was gathered through a variety of methods including in-depth interviews, participant observation, focus groups, and documentary analysis. The major conclusions that emerged from this study revealed that educational change in primary teacher education has been implemented. However, the study concluded that the quality of leadership demonstrated to lead the educational change was disappointing. Inadequate leadership at the administration and curriculum levels had a negative influence on the quality of education. Achieving quality education was also hampered by inadequate funding, scarcity of resources and inappropriate infrastructure in all the institutions. The two-year trimester program has improved access and quantity but at the expense of quality. To assist primary teacher education implement the reform agenda, foreign aid was required. PASTEP was introduced and the contribution made by PASTEP was substantial. However, the study concluded that some of the strategies adopted by PASTEP to conduct its programs were questionable because there was evidence of hegemonic and colonial practices found among some of its workforce. In accepting foreign aid projects, PNG needs to establish strategies to ensure equitable partnerships with all stakeholders for sustainable development in education. In this respect, the findings of this study may serve as a guide for future decisions about educational leadership, curriculum innovation, donor funding agencies and policy generation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic primary teacher education</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp167.23072008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Belonging: the case of immigrants and the Australian Catholic Church</field><field name="creator">Noseda, Mary</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to ascertain the extent and nature of belonging to the Australian Catholic Church as experienced by immigrants. This experience of belonging was ascertained through the quantitative study of the National Church Life Survey of 2001 and to a lesser extent the Catholic Church Life Survey of 1996. Both surveys were conducted with attenders at a particular Sunday Eucharist and hence measured the experiences only of Catholics who attend Church. This quantitative study was complemented with a qualitative study of a small group of Vietnamese Catholics who were members of a particular parish. The importance of belonging to a religious tradition is that it provides an aspect of an individual&#8217;s identity. Identity is many-faceted and formed and reformed in the context of belonging, whether that belonging is to people such as family or to groups of people such as fellow members of a religious tradition. In the process of migration and settlement, the set of primary groups to which an individual belongs is at best disrupted and at worst, lost. Belonging to a religious tradition may provide a constancy of belonging in the immigrant&#8217;s life when all other aspects of belonging are being renegotiated during settlement in the host country. In the case of the Catholic Church in Australia, there has been some debate about whether or not the Church has been welcoming of immigrants but little testing of immigrants&#8217; experience of being welcomed and enabled to belong to the Church. The National Church Life Survey provided a unique opportunity to examine the extent and nature of belonging as experienced by immigrant Catholics. Since all respondents to the survey were asked their birthplace, comparisons could readily be made between the experiences of Australian-born Catholics and those Catholics who were born elsewhere. Since nearly 3,000 respondents completed surveys in Italian or Vietnamese, comparisons could also be made between these respondents and those who responded to the survey in English. Finally, comparisons were made between the small group of Vietnamese parishioners who engaged in the qualitative research, and other groups of Catholics. The comparisons were made between all the groups on the issue of belonging. In the survey there was a particular question that asked respondents about their experience of belonging, but there were other questions that indicated the nature of belonging of respondents, and these were used in the analysis. The results of the analyses show that on almost all measures, immigrants belong to the Church to a greater extent than Australian-born Catholics. Immigrants attend Sunday Eucharist in greater proportion than Australian born Catholics. Immigrant Catholics participated more in devotional activities, they reported a greater degree of satisfaction with their faith life and they hold more orthodox beliefs than Australian-born Catholics. However, they did participate less in parish roles and groups than did the Australian-born Catholics. Whilst it may be concluded that this participation is limited because of the barrier of language, the results of this research indicate that this is not the only barrier to participation. Even those immigrants who responded to the English language survey did not participate in parish roles and groups to the extent that Australian-born Catholics did. Further research may be able to ascertain whether cultural barriers outside the scope of this work determine the level of participation of immigrants. This research concludes that since the Second World War, Catholic immigrants have &#8216;done the work&#8217; of belonging to the Australian Catholic Church. They have done this despite the &#8216;benign neglect&#8217; of the Church itself and they represent in fact the Church&#8217;s &#8216;most Catholic&#8217; members.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Catholic Church</field><field name="subject">Immigrants</field><field name="subject">Membership</field><field name="subject">National Church Life Survey</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp101.04092006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploration of the Impact of Principal Leadership Behaviour on School Culture</field><field name="creator">Numkanisorn, Nicholas Phiranant</field><field name="description">Thailand is entering into a new phase of educational administration under the new National Education Act of 1999 which requires all educational institutions to have internal and external quality assurance in order to ensure improvement of educational quality and standards at all levels (Section 47). This means that all educational institutions, especially in the private sector, have to undergo many changes, including changes in administration, teaching and learning processes, methods of evaluation and professional development programs.  The current study focused specifically on the transformational leadership behaviour of principals on school culture. Culture is considered to be a key factor in determining whether school improvement is possible (Deal &amp; Peterson, 1999). The study was conducted in two phases: quantitative and a qualitative, and carried out in the secondary schools of the Brothers of St. Gabriel, in Thailand.  In the quantitative phase, the researcher used two instruments, namely the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ, Short form) developed by Bass (2000) to measure the leadership behaviour of principals, and the School Culture Survey developed by Gruenert (1998) to measure school culture. The results from the quantitative study were used to select a school for the second phase of the study that was carried out using a qualitative approach.  The quantitative findings provided descriptive evidence that transformational leadership existed in the schools of the Brothers of St. Gabriel, in Thailand and the dominant culture of the Gabrieltie schools was Professional Development. In addition, the findings also revealed that there was a significant relationship between leadership behaviour and school culture. In the second phase, the leadership behaviour of the selected principal was interpreted based on transformational leadership applied in a school setting. This process was outlined by Leithwood (1996) as frame of reference to identify a pattern of leadership behaviour of the selected principal. The findings revealed that the selected principal exercised the qualities of transformational leadership to some extent. Some qualities were missing and some were practised to a moderate degree.  The study helps provide guidance and direction to principals who wish to exercise their leadership in a more appropriate and relevant way particularly in a context of change.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">School prinicpals</field><field name="subject">Transformational leadership</field><field name="subject">Leadership behaviour</field><field name="subject">Educational leadership</field><field name="subject">School culture</field><field name="subject">Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire</field><field name="subject">School Culture Survey</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp53.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploration of the Perceptions and Experiences of Leadership by Teachers and their Opportunities for Leadership Development</field><field name="creator">O&#8217;Brien, Patricia Anne</field><field name="description">Leadership in schools is equated principally with those who hold formal or designated positions of leadership. However, the general leadership literature asserts that leadership in the post-corporate world of the organisation is not solely position-based, nor does it belong to any one person. Rather, leadership is shared and collaborative, is distributive and multi-dimensional, and is open to all members of an organisation. This study explored the perceptions and experiences of leadership by teachers and their opportunities for leadership development, in the context of the study of the Catholic school. A key assumption that underpinned the study was that teachers, by virtue of their professional practice and professional learning, exercise leadership. It was argued in the study that the educational philosophy of a Catholic school provides a suitable context for teachers to exercise leadership. The conceptual framework for the study was derived from an exploration of the research literature which focused on the general field of leadership, educational leadership and the genre of teacher leadership. The empirical study involved qualitative inquiry situated within an interpretative paradigm and oriented to providing in-depth and detailed descriptions and interpretations of the phenomenon of leadership. Data were gathered through four focus group interviews conducted with teachers in two Catholic schools in the Archdiocese of Melbourne, Australia. A fifth focus group interview was conducted with an &#8216;expert&#8217; group of teachers to verify a first summary of the findings. Data were analysed through an iterative process of data reduction, data display and verification. The data produced rich descriptions of leadership as perceived and experienced by teachers and were displayed in key themes within the framework of the research questions. The findings of the study revealed that teachers in the sample had well-developed understandings of leadership, of the nature of leadership in a Catholic school, and of their personal, interpersonal and professional capacity to exercise leadership in their professional practice and professional learning. However, these conceptual understandings did not always translate into practice. Leadership by teachers and leadership development of teachers were hindered by a number of factors, namely, a perceived lack of identity of teaching as a profession; the association of leadership with formal leadership structures within the school, and limited access to professional learning programs. The recommendations arising from the study have implications for system and school leaders and for policymakers and practitioners alike. In particular, the development of policy and practice that articulates the multi-dimensional perspective of leadership, and the leadership and professional role of teachers within this perspective, are highlighted. In light of the study&#8217;s findings, future research relating to the area of teacher leadership is recommended. Although the genre, teacher leadership, is well established in educational literature, there has been limited empirical research undertaken in this field in the Australian education context. This study makes a small but significant contribution to the ongoing development of knowledge in the field.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational leadership</field><field name="subject">Teacher leadership</field><field name="subject">Leadership development</field><field name="subject">Catholic schools</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp86.25092005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the Characteristics of Effective Professional Learning and Training Programs: Perceptions of teachers, principals and training personnel within Catholic Education in Melbourne</field><field name="creator">O&#8217;Brien, Robert Patrick</field><field name="description">The main aim of this thesis centred on what made effective professional development programs. As a particular case study data was collected on those programs sponsored by the Melbourne Catholic Education Office. Teachers from three schools in the North Western Metropolitan Zone of Melbourne, Australia, the principals from the three participating schools and training staff from the Catholic Education Office in Melbourne became the subjects of the study. The data collected from questionnaires was analysed in order to ascertain whether there were any common trends as to what the teachers thought was needed in effective professional development programs. The interviews with the participating principals and training staff were taped and later analysed in order to determine what they believed was the purpose of professional development and whether the programs currently being offered were effective. In addition, a list of characteristics of effective professional development was developed from the relevant research literature.  The analysis of the above data was used to develop a model of effective professional development. The design of this model is cyclical. A main characteristic of the model promotes the reflection by both the participants and the training providers on what has occurred during the program and this process of reflection contributes in later development of programs in similar areas. It was also concluded that the needs and expectations from professional development of teachers and principals were different to what has been expected in past research projects. Both the teachers and principals expected that they would not be solely immersed in theory or in activities that may be used in the classroom. Instead they hoped to gain a knowledge of activities that are based on theory and develop an understanding of how these activities may be used and how they will assist in student learning. Hence, the link between the theory and its application was believed by teachers and principals to be of primary importance in professional development in order to maintain high teaching practices and in turn result in improved student learning.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Professional development programs</field><field name="subject">Melbourne Catholic Education Office</field><field name="subject">Melbourne schools</field><field name="subject">Professional development model</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp54.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of the Learning Technology Coordinator in the Professional Development of Teachers as they Integrate Learning Technologies into Classroom Practice</field><field name="creator">O&#8217;Donnell, Margaret M.</field><field name="description">This research study investigated the professional development of teachers as they integrate learning technologies into classroom practice. In particular, the study was concerned with the specific role of the learning technology coordinator in this professional development process.  The views of classroom teachers were sought concerning factors in their professional development which they found useful together with the relevance of the role of the learning technology coordinator. So too, the views of the learning technology coordinators and principals were sought regarding effective professional development as teachers integrate learning technologies into classroom practice. Two processes were used to ascertain these views. Focus groups and interviews were conducted at the LaTTiCE (Learning and Teaching Technologies in Catholic Education) and Navigator schools. The Navigator and LaTTiCE school were specially funded pilot schools for the integration of learning technologies into classrooms. These technology rich schools provided detailed data from a specific group of people. A survey was also sent to randomly selected primary schools in Melbourne to see if similar responses would be gained from the general population of schools less privileged in terms of learning technologies and the associated professional development.  Analysis of this data led to some important insights related to the professional development of teachers as they integrate learning technologies into classroom practice and to the specific role of the learning technology coordinator in this process. This study found that the main reason why teachers integrated learning technologies into classroom practice was to benefit their students and to improve their own skill levels. The important factors in the professional development of teachers integrating technology were that it was collaborative, embedded in practice, ongoing over time, had the support of the principal and was supported by a learning technology coordinator. This study focused on the role of the learning technology coordinator and found that the most important aspect of this role was related to the professional development of teachers and the coordination of the school&#8217;s technology program. These findings led to recommendations that priority be given to funding at a system level for a school based learning technology coordinator to be appointed in each primary school and that principals provide for this coordinator to focus on the professional development of teachers integrating technology into classroom practice.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Professional development</field><field name="subject">Teachers</field><field name="subject">Learning technologies</field><field name="subject">Learning technology coordinator</field><field name="subject">Classroom practice</field><field name="subject">Navigator and LaTTiCE</field><field name="subject">Learning and Teaching Technologies in Catholic Education (LaTTiCE)</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp23.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploration of How Nurses Construct their Leadership Role During the Provision of Health Care</field><field name="creator">Osborne, Yvonne Therese</field><field name="description">This research explores how registered nurses constructed their leadership role during the provision of health care services in acute care, adult hospitals in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. As health care organizations change to meet the demands of the twenty first century, nurses in Australia are coming to realize there is a dissonance between what they perceive to be the relevance of their work and the perception of the relevance of nurses&#8217; work by others in the health care system. Consequently, nurses&#8217; contributions to health care services are not recognized. The literature highlights that one way to address this problem is to articulate the various leadership roles contemporary nurses are asked to undertake. This is the aim of this thesis. This research seeks to illuminate the role of the nurse within changing health care systems by making clear the nature of their work through the perspectives of leadership. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to explore how nurses have undertaken leadership initiatives in their role as health care providers within contemporary health care organisations. The literature review generated following research questions: 1. How do nurses describe leadership within their health care organisations? 2. How do nurses experience leadership within their health care team? 3. How do nurses construct their leadership role whilst providing health careservices? In order to legitimate its findings this study aimed to provide a clear theoretical framework. In order to gain a clear understanding of the personal experiences and meanings of the participants, the theoretical framework for this study was underpinned by the interpretive philosophies the epistemological framework of constructionism and the theoretical perspective of symbolic interactionism. The methodology of case study enabled an empirical investigation of a contemporary nursing phenomenon, leadership wherein the researcher was able to pose questions to those nurses from whom most could be learned. Data were collected through two stages. In stage one, the exploratory stage data was collected through three focus group interviews. Stage two aided deeper exploration of the nurses&#8217; leadership constructs with data obtained through one-to-one interviews. Analysis of the data enabled the development of a model of nurse leadership. Participants identified that their leadership was constructed through three perspectives of Self as Leader, Self and Others and Self in Action. The findings contrast the nurses&#8217; unique leadership constructs to those of health care organisations, highlight the lack of acknowledgment for nurse leadership within health care teams, and demonstrate how the nurses&#8217; leadership constructs influence their decision to act in the provision of patient care. This study concludes that as the nurses come to realise traditional leadership models are incompatible with their goal of achieving patient centred care, they have developed a different style of leadership to achieve their vision of patient centred care. Finally this study offers recommendations in the areas of nursing practice, nursing education and research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Registered nurses</field><field name="subject">Nurse leadership</field><field name="subject">Leadership role</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp102.11092006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thomas Merton and The Towers of Babel</field><field name="creator">O&#8217;Sullivan, Colleen Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis will examine intensively &#8220;The Tower of Babel: A Morality&#8221; a significant work of Thomas Merton, a major spiritual writer of the 20th Century, entitled. In order to explore this play three other works which impacted significantly on the development of the drama will also be examined. These three works are: A poem also called &#8220;Tower of Babel&#8221;; a second poem entitled &#8220;A Responsory&#8221; and a musical work titled &#8220;The Tower of Babel: An Oratorio&#8221;. Even though Victor Kramer, a Merton scholar, noted the significance of the Morality, the existing literature has all but ignored the impact of &#8220;The Oratorio&#8221; and the drama. Until this author requested a copy of &#8220;The Oratorio&#8221; from the Merton Centre in Louisville, Kentucky the work had been known by name only and had never been analysed. Yet this work was a major development from the poem &#8220;A Responsory&#8221; and led to the creation of the Morality Play. This work argues that &#8220;A Morality&#8221; was pivotal in contributing to personal and spiritual change in Merton as well as developing a greater depth of social understanding in him. It will also argue that the work contained the seeds of future Merton writings. Writing the drama moved Merton towards a contemplative maturity based on communion not simply community. While many studies have alluded to the play none of them have studied it with this particular focus. This new focus is the discovery of the ways Merton attempted to resolve the dilemma he experienced between the paths of monk and poet and how, in doing so, he created for spiritual seekers a fresh inner significance for the Babel story. This work is opening up new ground for an understanding of the importance of Merton&#8217;s insights in the contemporary world. The methods used in this thesis are: 1. Contextualising, that is establishing the historical, social, spiritual and literary framework in which the poems and plays were written, and 2. Literary analysis. Part A of the thesis examines the monastic, spiritual, social, literary and academic contexts which brought Merton to the moment of writing the Morality. Part B is organised chronologically and is an intensive analysis of the poems, the Oratorio and the Morality Play. Part C identifies the seeds of future growth contained within the Morality play and points to some of the directions in which these seeds developed in later Merton works.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">The Tower of Babel; A Morality</field><field name="subject">Thomas Merton</field><field name="subject">Literary analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp115.25102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">No Pain, No Gain: an investigation of the concept of persistence in learning in a Taiwanese college program</field><field name="creator">Pan, Li-Chi</field><field name="description">This study aims to explore, describe and thus understand the phenomenon of two-year college program students&#8217; persistence within the context of Taiwanese culture and tradition; and to develop and provide a framework or patterns for understanding working adult students&#8217; persistence for educators. By using a hermeneutic phenomenology approach, the persistence in learning experiences of specific participants was explored based on semi-structured interviews in two exploratory studies linked by a comprehensive literature review. The researcher&#8217;s own experience of persistence was also included as part of the study. The data were analysed by using thematic analysis and narrative construction. Findings reveal that participants persist with the support of enabling factors and application of coping strategies despite barriers. The intertwined relationship between the value placed on qualifications, identity recognition and views of persistence contribute to the concept of persistence. This concept develops through schemas emerging from the data: historical effect, cultural reproduction and identity construction. Under the influence of Taiwanese tradition and culture, this concept of persistence immerses into the participants&#8217; knowledge ground and standpoints to understand the world they live in. The concept is defined as &#8216;no pain, no gain&#8217; and includes dimensions of insisting on the right to study, fulfilment of dreams, being a role model of good study habits, personal growth and enrichment. Participants construct both social identity as graduates and personal identity as progressive, competent and respected individuals. The findings of this study benefit both theory and practice. Theoretical implications and recommendations include providing insights into the concept of persistence through development of schema that underpin factors contributing to working adult students&#8217; persistence in Taiwan. Practical implications and recommendations include insights drawn from the perspective of Taiwanese culture and tradition to understand the experience of two-year college program working adult students to persist in a high level learning environment, which informs educators to see themselves as important sources of support and information, and thus able to assist their students to cope with the barriers to their learning, or to extend persistence outside their formal educational settings and maintain their learning.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult education</field><field name="subject">Taiwanese culture and tradition</field><field name="subject">Learning experiences</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp116.25102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Body Image and Dieting Behaviours: a Study of athletes and non-athletes</field><field name="creator">Peterson, Vanessa Margaret</field><field name="description">Research has shown that elite female athletes competing in competitive sports may experience weight consciousness and face demands to conform to unrealistic standards of body weight. The purpose of this research was to investigate body image and dieting behaviours in adolescent female athletes and non-athletes. A self-reporting questionnaire was administered to 60 athletes aged between 13-16 years derived from eight different sporting populations, and a control group consisting of 60 non-athletes or inactive individuals aged between 13-16 years. Two major areas relating to weight and eating behaviours were examined: disordered eating and distorted body image. Other variables under investigation included current attempts at weight loss, level of acceptance of thin female stereotypes promoted by the media, reasons for dieting, and perception of one&#8217;s own body image.  Results indicated that the majority of the athletes displayed a positive body image and were generally happy with their overall body shape. This group was less likely to employ weight loss behaviours. However, the non-athletes were more likely to display distorted body image and distorted eating behaviours. Consistent with the cultural expectations of thinness, large proportions of the non-athletes wished to lose weight, even though their actual weight (i.e. Body Mass Index) was normal or underweight. Weight concerns in the non-athlete group related more to attaining a media driven &#8220;ideal&#8221; of femininity. The weight concerns recorded amongst a small number of athletes were related more to improving sporting performance. Although no clinically diagnosed cases of eating disorders were recorded, eating behaviours, weight reduction practices and body image beliefs indicated that the adolescent female non-athletes may be at risk of developing disordered eating and body image problems.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Body image</field><field name="subject">Dieting behaviour</field><field name="subject">Eating behaviour</field><field name="subject">Eating disorders</field><field name="subject">Weight</field><field name="subject">Adolescent female athletes</field><field name="subject">Adolescent female non-athletes</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp38.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organizational, Professional and Personal Roles in an Era of Change: the Case of the Catholic clergy</field><field name="creator">Power, Georja Jane</field><field name="description">The effects of transformations in the cultural context on the structures of the Catholic organization and consequently on the identity and role of priests is explored in this research. The way these transformations affect clergy relationships with the church, diocesan authorities and parishioners, and ultimately the psychological wellbeing of priests, are investigated in the light of recent research and literature. Quantitative and qualitative data from the Catholic Church Life Surveys (CCLS) of 1996 and 2001 is analyzed, together with qualitative data generated through semi-structured interviews. The theoretical underpinning for the interpretation of changing clerical identity and roles and the relationship dynamics is personality theory, including a neoanalytic model (Horney, 1950), and a psychodynamic approach using an iconic reading of Freud (Cozzens, 2000). Social identity theory (Haslam, 2001), and Fowler&#8217;s (1996) theory of faith development also contribute to the theoretical framework. The NEO-FFI personality factors (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992) are used as covariates throughout the analysis.  Four major themes are addressed in this research. First, ambiguities in the identity and role of clergy brought about through structural changes in the organization following the Second Vatican Council. Second, cultural changes which challenged the institutional hierarchical structure of the church and some of its theological and ecclesiological positions. Third, the contribution to satisfaction with ministry and personal wellbeing made by priests&#8217; relationships with the organization, diocesan authorities, and parishioners, as well as intimacy with colleagues and friends. Finally, the impact of psychodynamic factors on the spiritual and psychological dimensions of priestly life.  It was found that although the sacramental role of priests remains largely intact, their identity as religious and spiritual leaders is under challenge through greater participation in parish life by educated and theologically trained lay people. It is argued that the competence to appropriately express leadership, preach meaningful homilies and promote spiritual growth in parishioners rests on the attainment of mature psychological development and continued faith and spiritual formation. Analysis of personality factors showed that sound organizational and structural supports are needed to assist priests in their personal and professional lives. Over half the priests in the present study were found to be vulnerable to emotional and psychological distress, while others had strong resources to cope with increased ambiguity and complexity in ministry. A review of literature suggests that cultural changes over the last 30 years compound the effects of Vatican II, particularly the patriarchal hierarchical structure of the organisation and teachings on sexual morality that are under pressure from changing attitudes by both clergy and laity. Quantitative and qualitative analyses showed that there is little support by priests for the obligation of celibacy, the successful attainment of which demands a high level of mature psychosexual development. It was argued that without a strong clerical commitment to celibacy, education and training programs currently being implemented in seminaries would be largely ineffectual. Key factors impacting on the relationships of priests with parishioners were found to be first, a decline in the authority of priests, second, the revelations of sexual abuse by priests, and third, the difficulty numbers of clergy have with establishing and maintaining close, intimate relationships. The NEO-FFI factors Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness were found to be significant predictors in the quality of relationships between priests and parishioners, with 30% of clergy experiencing difficulty in these relationships. It was argued that maturity in spiritual, psychological, and psychosexual development was found to impact significantly on clergy personal wellbeing and professional competence, which in turn contributes to satisfaction with ministry.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic clergy</field><field name="subject">Priestly life</field><field name="subject">Celibacy</field><field name="subject">Clerical identity</field><field name="subject">Cultural change</field><field name="subject">Personality theory</field><field name="subject">Catholic organisation</field><field name="subject">Catholic Church Life Surveys</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp39.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Russian Orthodox Presence In Australia: The History of a Church told from recently opened archives and previously unpublished sources</field><field name="creator">Protopopov, Michael Alex</field><field name="description">The Russian Orthodox community is a relatively small and little known group in Australian society, however, the history of the Russian presence in Australia goes back to 1809. As the Russian community includes a number of groups, both Christian and non-Christian, it would not be feasible to undertake a complete review of all aspects of the community and consequently, this work limits itself in scope to the Russian Orthodox community. The thesis broadly chronicles the development of the Russian community as it struggles to become a viable partner in Australia&#8217;s multicultural society. Many never before published documents have been researched and hitherto closed archives in Russia have been accessed. To facilitate this research the author travelled to Russia, the United States and a number of European centres to study the archives of pre-Soviet Russian communities. Furthermore, the archives and publications of the Australian and New Zealand Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church have been used extensively. The thesis notes the development of Australian-Russian relations as contacts with Imperial Russian naval and scientific ships visiting the colonies increase during the 1800&#8217;s and traces this relationship into the twentieth century. With the appearance of a Russian community in the nineteenth century, attempts were made to establish the Russian Orthodox Church on Australian soil. However, this did not eventuate until the arrival of a number of groups of Russian refugees after the Revolution of 1917 and the Civil War (1918-1922). As a consequence of Australia&#8217;s &#8220;Populate or Perish&#8221; policy following the Second World War, the numbers of Russian and other Orthodox Slavic displaced persons arriving in this country grew to such an extent that the Russian Church was able to establish a diocese in Australia, and later in New Zealand. The thesis then divides the history of the Russian Orthodox presence into chapters dealing with the administrative epochs of each of the ruling bishops. This has proven to be a suitable matrix for study as each period has its own distinct personalities and issues. The successes, tribulations and challengers of the Church in Australia are chronicled up to the end of the twentieth century. However, a further chapter deals with the issue of the Church&#8217;s prospects in Australia and its relevance to future generations of Russian Orthodox people. As the history of the Russians in this country has received little attention in the past, this work gives a broad spectrum of the issues, people and events associated with the Russian community and society at large, whilst opening up new opportunities for further research.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Russian Orthodox Church in Australia</field><field name="subject">Russian Orthodox Community</field><field name="subject">Multiculturalism in Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian Russian relations</field><field name="subject">Russian immigration</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp87.09042006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Emergence of a Dominant Discourse Associated with School Programs: A Study of CLaSS</field><field name="creator">Rafferty, John Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis takes the position that once schools and school systems adopt reform programs,the values and meanings inherent in those programs create and perpetuate powerful forms of discourse that characterize the projects themselves, evoke loyalty and commitment and may ultimately serve to stifle other voices. The thesis examines several primary schools involved with the Children&#8217;s Literacy Success Strategy (CLaSS) in the Victorian Catholic Education system. It is an analysis of the dominant discourse created and perpetuated by the CLaSS documentation, education officers, principals, and classroom teachers. The study characterizes the nature of that discourse and explores its effects on the work of teachers, principals, and on school improvement. The analysis proposed in no way disparages CLaSS itself, nor does it seek to judge its objectives, or offer a critique of the specific methods used to improve literacy. Rather, it advocates that genuine school improvement requires one to step outside the circle of discourse engendered by reform programs such as CLaSS which promote a &#8216;single minded&#8217; discourse about themselves and that which the school is attempting. When programs such as CLaSS are introduced into schools as part of a sector wide reform agenda they are expected to provide proof of improved results in order to justify the financial investment associated with the initiative. The values and beliefs of the reform initiative are expected to be accepted by school systems usually without question (Apple, 2000). The effects of such unquestioned acceptance of particular values are examined in the current study. As schools are expected to accept programs like CLaSS in their entirety, it is not possible within the rhetoric of CLaSS to select what elements of the program to adopt. This appears to lead to the creation and perpetuation of an &#8216;officially&#8217; sanctioned way of thinking about school reform and teaching. Proponents of reform programs may argue that such sanctions are a necessary feature of whole school reform programs and provide a focus for energy and activism, for winning people&#8217;s support, and for conveying to parents and the wider school community a sense of purposeful action and rational planning. However, these dominant discourses seem to obscure other perspectives, disallowing critique and preventing reflective discourse and analysis. Indeed, this study holds that genuine school reform requires schools to break out of the imprisonment of dominant discourses and remain open to critical reflection</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic schools</field><field name="subject">Children&#8217;s Literacy Success Strategy</field><field name="subject">Literacy</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp168.23072008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Grounded Theory Study of Midwives&#8217; Decision-Making: use of continuous electronic foetal monitoring on low risk labouring women</field><field name="creator">Rattray, Janene</field><field name="description">Many midwives continue to use Continuous Electronic Foetal Monitoring (CEFM) on low risk women in labour, despite overwhelming clinical evidence that it is unnecessary. The use of CEFM on low risk labouring women has been linked to rising rates of medical intervention during labour and birth with no improvement in long term neonatal outcomes. This study examined the decision-making processes of midwives who used CEFM on low risk labouring women. Whilst a number of previous studies have examined various aspects of CEFM, none specific to midwives&#8217; decision-making and CEFM on low risk labouring women. This study contributes to the literature in this specific area. The theoretical origins of Symbolic Interactionism and Grounded Theory (GT) methods underpin this study. SI, a sociological theory that emphasises meaning in human interactions and behaviours is used in this study to focus on the behaviours and interactions of five midwives&#8217;when deciding to use CEFM on low risk labouring women. Primary data were collected by conducting unstructured interviews and systematic analysis was undertaken using GT methods to generate a substantive theory of: Midwives&#8217; CEFM decision-making despite evidence based guidelines. The midwives made the decision that led to CEFM at two key points in the woman&#8217;s labour care. Firstly, during the initial assessment of the woman and foetus, some midwives decided to use a baseline CTG rather than intermittent auscultation (IA). Secondly, following initial assessment, the midwives made an individualised assessment and decided whether to use CEFM as the method to monitor the foetus during labour. Trust was identified as the core variable, having a profound effect on the midwives&#8217; decision-making at these two points. Another significant factor that impacted on decision-making was staff workload. Recommendations relating to these findings promote that labouring women be central and intimately involved in decisions about foetal monitoring. Workplace reforms, such as the introduction of midwifery led models of care for women within a community setting are recommended to address professional trust and workload issues. Through the implementation of these recommendations it is expected that midwives will embrace the notion of woman centred care and that the unnecessary use of CEFM on low risk labouring women will be reduced.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="subject">Continuous Electronic Foetal Monitoring</field><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp141.17052007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Participation in School-Facilitated Community Service Programmes on Students&#8217; Self-Esteem, Sense of Community Engagement and Attitudes to Christianity.</field><field name="creator">Reed, Luke Terrence</field><field name="description">Increasingly, student orientated service outreach programmes (community service) are being incorporated into the broad curriculum of Australian High Schools. The assumption made is that such programmes have tangible benefits for students, the community and the schools themselves. Schools that operate out of a Christian paradigm have the added incentive of seeking to assist students give personal expression to religious commitment through the service of others. This study tests the assumption that participation in community service or service outreach activities has positive benefits for the students involved. It explores the effect that student involvement in school-facilitated community service programmes has on three personal domains; self-esteem, sense of engagement with community, and attitude to Christianity. This is a quantitative study utilising a questionnaire instrument to collect data from participants. The questionnaire is a compilation of three pre-existing and previously validated instruments, each of which focus on one of the three research areas. Combined, they provide 74 items which are answered using a Likert scale with response choices ranging along a six point continuum from &#8216;strongly disagree&#8217; to &#8216;strongly agree&#8217;. The sample consists of a total of 225 participants drawn from students across years 10 to 12 from five Catholic High Schools in the Brisbane metropolitan area. All of these schools have single sex enrolment. Male and female participants are equally represented in the sample. In total, 80% of the sample participated in their school&#8217;s community service/service outreach programme. Information related to students&#8217; community service involvement, the type of service undertaken, the duration of such service, and prior community service experience, was also collected from participants. No treatment is being introduced or manipulated in this study; rather, the research examines &#8216;between-participant&#8217; and &#8216;within-sample&#8217; differences associated with students&#8217; participation (or non-participation) in existing community service/service outreach programmes in their schools. As such, the research is ex post factor in nature. Initial confirmatory factor analysis is undertaken to validate the integrity of the combined instrument. This is followed by a Cronbach&#8217;s alpha reliability study of the 12 component scales of the combined instrument; the results of which prove to be consistent with those previously reported. In subsequent analysis of the data, significant correlations are identified between six pairs of dependent variables. With statistical significance set at the 95% level, MANOVA is then utilised to determine the effect of a number of factors on scale scores. In addition to the primary focus on the effect that participation/non-participation in school community service programmes has on student selfesteem, engagement with community and attitude to Christianity, other influencing conditions explored include; type of community service, duration of community service, prior community service involvement, and gender. The principal finding of this research is that a statistically significant relationship is evident only between students&#8217; participation in school-facilitated community service programmes and their attitude to social justice. Attitude to social justice is a constitutive element of the larger construct, &#8216;sense of engagement with community&#8217;. Analysis of the data reveals no significant association between community service participation and either self-esteem nor attitude to Christianity. The paper concludes with a discussion of the findings in the light of the earlier review of relevant literature.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community service programmes</field><field name="subject">Catholic secondary schools</field><field name="subject">Self-esteem</field><field name="subject">Community engagement</field><field name="subject">Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp142.17052007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Emotional Congruence of Experience and Bodily Change</field><field name="creator">Reeder, Matthew</field><field name="description">This study examined the association of the experience of emotion and somatic changes. The study compared reported somatic changes generally experienced when anxious with the actual association of the experience of emotion and somatic changes as measured during a specific event. Emotions were measured as both general negative emotion as well as specific emotions: anger, disgust, fear, sadness and shame. Participants were volunteers from a Victorian university who agreed to watch a video depicting the dramatisation of child abuse. Throughout the video, participants indicated their experience of emotion. Measures were also taken throughout the procedure of facial expression and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). In order to examine emotional-congruence, subjects were divided into three groups. These groups were divided according to the congruence of subjects&#8217; experienced emotion with autonomic changes and facial expressivity. Groups were divided separately for each of the emotion types. Where there was little difference between the reported experience of emotion and that, which would have been expected from the observed somatic changes, the subject was deemed to be in the Congruent Group. Subjects whose reported experience of emotion was greater or less than would be expected from observed somatic changes were allocated to the Over-reporter and Under-Reporter Groups respectively. This data was then compared to participants&#8217; reports of the number of somatic symptoms usually experienced when anxious. It was found that participants who under-report the experience of general negative-emotion compared with their observed somatic changes (both GSR and facial expressivity) had lower trait-somatic-anxiety (reported fewer somatic symptoms usually experienced when anxious). There was no significant difference between the Congruent Group and Over-Reporter Group. The Under-Reporter Groups had significantly lower trait-somatic-anxiety than the Congruent Group when emotional-congruence was defined by fear and GSR, anger and GSR and sadness and facial expressivity. The actual association of shame and disgust with either somatic change, sadness with autonomic change and anger and fear with facial expressivity was unrelated to the number of somatic symptoms reported to be usually experienced when anxious. The results supported the idea that subjective reports of the number of somatic symptoms reported to be usually experienced when anxious reflect the actual association of somatic change and experience, but with limitations. The actual association of experience of fear with autonomic change seems to reflect the number of somatic symptoms reported to be usually experienced when anxious more than other emotions. Further for those for whom the experience of anger and negative-emotion has a greater association with somatic change, there was a greater number of somatic symptoms reported to be usually experienced when anxious. This would suggest that some people have a greater association of some experiences of emotion and somatic change. Furthermore, while there is an association between reported somatic changes generally experienced when anxious with the actual association of the experience of emotion and somatic changes as measured during a specific event, this was dependant on the association of the emotion types rather than being generalised for all emotions.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Somatic changes</field><field name="subject">Emotion</field><field name="subject">Galvanic Skin Response GSR</field><field name="subject">Autonomic changes</field><field name="subject">Facial expressivity</field><field name="subject">Anxiety</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp10.09042006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Church First Called Christian: the Melkite Church of Antioch</field><field name="creator">Reeves, Elizabeth Ann</field><field name="description">The Catholic Church is made up of many church communities of different rites, with the main classifications being the Roman rites and the Eastern rites of the Catholic Church. With the influx of migrants especially since the Second World War there has been growth in Australia, in the number of Catholics belonging to the many Eastern rites including Byzantine Catholics, Coptic Catholics and Chaldean Catholics. The Second Vatican Council documents encouraged members of the Catholic Church of the Latin traditions to know and understand the rich traditions of the Easterners so that the full manifestation of the catholicity of the Church and full knowledge of its divinely revealed heritage are preserved. One can ask how familiar are Catholics of the Roman rites with the beliefs, practices, liturgy, devotions and historical development of the other rites in the Catholic Church? The aim of this thesis is to give understanding about the Melkite Catholic Church in Australia. It takes the reader on a journey from Antioch in Syria to Australia in the third millennium, showing that the Melkites trace their roots to Antioch where believers were first called Christians. This thesis elaborates on who the Melkites are by firstly looking at the origins of this church community and thereby establishing the authenticity of this church community since it was established by the apostles and their co-workers, with the apostles being empowered by the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. The thesis enumerates the key aspects of the early church at Antioch including theology, liturgy and the structure of the church, with these findings being foundational for the Melkite Church in Australia today. The thesis describes worship in the Melkite Church with emphasis on the development of this worship especially for the sacraments of Baptism, Chrismation and the Eucharist. It explains important ritual, symbols, architecture and artwork and concluded that these express the key beliefs of this church community. The fundamental dogmas in the Melkite Church are the teachings on the Holy Trinity and the Incarnation. The thesis elaborates on these dogmas explaining how they were important in the early church at Antioch and how understanding of them was developed by important theologians revered in the Melkite Church, in previous eras and today. The Christian faith is a living faith. In writing this thesis the importance of Tradition for God&#8217;s revelation to His holy people is emphasised. In its study of the sacraments of Baptism, Chrismation and the Eucharist, the thesis was able to show that the celebration of these sacraments was linked to the early church at Antioch. It especially looked at what was happening at the time of St John Chrysostom at Constantinople. This time frame saw the beginning of the development of the Byzantine Rite. There is elaboration on the link between the Byzantine rite (the rite of the Melkites today) and the Antiochene liturgy. As well the thesis expounded on the understanding of the three fold ministry of bishop, priest and deacon at Antioch and the importance of the ordained ministry today. It concluded that the four sacraments discussed above were foundational in the early church and are essential in worship in the Melkite Church today. The thesis explained important details about the sacraments of Marriage, Penance and the Anointing of the Sick. It especially explained the development of the Sacrament of Penance. The thesis acknowledges the validity of all rites in the Catholic Church and concluded that encouragement must be given for the preservation of the various rites in the Church. This is important for the Eastern Church communities as they contain a rich heritage, which is an integral part of the Church of Christ. An important conclusion was that the development of the church at Antioch must be understood in the light of Tradition the living and lived faith, which passes on all that the church believes and celebrates in its worship of the Holy Trinity. The Melkite Church of Antioch was first called Christian.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Melkite Catholic Church</field><field name="subject">Eastern Rite</field><field name="subject">Melkite Church in Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp147.26072007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Are Graduate Nurses Satisfied with Graduate Nurse Programs?</field><field name="creator">Reeves, Julie</field><field name="description">The transition from student nurse to Registered Nurse Grade 1 is a difficult journey for many graduates. New graduates experience issues related to reality shock, socialisation, confidence and the theory practice gap. It is well recognised that graduates require extensive support and development throughout this very difficult time. In Victoria graduate nurse programs are a recognised vessel to deliver this support. Quality graduate programs which meet the satisfaction of graduate nurses are required to provide effective support. The implications of minimal support are enormous and can lead to graduates leaving the profession. There is much in the literature suggesting the importance of each of the varied components of graduate programs however there is minimal comparisons made between various programs. As a result it was difficult to measure the qualities of programs. The purpose of this study was to explore and compare various graduate nurse programs and identify whether the programs were satisfying the needs of graduate nurses. An exploratory descriptive design was utilised and a written questionnaire was employed to gain data. The findings of this research indicated that the delivery of graduate nurse programs within this study were not consistent in content and quality. Overall graduates were satisfied with their graduate nurse program although they identified there were areas which required improvement. This project has suggested that the analysis of graduate nurse satisfaction is vital in identifying quality programs that retain graduates. It is essential that ongoing evaluation of programs are completed by graduate nurses to ensure they are satisfying their needs and thus retaining them within the nursing profession</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nurse education</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp170.28072008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Phenomenon of Problematic School-Related Absenteeism</field><field name="creator">Rennie, Robert Wylie</field><field name="description">This research was concerned with the phenomenon of problematic school-related absenteeism (PSRA) within the Victorian secondary school system with particular reference to middle schooling.

Whilst the condition only occurs in 2% of the general school population, more interestingly the problem accounts for about 8% of clinically referred children (Burke &amp; Silverman, 1987). This study focuses on the school refusal of a young adolescent male. This thesis has examined the degree to which school refusal can be minimised through employing a whole school approach underpinned by effective pastoral care (WSNPC intervention program).  The research questions were as follows:  To investigate the effects the WSNPC intervention program has on the: minimisation of school refusal; replacement of the motherlfigurehead in the mother-child relationship relative to separation anxiety; and = improved emotional, social and intellectual wellbeing of the school refuser. The methodology adopted for the study of school refusal regarding a young adolescent male was based on a grounded theory approach and also included a combination of action research and case study methods. Qualitative paradigms measured the degree of the participant's school refusal. A variety of instruments were employed to measure the participant's perceptions of school refusal. The implementation of multiple strategies were based upon data collected and evaluated, both as a result of intentional efforts, or as an unintentional by-product of the study with the expressed aim of maximising the participant's school attendance. The evidence presented in this study indicates the strategies employed via the WSA/PC intervention program were helpful in improving the participant's attendance at school. The results give an insight into the level of comprehension for the sample of school refusal and its response in terms of understanding the reasons for such thinking. The limitations of single case methodology are acknowledged in the study and suggestions for further research discussed.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School refusal</field><field name="subject">Adolescent male</field><field name="subject">Whole school approach</field><field name="subject">Pastoral care</field><field name="subject">WSNPC intervention program</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp40.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Henry Cowell (1897-1965) and the Impact of His First European Tour (1923)</field><field name="creator">Rischitelli, Victor Emanuel</field><field name="description">In 1923, American composer and pianist, Henry Cowell (1897-1965) gave his first highly successful concert tour of Europe, playing his own unique compositions. This thesis details this tour and discusses its impact. Considering the enormous impact of Cowell&#8217;s tour, it has only been discussed briefly. Cowell performed in many European cities, especially in Vienna, Berlin, Paris and London, achieving positive reviews and some notoriety. I discuss how and why he created such an impact, not only during the tour but also immediately following it, in relation to musical life in Europe and the differences between his piano music and the piano music that was being heard at the time. On his tour, Cowell showcased many new piano techniques he had invented, some of which he had discussed in his treatise New Musical Resources (1919). His clusters, string-piano technique and to some degree, his experiments with time and metre, were very new and influenced later generations of composers. His music created such passionate responses from the Europeans that when he returned to America, attitudes towards him and his music had changed for the better. In Europe, Cowell was also impressed by the various societies and publications devoted to new music and as a result he founded, in America, the New Music Society and the publication New Musical Quarterly. These promoted mostly American composers devoted to avant-garde developments in music, providing the foundation for the development of American music.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Henry Cowell</field><field name="subject">Piano music</field><field name="subject">American music</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp130.17052007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Framework of Growth Points in Students&#8217; Developing Understanding of Function</field><field name="creator">Ronda, Erlina R.</field><field name="description">This research developed a framework describing students&#8217; developing understanding of function. The research started with the problem: How might typical learning paths of secondary school students&#8217; developing understanding of function be described and assessed? The following principles and research questions guided the development of the framework.  Principle 1. The framework should be research-based.  Principle 2. The framework should include key aspects of the function concept.  Principle 3. The framework should be in a form that would enable teachers to assess and monitor students&#8217; developing understanding of this concept.  Principle 4. The framework should reflect students&#8217; big ideas or growth points which describe students&#8217; key cognitive strategies, knowledge and skills in working with function tasks.  Principle 5. The framework should reflect typical learning trajectories or a general trend of the growth points in students&#8217; developing understanding of function.  The following questions guided the development of the framework of growth points:  1. What are the growth points in students&#8217; developing understanding of function?  2. What information on students&#8217; understanding of function is revealed in the course of developing the framework of growth points that would be potentially useful for teachers?  The framework considered four key domains of the function concept: Graphs, Equations, Linking Representations and Equivalent Functions. Students&#8217; understanding of function in each of these domains was described in terms of growth points. Growth points are descriptions of students&#8217; &#8220;big ideas&#8221;. The description of each growth point highlights students&#8217; developing conceptual understanding rather than merely procedural understanding of a mathematical concept. For example, growth points in students&#8217; understanding of function under Equations were:  1) interpretations based on individual points;  2) interpretations based on holistic analysis of relationships;  3) interpretations based on local properties; and,  4) manipulations and transformations of functions (in equation form) as objects.  he growth points in each domain are more or less ordered according to the likelihood that these &#8220;big ideas&#8221; would emerge.  o identify and describe these growth points, Year 8, 9 and 10 students in Australia and the Philippines were given tasks involving function that would highlight thinking in terms of the process-object conception and the property-oriented conception of function. Students&#8217; performance on these tasks and their strategies served as bases for the identification and description of the growth points.  he research approach was interpretive and exploratory during the initial stages of analysis. The research then moved to a quantitative approach to identify typical patterns across the growth points, before returning to an interpretive phase in refining the growth points in the light of these data. The main data were collected from students in the Philippines largely through two written tests. Interviews with a sample of students also provided insights into students&#8217; strategies and interpretations of tasks.  he research outputs, the research-based framework and the assessment tasks, have the potential to provide teachers with a structure through which they can assess and develop students&#8217; growth in the understanding of function, and their own understanding of the function concept.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="subject">Secondary school students</field><field name="subject">Students&#8217; understanding of function</field><field name="subject">Cognitive development</field><field name="subject">Function concept</field><field name="subject">Learning trends</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp55.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Journey to the Margins: the Contribution of the Missionary Society of St Columban to the theory and practice of overseas mission within the Australian Catholic Church 1920-2000</field><field name="creator">Rue, Rev. Charles Douglas</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to show that the Columban Society made definable and significant contributions to the Australian Catholic missionary movement. The scope of the thesis is an analysis of the work of the Missionary Society of St Columban (Columban Society) in Australia from 1920-2000. Rather than the Society&#8217;s foundation in Ireland or its overseas missionary work, the focus is the activity of the Columban Society in Australia. The thesis argues that the Columban Society helped advance the understanding and practice of overseas mission within the Australian Catholic Church in four major ways. Firstly, by organising support for its own missionary venture in China and elsewhere, it helped foster mission mindedness among Australian Catholics and established structures for the ongoing resourcing of missionary activity. Secondly, it set up seminaries to train missionary priests and later opened its reformed tertiary level missionary formation programs to all church personnel in Australia. Thirdly, it helped mould Catholic opinion through its commentary on such international issues as Australian relations with Asian peoples. Finally, it contributed to the development and dissemination of new Catholic theological teaching, particularly in relation to social justice and indigenous churches, religious dialogue and the connections between faith and ecology.  The Columban Society carved out a position for itself in Australia through negotiating with the local Catholic Church. Starting as a group of diocesan priests and, from 1920 onwards, tapping into the numerous Irish church personnel in Australia, the Society grew to become a missionary arm of the local church. It created a network of financial support and influence at the grass roots level in parishes and schools through a system of regular visits, collections and a monthly magazine. As the world and church changed, it added mission education programs that fed back to Australian Catholics ideas and experiences coming from the new indigenous churches.  The distinctive contribution of the Columban Society to the Australian Catholic Missionary Movement lies in its close relationship with diocesan based parish Catholics and the teaching role it developed about missionary experiences of overseas churches within the context of international affairs. The Society has a significant placewithin the social history of Australia because of the direct influence it had on the opinions of the more than a quarter of the Australian population who identified as Catholics. The history of the Society is also a case study in the application of the reforms of the Second Ecumenical Vatican Council of the Catholic Church 1962-1965 and the consequent redefinition of orthodox belief and practice.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Catholic Church 1920-2000</field><field name="subject">Australian Catholic Missionary Movement</field><field name="subject">Missionary priests</field><field name="subject">Missionary Society of Columban Society</field><field name="subject">Second Ecumenical Vatican Council of the Catholic Church 1962-1965</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp24.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To Lead, or Not to Lead: that is the question: An exploration of understandings of leadership in the context of the deputy principal in the Lutheran secondary school.</field><field name="creator">Ruwoldt, Merryn Jane</field><field name="description">Twenty first century Lutheran secondary schools operate in a complex and demanding social, historical and theological environment. Leadership needs to be conceptualized in a manner which is appropriate for a fluid, dynamic learning community. Contemporary thinking about school leadership explores concepts such as teacher leadership, shared and distributed leadership. Successful school leadership is also perceived to impact positively on student educational outcomes. The leadership of the deputy principal in many school sectors has traditionally been structured on the basis of a bureaucratic, hierarchical model. Such models are increasingly perceived as unhelpful in the school context, yet in response, little has changed for deputy principals. The purpose of the current study was to consider the situation in Lutheran secondary schools. It explored the understandings about leadership embedded in the current role of the deputy principals. This was achieved by comparison of the participants&#8217; perceptions with historical leadership narratives. The key finding of this research is that in Lutheran schools, the leadership role of the deputy is often not as fully developed as would be appropriate in the existing climate, where schools and principals are expected to provide ever expanding services and fulfil multiple purposes. In many schools, the leadership role of the deputy does not provide sufficient training for succession to the principalship. Deputy principals are seen to focus on activity which supports educational leadership, but leaves them on the fringe of it. Deputies are often not involved in major teaching and learning strategic planning, vision and change management. This hinders their preparation for a future role as principal, but also deprives the school of a potentially significant source of leadership activity. Deputy principals are seen to model the Christian ethos of the school through the way they interact with staff and students and their involvement in the devotional life of the school. However, in-depth involvement in ongoing dialogue about Lutheran identity and the church in the school is usually dependent on the interest and passion of the individual deputies, not inherently demanded by the role. There is also a limited understanding of servant leadership influencing the practice of deputy principals in the schools. In order to maximise the effectiveness of the leadership role of the deputy principals in Lutheran secondary schools, it would be timely to draw together key doctrinal statements, leadership theory and Luther&#8217;s reflections on vocation, into a cohesive and practical understanding of leadership. This could form the basis for further development of distributed leadership in Lutheran secondary schools and help to ensure that they continue to successfully meet the needs of their communities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School leadership</field><field name="subject">Lutheran secondary schools</field><field name="subject">Deputy principals</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp143.17052007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From El Salvador to Australia: a 20th century exodus to a promised land</field><field name="creator">Santos, Beatriz</field><field name="description">El Salvador, the smallest and the most densely populated state in the region of Central America, was gripped by a civil war in the 1980s that resulted in the exodus of more than a million people. This thesis explores the causes that led to the exodus. The thesis is divided into two parts. The first part contains a historical and theoretical analysis of El Salvador from the time of conquest until the 1980s. An examination of the historical background of the socio-economic and political conflict in El Salvador during this period sets the scene for an account of the mass exodus of Salvadorans in the 1980s. The second part of the thesis involves a qualitative study of Salvadoran refugees, which concentrates on their experiences before and after arriving in Australia. The study explores both the reasons for the Salvadorans&#8217; becoming refugees and their resettlement in Melbourne. In an effort to explain some of the reasons for the socio-economic and political conflict in El Salvador in the 1980s, some concepts and ideas from different theoretical perspectives are utilized: modernisation theory, world-systems theory, dependency theory, elite theory, Foco theory of revolution and economic rationalism. The historical account covers the period from the expansion of the European world economy in the 16th century up to the political conflict of the 1980s. When the Salvadorans began to arrive in Melbourne, the micro-economic agenda in Australia was based on economic rationalism. This shifted the focus away from the state and onto a market-based approach that emphasised vigorous competition and fore grounded a non-collective social framework. The changes to policies in the welfare and immigration areas resulting from this shift are examined for their impact on the resettlement experiences of Salvadoran refugees. The United States foreign policy is also delineated because of the impact it had on the political, economic and social situation in El Salvador. The thesis focused on the time-period from the 1823 Monroe Doctrine to the era of the Cold War of &#8216;containment of communism&#8217;. The Catholic Church has also played a major influence in the political, social and religious life of Salvadorans. The changes that occurred in the post-1965 renewal of the Catholic Church were influential in the political struggles in El Salvador. The second part of the thesis involves a qualitative research study of a small group of 14 Salvadoran refugees. Participants were selected from different professional, educational and socioeconomic backgrounds. The study examines their flight from El Salvador, their arrival in Australia and their long-term experiences of resettlement. Tracking the experiences of refugees over a considerable period of time has seldom been the focus of a research study in Australia. The Salvadorans have been under-researched and no longitudinal studies have been conducted. The Salvadorans who took part in the study became refugees for diverse reasons ranging from political/religious reasons to random repression but certainly not for economic reasons. Their past experiences have influenced their resettlement in Australia and their attempts to build their lives anew have been fraught with difficulties. The difficulties in acquiring a working knowledge of the English language have often led to a downgrading in their professional and employment qualifications, isolation from the mainstream community and the experience of loneliness for the older generation. In addition, many of the participants still experience fear both in Australia and in their home country when they return for a visit. The findings indicate that the provision of extra services, such as counselling, could facilitate their resettlement and integration into Australian society.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salvadoran Refugees in Australia</field><field name="subject">El Salvadoran History</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp126.25102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Affective Component in Effective Education</field><field name="creator">Sellars, Maura</field><field name="description">This study investigated eight and nine year old children&#8217;s capabilities to develop skills in the intrapersonal intelligence domain as defined by Howard Gardner. A group of twenty-seven, seven to nine year olds were introduced to a program specifically designed to foster their self-knowledge as learners and their self-management skills in the English learning environment. The students were introduced to activities that would help them to identify their own relative strengths and limitations and use this knowledge to negotiate a learning environment that would best suit their own learning needs. This program included developing skills in goal setting and identification of personal learning strategies. It also sought to improve work habits and student on- task behaviours and encourage self-monitoring, self-evaluation and self-reflection. The results obtained evidenced a considerable improvement in the students&#8217; self knowledge and how this impacted on their perceptions of themselves as learners. The students grew increasingly aware of their own relative strengths and used this information to negotiate their learning environment, to identify strategies that worked for them and to take increasingly more responsibility for their own learning. As a result of the findings of this study, there are clear implications that if students are provided with opportunities to develop accurate intrapersonal intelligence, this improved awareness of &#8216;self&#8217; can have an impact on successful learning. This study indicates that if teachers provide students with opportunities to investigate and learn about themselves as learners, to build skills in goal setting and to identify personal learning strategies, then an increase in self-knowledge and self-management will impact positively on the students&#8217; capacity to learn successfully. Consequently, programs and strategies designed to promote students&#8217; intrapersonal intelligence may become a valuable part of school practice and curricula.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Child development</field><field name="subject">Intrapersonal intelligence</field><field name="subject">English language learning</field><field name="subject">Learning strategies</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp103.11092006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mission Through Journalism: Elizabeth Hayes and the Annals of Our Lady of the Angels</field><field name="creator">Shaw, Pauline Joan</field><field name="description">Nineteenth-century periodical literature, recognised today as a distinctive and significant feature of Victorian public communication, is voluminous. Yet in order to argue that the editor-publisher Elizabeth Hayes made a significant contribution to evangelising journalism, this thesis finds it imperative to situate her work within the enormous outpourings of the Victorian periodical press. For a Victorian woman to succeed in journalism was impressive and this investigation argues that Hayes capably led an international journal of religious ideas to stability and longevity. The investigation will show that Hayes, foundress of an organisation which edited, published and distributed a Franciscan monthly journal - to date scarcely investigated- was prepared prior to 1872 for her subsequent journalistic mission. The argument that Hayes made a significant contribution to nineteenth-century Catholic journalism appears strongest when evidence of the immense power of the press for good and evil is provided. This is accomplished hopefully though an examination of both secular and religious periodical literature and in particular by situating Hayes&#8217; output within this milieu. The argument is further strengthened through a detailed examination of the actual contents of Hayes&#8217; Annals of Our Lady of the Angels, of the numerous contributions to her Annals and of the editing, publishing and distribution methods which she employed in her mission. The argument shows Hayes&#8217; publication to be a significant contribution in the literary field to a growing body of research on late nineteenth-century professional women who enriched society with religious periodicals. The thesis argues that Hayes provided matter of interest to general readers and presented the progress and development of the Franciscan Order. The journal&#8217;s range of themes adds weight to the growing body of evidence of how women&#8217;s topics varied in the Victorian religious periodical press. It is argued that Hayes&#8217; diffusion of good literature was an authentic medium of evangelisation over twenty-one years. As writer, editor, publisher, manager of printing and distribution, it is argued that Hayes was a significant contributor to the Apostolate of the Press and that she used her journal as a tool of both adult education and entertainment.

The resulting populations have a number of distinctive features which make them both a challenge and an opportunity for the Church as it seeks to minister effectively. The underlying proposition of this thesis is that since there are distinctive demographic features of these towns, and since the church is called to minister effectively, there may well be approaches or ministry philosophies which enable the church to be more effective in these populations. Distinctive Populations Using data from the 2001 census a comparison between the Australian national figures and those of coastal towns between Newcastle and Tweed Heads showed that overall the population of the coastal towns was older, less formally educated, had lower income levels, more mobile, more likely to be Australian citizens, more likely to be married or divorced, more likely to describe themselves as Christian and members of the Anglican Church than the Australian average. The Survey With the assistance of the National Church Life Survey, thirty churches in coastal towns between Newcastle and Kingscliffe, were contacted. These churches (Anglican and Protestant) were those which had had the highest number of &#8216;newcomers&#8217; in the 2001 National Church Life Survey. NCLS wrote to these churches on my behalf and invited them to contact me if they were prepared to participate in my study. In the end I interviewed ordained and lay leaders as well as members of six churches. There were a number of features common to these churches including: the ordained leaders had what might be called orthodox theological views; the ordained and lay leaders were clear about the vision and direction of the church; the ordained and lay leaders were in agreement as to the role of the ordained leader &#8211; that role was clearly leadership; the welcoming nature of the congregation is vital; and the use of contemporary music and worship style. The Mission of the Church Whilst the mission of the church has been seen in different ways over the past two thousand years, it is clear that the central theme of the teaching and practice of Jesus Christ was the Kingdom or Reign of God. By his teaching and very powerfully through his actions Jesus demonstrated the reality of the new in-breaking reality. The early church was clear that it saw itself as being sent by Jesus to continue his mission of proclaiming the kingdom in the power of the Holy Spirit. Effective Church Given that the mission of the church is to focus on the Kingdom or Reign of God, it is important that this be done in an effective a way as possible. One of the challenges in this is to determine what &#8216;effective&#8217; means for the church. For some, being effective means numerical growth in church attenders. For others, being effective means being a &#8216;healthy&#8217; church. My conclusion is that being effective, whilst not dismissing church growth or church health, means an attitude, and that is, being focused on proclaiming the reality of the Kingdom of God. As the church is more focussed on this task, it is effective. Being Effective in Rapidly Growing Coastal Towns There seem to be a number of challenges facing the church in rapidly growing coastal towns as the church seeks to focus on the Kingdom of God. If the kingdom is good news for the poor, the question then is: who are the poor of coastal towns? An immediate need in coastal towns is community for those who are newly arrived, or poor, or otherwise on the margins of the society. The church needs to be a welcoming and inclusive place for those in need, and a place which actually helps people with their physical poverty. The church also needs to confront its own operating model in order to be effective. Too often the church is focused on its own survival and not on the kingdom. The church in its local mode seems like a religious small business. Focus on the &#8216;growth of the business&#8217; may well lead to a loss of focus on the kingdom. For the church to be effective in rapidly growing coastal towns the church must take seriously the culture of those towns and seek to express its focus on the kingdom in ways that bring good news to the reality of those communities.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coastal communities</field><field name="subject">Australian Christian Church</field><field name="subject">Ministry</field><field name="subject">National Church Life Survey</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp104.11092006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Images of Salvation: A study in theology, poetry and rhetoric</field><field name="creator">Smith, Gregory Brian</field><field name="description">Humankind yearns for reconciliation, fulfilment and salvation, and the human heart has always sought deliverance from negative forces. In particular, this yearning for salvation is most apparent when poets envisage such yearning in living situations and in recognisable life circumstances. Reading them shows how the quest for salvation is being achieved in daily steps that incarnate movements of hope and a contesting of despair. This dissertation captures some significant images of salvation expressed in selected Australian poetry. It argues that what is classically called final salvation is imaged in the trope of transcendence in poetry. Because the concept of salvation both indicates the right path and promises a way of liberation and fulfilment, gaining salvation is not an escape from the world, but rather an engagement with it, through just and humane actions. The study&#8217;s poetic selections image salvation as redressing wrongs, regenerating the land, seeking new life, and envisaging better states of affairs. This dissertation functions at the interface of theology and poetry. It shows how a reader in the Christian community may identify some key images in public poetry as foreshadowing religious salvation. This is possible because, like the poet engaging in an aesthetic experience, the believer brings a remarkable openness to reality in the exercise of the religious imagination. This analogical imagination identifies images in poetry that do touch the human spirit in deeply spiritual ways. The study employs the competence of methodical hermeneutic interpretation. It proceeds as an aesthetic-theological reading employing critical-analytical scholarship. Rather than attempt a formal explication of authorial intent, the hermeneutic reads in a careful excavation of the poems for those significant &#8220;scraps of experience&#8221; that coax the imagination towards hope in the mystery of salvation. The dissertation approaches the poetic texts using &#8220;Christian literary theory&#8221; as its hermeneutical framework. The dissertation presents readings of selected poetry and prose of three celebrated Australian voices, Judith Wright, Les A. Murray and David Malouf. The study&#8217;s primary data are their poetic images recognising and affirming the dream of transcendence embodied in human happiness, moments of rescue and relief, events of forgiveness and transformation, and insights for a better life for humans and the planet. The study shows how poetical insights image partial fulfilments in transcendent perceptions, transformed personal destinies and envisaged social reforms. This exercise in contextual theology searches for depth and perennial resonances that sustain Australians in their culture. The discussion is especially concerned with the poetic use of the trope of hope and its effects, and especially with the power of metaphor for accessing the sublime. The study distils ten virtues for salvation from the readings of the selected poems as pathways for implementing salvation in the world. The study presents poetic images of promise, rescue and transformation that refresh discourses regarding salvation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian poetry</field><field name="subject">Religious poetry</field><field name="subject">Christian literary theory</field><field name="subject">Salvation</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp144.17052007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation into the Use of Water Immersion upon the Outcomes and Experience of Giving Birth</field><field name="creator">Sprague, Annie G.</field><field name="description">The use of deep-water immersion during labour and birth is commonplace in many countries including Australia, yet there has been little contemporary Australian data from which to form policies regarding its use during childbirth, or which have included women&#8217;s experiences using water immersion.  The literature reviewed for this study was positive with regard to the effect of water immersion during childbirth and was associated with decreased rates of perineal trauma, low episiotomy rates, low rates of analgesic use, lower operative deliveries coupled with increased maternal satisfaction of the experience of childbirth when compared with births where water immersion was not involved.  The purpose of this research was to investigate the influence of deep-water immersion upon maternal and neonatal outcomes and women's experiences of giving birth in Australia. This study used a mixed method in an attempt to fulfil this purpose: the first phase was a Quasi-experimental design and the second phase was based upon a Hermeneutic Phenomenological approach. Data were collected via a Random Chart Audit, from a random sample of fifty nulliparous women who used deepwater immersion during labour and childbirth and six women were selected to participate in a semi-structured interview.  Data from each phase of this study revealed positive birth outcomes and these findings were supported by the literature. The women's stories were positive and comprised elements of four lifeworld themes. &#8226; Water&#8217;s Embrace &#8226; Warped Time &#8226; Naked but Clothed &#8226; The Shape of Water.  Each of these themes encapsulated different aspects of the women's experiences, which when considered together, increased the understanding of the phenomenon of deep-water immersion upon the experience of giving birth.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Birth</field><field name="subject">Water birth</field><field name="subject">Deep-water immersion</field><field name="subject">Maternal outcomes</field><field name="subject">Neonatal outcomes</field><field name="subject">Australian womens&#8217; birthing experiences</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp56.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When Students Negotiate: an action research case study of a year 8 English class in a Catholic secondary college in regional Victoria</field><field name="creator">Sproston, Carlyn</field><field name="description">This action research study examines the learning experiences of Year 8 students and their teacher as they negotiate aspects of their English classes. The study takes place in a regional Catholic co-educational secondary college in Victoria, Australia. The question of understanding the lived experience of ourselves and other is fundamental to this study, which is situated within an holistic, enactivist view of the world. From this perspective learning is a shared activity in which students participate in creating their own interpretation as they interact with others to bring forth understanding. The study focuses on classroom practice which aims to include all participants, through negotiation, in the actions that take place in the classroom. I have used a narrative approach to describe the way in which three action research cycles were implemented in the English classroom during one academic year. A variety of data gathering techniques was used and these included: classroom questionnaires, classroom meetings, journals, partnership observation and interviews. The main sources of data were the interviews that I undertook with each of the twenty five students in the class. The three action research cycles allowed both the students and me to reflect upon classroom activities and make appropriate changes as the cycles progressed. In addition, negotiating in this English class has helped me to better understand my students and, through reflection, to improve my teaching practice. Analysis of the data suggests that students experience greater commitment and motivation when they are given opportunities to be actively involved in contributing to their own learning. The data also supports research that recognises the importance of collaboration, positive relationships within the classroom, the importance of metacognitive skills and student voice. In addition, the findings point to the value of action research as a method of improving teaching practice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Year 8 students</field><field name="subject">Classroom practice</field><field name="subject">Student centred learning</field><field name="subject">Catholic secondary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp88.09042006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What a Difference a Play Makes: an examination of factors influencing personal development benefits through involvement in extracurricular theatre</field><field name="creator">Sproston, Ronald Leslie</field><field name="description">The research investigates the personal development benefits to students of involvement in a particular extracurricular activity (student theatre). It examines aspects of student personal development that are promoted by involvement in this extracurricular activity and discusses factors within the activity that encourage or promote these results. It does this through its focus on participants&#8217; perceptions of what happens in the group, in terms of personal development and events and actions that affected that personal development. The extracurricular theatrical activity that is the focus of this study takes place annually in a regional Catholic co-educational secondary college in Victoria, Australia. It is a multi-age activity that involves students from Years 7 &#8211; 12. Participation is open to all students and the activity is non-competitive. A detailed review of the literature covering the areas of extracurricular activity, adolescent development and resilience is provided. The research is underpinned by an holistic enactivist world-view and makes use of the constant comparison methodology of grounded theory to analyse the data it obtains. The theoretical justification for this position is provided. The data were obtained through semi-structured or guided interviews with long term participants in the activity. The participants included students, ex-students, teachers and parents. The participants&#8217; perspectives of the personal development that occurred through involvement in the extracurricular activity were revealed through their voices, and were examined as they described and reflected upon their experiences. The interconnectedness of the personal development benefits and the factors that enable them are highlighted. Conclusions about the significance of an increased awareness of the complex inter-relatedness of the events that subscribe to the enhancement of personal development are offered. Theory related to the elements that contribute to the development of an environment that facilitates personal development benefits is developed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Personal development</field><field name="subject">Extracurricular activity</field><field name="subject">Student theatre</field><field name="subject">Secondary school students</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp89.09042006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Righting Women&#8217;s Writing: A re-examination of the journey toward literary success by late Eighteenth-Century and early Nineteenth-century women writers</field><field name="creator">Stanford, Roslyn</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the progressive nature of women&#8217;s writing and the various factors that helped and hindered the successful publication of women&#8217;s written works in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The thesis interrogates culturally encoded definitions of the term &#8220;success&#8221; in relation to the status of these women writers. In a time when success meant, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, &#8220;attainment of wealth or position&#8221;, women could never achieve a level of success equal to the male elite. The dichotomous worldview, in which women were excluded from almost all active participation in the public sphere, led to a literary protest by women. However, the male-privileged binary system is seen critically to affect women&#8217;s literary success. Hence, a redefinition of success will specifically refer to the literary experience of these women writers and a long-lasting recognition of this experience in the twentieth century. An examination of literary techniques used in key works from Catherine Macaulay, Mary Wollstonecraft, Hannah More, Mary Shelley and Jane Austen suggests that there was a critical double standard with which women writers were constantly faced. The literary techniques, used by the earlier writers, fail in overcoming this critical double standard because of their emphasis on revolution. However, the last two women writers become literary successes (according to my reinterpretation of the term) because of their particular emphasis on amelioration rather than revolution. The conclusion of the thesis suggests that despite the &#8220;unsuccessful&#8221; literary attempts by the first three women authors, there is an overall positive progression in women&#8217;s journey toward literary success. Described as the &#8216;generational effect&#8217;, this becomes the fundamental point of the study, because together these women represent a combined movement which challenges a system of patriarchal tradition, encouraging women to continue to push the gender relations&#8217; boundaries in order to be seen as individual, successful writers.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women&#8217;s writing</field><field name="subject">Eighteenth Century women writers</field><field name="subject">Nineteenth Century women writers</field><field name="subject">Literary techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp25.09042006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Education for an Australian Choral Tradition: evaluating the philosophies of Stephen Leek</field><field name="creator">Stephens, Annette</field><field name="description">The thesis aimed to assess the philosophies of Stephen Leek, in regard to the education for an Australian choral tradition. In order to address Stephen Leek's philosophies, a study of Australia's existing choral tradition and its history was conducted. This was followed by a general overview of music education in Australia post 1960. In light of these findings, Leek's educational philosophies were discussed, with specific influences, including biographical information. Leek's educational work Voiceworks was found to encapsulate his ideas. The program is creative-based, and aims to facilitate the discovery of new artistic concepts, and foster acceptance and interest in contemporary Australian choral music. Using the voice as the sole instrument, students can perform the pieces from Voiceworks, or use the ideas for further creativity in their own compositions. The program is based on experimentation, discovery, structuring, formulating, rehearsal, performance and discussion. Leek advocates that these stages are the quickest and most effective way of facilitating the learning of contemporary music techniques. In the evaluation of Leek's philosophies, case studies using a lesson from Voiceworks, were conducted with two Year 7 music classes in two different government coeducational schools. The findings revealed that Voiceworks can be a successful resource in the education for an Australian choral tradition. However, it was also found that excitement, enthusiasm and enjoyment are the key to its success, and hence excellent teaching is required in its presentation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian choral tradition</field><field name="subject">Stephen Leek</field><field name="subject">Music education</field><field name="subject">Music techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp90.09042006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human Rights in Crisis: Is There No Answer to Human Violence? A Cultural Critique in Conversation with Ren&#233; Girard and Raymund Schwager</field><field name="creator">Stork, Peter Robert</field><field name="description">The study attempts to bring together the mimetic theory of Ren&#233; Girard and the theology of Raymund Schwager to address questions inherent in the contemporary notion of human rights. The impetus derives from the phenomenon of human violence, the universal presence of which points to a problematic that seems to defy conventional explanations and political solutions. In dialogue with Girard and Schwager, the project seeks to shed light on the causes not only of the apparent fragility of the human rights system, but also of the persistence with which large-scale human rights violations recur despite the proliferation of human rights norms. It argues that the human rights crisis is neither an accident nor a shortfall in techniques of implementation, but reflects the subconscious and collective structure of civilization. Following a description of the crisis, this investigation examines the nature of human violence, especially the contagious manner in which it works at the root of the crisis, offering understanding where conventional anthropological reflections fall short. The study argues with Girard that vengeance and retribution resonate deeply with the human psyche and easily evoke an archaic image of the divine. While this arouses moral protest in the post-modern mind, we meet here one of the fundamental issues mimetic theory elucidates, namely that it is on account of such an unconscious image of the &#8220;sacred&#8221; that vengeful violence has remained for so long a determining element in human history. In a theological key, the study presents human mimesis as a divinely constituted structure that makes possible divine/human intimacy and reciprocity. However, this exalted capacity is perverted. Human sin casts God into the image of an envious rival which corrupts the personal and structural dimensions of human sociality of which the so-called &#8220;human rights crisis&#8221; is but a contemporary manifestation. What rules the social order is not the true image of God but a resentful human projection that deceptively demands victims in exchange for peace and security. Thus &#8220;mimetic victimage&#8221; is the essential clue to the fallenness of nations and their institutions, including the institution of human rights, as well as to the fallenness of individuals in their profound alienation from God, from themselves and from one another. Nonetheless, mimesis is also a structure of hope and transcendent longing. So understood, it opens the way to a profound and practical appropriation of the meaning of Christ as the restoration of the image of God in humanity whereby rivalistic resentment, the epicenter of the human predicament, is undone through forgiveness. While there is an enabling aspect to violence when it restrains and coerces us for our benefit as we rightly fear the greater violence that might ensue in its absence, the study also argues that because mimetic human agents carry out the &#8220;deed of the law&#8221;, the human rights system cannot overcome the mimetic impulse. As a judicial system, human rights belong structurally to the same order as the system they seek to correct. This ambiguity takes on special significance in the &#8220;age of annihilation&#8221;. For the first time in history limitless violence has become feasible through weapons capable of planetary destruction so that humanity not only faces its own complicity with violence, but also the relative powerlessness of the human rights project to keep its mimetic escalation in check. This raises the central question of the study. If the institution of human rights cannot offer a rigorous critique of structural violence, let alone free humanity from complicity with it, where shall the world place its hope for a more humane future? It concludes that such a hope is not to be found in the proliferation of rights norms and their enforcement but in the transformation of human desire through the restoration of the true image of God as revealed in the Christ-event. This revelation judges as futile all attempts at human sociality that retain violence as their hidden core. Thus God&#8217;s freedom granting action in history is both revelatory and &#8220;political&#8221;: in its prophetic stance against the powers of human sin and domination, it calls humanity to its true vocation to be the image of God grounded in a new pacific mimesis that resonates freely and unflinchingly with the self-giving love of God in Christ.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ren&#233; Girard</field><field name="subject">Raymund Schwager</field><field name="subject">Human rights</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp127.25102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of the Mater Children&#8217;s Hospital Tile Project</field><field name="creator">Sutton, Kathleen Rose Creagh</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the relationship between children&#8217;s visual art and hospital contexts. It specifically focused on children&#8217;s art in the Tile Project within the Mater Children&#8217;s Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. This ethnographic study consisted of interviews with the creators of the Tile Project as well as interviews and a survey with parents, staff, and children within the Mater Children&#8217;s Hospital. The interviews were informed by a review of literature in the areas of art in health settings. The study made observations of the community interacting with the tiles and collected images of the tiles used in the hospital and employed the framework of Bourdieu&#8217;s (1993) fields of cultural production and Abbs&#8217;s (1987) aesthetic field and dimensions, as well as the aesthetic dimensions of Beardsley (1982), Eisner (1985), and Csikszentmihalyi (1990). The study investigated the aesthetic characteristics of the tiles and their health outcomes in relation to the hospital community. This study is significant because the Mater Children&#8217;s Hospital Tile Project was a project that reflected art in healthcare settings involving Community Arts, art in design, and art in public buildings. The research identified the unique nature of the Tile Project which saw the hospital as a children&#8217;s space with artworks for children by children. The study reflected on the value of the tiles in having a healing and distracting quality for parents and children alike and that engagement with the tiles through touch, imagination, and playful games improved the atmosphere of the hospital.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children&#8217;s hospitals</field><field name="subject">Art in health settings</field><field name="subject">Healing</field><field name="subject">Hospital environment</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp105.11092006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Ascetical Theology and Praxis of Sixth to Eighth Century Irish Monasticism as a Radical Response to the Evangelium</field><field name="creator">Thom, Catherine Philomena</field><field name="description">This thesis aims at an exploration of the ascetical theology and praxis of the sixth to the eighth century Irish monasticism viewed as a radical response to the Christian evangelium. It also aims to analyse the extent to which the distinctive response of the monastic Irish in the period arose from their Celtic cultural context. Culture influences all aspects of life and given that this work is addressing the critical period of the emergence of a people from primitive forms of religious belief and practice to Christianity it would be important to evaluate the influence of culture. The thesis is an exploration in the sense that, though much has been written about monasticism and specifically the Irish monastic movement up to and beyond the tenth century, the discussion of the ascetical theology and praxis has the potential to open up new pathways to better understanding and appreciation of this phenomenon within the wider Irish Church. &#160;The scope of the work ranges briefly over the cultural context of Irish society in the pre and post-Christian era: its social organisation, sagas, Brehon laws and druidism. The primary sources utilised include the penitentials, the monastic rules, the Vitae and writings of ColumCille and Columbanus. These formative works regarding two of the most influential early Irish monastic founders are seen as encapsulating, and broadly illustrating, the ascetical emphasis and praxis of this time. The work draws on the ancient notions and practices of asceticism and the principle of contraries brought to light by Cassian. One facet of the radicality of Irish monasticism, manifested specifically in the penitentials, lies partly in the fact that, whereas asceticism is usually perceived as a personal response to the call to change one's lifestyle, the Irish praxis was, on the whole, undertaken in the context of a community. &#160;Chapter One looks briefly at the Irish Church as part of that phenomenon called the Celtic Church. Other aspects of the topic addressed in this chapter include history (the Irish of the period had a particular way of looking at it), theology, asceticism, radicality and how each of these facilitates the future analysing of the primary sources. Chapter Two analyses the Irish penitentials that traditionally, and often today, have been seen as harsh and inflexible. Chapter Three analyses the monastic rules of some early founders and demonstrates that they are a call to a radical lifestyle for those committed to the religious life, compared with the ordinary demands of the Christian evangel. In Chapters Four and Five, the lives and writing of ColumCille and Columbanus are treated. The Sermons of Columbanus are the primary material used in Chapter Five. The conclusions of this work are that the radicality in the monastic rules, penitentials and the Vitae of its most prominent founders reveals that all the practices were designed to promote personal growth in the spiritual life and were not primarily focussed on punishment. They were about an inner transformation that enhanced one's personal, spiritual and human well being rather than a humiliation and belittling of the person. Present day psychology and the behavioural sciences in general would affirm the wisdom of the fundamental belief inherent in Cassian's contraries, which underpinned the injunctions in both the monastic rules and penitentials. The evidence deduced from many of the injunctions in the extant penitentials is that of a balanced presentation of the ideals of asceticism, which were a guide for the inner transformation of the person. Both the penitentials and the monastic rules also point to the emphasis on individuality that is evident in much Irish secular writing. The injunctions of the extant rules make it clear that their asceticism was, through prayer, sacrifices or mortification and work, to aid in the transforming of the energy of self-denial into a spiritual power. The asceticism thus recommended in these primary sources of the sixth to the eighth century Irish monastic movements was not harsh and inhuman, for the radicality of their lives depended on the fact that it was deliberately and personally chosen by the monks. They were captured by the beauty of their newly found faith in the Christian God, incarnated in Jesus whose life they contemplated in the daily recitation of the Canonical Hours and whose presence surrounded them in the totality of creation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ascetical theology</field><field name="subject">Celtic Church</field><field name="subject">Columbanus</field><field name="subject">ColumCille</field><field name="subject">Irish monasticism</field><field name="subject">Irish penitentials</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp26.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Church as Family of God: its development and implications for the Church in Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Tien, Ngo Dinh</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to study the development of the concept/model &#8220;the church as the family of God&#8221; and to explore its implications in terms of participation of church members and the social mission for the church in Vietnam. The discussion of the development of the ecclesiological concept helps to construct an ecclesiology of the church as the family of God in response to the call of Pope John Paul II in the Apostolic Exhortation Ecclesia in Africa (1995).It also assists the Vietnamese church in its evaluation and implication of the model of the church as family. This ecclesiological model has been promoted since the seventeenth century and emphasised since the Second Vatican Council in the church in Vietnam. The scope of this thesis studies the biblical, theological and ecclesiological development of the concept/model of the church as God&#8217;s family. It also investigates the understanding of the family and the church as family in Vietnam, the mutual relationships of church members and the characteristics of the mission of the church in the world. Then it explores the implications of the ecclesiology of the church as the family of God for the local church. A proper understanding of these issues is necessary because it helps the Vietnamese church to apply authentically the model of the church as the family of God. Chapter One discusses the biblical understanding of the family of God as the metaphor for the relationships between God and his people and among members in the church. The metaphor &#8220;the family/the household of God&#8221; was applied to the house church in early Christianity and provides some relevant implications for the church today. Chapter Two examines the theological foundations of the concept in patristic writings, in the liturgy and in church documents. Chapter Three explores the components of an ecclesiology of the church as the family of God which include trinitarian, Basic Ecclesial Communities, ancestral veneration and liberation ecclesiologies. Chapter Four investigates the traditional as well as modern Vietnamese family and its challenges in order to identify the foundation of the understanding of the concept of family in the local church. Chapter Five describes the development of the concept/model of the church as family in the organisation of the Vietnamese church that appeared in the seventeenth century and in some documents of the local church. Chapter Six analyses church hierarchy and the participation of the people of God. It provides some implications of the ecclesiology of the church as God&#8217;s family for the promotion of the participatory church in Vietnam. Chapter Seven examines the characteristics of and the practical tools in the church&#8217;s social mission and explores the challenges to the implications of the social mission of the church as the family of God. The conclusions of this thesis are that the concept/model and the applications of the church as the family of God have basic foundations in scripture, in patristic writings and in church documents. The concept of family in these materials implies two main meanings: the familial relationships between God and the people of God (or the church) and the mutual relationships among people in the church as well as in society. These relationships are based on human interactions in the family which are problematic in some situations. Therefore, the model of the church as family must be patterned on trinitarian communion of the divine family so that it can overcome the limitations of the human family. In that context, the Vietnamese family pointed out advantages as well as disadvantages in the development of the model of the church as family. The concept of family is very close to the Vietnamese; it provides some possibilities to develop the participation in the church and its mission in society. However, to some extent, the concept and the structure of the Vietnamese family which was influenced by Confucianism have challenged the local church in these areas. Therefore, the proper understanding of hierarchy and the church&#8217;s social mission were discussed. Based on that understanding some applications were also proposed in order to help the Vietnamese church to overcome these challenges and become an authentic model of the family of God.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Catholic Church</field><field name="subject">Family of God</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp128.25102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coping with Cancer: the Adolescent experience</field><field name="creator">Till, Tracy</field><field name="description">Adolescence is the period of physical and emotional development from childhood to adulthood. As an adolescent develops they struggle with many issues including developing independence from their parents, embracing peer culture, an increase in the importance of body image and the development of sexual, vocational, and moral identity. The diagnosis and treatment for cancer can interfere with the adolescent meeting these goals, and subsequently cause the experience of adolescence to be more difficult. The aim of this study was to identify how adolescents with cancer cope with their situation. The objectives were to determine the resources adolescents utilise to cope with their experience, and the coping strategies adolescents use to cope with their experience. A thorough literature review identified that there had previously been only limited research with adolescents with cancer. In particular there had been very few qualitative studies investigating the specific coping strategies used by adolescents with cancer, with no such research being undertaken in Queensland. This study was conducted under the epistemological stance of constructionism. Meaning was constructed for this study of adolescents with cancer through the use of grounded theory methods, and secondary analysis of data. Interviews were collected by the researcher for a project at the Royal Children&#8217;s Hospital. Using grounded theory methods, seven of the interviews were analysed. In the process of developing a central category, Schatzman's Dimensional Matrix was used to assign codes into context, processes, consequences, and conditions, under the central category of &#8220;conquering the cancer experience&#8221;. The experience of diagnosis and treatment for cancer was difficult for these adolescents, however they ultimately coped and became stronger as a result of their experience. The key findings of this study identified that adolescents were able to cope with their experience. These finding were discussed in relation to factors which enhanced their coping, factors which influenced their ability to cope and how the experience changed the adolescent. Recommendations were also made with the aim of improving the experience of adolescents undergoing treatment for cancer in Queensland. Through the implementation of the recommendations of this study, hopefully the journey of adolescents with cancer can be made easier.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Adolescence</field><field name="subject">Adolescent cancer experiences</field><field name="subject">Coping strategies</field><field name="subject">Cancer diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Cancer treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp70.25092005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ariadne&#8217;s Thread: Women and Labyrinths in the Fiction of A.S. Byatt and Iris Murdoch</field><field name="creator">Tomazic, Elizabeth Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation of the journeys towards a sense of identity or selfhood, achieved through honest and accurate appreciation of the lives of others, made by several female characters in the fiction of A.S. Byatt and the late Iris Murdoch. I believe that because Byatt and Murdoch value literature as a serious business that teaches as well as entertains, their writing can play a significant role in illuminating the lives of women by means of its portrayal of the resolution of women&#8217;s struggles. Women&#8217;s lives, despite the rise of feminism, are still not equitable. While many women strive to attain a balance of independence and intimacy &#8211; what Thelma Shinn calls a &#8220;meronymic&#8221; relationship &#8211; and connection within community, many do not succeed in this endeavour. The numerous challenges they face are difficult and confronting, and the stories of their efforts resemble journeys through a labyrinth or maze. Byatt acknowledges Murdoch as her literary mother, frequently citing Murdoch&#8217;s belief in the ability of literature to improve human life. While Byatt and Murdoch are interested in what characters learn about their relations to others and the world, they make it clear that characters are constructs, not real people. Yet their fiction is an ongoing exploration of the nature of reality and the nature of selfhood, particularly that of women. According to feminist theories, women are more constrained than men, and are therefore the focus of this study, but their experience of constraint is a more complex matter than experience of mere undifferentiated oppression, and is better represented by the structure of the labyrinth than that of the simple, linear journey. I agree with Byatt&#8217;s and Murdoch&#8217;s view of the importance of fiction as a means of commenting on human relationships, particularly with the notion of the need for connection within community. The labyrinth, together with the Bildungsroman, provides a paradigm for the complex experiences of Byatt&#8217;s and Murdoch&#8217;s female characters. All the characters in this study struggle to flee from restraint, seek purpose and agency in the world through interaction with others, and escape a feminised Plato&#8217;s Cave by learning to see more accurately, and all but one emerge from the maze into an autonomous and independent existence in community with others.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">A.S.Byatt</field><field name="subject">Iris Murdoch</field><field name="subject">Women in literature</field><field name="subject">Character constructs</field><field name="subject">Female identity</field><field name="subject">Feminist theories</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp91.09042006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Review of the grief process and bereavement follow up support</field><field name="creator">Tomlinson,Catherine</field><field name="description">Grief is a life changing and universal experience, expressed through individual sets of responses and behaviours. Society and health workers&#146; interpretation and beliefs regarding grief and bereavement have changed throughout the decades. This is a continually evolving process. As we move into a new century, so too does grief move into a new era where a new postmodern paradigm is arising. We are thus deviating away from stage theories that are time limited, linear and predictable. Emphasis in this new wave of thought is placed upon grief as an oscillating and highly unique experience, one that encourages a continuation of a bond and lifetime relationship with the deceased. This current qualitative study explores the new phenomenon in relation to both the grief process and bereavement support programs, by extensively reviewing the literature and analysing data from a number of interviews with the bereaved. Furthermore the supports offered by society, with particular focus on a Melbourne Community Bereavement Follow Up Program, are reviewed. By observing and discussing expressions of grief it was found, although unique and varying, some patterns or common behaviors emerged. Supports and comforts that assisted the bereaved are explored. Issues, including inappropriate comments and problems with bureaucratic departments, are also developed and discussed. There is an emphasis placed upon the need of health care staff and the community in general to increase their understanding of the grief process and bereavement support, so as to enhance care and practice when working with people who have suffered loss.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grief</field><field name="subject">Grief process</field><field name="subject">Bereavement</field><field name="subject">Berevement support</field><field name="subject">Melbourne Community Bereavement Follow Up Program</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp11.25072005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bringing Up Children In Taiwan: Parents&#8217; Beliefs, Concerns and Coping Strategies Relating to Preschool Children&#8217;s Food Acceptance Behaviour</field><field name="creator">Tsai, Shu-Fang</field><field name="description">This study examined the food acceptance behaviour of preschool children in Taiwan from their parents&#8217; perspectives. The research explored food preferences and aversions of preschool children and how parents&#8217; beliefs, concerns and coping strategies influenced their food acceptance behaviour. This qualitative study used in-depth interviews to obtain answers to the research questions. This appears to be the first study of its kind in Taiwan. The results of this research were represented in three ways: as themes and sub-themes, as narratives for two families, and as concept maps to show the relationship between themes and preschool children&#8217;s food acceptance behaviour. The major findings of this research are firstly, that children showed a wide range of food acceptance behaviours that are established early in life. Secondly, parents had a number of beliefs and concerns about the nature of the food acceptance behaviour of their preschool children. They described many factors that they believe affect their children&#8217;s eating behaviour including the influence of caregivers, parents themselves, siblings, grandparents, peers, the kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten cook, and the media. Thirdly, parents&#8217; rearing styles influence the eating habits of preschool children. The thesis concludes by pointing to useful directions and recommendations for further research, education and policy around the issue of early childhood food acceptance behaviour.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Taiwanese preschool children</field><field name="subject">Food aversions</field><field name="subject">Food preferences</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp134.05022007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making the Edmund Rice Ethos a Reality: A case study in the perceptions of principals in Christian Brothers&#8217; Schools in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Tuite, Kerrie Patricia</field><field name="description">This research concerns how lay principals are negotiating the nurturing of authentic Edmund Rice education in their schools within a period of organisational change in the 21st century. The context of this research is Queensland Catholic schools in the Edmund Rice tradition, once more commonly known as Christian Brothers&#8217; schools. These schools claim to carry on the educational charism of Edmund Rice (1762-1844), Founder of the Christian Brothers, who began schools in Ireland to provide a holistic education for boys, especially those who were marginalised by poverty and social stigma. Christian Brothers&#8217; tradition purports that the Edmund Rice educational charism was handed on to successive Christian Brothers&#8217; schools by Christian Brothers; however, research indicated that there were clear deviations from the original charism just prior to and following the death of Edmund Rice, raising questions of whether these schools remained authentic carriers of the original charism. Research also suggests that these deviations resulted in number of instances when the original charism of Edmund Rice was, at best, muted, or, at worst, distorted beyond recognition. Additional investigation also demonstrates that these departures from Rice&#8217;s charism resulted in a culture that differed from Edmund Rice&#8217;s original vision for education thus raising issues of authenticity for schools in the 21st century. Since Vatican II the Congregation of Christian Brothers has undergone significant changes. Most notable has been the reduction in Brothers in leadership positions in schools. Edmund Rice&#8217;s beatification in 1996 sparked renewed interest in his original educational vision, and The Congregation of Christian Brothers world wide began to explore what this charism might mean in contemporary times. In Australia, schools changed their name from Christian Brothers&#8217; schools to Catholic schools in the Edmund Rice tradition, as part of an attempt to develop an authentic educational vision for contemporary Australian schools. At the time of this research, there were ten schools in Queensland, all led by lay principals, within a subset of forty or more schools across Australia. In Queensland, these schools encompass a wide socio-economic spectrum and offer differing educational offerings ranging from a totally traditional curriculum, to a comprehensive curriculum, to more flexible offerings for disengaged and marginal youth; the majority of these boys&#8217; schools are single sex schools. This researcher identified that there was lack of clarity as to what constitutes an authentic Edmund Rice school and that a lacuna existed between the organisational rhetoric and the reality of principals. Consequently, the purpose of this research was to explore what lay principals perceived to be the essential features or ethos of this educational vision and the ways they developed this ethos into an authentic Edmund Rice culture in order to determine whether these schools are authentic to the original vision of Edmund Rice. Because the purpose of this research was to explore perceptions, the epistemological position of Constructionism, using an interpretivist perspective was adopted for this research. The methodology of Case Study was utilised as it allowed for the exploration of the world of Queensland Catholic schools in the Edmund Rice tradition from the perspectives of principals: nine current principals and one past principal were studied. The literature review generated the following research questions: 1.What do principals consider are the essential features of the Edmund Rice ethos? 2.How do principals ensure that the ethos of Edmund Rice is an integral element of school culture? 3.What aspects of leadership do principals consider important in ensuring that the Edmund Rice ethos is developed into an authentic culture?  The findings of this research indicated that principals perceived that the essential features of ethos were found in: providing values based education; ensuring that young people were liberated from factors which marginalised them; ensuring that their schools were places of Diversity and Inclusivity; undertaking the development of Right Relationships; and developing a strong sense of community. Principals ensured that the Edmund Rice ethos was authentically connected to school culture through: providing Social Justice Initiatives; developing spirituality and sense of the sacred; providing flexible options for a diverse range of students; and ensuring that structures and formation experiences were provided to support the development of ethos. Finally, principals articulated their leadership role: in ensuring the embedding of ethos in culture was one of cultural change agent; as a spiritual and prophetic leader; developing a student centred focus; and being a role model for leadership within the totality of the school community. The research concluded that, for these principals, the development of an authentic Edmund Rice school was embedded in these three issues: 1.Ethos: A Catholic education with values based on Edmund Rice and his educational mission; 2.Culture: A positive environment which enables and encourages the development of structures and formation experiences to support ethos; 3.Leadership: Leadership led by a principal who understands ethos and is committed to a role model of the development of an authentic culture. However, the research also concluded that, while lay principals were committed to the development of an authentic Edmund Rice school and were committed to the organisational change needed to achieve this goal, they were constrained by a variety of factors including: school context; school tradition and history; the traditions and expectations of the Christian Brothers; the financial situation of the school; support or lack of support from the college community and Edmund Rice Education. These factors make the realisation of authenticity a goal to be worked towards, rather than a concrete reality. In essence, this study concluded that, one overriding dilemma for principals was whether they were prepared to make the sometimes difficult decisions needed to ensure authenticity to the original Edmund Rice educational charism, or retain the status quo, with the knowledge that, in so doing, they may be militating against authenticity to the Edmund Rice educational vision.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Edmund Rice</field><field name="subject">Edmund Rice Charism</field><field name="subject">Catholic School Principals</field><field name="subject">Christian Brothers&#8217; Schools</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp175.16092008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Voice of Teachers in a Changing Hong Kong Society: the Study of the effectiveness of a school guidance programme for teacher development</field><field name="creator">Tung, Elaine Yee-Lai Cheung</field><field name="description">This research study examines the development of a school guidance programme in a teacher education institute in a turbulent Hong Kong environment. The focus of the study is the teachers&#8217; awareness of the impact of change, their beliefs in human nature, and the skills gained from the programme in dealing with student guidance issues in their classrooms. The study describes the political, economic and social changes in Hong Kong society after 1997 and the consequent impact on primary school teachers, educated and brought up in traditional Chinese families now facing student problems in their classrooms that are being addressed using Western humanistic theories and models.  The researcher has used a variety of essentially qualitative strategies. These include: participants&#8217; self-reflection; researcher&#8217;s observation and interviews on campus and in school classrooms; and teaching and learning materials. The effectiveness of the programme is judged to be in the teachers&#8217; awareness of the theories imparted, and the relevant skills that they gained, in dealing with these behavioural issues in their classrooms. The study explores how contemporary teachers deliver cognitive knowledge to pupils, but also can learn to play the role of guidance helper to their pupils. Thus, the focus is on affective professional teacher development. The contribution this research makes to our understanding is in its attempt to relate teachers&#8217; values and beliefs to their professional behaviour. It also contributes to an understanding of how Eastern and Western values interact in solving global educational issues. The study enters into the professional reflections of new generation of teachers in Hong Kong&#8217;s recent period of rapid cultural change.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School Guidance Programme</field><field name="subject">Teacher development</field><field name="subject">Hong Kong</field><field name="subject">Primary school teachers</field><field name="subject">Impact of change</field><field name="subject">Cultural change</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp27.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Catholic Education Office (CEO) Sydney as a Learning Organization and its Perceived Impact on Standards</field><field name="creator">Turkington, Mark</field><field name="description">The Catholic Education Office (CEO) Sydney is a large non-government education authority which administers the systemic, Catholic schools of the Archdiocese of Sydney, Australia. The system consists of 148 primary and secondary schools with an enrolment of some 62,000 students.  The major research question was: What characteristics of a learning organization can be identified in the Catholic Education Office (CEO) Sydney and are these perceived to raise standards in systemic schools of the Archdiocese of Sydney?  Like all western education systems the CEO Sydney is immersed in constant change and is expected to account for improving educational standards within the system.  The learning organization with its emphasis on adaptability and continuous improvement was considered an appropriate framework within which to conduct this research.  The study consisted of two main parts the first investigated the CEO Sydney as a learning organization using a survey questionnaire distributed, using a dedicated web site, to a sample of primary and secondary principals in the system and a smaller number of senior CEO Sydney personnel. The response rate was 91%. This was complemented by examination of relevant CEO Sydney documentation and policies.  The definition of the learning organization adopted for the study consisted of eight characteristics each of which formed a scale in the questionnaire. The eight characteristics adopted were: &#8216;Systemic Thinking and Mental Models&#8217;, &#8216;Continuous Improvement of Work&#8217;, &#8216;Taking Initiatives and Risks&#8217;, &#8216;Ongoing Professional Development&#8217;, &#8216;Trusting and Collaborative Climate&#8217;, &#8216;Shared and Monitored Vision/Mission&#8217;, &#8216;Effective Communication Channels&#8217; and &#8216;Team Work and Team Learning&#8217;. This part of the study was essentially a quantitative one, with the data subjected to descriptive, statistical analysis complemented by some clarifying and contextualising qualitative data.  The second part of the study investigated the perceived relationship between the CEO Sydney and its learning organization characteristics and the standards in three curriculum outcome areas (religious education, literacy and numeracy). This part of the study was also quantitative using descriptive statistics complemented by Pearson correlation, multiple regression and canonical correlational analyses. Once again some relevant contextualising qualitative data was gathered. Five demographic groups (gender, role, region (principals only), years of experience as a principal and age) were examined to see if there were any differences in the extent to which the various learning organization characteristics and curriculum outcomes were identified by each group.  The results of this study indicated that the CEO Sydney exhibited many of the characteristics of a learning organization with particular strengths in &#8216;Continuous Improvement of Work&#8217;, &#8216;Systemic Thinking and Mental Models&#8217; and &#8216;Shared and Monitored Vision/Mission&#8217;. The weakest characteristic was &#8216;Taking Initiatives and Risks&#8217;.  Demographic group analysis of this data revealed that there were no statistically significant differences in the responses of the different demographic groups.  The results also indicated that there were correlations between the CEO Sydney as a learning organization and raising standards particularly in religious education and literacy and less so in numeracy.  Finally, the study made a number of recommendations for the further development of the CEO Sydney as a learning organization and ways that it can further raise standards in the schools of the system.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sydney Catholic Education Office</field><field name="subject">Archdiocese of Sydney</field><field name="subject">Learning organisation</field><field name="subject">Educational standards</field><field name="subject">Curriculum outcomes</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp57.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Waiting: a critical experience</field><field name="creator">Van Dreven, Amber</field><field name="description">This study explores the experiences of relatives waiting. Often relatives wait for considerably long periods, especially in critical care areas, whilst their loved one, whose health status is unknown, receives care. To explore these experiences and to understand the symbolic meaning behind the participants&#146; stories, a grounded theory approach was utilised which is firmly rooted in the sociological theory of symbolic interactionism. A qualitative approach was employed in order to yield a rich description of the human experience often not found in quantitative studies (Jamerson, Scheibmeir, Bott, Crighton, Hinton and Kuckelman, 1996, p. 468). Similarly, the use of feminist principles to guide this study has facilitated a greater understanding of such issues as gender roles, language, power and hierarchy. Using grounded theory methodology, audio-taped interviews were conducted with six female relatives who were recruited using theoretical sampling. Simultaneous recruitment, data collection, analysis and literature review took place, as advocated and outlined by Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss (1967). The overarching core category discovered using this approach which epitomises the waiting experience, is the balancing of both positive and negative aspects of the four codes identified. These four codes are -mothering, trust, flustered anxiety and institutional and medical power. Each code had negative aspects, such as being denied the felt need to mother the critically ill loved one, being asked to entrust the health of a loved one to people that relatives had never met, feelings of fluster and anxiety, and a perception that they would interfere with medial care if they were to be involved in their loved one&#146;s care. Conversely, each code could potentially have a positive aspect, such as being involved in the care of the loved one, feelings of relief once the care of the loved one was entrusted to &#145;professional&#146; health care providers, affiliating with other relatives who were waiting in similar circumstances, and receiving frequent information from staff. A final model was produced that illustrates the balance that many relatives aspire to when waiting in the Emergency Department waiting room. If the balance tips in favour of the negative aspects of the codes, a negative impact on the relative&#146;s feelings of well being can result.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Experience of waiting</field><field name="subject">Critical care</field><field name="subject">Health status</field><field name="subject">Well being of relatives</field><field name="subject">Symbolic interactionism</field><field name="subject">Grounded theory methodology</field><field name="subject">Emergency Department waiting room</field><field name="subject">Mothering</field><field name="subject">Trust</field><field name="subject">Flustered anxiety</field><field name="subject">Institutional and medical power</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp12.25072005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Pledge of Future Glory: The Eschatological dimension of the Eucharist: A Systematic exploration</field><field name="creator">Vu, Chi Hy Paul</field><field name="description">The Eucharist is preeminently the sacrament of Christian hope. It is a foretaste of the eschatological banquet. Saint Thomas Aquinas, in the antiphon for the Magnificat on the feast of Corpus Christi, described the Eucharist as the pledge of future glory. It contains within it the memorial of Christ&#8217;s Passover and the anticipation of his coming in glory. Filled with hope, Christians celebrate the Eucharist as &#8220;a sacrament of love, a sign of unity, a bond of charity, a paschal banquet in which Christ is consumed, the mind is filled with grace, and a pledge of future glory is given to us&#8221; in anticipation. (Sacrosanctum Concilium, par. 47).  How this eschatological consciousness is related to the Eucharist is a question that deserves further exploration. While some authors have touched on the subject, there has been no systematic treatment of this theme since Geoffrey Wainwright&#8217;s Eucharist and Eschatology. Our thesis explores the contemporary insights into Eucharistic eschatology of Hans Urs von Balthasar, Francois-Xavier Durrwell, Gustave Martelet, and Louis-Marie Chauvet. We shall situate our study in terms of a current philosophical-phenomenological context of hope as explored by Gabriel Marcel and Ernst Bloch, and the questions of gift as discussed in the works of Robyn Horner, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Luc Marion and David Power.  To approach the Eucharist as the pledge of future glory is to discern the eschatological meaning of this sacrament and its relationship to Christian hope. If hope is essential to the human condition, then the Eucharist keeps hope alive within the Christian community and the world. As the sacrament of the Eschaton, the Eucharist activates hope in the present time for the consummation of God&#8217;s purposes for all humanity and for the fulfilment of God&#8217;s reign of justice, freedom and peace throughout creation. To celebrate the Eucharist is to participate in a &#8220;holy communion&#8221; with God through the bread and wine shared together. Such an eschatological communion foreshadows the future transformation of the whole cosmos into New Creation.  The Eucharist is thus the divine milieu where the Christian community celebrates the real presence of the risen and glorified Christ, and the eschatological grounds for its ultimate expectations. In order to celebrate the Eucharist as the pledge of future glory it is also important to recognize that the future glory which Christians anticipate through the Eucharist is God&#8217;s gift. It is a gift of grace to be received and cultivated with a sense of responsibility. The Eucharist inspires Christian hope and gives birth to creative human activity in the direction of the coming of the new heaven and new earth. Only when Christians recognize the future as eschatological gift, they will be able to commit themselves to building up the body of Christ in the world and at the same time dare to hope for the future glory in the fullness of God&#8217;s time. The Eucharistic hope thus embodies an ethical praxis that the Christian community is summoned to embody in their lives. The Christian community, gathered for prayers and thanksgiving, and for the &#8220;breaking of the bread&#8221; is itself an eschatological reality. It proclaims the real presence of the future that God has prepared for the whole of creation in Christ.  We seek to explore the notion that the Eucharist, as the sacrament of hope, is both a vision of the future and a celebration of the Christian community as it is nourished on the body and blood of Christ, the firstfruits of the Kingdom. It is significant because if God is our ultimate future glory it matters greatly that we understand and know that the gathering at the Eucharistic table confirms and extends our communion with God and with all creation. It is in this Eucharistic communion that hope is born. A foretaste of what is to come is already celebrated and given in Christ&#8217;s self-giving love. It is vital therefore that we explore the interconnection between the Eucharist and eschatology and attend to the meaning and practice of Christian hope. The thesis will conclude with a constructive retrieval of the eschatological dimension of the Eucharist as a pledge of the future glory.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eucharist</field><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="subject">Christian community</field><field name="subject">Sacraments</field><field name="subject">Eschatologyl</field><field name="subject">Hope</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp58.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of Clinical Assessment Processes of Student Nurses in Jakarta, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Wanda, Dessie</field><field name="description">Nursing in Indonesia is attempting to achieve a higher standard of education to enable nurses to migrate to global areas of nursing shortages. Assessment of nursing practice during undergraduate nursing education in Indonesia requires investigation to assist in achieving a higher standard of education. For assessment to occur, there are several variables reported in the literature that must be included in the process of assessment, that is assessors, students, methods and tools of measurement as well as clinical environment. It is acknowledged that those factors influence the successfulness of the clinical assessment process. The purpose of this descriptive exploratory study utilising a self report clinical instructor and student nurse questionnaire was to investigate the clinical assessment of Indonesian student nurses undertaking the professional stage of the undergraduate nursing course. Specifically, the study investigated how clinical teachers assess student nurses and how students perceive the clinical assessment process. Data were collected from four nursing institutions in Jakarta, Indonesia during July 2006. Quantitative and qualitative data analysis were undertaken to meet the purpose and objectives of the study. Quantitative data analysis utilised frequency tables, cross tabulations and ANOVA. Participants&#8217; responses to open-ended items were analysed using content analysis procedures. The findings of this study have shown that there are many important issues surrounding the assessment of Indonesian student nurses, such as the model of assessment process employed and the characteristics of clinical instructors, students and clinical environment. From this study, it was revealed that the assessment of student nurses employed skilledv based assessment, despite the global trends towards competency-based assessment. Findings from this study also illustrate that nursing education development has been occurring in Indonesia with already half of the clinical instructor participants being educated to master&#8217;s level and most student nurse participants held diploma III qualifications prior to their Bachelor of Nursing course, which means that they want to continue their study to a higher level. However, improvement in nursing curriculum which focuses on competency-based curriculum is needed. Improvement in the nursing curriculum will lead to improvements in the nursing profession. That is a higher standards of professionalism for nursing and nurses in Indonesia. Recommendations from the study include promoting changes in curriculum, particularly regarding the assessment process to employ competency-based assessment for student nurses. This study also endorses the use of a standardized assessment in clinical setting. In addition, further research related to replication of the study at a national level and comparison of clinical assessment in other countries should be conducted.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clinical assessment</field><field name="subject">Student nurses</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp157.05062008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploration of How Some Staff Members Perceive Catholic School Renewal in Some Primary Schools in the Catholic Diocese of Rockhampton</field><field name="creator">Watkins, Simon A. C.</field><field name="description">For the last forty years, since the end of the Second Vatican Council, the Catholic Church has been committed to renewal. In Queensland, Catholic schools have responded to this commitment by undertaking cyclical renewal processes since the early 1980s. The focus of this research was the process of Catholic School Renewal in the Catholic Diocese of Rockhampton, Queensland, Australia. The review of the literature focused on literature relating to school effectiveness and school improvement internationally and nationally, as well as Catholic School Renewal in Queensland generally and the Catholic Diocese of Rockhampton specifically. The following research questions focused the research design: 1. How is the process of Catholic School Renewal a source of potential growth? 2. How does the process of Catholic School Renewal ensure quality Catholic education? 3. How is the process of Catholic School Renewal a useful quality assurance tool? The epistemological stance adopted for the research was constructionism. The research paradigm adopted was interpretivism with social interactionism as the selected orientation. As case study is congruent with an interpretivist tradition of research it was adopted as a useful way of gaining insight into the perspectives of the participants. The case was comprised of some staff members who worked in one of four Catholic primary schools situated in three of the four regions of the Catholic Diocese of Rockhampton. Data collection took the form of semi-structured interviews and a survey questionnaire with the data being analysed using the constant comparative method. The study concluded that the process of Catholic School Renewal in the Diocese of Rockhampton is a useful quality assurance tool which helps to ensure quality Catholic education. Whether or not the process is a source of growth is dependent on a number of factors, paramount among which is the approach and ability of the Regional Supervisor of Schools. There were six major recommendations arising out of the research. These related to: 1. Ensuring the Regional Supervisor of Schools has certain attributes and knowledge. 2. Inservicing school staff on the purpose and nature of Catholic School Renewal. 3. Providing External Validation Team members with adequate inservice. 4. Permitting more involvement of the school principal in the process. 5. Initiating a review of the process of Catholic School Renewal in the Catholic Diocese of Rockhampton. 6.

Historically the Christian Brothers have had a significant impact on the development of Catholic education in this country through the development of a large network of Christian Brothers&#8217; schools. However the rapidity and depth of changes over the past two decades have threatened this position of strength and the schools now find themselves at a critical time. There is the possible risk of the gradual dilution of Christian Brothers&#8217; schools losing their special character and their God-given charism. The study investigated the means for the effective formal and informal transmission of the charism of Edmund Rice, and the influence of leadership styles and qualities on this transmission. The two main questions were asked are: What is needed for the effective formal and informal transmission of the charism of Edmund Rice? What leadership styles and leadership qualities are required of lay principals for this transmission? The study was situated in three schools that display one of the following characteristics: A Christian Brothers&#8217; school that had a lay principal for a period of more than five years. A Christian Brothers&#8217; school that currently had a Christian Brother as principal. A Christian Brothers&#8217; school that had recently changed from a religious principal to a lay principal and was in the associated processes of changing from a religious to lay leadership. The methodology used for this research study, was a case study, presented in the context of general qualitative methodology and specifically social research methodology. The major data-gathering approach was a questionnaire. Two questionnaires were used to collect the required data. The construction of the items were informed by key points, drawn from the literature review which, in turn were derived from educational leadership theories. The research undertaken in three Christian Brothers&#8217; schools resulted in: Understanding the leaders&#8217; perceptions of the charism of Edmund Rice; Identification of means for transmission of charism; Identification of styles of leadership and qualities of leadership which assist the transmission of charism; Informed Christian Brother&#8217;s schools of possible means for the transmission of the Edmund Rice charism in the future; and Suggested the provision of a formation program for recently appointed principals. The thesis concludes that the understanding of the Edmund Rice charism by future leaders of Christian Brothers&#8217; schools needs to reflect the contemporary context, that takes into account the need to provide access to a Catholic education by all those who seek it rather than preserving it for those who have the capacity to pay for it; and it needs to provide spiritually nourishing environments for students within these schools. Ultimately, a real and genuine attempt to engage all people in a Catholic education that is embedded in the tradition of Edmund Rice is required. Christian Brothers&#8217; schools require leaders who can promote and achieve the vision and mission of Christian Brothers&#8217; schools and live out the charter of Edmund Rice through example.

This survey of complete or partially through -composed settings of the eucharistic prayer attempts to shed some light on why and how composers have responded to the wide-spread opinion that the eucharistic prayer is rarely experienced as the high point of the eucharistic celebration as it was intended. Divided into two parts, the study initially considers the official aims and norms of the post-conciliar liturgy, both in general and as they pertain to the eucharistic prayer, noting some tension between the aims and their realisation. Three broad themes are identified for the entire work: ritual structure, the role of music and participation. The texts of the eucharistic prayers are then discussed to see how the official expectations are realised. A survey of the theoretical writings on rnusic and the eucharistic prayer concludes the first part. The second part focuses on over 100 musical settings, both published and unpublished d the eucharistic prayer. After offering a general chronological overview of the music, noting its forces and general characteristics, the music is scrutinised to see whether its various parts are celebrated or submerged by music, the broader shape of the compositions is examined and then a discussion concerning participation issues follows. The use of tabulated data aids the discussion. While acknowledging that there are many ways to evaluate the usefulness of such compositions and that this study does not touch on their actual reception and performance, it is hoped the current work will offer some insights into the variety of existing responses to the challenge of the setting the eucharistic prayer and offer some suggestions as to how this important work may continue.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eucharistic prayer</field><field name="subject">Church music composition</field><field name="subject">Catholic Church liturgy</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp59.25092005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher Learning Matters: The interrelationship between the personal and professional lives of rural teachers</field><field name="creator">Weadon, Helen Ann</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to highlight the growing understanding that schools and all its members are continually learning. This has provided a new lens for educationists to view the professional and personal needs of teachers. Goodson (1996) refers to the fact that researchers have often omitted the &#8216;lived voice&#8217; of the teacher in educational research. By this he means that the life stories and experiences of teachers, told by themselves, are ruled out as irrelevant data by many researchers. The early work of Hall and Morgan (as cited in Queensland Consortium for Professional Development in Education (1996)., and later Dreyfus and Dreyfus (1996) who based their work on the stages of nurse development, but adapted to assist with understanding the professional and personal lives of teachers, formed the initial interest in exploring the under researched area of teachers&#8217; lives. This qualitative research study explores the interrelationship between the personal and professional lives of teachers especially those in mid to late careers in rural areas. Participants in this study completed a written survey and then oral contributions through focus groups or interviews. A model which illustrated the critical influences on teachers&#8217; professional learning in their school was developed as a result of the analyses of the teacher data. This model highlighted the need for the provision of professional learning opportunities that incorporate the four major themes which emerged from this study. It also showed the need to maintain a learning culture in a school that is inclusive of all teachers regardless of their life or career stage. Reactions to this model were then obtained from the school principals, and from professionals working in the education system office. These reactions showed distinct variations to those of teachers. The teachers clearly had the view that teacher learning does matter to the life of a learning community. The challenge for rural schools is to provide teachers with professional learning opportunities that incorporate adult learning principles and empower teachers to take control of their own professional and personal learning.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="subject">Rural teachers</field><field name="subject">Teacher needs</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp171.29082008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical Activity, Aerobic Fitness, Body Composition and Asthma Severity in Children and Adolescents</field><field name="creator">Welsh, Liam</field><field name="description">The investigations described in this thesis were conducted in order to increase the understanding of the relationships between physical activity, aerobic fitness, body composition, asthma, and asthma severity in children and adolescents. This was largely achieved by examining the aforementioned factors in a sizeable population of Melbourne school children and adolescents. However, during the course of the school-based testing, it became apparent that the severe asthmatic category was under-represented, typical of the current literature. Thus, effort was also directed at addressing this knowledge gap by examining a severely asthmatic cohort in a laboratory-based setting. The outcomes generated by these investigations can be summarised as follows: 1) In &#8216;school-tested&#8217; youth aged 10 to 14 years, prevalence rates of overweight and obesity were 19.1% and 4.0%, respectively. Approximately 16% of participants also suffered from asthma. These rates appear to be representative of similarly aged children and adolescents within Australia. The latter observation also adds weight to the view that asthma prevalence has attenuated in recent years. In addition, overweight and obesity were more prevalent in asthmatics than non-asthmatics, supporting the proposed notion of an asthma-obesity association. 2) Asthmatic and non-asthmatic young people had comparable aerobic fitness and daily physical activity levels and the severity of disease did not influence aerobic fitness nor involvement in physical activity. Males possessed greater aerobic fitness and physical activity levels and had a lower percentage body fat compared to age-matched females, independent of asthma status (i.e. asthmatic or non-asthmatic). 3) There was a significant inverse relationship between aerobic fitness and markers of increased body fat among non-asthmatic children and adolescents, even after corrections to aerobic fitness were made for fat free mass. Differences in daily physical activity could only partially explain this association. In fact, the current findings suggest that decreased levels of daily physical activity are not the cause of the increased overweight/obesity prevalence among this sample, and that physical activity lacks a strong link to paediatric overweight/obesity in this population. These findings were also present in asthmatic youth. 4) Severely asthmatic youth, premedicated with bronchodilator, had aerobic fitness levels comparable to their non-asthmatic and less severe asthmatic peers. This finding indicates that severely asthmatic youngsters should be able to train at work intensities sufficient to bring about improvements in cardio-respiratory fitness without any added functional limitation due to their condition. In addition, a state of well-controlled asthma (as were the severe asthmatics in this study) afforded the participants the ability to engage in similar levels of physical activity as their non-asthmatic or less severe asthmatic peers. In agreement with data from the &#8216;school-tested&#8217; asthmatics, a significantly greater proportion of severely asthmatic participants were overweight or obese in comparison to their non-asthmatic peers. These findings (i) highlight the association between aerobic fitness and overweight/obesity; (ii) suggested that decreased levels of daily physical activity were not associated with the increased overweight/obesity prevalence in a youth sample within Australia; (iii) emphasize that well-controlled asthmatic young people can undertake levels of physical activity and achieve cardio-respiratory fitness similar to that of their non-asthmatic peers, independent of asthma severity, and; (iv) indicated that asthma is either a risk factor for overweight and obesity or that overweight and obesity may precede asthma.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">Aerobic fitness</field><field name="subject">Body composition</field><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">Children and Adolescents</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp159.05062008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender and School: Policy directions, practice and leadership</field><field name="creator">Wenham, Anne Maria</field><field name="description">Since the mid 1970s student experience of gender at school has been the focus of intense media scrutiny, academic research and policy development for schools in Australia. This study took as its focus the role of the school principal as a leader for gender equity in schools. It set out to determine the response of 35 Catholic K-6 schools to gender policy directions as contained in gender policy documents published for Australian schools between 1975 and 1997 and to use these findings to determine implications for school leadership for gender equity.  The study encompassed three interlinked research phases which contributed to specific learnings about leadership for gender equity. The first research phase entailed a critical analysis of gender policy documents for Australian schools leading to the development of a Policy Analysis Template. Utilisation of the template resulted in a synthesis of gender policy implications which formed the basis for examination of school practice in a sample of K-6 Catholic schools in the next two research phases. The second research phase examined student experience of gender at school using a questionnaire and the third research phase studied teacher and principal experience of gender reform utilising questionnaires.  Data analysis methods included content analysis of policy documents, statistical analysis of questionnaire responses to determine particular connections and to identify emerging trends in the data and analysis of the qualitative responses to provide validation and further insights. The research tools developed for this study provide possibilities for future work in gaining insights into policy implementation in schools.  The research results confirmed the findings of the implementation literature in terms of leadership. The response of schools to gender policy directions was strongly influenced by a principal who could not only articulate a vision of gender equity but who also had a commitment to translating this vision into practice. The findings also demonstrated a clear link between a school&#8217;s commitment to its proclaimed values, formed and shaped by its Catholic ethos and its response to gender equity issues through actual practice. Thus school responses to gender policy directions were seen to be informed and influenced by their articulated vision and mission.  Furthermore, results demonstrated that specific gender policy directions had been adopted by schools whereas others had resulted in little or no impact at all. It was beyond the scope of this study to investigate the factors that enabled or inhibited school response to particular gender policy directions although specific gender policy reform priorities were signalled for principal attention.  The focus of this study was on the emerging connections and relationships between gender policy directions, student experience of gender at school and teacher and principal experience of gender reform. The recommendations of the study addressed the role of the principal in fostering school commitment to equity practices.  The study which utilised a sample of 35 Catholic K-6 schools demonstrated the significant role of the principal in gender reform. The impact of gender policy directions on actual school practice was seen to be dependent on the vision for gender equity and commitment to implement this into practice that the school principal brings to the role of leadership for gender equity.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School principal</field><field name="subject">Gender equity</field><field name="subject">Catholic K-6 schools</field><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="subject">Policy Analysis Template</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp28.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relational Standards: Rules and Expectations in Romantic Relationships</field><field name="creator">West, Alexandra Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Romantic relationships are assumed to be guided by norms and rules, however research in the field of personal relationships has not directly addressed the area of relationship rules in romantic relationships, but has investigated their violations, with a specific focus on examples such as infidelity and deception. The present research program provides the first comprehensive study of rules and expectations in romantic relationships. The overall aim of the research is to explore the types of rules and expectations, or relational standards that exist in romantic relationships, how they come to exist, and their function within relationships. Given the lack of research on relational standards, a program of four studies, utilising both qualitative and quantitative methods was proposed to address the research aims. A combination of methods was deemed appropriate as qualitative methods would allow exploration of the types of relational standards that exist in romantic relationships, while quantitative methods could be used to explore their structure, function, and potential correlates. An initial study of the use of deception was based on previous work by the author. This study aimed to combine research on the strategies of deceptive use, with the motivations that are provided for engaging in deception, in order to further understand how deception is used in romantic relationships. A survey of 152 individuals currently in romantic relationships demonstrated that individuals tend to use multiple strategies when they engage in deception, and prefer to use less overt strategies than lying. Consistent with research on victim and perpetrator accounts, individuals believed their partners would view the deception as more serious than they themselves would. Deception can be viewed as one example of the violation of major relationship rules and expectations regarding trust and honesty, which prompted the question of what other rules and expectations exist in romantic relationships. This question provided the impetus for the subsequent studies, the aims of which were to explore what rules and expectations exist in romantic relationship, and how they come to exist. A qualitative study using focus groups and interviews with couples enabled the development of 16 categories about which rules and expectations typically exist. These categories described both the emotional aspects of a relationship, such as loyalty, fidelity, help and support, and the day-to-day functioning of a relationship, such as those regarding roles and time allocation. A third study, using quantitative methods, presented the 16 categories to 106 individuals in order to validate the categories, investigate how they come to exist (whether they are discussed or exist as expectations) and explore their function in terms of their importance to the relationship and levels of threat and (un)forgivability when they are violated. It also sought to explore whether relational standards were related to a measure of adjustment, specifically one.s self-restraint. All 16 categories were endorsed, and were generally seen as being common in most relationships, and important to a relationship.s functioning. The categories differed in their importance, threat and unforgivability, with rules and expectations about the emotional aspects of a relationship consistently rated as more important than rules and expectations about the procedural aspects of a relationship. The number of rules endorsed, and the types of rules discussed and expected, were not related to an individual.s adjustment. A final study of 45 couples aimed to replicate the results from the third study, as well as explore whether there was agreement in partners. responses. The final study also investigated whether relational standards were related to individual factors such as adjustment, personality, and the tendency to betray, and relationship variables such as trust, satisfaction and commitment. The results confirmed the pattern of endorsement found in the third study, that rules and expectations regarding the emotional aspects of relationship are regarded as the most important, and the most threatening and unforgivable when violated. Rules and expectations regarding the procedural aspects or the day-to-day functioning of the relationship are seen as least important to therelationship, and least threatening and easily forgiven when violated. The present research program demonstrated that there are identifiable areas about which couples have rules and expectations, and that these form a hierarchy based on their importance to the relationship. No differences were found in the way that relational standards come to exist, and relational standards were not found to be related to either individual or relationship factors. The identification of rule and expectation categories may help couples clarify their expectations of each other, and reduce potential areas of conflict. They also provide a starting point from which to further explore the importance of relational standards to relationship functioning.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Relationship expectations</field><field name="subject">Relationship rules</field><field name="subject">Romantic relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp135.05022007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visual Art, the Artist and Worship in the Reformed Tradition: a Theological study</field><field name="creator">Wheeler, Geraldine Jean</field><field name="description">The Reformed tradition, following Zwingli and especially Calvin, excluded images from the churches. Calvin rejected the sacred images of his day as idolatrous on the grounds that they were treated as making God present, that the necessary distinction between God and God&#8217;s material creation was not maintained, and because an image, which rightly was to be mimetic of visible reality, could not truthfully depict God. Calvin approved the Renaissance notion of visual art as mimetic and he understood that artists&#8217; abilities were gifts of God and were to be used rightly. He also had a very keenly developed visual aesthetic sense in relation to nature as the &#8220;mirror&#8221; of God&#8217;s glory. However, the strong human tendency towards idolatry before images, he believed, meant that it was not expedient to place any pictures in the churches.  Reinterpretation of key biblical passages, particularly the first and second commandments (Calvin&#8217;s numbering), together with changes in the understanding of what constitutes visual art, of the relationships between words and visual images, and of the processes of interpretation and reception not only of texts but of all perceived reality, lead to a re-thinking of the issues.  The biblical narrative with its theological insights can be interpreted into a visual language and used by the church as complementary to, but never replacing, biblical preaching and teaching in words. Attention to the visual aesthetic dimensions of the worship space is important to allow for this space to function as an invitation and call to worship. Its form, colour, light and adorning may give aesthetic delight, which leads to praise and thanksgiving, or it may provoke other response which helps people prepare to offer worship to God. The world and its people depicted in visual art/image may inform the praying of the church and the visual representation of the church (the saints) may provide congregations with an awareness of the breadth of the church at worship in heaven and on earth.  In the present diversity of views about visual art and the work of the artist there is freedom for the artist to re-think the question of vocation and artists may find new opportunities for understanding and exercising their vocation not only in secular art establishments and the community but also in relation to the worship of the church.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sacred images</field><field name="subject">Worship</field><field name="subject">Reformed Tradition</field><field name="subject">Visual representation</field><field name="subject">Depiction of God</field><field name="subject">Visual art</field><field name="subject">Christian church</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp41.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of Catholic School Consultants in New South Wales: Their leadership, relationship with principals and influence on schools</field><field name="creator">Whelan, Anthony</field><field name="description">How do the Catholic Schools Consultants through their leadership and relationship with Principals influence the outcomes of Catholic systemic schools in New South Wales (NSW)? This research question has been of considerable interest to the professional communities of Catholic educators. Throughout NSW there are eleven diocesan Catholic school systems, each led by a Director assisted by senior field officers called Consultants, the equivalent position of Area superintendents or inspectors in other school systems. The leadership of these Consultants is considered critical for the effectiveness of the school systems especially through their influence on and with Principals. Within this survey research study, the total population of Consultants and Principals was invited to participate, and 45 Consultants (90%) and 365 Principals (76%) responded. The research study was based on the assumption that a &#145;classical&#146; view of leadership should be augmented by a more complex, interactive view of leadership as relationship that influenced outcomes in school systems. The study was operationalized in three dimensions. Leadership was described by ten variables, derived from Sashkin&#146;s (1998) Visionary Leadership Theory. The relationship between Consultant and Principals was posited as a composite of two variables, Interpersonal Relation and Shared Catholic Leadership Mindset, that are viewed as explanatory, mediating variables. Three selected outcome variables are posited &#150; Educational Outcomes, School Outcomes and Spiritual Outcomes. The fifteen variables so described were developed and/or validated for this study using confirmatory factor analysis. Additionally, the impact of three demographic background factors of gender, school type, and years of networking association between Consultant and Principals on the main variables in the study was examined. A mediated &#150; effects survey research design was used. Survey questionnaires were sent from the local Catholic Education Office to each volunteer Consultant and to her/his associated network of Principals on a confidential basis and returned directly to the researcher. At no stage did the researcher know the identity of the respondents. Data analysis methods included comparative means analysis of Consultants&#146; and Principals&#146; perceptions of the variables; multiple regression analysis and structural equation modelling to examine the associations between variables; MANOVA analysis to examine demographic background factors; and finally some descriptive analysis of survey data to provide validation or further insights. The study results showed that both Consultants and Principals agreed that the Consultants demonstrated visionary leadership as defined by Sashkin (1998) although there were significant differences on seven leadership factors. There was high level agreement that Consultants and Principals exhibited a shared mindset, described as Shared Catholic Leadership Mindset, and outstanding interpersonal relationships. Findings about the associations between variables showed different results for Principals and Consultants. The &#145;Principals&#146; model suggested that the two relationship variables acted as mediators between some of the ten leadership variables and the three outcome variables. On the other hand, the &#145;Consultants&#146; model suggested that neither of the two relationship variables acted as mediators, but that only two leadership variables, Capable Management and Creative Leadership, had any influence on Outcomes. There were no significant differences on results due to gender, school type or years of networking association for either Principals or Consultants. These results, supplemented by qualitative findings, led to the conclusion that there was a need for system policy makers to reconceptualise the leadership of such Consultants to emphasise the importance of the shared mindset, and the synergistic element in the relationship between Consultant and Principals. There was a recommendation that further research replicate this study with other Catholic, Government and independent education systems. The use of structural equation modelling analysis in similar future research was also recommended.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic Schools Consultants</field><field name="subject">Catholic School Principals</field><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="subject">Educational Outcomes</field><field name="subject">School Outcomes</field><field name="subject">Spiritual Outcomes</field><field name="subject">Shared Catholic Leadership Mindset</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp2.14072005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pedagogy &#8211; The Missing Link in Religious Education: Implications of brain-based learning theory for the development of a pedagogical framework for religious education</field><field name="creator">White, Dan</field><field name="description">Over the past three decades, the development of religious education in Australia has been largely shaped by catechetical and curriculum approaches to teaching and learning. To date, little emphasis has been placed on the pedagogical dimension of religious education. The purpose of this research project is to explore the manner in which &#8216;brain-based&#8217; learning theory contributes to pedagogical development in primary religious education. The project utilises an action research methodology combining concept mapping, the application of &#8216;brain-based&#8217; teaching strategies and focus group dialogue with diocesan Religious Education Coordinators (RECs).  The insights derived contribute to the formulation and validation of an appropriate pedagogical model for primary religious education, entitled the &#8216;DEEP Framework&#8217;. The model reflects an integration of insights from brain-based theory with nuances from the contemporary Australian religious education literature. The project identifies four key, interactive principles that are crucial to pedagogical development in religious education, namely: Discernment, Enrichment, Engagement and Participation. It also recognises a fifth principle, &#8216;an orientation towards wholeness&#8217;, as significant in combining the various pedagogical principles into a coherent whole.  The DEEP framework enables teachers to more successfully select and evaluate appropriate, interconnecting teaching strategies within the religious education classroom. The framework underpins the pedagogical rationale of the recently developed Archdiocese of Hobart religious education program and forms the basis for the implementation of a coherent professional development program across the Archdiocese.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pedagogy</field><field name="subject">Pedagogical development</field><field name="subject">Religious education in Australia</field><field name="subject">Brain-based learning theory</field><field name="subject">Brain-based teaching strategies</field><field name="subject">Primary schools</field><field name="subject">DEEP framework</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp60.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Call for a Level Playing Field A Study of Masculinity 1999&#8211;2000</field><field name="creator">White, Greer</field><field name="description">The impetus of this study was a concern for the education and general welfare of boys. The interest in boys&#8217; education has grown notably over the past ten years. This interest is evident in media reports, popular psychology texts, education reports and scholarly writing. Academic research on boys&#8217; experience of education is less prolific although it does include studies conducted by Australian and international researchers. Central to this commentary on boys&#8217; education is the concept of masculinity. Here there is a strong claim that boys&#8217; academic performance and behaviour is influenced by the way they construct and live out masculine expressions.  This research study is situated in a Catholic secondary school for boys (referred to as the College) and seeks to illumine the school experiences of students at the school. As school Counsellor I noted that some boys were displaying a lack of motivation for learning, resisted independent thinking and seemed to be opposed to authority. These characteristics, in turn, contributed to diminished academic performance and troublesome classroom behaviour. This observation raised issues in respect to the boys&#8217; perceptions of masculinity and the various expressions of masculinity within the school.  An analysis of historical and contemporary documents identified a mismatch between the stated vision and mission of the school and the structural organization it creates. This mismatch pointed to a critical gap between the stated purpose of its education and the social reality of boys&#8217; educational experience. This critical gap was particularly evident in the school&#8217;s commitment to educating boys within a social justice framework. It seemed that investigation into the gender regime of the school and the implications this has for students was warranted.  A review of literature in respect to the concept of masculinity and boys&#8217; education served to further clarify the research problem and the purpose of this study. This review identified the various contemporary understandings of masculinity. It also explored the current debate about what is happening to boys in education and provided an outline of particular elements of the social constructionist&#8217;s understanding of collective masculinity expressions within a school setting. Commentary on how a school can configure its particular gender regime was of particular interest to this study. This review identified three research questions to guide this study. These questions are: Research Question 1: How do the students of the College understand masculinity? Research Question 2: What is the College&#8217;s gender regime? Research Question 3: What are the implications for students of the College&#8217;s gender regime? This research study was informed by a pragmatic understanding of the epistemology of constructivism and the principles associated with the theoretical framework of symbolic interactionism. A two-stage research design of exploration and inspection was employed to aid data collection, analysis and interpretation. In the exploratory stage data was collected through a questionnaire to 255 of the 301 Year 12 cohort. These data were analysed using both quantitative and qualitative methods and the results gave direction to the type of data needed in the second stage of the study, the stage of inspection. In the stage of inspection, data were obtained through two processes, one-to-one interviews and focus group discussions. An analysis of data collected in the second stage of the study led to the identification of a number of key findings in the way boys understand masculinity and the school has organized its gender regime. These findings highlight the domination of playing sport and the subordination and marginalization of other masculine expressions. They also give evidence of the existence of a critical gap between the school&#8217;s stated purpose based on Christian values, justice, holistic development, respect for the dignity of the individual, human striving and so on, and the reality it produces. The study concludes by outlining a number of recommendations that suggest themselves for the future development of the College. It recommends that the school introduce a gender education programme for students, review the gender regime that supports playing sport as the dominant masculine expression, and provide structures and opportunity for other masculine expressions to find approval and acceptance. Finally it is recommended that the vision that the school holds for the education of boys and its structural organization be open to scrutiny and exploration in order that what the school holds to be most important in the education of boys will be intentionally pursued.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Masculinity</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Boys&#8217; education</field><field name="subject">Catholic secondary schools</field><field name="subject">Student school experiences</field><field name="subject">Gender Education</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp61.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indigenous Women&#8217;s Career Development: voices that challenge educational leadership</field><field name="creator">White, Nereda Dawn</field><field name="description">This research focuses on deepening our understanding about Indigenous women&#8217;s participation in contemporary Australian society by exploring their experiences in employment, careers, education and leadership. Since the purpose of this study is to explore how university education Indigenous women understand and make sense of it of their career journeys, the epistemological framework of the research is constructionism using an interpretivist approach. The particular interprevetivist perspective used is symbolic interactionism, but the research has also been guided philosophically by the Indigenous worldview and emerging Indigenous research methodologies which assert the right of Indigenous people to research in their own way. The methodology adopted is a case study approach in keeping with the aim of the study. Data was collected by in-depth interviews to build the women&#8217;s stories, focus groups, and researcher&#8217;s journal. Throughout the study, there was a strong emphasis on observing ethical guidelines for research on and with Indigenous people. The research design aimed to honour cultural dimensions such as Indigenous knowledge, ways of knowing and culturally appropriate data gathering techniques. The study found that Indigenous women are deeply committed to their personal and professional growth. However there are enormous barriers, both personal and institutional, to their success. Vestiges of colonialism such as racism, sexism, socio-economic and educational disadvantage remain entrenched in contemporary Australian society. Despite these obstacles, Indigenous women through their strength, resilience and determination, strive to make better lives for themselves, their families and communities. Their stories are significant in that they offer important insights into how Indigenous women can be supported on their career journeys.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous women</field><field name="subject">Educational leadership</field><field name="subject">Australian society</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp132.17052007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the Wall: Ballarat Female Refuge: a Case study in moral authority</field><field name="creator">Wickham, Dorothy Glennys</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the Ballarat Female Refuge, the first such institution on the Australian goldfields, as a case study of the interrelationship between charity and power. Established in 1867 by a group of twenty-six Protestant women with the intention of reforming prostitutes, the Refuge became a shelter for single mothers. An analysis of its history over the period 1867 to 1921 highlights attitudes towards female sexuality, and demonstrates how moral authority was exercised through this highly-gendered institution.  The thesis locates the Ballarat Female Refuge within both an international history of female refuges and the network of voluntary charities which developed in nineteenth-century Ballarat. It argues that such charities were influential in the consolidation of class barriers in the goldfields city.

The latter two groups performed single-leg drop-landings (3 sessions.wk-1 and 50 landings.session-1) from 14cm and 28cm, respectively using the non-dominant leg. Single-leg peak ground-reaction impact forces (PGRIF) in a sub-sample ranged between 2.5 &#8211; 4.4 x body-weight (BW). No differences (p&gt;0.05) among groups at baseline for age, stature, lean tissue mass (LTM - DXA - Lunar 3.6-DPX), leisure time physical activity or average daily calcium intake were detected. No significant within group changes for between leg differences from baseline to post-training and no significant differences among groups at baseline, or in magnitude of change for any of the dominant or non-dominant (loaded) leg bone mineral content (BMC g) measures determined by DXA &#8211; loaded leg total - 19.06, 25.5, 25.46 [p=.156], femoral neck - 0.14, 0.11, 0.15 [p=.959], greater trochanter - 0.37, 0.06, 0.26 [p=.733], mid femoral shaft - 3.87, 3.87, 3.42 [p=.677] for the C, LD and HD groups, respectively, after adjusting for the covariates baseline body and fat mass, and change in LTM (ANCOVA) were observed. Similarly, following ANCOVA adjustments no significant differences for changes in calcaneal speed of sound and broadband ultrasound attenuation (CUBA Clinical), DXA derived changes in femoral neck (-0.009, 0.033, -0.009; p=.189) and total MFS (0.029, 0.041, 0.053; p=.447) volumetric BMD (g.cm-3), or MFS cortical volumetric BMD, the latter derived by a new technique combining MRI and DXA were identified. TBBMC changed by 79.6g-C, 100.2g-LD and 91.9g-HD (p=.339). Combining data from both exercise groups to increase statistical power produced similar results. No significant within group changes for between leg differences from baseline to post-training and no significant differences among groups at baseline, or in magnitude of change for any of the dominant or non-dominant (loaded) leg bone geometrical (area cm2) determined by MRI using ANALYZE&#174; software of proximal - 22.18, 12.91, 19.86 [p=.248], mid - 19.83, 15.91, 19.64 [p=.233], or distal - 14.78, 16.07, 13.35 [p=.792], slice cortical area for the C, LD and HD groups, respectively, after adjusting for the covariates baseline body and fat mass, and change in LTM (ANCOVA) were detected. Similarly there were no significant biomechanical cross sectional moment of inertia (CSMI cm4) changes determined by Scion Image&#174; (Frederick, Maryland: Version-Beta 3B) and a custom macro program of proximal - 896, 815, 649 [p=.415], mid - 1054, 806, 1087 [p=.471], or distal - 1197, 1079, 966 [p=.606], slice CSMI for the C, LD and HD groups, respectively after adjusting for the same covariates.

Mangrove habitats have expanded both seawards and landwards, the latter being at the expense of saltmarsh habitats. This relatively common phenomenon is generally suggested to be an outcome of sea-level rise. Several factors potentially responsible for this change are examined, including changes in mean sealevel during the past 50 to 100 years, changes in climate, population growth, catchment landuse, and estuary type.  A protocol for mapping estuarine habitats was developed and implemented, incorporating the application of geographic information systems. Spatial and temporal coastal wetland habitat changes at nine sites along the New South Wales coast are illustrated. These habitat dynamics were shown to not correlate between sites. The results demonstrate that sea-level rise in this region cannot solely account for the extent of change during the past sixty years. With the exception of one site (Careel Bay), there have been no correlations between contemporary mean sea-level rise and mangrove incursion of the saltmarsh habitats at the study sites, or with rainfall patterns, at the scale of observation in this study, which was largely decadal. The only correlations determined during this study have been between population growth and coastal wetland habitat dynamics in some sites.  In spite of saltmarsh habitat loss being a regional phenomenon, local factors appear to have a profound bearing on the rates of change. Neither contemporary mean sea-level rise, rainfall patterns, estuary type, catchment landuse, catchment natural cover nor population pressure can account solely for the patterns in the spatial and temporal dynamics of the coastal wetlands of New South Wales. It seems apparent that regional factors create preconditions favourable for mangrove incursion, but that localised conditions have been responsible for the extent of these incursions from site to site.  That is, despite higher sea-level and greater rainfall, the extent of change has been determined by the unique characteristics of each site.  The results have important implications for current estuary management practices in the state of New South Wales. The lack of spatial and temporal trends in coastal wetland habitat dynamics point to the need for management to be conducted on a localised, rather than regional scale. Additionally, anthropogenic influences must be carefully managed, since the extent of mangrove habitat expansion into saltmarsh areas is unlikely to be a natural occurrence.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intertidal wetland habitats</field><field name="subject">Mangrove habitats</field><field name="subject">Saltmarsh habitats</field><field name="subject">Coastal wetlands</field><field name="subject">Southeastern Australia</field><field name="subject">New South Wales coast</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp29.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vegetation Changes in a Large Estuarine Wetland Subsequent to Construction of Floodgates: Hexham Swamp in the Lower Hunter Valley, New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Winning, Geoffrey Bruce</field><field name="description">Floodgates were constructed in 1971 on the main creek draining Hexham Swamp, a large wetland on the floodplain of the lower Hunter River, New South Wales. Substantial changes in vegetation have occurred in Hexham Swamp subsequent to the construction of the floodgates. Previous areas of mangroves and saltmarsh have been reduced (180ha to 11ha, and 681ha to 58ha, respectively), and Phragmites australis has expanded (170ha to 1005ha). Much of the mangrove loss (ca. 130ha) was a result of clearing, and the remainder has gradually died off. The factors contributing to the dieback are likely to be a combination of drying of the soil, root competition and, at times, waterlogging. Field sampling as well as microcosm and reciprocal transplant experiments involving key species, Sarcocornia quinqueflora, Sporobolus virginicus, Paspalum vaginatum and Phragmites australis, suggest that a reduction in soil salinity has been an important factor in initiating successional change from saltmarsh to Phragmites reedswamp. The data also suggest that increased waterlogging has been an important factor in initiating vegetation change. This apparently paradoxical result (floodgates and associated drainage generally result in drying of wetlands) is likely to have resulted from occlusion of drainage lines (by sediment and reeds) and is, therefore, likely to be a condition that developed gradually. That is, the initial effect of the floodgates is expected to have been a drying of the swamp, followed over time by an increasing wetness. An examination of vegetation changes after removal of cattle from part of Hexham Swamp, suggests that grazing had little effect on species composition of vegetation or rate of expansion of Phragmites australis. However, grazing does affect vegetation structure (height and density), possibly favours some coloniser species (e.g. Sarcocornia quinqueflora) in particular environmental conditions, and possibly inhibits establishment of Phragmites australis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Estuarine wetland</field><field name="subject">Floodgates</field><field name="subject">Vegetation changes</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp107.11092006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Contextual Interference and Variability of Practice on the Acquisition of a Motor Task and Transfer to a Novel Task</field><field name="creator">Wrathall, Stephen</field><field name="description">AIM  The purpose of this experiment is to assess whether the advantages of variable practice are due to schema formation or to enhanced information processing (contextual interference) alone.  DESIGN  The design involved a 2 (mode; cognitive and motor) x 5 (practice schedule; blocked, random, constant distance one, constant distance two, and constant distance three) between subjects design resulting in ten groups. One hundred participants were randomly chosen from Human Movement students at Australian Catholic University and assigned to each of the ten groups (n=10).  The cognitive mode involved the participants having to recognise the appropriate target from three geometrical shapes (triangle, square or circle), the triangle being the target in every case. The motor mode involved the participants having to tap on the target among three boxes that was merely filled in. The experiment consisted of ninety (3 blocks of 30) acquisition trials followed by ten transfer trials to a novel movement.  MAIN HYPOTHESIS  It was hypothesised that if facilitated transfer to a novel target occurs through schema formation, then there would be no differences between the motor groups and their corresponding cognitive groups. However, if facilitated transfer to a novel target occurs through enhanced information processing, then there would be differences between the motor groups and their corresponding cognitive groups.  RESULTS  Statistical analysis revealed a contextual interference effect for participants involved in the cognitive mode, in that the cognitive blocked group outperformed the cognitive random group in acquisition, but the reverse was the case in transfer. In the motor mode, the motor blocked group outperformed the motor random group in acquisition, and repeated the performance in transfer.  CONCLUSION  The results appear to indicate that for simple motor tasks it is the amount of variability of practice that is important for transfer to a novel task, while for tasks with a cognitive component, the schedule of practice is critical.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motor task acquisition</field><field name="subject">Novel task transfer</field><field name="subject">Variable practice</field><field name="subject">Schema formation</field><field name="subject">Information processing</field><field name="subject">Contextual interference</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp63.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Games on the Acquisition of Some Grammatical Features of L2 German on Students&#8217; Motivation and on Classroom Atmosphere</field><field name="creator">Yu, Shu-yun</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this study is to explore the effects of the use of games as a teaching strategy for raising the grammatical accuracy level of secondary students of German as a second language. This thesis seeks also to examine the effect of game-based grammar instruction on students&#8217; motivation and classroom atmosphere. The participants in this study were divided into two groups, the Control and Experimental groups, and received 90 periods, over 18 weeks, of grammatical instruction by the same teacher. The teaching program was the same for both groups. The difference consisted in the use of game-based practice for the experimental group, while the control group performed traditional grammar-based practice only. Data were collected using the following instruments: grammar tests and examinations,a questionnaire on motivation, a questionnaire on classroom atmosphere, a questionnaire on the type of grammar practice, a questionnaire on the role of grammar and grammar instruction, focus group interviews with students, and the researcher&#8217;s field notes. While the main result does not support the hypothesis for significant improvement in grammatical accuracy by the experimental students as a result of game-based practice, their overall improved performance is a worthwhile achievement, particularly if it is linked to significant improvements in students&#8217; motivation and classroom atmosphere.These positive results offer a notable incentive to language teachers to include games in their teaching of grammatical features, because the positive results of this experiment with regard to learners&#8217; motivation, peer interaction, teacher-student interaction augur well for an eventual improvement also in the rate of grammatical accuracy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Language teaching</field><field name="subject">German language</field><field name="subject">Game based grammar instruction</field><field name="subject">Teaching strategies</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp98.29052006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spectroelectrochemical Studies of Surface Species in the Gold/Thiosulfate System</field><field name="creator">Watling, Kym Marjorie</field><field name="description">This thesis presents results of studies using the technique of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy to investigate surface processes occurring on gold during electrochemical experiments in thiosulfate solutions and during leaching in ammoniacal copper(II) thiosulfate systems.  The gold SERS electrode was characterised using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). SEM investigations of the SERS activated gold surface showed the presence of electrodeposited dendrites with nanoscale features.  XRD studies of the dendrites showed them to be polycrystalline with a large proportion of Au(111).  Rotating disk electrode (RDE) studies of polished and SERS electrodes were undertaken in order to clarify the electrochemistry of various thiosulfate systems.  The ex situ techniques of XPS and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy were used to determine the presence of sulfur, copper and nitrogen on leached or electro-oxidised surfaces.  Voltammetric methods were used to determine sulfur and copper surface coverages at various potentials in sulfide, thiosulfate and ammoniacal copper(II) thiosulfate media.  The electro-oxidation of sulfide was examined as a model system in order to identify spectral features and coverage associated with various potential-dependent sulfur layers.  In the hydrogen evolution region, a surface layer formed by underpotential deposition in acid and basic media was characterised by a gold-sulfur stretching band, &#61550;Au-S, attributed in the literature to a monoatomic stretching mode of sulfur bonded to gold.  The surface coverage in this potential region was limited to 0.35 ML, representing adsorption in a (&#61654;3x&#61654;3)R30&#61616; structure.  Bands were found to be absent that would have indicated the adsorption of SH&#150; species as has been reported in the literature.  A facile change in the position of the &#61550;Au-S band with potential, unaccompanied by Faradaic processes, was seen when the adsorbed (&#61654;3x&#61654;3)R30&#61616; sulfur layer was examined in a sulfide-free solution.  This may indicate a change in sulfur adsorption sites with potential in the hydrogen evolution region.  At potentials above the S II/S0 reversible value in sulfide solutions, the surface coverage increased and &#61550;S-S bands were observed, indicating the formation of an adsorbed polysulfide species, Au-Sn.  A change in the position of the &#61550;Au-S band was seen to accompany the formation of the &#61550;S-S bands.  As coverage further increased, bands due to S-S-S bending, &#61540;S-S-S, developed that were characteristic of cyclo octasulfur, S8.  On removal from sulfide solution and rinsing, a characteristic SERS spectrum was observed ex situ.  The spectrum showed a characteristic &#61550;S-S at 460 cm-1 and &#61550;Au-S at 325 cm-1 and was assigned to an adlayer of S8 adsorbed on gold in a crown configuration, Au S8.  Gold was polarised in thiosulfate solutions at a potential at which gold dissolution is known to occur.  In situ SERS spectra showed bands characteristic of S-S bonding and Au2S to occur after 1 hr for thiosulfate with sodium and ammonium counter-ions and for both systems in the presence of ammonia.  XPS studies of polished gold held in sodium thiosulfate under these conditions showed S 2p binding energies corresponding to metal sulfide and pyritic sulfur, S22-.  After 72 hrs at the mixed potential in air saturated sodium thiosulfate, SERS investigations showed a spectrum with Au-S8 characteristics.  XPS studies on a polished electrode under these conditions showed a third type of S 2p binding with a binding energy between that of pyritic sulfur and S8.  The sodium thiosulfate system showed an adsorbed tetrathionate-like surface species, Au-S4O6, to be present at the mixed potential and to disappear with increased potential prior to the formation of bulk S8 via an Au-S8 intermediate.  In the presence of the ammonium cation at high potentials, Au-Sn bands appear in the presence of a more intense and broad &#61550;Au-S characteristic of gold sulfide, Au2S.  This was assigned to a mixed gold sulfide/polysulfide phase, Au2S/Sn.   With addition of ammonia, the surface species Au S4O6, Au2S/Sn and, tentatively, adsorbed NH3 were observed above the mixed potential.  For gold in air-saturated copper(II) ammoniacal thiosulfate media, bands due &#61550;S-S at 382 cm-1 and symmetric S-O stretching, &#61550;symS-O, at 1017 cm-1 developed during leaching at the mixed potential.  These modes diminished and, when rinsed and examined in water, were replaced by a single band at 255 cm 1 assigned to a metal sulfide stretch.  In typical leach solutions, sulfur and copper coverages showed a 2:1 atomic ratio after leaching for 16 h.  Ex situ ATR and XPS studies showed that ammonia was adsorbed to a surface copper sulfide.  Kinetic studies using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) to measure gold in solution showed that the ammoniacal copper(II) thiosulfate leaching solution exhibited higher dissolution rates in the presence of the sodium counter ion than the ammonium.  Thiourea as an additive to thiosulfate solutions was seen to disrupt S-S bonding in both Au-S8 and Au2S/Sn surface structures.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">SERS</field><field name="subject">Raman scattering</field><field name="subject">gold</field><field name="subject">thiosulfate</field><field name="subject">electrochemical experiments</field><field name="subject">surface processes</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20081024.164504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">POLITICAL DEMOCRACY AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISE MANAGEMENT:
A STUDY OF TAIWAN'S STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES</field><field name="creator">Pu, Cheng-Chiu</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of why and how an authority model of managing state-owned enterprises has remained popular in Taiwan through the past two decades. The subject was chosen because it has to date, been a neglected subject in the literature on Taiwan, even though it is significant to any serious examination of Taiwan's continuing political development and the government's approach to governance. Taiwan has experienced three major milestones of political democratisation over the period, each greatly enhancing the democratic characteristics of the state and also reflecting a degree of absorption of global political and economic pressures. Taiwan's political democratisation has been widely discussed in recent years, but not much attention has been paid to the effect of the political changes on its public sector management. The discussions have simply speculated that the Taiwanese government no longer uses the authoritarian way of governing the country, in keeping with its promotion of democratic development.
However, this research clearly indicates that the change of political regime from the previous Kuomintang (KMT) to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has not meant any significant change in the way state-owned enterprises are managed. The approach of the DPP government resembles that of the KMT government in that it continues with an authoritarian way of managing state-owned enterprises, despite the party's long established commitment to a democratic way. In other words, this huge change has not meant state-owned enterprises are any better placed than they were previously in terms of having a greater degree of enterprise management autonomy.
This research also shows that Taiwanese governments, regardless of which of the two parties is in power, manipulate state-owned enterprise management using the enterprises as a major means of achieving multiple political objectives. In particular, it has become almost endemic in Taiwan's politics that the ruling party manipulates state-owned enterprise management in order to win political elections and protect its political position. In this sense, it has become evident that the democratic way of governance has still not been used within this part of the government yet.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="subject">public enterprise management</field><field name="subject">public administration</field><field name="subject">political economy</field><field name="subject">public sector</field><field name="subject">state owned business</field><field name="subject">organisation</field><field name="subject">company</field><field name="subject">political influence</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081024.110804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ACCIDENT DENOMINATORS RELATIVE TO AGE GROUPS IN HEAVY INDUSTRIES OF THE PORT HEDLAND REGION OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">BOTTRELL, John Robert</field><field name="description">The aim of this research is to investigate characteristics of accident denominators across age groups in mining and associated process industries in the Port Hedland region of Western Australia.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if five weeks of training with PowerCranks(tm) improves economy of motion (EOM), gross efficiency (GE), oxygen uptake (V.O2) and muscle activation patterns in trained cyclists. Sixteen trained cyclists were matched and paired into either a PowerCranks(tm) (PC) or Normal Cranks (NC) training group. Prior to training, all subjects completed a graded exercise test (GXT) using normal bicycle cranks. Additionally, on a separate day the PC group performed a modified GXT using PowerCranks? and cycled only until the end of the 200W stage (PCT). During the GXT and PCT, FeO2, FeCO2 and V.E were measured to determine EOM, GE and V.O2max. Integrated electromyography (iEMG) was also used to examine selected muscular activation patterns.

This study was designed to explore what drinkers consider to be the nature of wine quality and what they believe its features to be. Focus groups and individual and small group interviews were used to explore the conceptualisation and dimensions of wine quality, how that quality is assessed, and what its relevance may be. There were 105 informants, sourced from three states across Australia primarily by utilising friends and acquaintances of the researcher. Informants included consumers with a wide background of consumption practices and involvement levels, and also producers and those involved generally in the marketing, selling and promotion of wine. The study viewed wine as an aesthetic or quasi-aesthetic object and therefore also investigated drinkers' more general perceptions of the links between wine and other aesthetic products, placing the understanding of quality within that context.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">consumer behaviour</field><field name="subject">aesthetics</field><field name="subject">alcohol</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.ecu.edu.au/adt-public/adt-ECU2006.0004.html</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BUSINESS ADAPTATION STRATEGIES USED BY SMALL AND MEDIUM RETAILERS IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT: A STUDY OF UBON RATCHATHANI, THAILAND</field><field name="creator">CHEUNGSUVADEE, Kittima</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a study of business adaptation strategies employed by small and medium retailers in order to be sustainable in a climate of rapid and significant environmental change in regional Thailand.

Very often, however, it is used to describe things which English speakers would describe as being green. Granny Smith apples are 'ao', so are all Westerners' eyes, regardless of whether they would be described as being 'blue' or 'green' in English. The sky and the sea are prototypically 'ao', but this term is also used to describe lawns, forests, traffic lights and unripe tomatoes. What, then, do Japanese native speakers (henceforth JNS) understand by this term? How do its semantic boundaries relate to those of the term 'midori' (`green')? What is the JNS understanding of the foreign loan words 'guriin' (green) and 'buruu' (blue)?

With no gold standard existing, one partner?s report is often an accepted measure of violence in the relationship. This discrepancy in reporting between intimate partners has been thoroughly examined, yet researchers still debate the reliability of single partner reporting. The current study extends upon the Archer (1999) meta-analysis of intimate violence discrepancy reporting, and includes current studies, instruments and research methods in the analysis. This study examines the discrepancy effect among thirty-four samples from studies of heterosexual intimate violence, finding that the discrepancy in general was sizeable for men?s violence, and that different study conditions yield differing levels of discrepancy. This discrepancy level is a major issue when conducting quantitative research, especially typological studies, which utilise estimation and extrapolation of prevalence levels, and when violence data is used to evaluate recidivism. The current study identifies situations where the discrepancy is likely to be high and makes recommendations to improve the accuracy of the data being used to advise government policy and spending.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">domestic violence measurement</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.ecu.edu.au/adt-public/adt-ECU2008.0006.html</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN INVESTIGATION OF PHYSICS INSTRUCTORS' BELIEFS AND STUDENTS'  BELIEFS, GOALS AND MOTIVATION FOR STUDYING PHYSICS IN THAI RAJABHAT UNIVERSITIES</field><field name="creator">HONGSA-NGIAM, Anusak</field><field name="description">Students' interest in physics seems to be decreasing at all levels of education in most countries including Thailand.

Specifically the points of emergence for three verbal morpho-syntactic structures, namely verbal inflection, the V-te V structure and the passive/causative structure, were investigated within a framework of Processability Theory (PT) (Pienemann, 1998b). The subsequent development of these structures was also examined. Unlike earlier research about morpheme orders and developmental sequences in language acquisition which was criticised because of its apparent lack of theoretical underpinnings, Pienemann's Processability Theory (PT)(1998b) connects the processability of morpho-syntactic structure to linguistic theories. Pienemann also claims that this theory can be used to explain the acquisition of a wide range of morpho-syntactic structures and that it is typologically plausible and applicable to any language. In recent times PT has been extensively tested in a range of languages acquired as an L2, including German, English and Swedish (Pienemann, 1998b; Pienemann &amp; Hakansson, 1999) and Italian and Japanese (Di Biase &amp; Kawaguchi, 2002).

A disability voice is not prominent in public debate on EPAS in Australia or the Netherlands, even though people with disabilities are often thought to be vulnerable in relation to EPAS policies. Disability perspectives are potentially valuable in illuminating issues in relation to euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, because issues of dependence, independence, and individual autonomy play important roles in relation to both EPAS and to living with disability. The study's methodology uses a phenomenological approach and incorporates aspects of heuristics and grounded theory. Its conceptual framework incorporates MacIntyre's (1999) theory of acknowledged dependency and vulnerability; Habermas'  (1989) theory of knowledge; and Festinger's (1959) theory of cognitive dissonance.

They make use of employee communication media to help re-form the values, beliefs, norms and behaviours which are generally thought to comprise culture. However, culture is a complex and profound phenomenon. Successful communication between two culturally separate groups requires each to achieve an understanding of the other, no less so in workplaces than in societies composed of different cultures.Yet even employers who believe in communicating fully with their workforces find it difficult to convey viewpoints other than their own. Their communication tends therefore to be one-directional, asymmetrical and controlling, typified by the ubiquitous staff newsletter containing articles about people's contribution to corporate goals. The messages contained in such media have little or none of their desired effect because they tend to be re-interpreted via the cultural forces of the workers to whom the messages are directed.This study investigated a large industrial minerals refinery to analyse the working lives of shop floor employees and the effectiveness of various communication channels. It focused on one group to whom safety messages were communicated, the shop floor `crews', and examined how the organisation's hierarchy, rules, and informal organisation mediated this communication.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.ecu.edu.au/adt-public/adt-ECU2006.0001.html</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CONFINED SPACE FATALITIES</field><field name="creator">MACCARRON, Ciaran</field><field name="description">The extent of work related fatal accidents has been analysed statistically by agencies throughout the world.

The purpose of the study is to gain insights into why women wear make-up. It seeks to provide understanding of what this medium signifies to women and what the `sign' of make-up symbolises to the female individual. It explores how visible face make-up affects the way women consume appearance in everyday life, how they feel about themselves, and the role make-up plays in defining their own self-identity. The study utilises an interpretivist approach and uses a qualitative methodology in the form of phenomenology. The theoretical framework used to underpin this research is semiotics and this study examines the sign of make-up using two different semiotic perspectives previously not used together.

The use of microelectronics in conjunction with photonics enables intelligence to be added to the high-speed capability of photonics, thus realising reconfigurable optical devices which can revolutionise optical telecommunications and many more application areas. In this thesis, we investigate and demonstrate the capability of Opto-VLSI processors to realise a reconfigurable WDM optical device of many functions, namely, optical multiband filtering, optical notch filtering, and reconfigurable-Optical-Add-Drop Multiplexing (ROADM). We review the potential technologies available for tunable WDM components, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. We also develop a simple yet effective algorithm that optimises the performance of Opto-VLSI processors, and demonstrate experimentally the multi-function WDM devices employing Opto-VLSI processors.

The study has an internal narrative which takes the reader through the process of the research, from the initial question raised by a casual classroom conversation to the discussion chapter which questions a number of assumptions underlying current English language teaching practices within western educational contexts. The study falls into two distinct phases. The first phase uses the constant comparative method of data collection and analysis to integrate the perceptions of 28 experienced language teachers into the following theory: teachers judge the quality of their classes in terms of the degree to which they function as cohesive groups. The second phase uses the social-psychological framework of class cohesion to explore the perceptions of eight language teachers concerning a range of everyday behaviours and events occurring within their classes. The data were gathered through classroom observations and extended weekly teacher interviews and were supplemented by information from student interviews.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grounded theory</field><field name="subject">teacher cognition</field><field name="subject">classroom climate</field><field name="subject">classroom community</field><field name="subject">teacher roles</field><field name="subject">student roles</field><field name="subject">humour</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.ecu.edu.au/adt-public/adt-ECU2006.0002.html</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EXPLORING YOUNG PEOPLE'S CONCEPTS OF SMOKING ADDICTION: PERCEIVED OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY SMOKING WITHOUT BECOMING ADDICTED</field><field name="creator">WANG, Calvin</field><field name="description">This study explores how young people conceptualise addiction to smoking and, also the relationship between young people's addiction beliefs and intentions to smoke cigarettes. Addiction to smoking is a major health problem, not just for adults, but also for young smokers, up to 60% of whom are dependent on nicotine. However, anti-smoking prevention efforts targeted at young people generally emphasise ill-health effects and little attention is paid to addiction education which is generally considered relevant only to adult smoking and cessation efforts. Perhaps as a consequence, young people appear to have many misconceptions and unrealistic ideas about addiction, and these may possibly have influenced initial decisions to take up smoking. For example, between 50% and 60% of young smokers believe that it would be easy or very easy to stop smoking altogether if and when they choose to and the majority of daily smokers mistakenly believe that they will not be smoking for more than five years. For these young smokers, becoming addicted is often an unforeseen consequence and most are surprised to find that they cannot give up smoking as easily as they thought. The majority of addicted smokers regret ever taking up smoking but nevertheless continue to smoke cigarettes for perhaps 30 to 40 years because they find it very difficult to stop. This backdrop provides the impetus for the present study.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">smoking addiction</field><field name="subject">childhood smoking</field><field name="subject">concepts of addiction</field><field name="subject">youth tobacco control</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.ecu.edu.au/adt-public/adt-ECU2006.0033.html</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The search for character: servant-leadership in an Australian organisation</field><field name="creator">WHITMORE, Margaret</field><field name="description">This study is in response to globalisation, changing world values and the call in modern literature for leaders of good character.

The work of servant-leadership's proponent, Robert Greenleaf, is thoroughly examined to explain how his understanding of trust as faith is linked to spirituality and this is the key to understanding the character of servant-leaders.

Over a period of two academic years, four students told their stories of their transition to high school and their experiences of friendships and social relationships in their classrooms, playground, and after school venues. Their parents, siblings, peers, principals, teachers, and teacher aides were also interviewed and together with school observations and relevant documents provide a holistic perspective to the students&#8217; stories. The students&#8217; stories are foregrounded and re-presented in poetic form. Analysis of each student&#8217;s accounts are developed within a socio-cultural context that examines contextual factors that shape, support, or create barriers to their friendships and social relationships. These analyses are written as narrative responses within an ethic of caring. The research discusses the nature of social relationships between students with disabilities, and between students with and without disabilities, including bullying and rejection; contextual factors such as gender that shape students&#8217; perceptions of each other; and aspects of curriculum and pedagogy that support or hinder social relationships. The agency of individual students in the processes of social relationships are analysed, and implications for further research outlined. The study concludes that there are personal and socio-ecological factors that impact on the social experiences of students with disabilities. The findings suggest the need for teachers to examine values, attitudes, knowledge, and pedagogy in the context of their schools and adopt a multilevel approach to address the academic and social needs of all students.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">friendship</field><field name="subject">social relationships</field><field name="subject">secondary education</field><field name="subject">students with disabilities</field><field name="subject">social networks</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/685</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emotional Processing Deficits in Parkinson's Disease</field><field name="creator">Schafer, Molly Clark</field><field name="description">Doctor of Clinical Neuropsychology/Master of Science</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emotion processing deficits</field><field name="subject">Parkinson's disease</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3687</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading rooms : domesticity, identity and belonging in the paintings of Bessie Davidson, Margaret Preston and Stella Bowen in Paris and London 1910s - 1930s</field><field name="creator">Downey, Georgina</field><field name="description">This study explains how expatriate South Australian woman artists established both new lives and art careers in the modern metropoles of Paris and London in the early years of the twentieth century.

This commitment provides the starting point for the present study, which explores how the role of Inuit language and culture is constructed within the curricula and practices of Nunavut schooling. Data were generated from dialogue with Nunavut teachers and with authors of the Inuuqatigiit curriculum. In order to interpret the interview texts, a discourse analysis was undertaken using James Gee's ideas of situated meanings, cultural models, and discourses at work within them in relation to the Nunavut schooling context.

Laboratory trials of electrically stimulated leg cycling (ESLC) have led to increased oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide production, and reactivation of the venous muscle pump, increasing stroke volume and cardiac output during exercise. However transfer of these eftects into home and community settings has been poor. The Power Trainer, a commercially available device, combines active arm crank exercise (ACE) with ESLC, achieving hybrid exercise (HE). Despite its relative simplicity compared with legs only electrical stimulation cycles, exercise responses associated with its use have not been researched. The exercising muscle mass during HE with the Power Trainer is increased compared with either arms only or legs only exercise, increasing respiratory demands. If venous return is also increased, such exercise will fulfil the requirements for regaining fitness following a spinal cord injury. Differences were investigated between the cardiorespiratory responses to ACE and HE on the Power Trainer. Responses were measured during 30 minutes of steady state exercise with each exercise modality.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Paraplegia</field><field name="subject">Physical therapy</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Electrical stimulation</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/45759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anger and women prisoners : its origins, expression and management</field><field name="creator">Walker, Raylene</field><field name="description">This project addresses the role of anger in violent crime committed by women, and  alternatives that are currently available to manage this anger. This has been a neglected area of criminological research, partly because of women's lesser involvement in crime in general and violent crime in particular. The role of anger in  violent crime committed by men has received considerable attention and treatment  programs have been developed and evaluated. This has not happened to the same  extent for women. This project addresses this deficit by reviewing the literature on  anger experienced by women offenders. The project begins by critically examining  theories explaining the development of anger expression in women in western society and how this differs from men. The focus then shifts to female offenders and a review of literature on feminist criminology. From the literature, issues are identified which  need to be considered when developing women's anger management programs. At the  policy level, current initiatives in women's policy development in the western world  are explored. Finally recommendations are made for the future development of anger management programs for women in prison in South Australia.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Criminology</field><field name="subject">Female offenders</field><field name="subject">Anger management</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/45761</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visualisation in mining documents for retrieval using self organising maps</field><field name="creator">Tan, Hiong Sen</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents a study of creating maps that can be used to help people seek information from Internet documents.

The purpose of this dissertation is to offer an alternative way to retrieve information by visually representing the characteristics of the unseen documents and their relationships on the 2-dimensional surface of the SOM. The process starts with collecting documents that include text and images from the Internet, moving to extracting important features from them. In other words, we are performing an information retrieval indexing process. The document features are then clustered by using the SOM. As a result, documents with similar features will be clustered together on 2-dimensional maps. The maps are labelled and the documents are connected to locations on the maps based on the labels. The maps are then arranged hierarchically and visualised so that they can be used as a browsing and exploration tool for information retrieval.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Data mining</field><field name="subject">Map reading</field><field name="subject">Information management</field><field name="subject">Information retrieval</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/45763</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A test of self-determination theory in the context of relationships with partners and friends</field><field name="creator">Soukoulis, Catherine</field><field name="description">The connection between intrinsic motives and positive psychological outcomes has been widely demonstrated, and has been extended to Self-Determination Theory concepts of  the self-determination continuum and the three basic needs.

Contemporary understanding of the physiology of brain arousal processes suggests a consistent balance between brain arousal and recovery over the 24-hour work/rest cycle is crucial for maintaining an adaptative response to work strain. Broadly, intense brain arousal tends to occur at work, whilst its recovery occurs in non-work time, usually at home. This thesis describes the development and validation of a new self-report measure of work-related strain, which incorporates a new and unique measurement of recovery from work strain between successive work periods. This instrument has facilitated several studies of recovery from work-related stress/fatigue, which are reported in the form of papers published, in press or in review with peer-reviewed journals. In particular, it is evident that the type and frequency of non-work time behaviour may be significant in determining the level of recovery from acute work strain. This, in turn, mediates the quality of sleep subsequently achieved, and these combine synergistically to determine overall level of recovery that is achieved between work periods. Consistent with the known physiology of brain arousal and recovery, which is described, non-work time behaviours, which mediate adequate recovery from work strain consistently, may represent the difference between long-term adaptative and maladaptive outcomes of work strain exposure. This suggests an area for work-stress intervention hitherto underestimated in fatigue/stress research. It is argued to be of significance for workers in high stress occupations, since non-work time behaviour is potentially more completely within their discretionary power, than the stress/fatigue levels to which they may be regularly exposed through the inherent nature of their work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fatigue</field><field name="subject">Stress</field><field name="subject">Occupational stress</field><field name="subject">Occupational fatigue</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/45949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The embodied wheelchair : 'it's part of me'</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Jennifer</field><field name="description">The wheelchair is an unmistakeable sign of bodily damage.

The resultant impairment of my faculties, and its effect on my vocational, emotional and spiritual life is outlined. My main means of expressing my journey from illness to partial recovery and self-renewal is through art-making. This art-making (a form of art self-therapy) is recorded in my paintings; included in my thesis as my main means of expression taking the place of the printed word, as my capacity to write and type is somewhat impaired. The main value of my thesis relates to recounting the experience, for others of the renewal of my life, following a major illness. Most brain tumours are fatal or severely limit the ability of a person to communicate, or limit their intellectual functioning. I was fortunate in that I could still communicate through using the visual arts; an area where I had retained my competencies. My thesis then, is aimed at increasing the understanding of illness, recovery and renewal for those in the helping and medical professions; also to give hope of life renewal through art expression and art therapy in cases where verbal and written means of communication are limited. The field of my thesis is adult education and personal learning through experience. This learning has focussed on using creative painting experiences as a way of self-healing. Those paintings that were significant in my recovery and renewal are exhibited in the Art Gallery section of this thesis.

A fluid drop (mercury) is introduced into the apparatus which allows a range of deformable surfaces to be studied in the SFA. This project is an extension of this technique.

To calculate an optimal driving strategy we need a realistic model of train performance. In particular, we need to know a coefficient of rolling resistance and a coefficient of aerodynamic drag. In practice, these coefficients are different for every train and difficult to predict.

It is argued further that a necessary condition for the realisation of this goal is that individuals are equipped to think well; more precisely, to make decisions on the basis of arguments that are both logically cogent (that is, which have true premises and which are either inductively strong or deductively valid) and ethically grounded (that is, with premises which express appropriate regard for the welfare of others). The concern of the thesis is the role education might play in fostering both the capability and the readiness to engage widely in such thinking. Although this concern has a long and complex history within the Western tradition, insufficient educational progress has been made. It is suggested that progress has been hampered on the one hand by the stark disciplinary divide between the descriptive approach of psychology and the normative stance of philosophy; and on the other, by a failure on the part of educational programme developers to take into account the constraints of prevailing educational structures. It is argued that what is needed is a new model of interdisciplinary research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Logical and ethical reasoning</field><field name="subject">Ethical inquiry</field><field name="subject">Dialogue</field><field name="subject">Social and environmental education</field><field name="subject">Democracy</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/45976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructions of an active language learner in English as a foreign language (EFL) teacher education in Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Dang, Hung Van</field><field name="description">This study investigates how an active language learner is constructed in the context of teacher education for teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL) in Vietnam, as well as the supportive factors and challenges in developing learner activeness in language learning.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teacher Education: Higher Education</field><field name="subject">Professional Development of Teachers not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">English as a foreign language</field><field name="subject">Active learning</field><field name="subject">Active learner</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/45978</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Graph based techniques for measurement of intranet dynamics</field><field name="creator">Dickinson, Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis develops a number of graph-based techniques that are capable of measuring the dynamic behaviour of a network and discusses their application in network management. By representing a computer network as a time series of uniquely labelled graphs, it is possible to measure the degree of change that has occurred between a pair of graphs, and hence the dynamics in a network. Concepts introduced include the median graph, intra- and inter- graph clustering, and hierarchical graph representations. The focus is on producing efficient algorithms and improved measures of network change. It is believed that these graph-based techniques for measuring network dynamics have great potential in network anomaly detection, and thus will improve reliability of enterprise intranets.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intranets</field><field name="subject">Computer network</field><field name="subject">Network management</field><field name="subject">Median graphs</field><field name="subject">Hierarchical graphs</field><field name="subject">Uniquely labelled graphs</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/45980</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:33446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interaction of sphalerite and silica at very fine particle sizes and its influence on flotation selectivity</field><field name="creator">Duarte, Ana Cristina Pereira</field><field name="description">The present research is focused on investigating particle interactions between valuable and gangue materials, and the effect of these interactions on selectivity in flotation.

Electronic commerce, or e-commerce, was deemed elemental to a fundamental shift in economics. However, it was also implicated in a shifting dynamic in which the relative power of producers was diminished in favour of that of consumers. In industry literature, the e-commerce consumer was, and remains, typified as 'empowered'.

CPR examples include forests, pastures, irrigations, rivers, lakes, and fisheries. This research examines a common pool resource in Thailand, i.e. a canal in Nonthaburi Province (NP). The canal, named Klong Om-Klong Bangkok Noi-Klong Bang Kruai, is utilised for agriculture, transportation, commerce, tourism and aesthetics. Currently, urbanisation threatens the canal through changes in land use along the canal. Also, an increasing amount of garbage and water hyacinths in the canal are degrading the quality of the canal environment and waterway transportation. The aims of this thesis were to identify essential factors in the canal system that support the success of collective action in environmental management. This study analyses CPR management in the NP canal system by applying design principles illustrated by long-enduring CPR institutions. These have been identified by Elinor Ostrom (Ostrom, 1990; 1992) and by analysing the situational variables as barriers or resources for collective action. The research was conducted on five communities in Thailand. The primary data collection techniques were qualitative and consisted of two different interview processes and five focus groups. The interviews were completed with local residents and government officials while the focus groups were completed with individuals from five communities. The N6 computer program for handling qualitative data was used to analyse the responses.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">common pool resource</field><field name="subject">canal</field><field name="subject">Nonthaburi Thailand</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/46326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Professional ethics for professional nursing</field><field name="creator">Kalaitzidis, Evdokia</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to propose and defend a maxim to serve as a foundation and guideline for professional ethics in nursing.

Evaluations using time-varying Jensen index adjust the asset return comparison for possible time-varying investment risk (return variation). The return and risk comparison for direct and indirect real estate investment is further investigated with an alternative GARCH-M model in capturing the possible time-varying risk premium. Unlike previous studies, one of the major contributions of this research is to measure the risk-adjusted real estate returns by taking into account the impact of illiquidity, management and transaction costs, and vacancy risk with actual transaction data. The time-varying models have not been applied for analysing the returns on property investment in Hong Kong so far. The results of this study help resolving the puzzle why real estate offers superior investment performance as stated in the existing literature that is inconsistent with the Efficient Market Hypothesis. With arbitrage, the capital theory predicts that all investments should display similar risk adjusted return in the long run. As a result, it is impossible for direct property to earn abnormal risk adjusted return in the long run. The empirical results show that superiority of real estate property in risk-adjusted return is reduced or even disappeared in the period of 1991 to 2002 when the impact of illiquidity and the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis are taken into account. This conclusion is further strengthened with the favourable empirical evidence obtained when all the unsystematic risks including the management and transaction costs, and vacancy risk are incorporated into the analysis. The superior investment performance for real estate relative to property stocks found in the literature is too good to be true. Its existence is simply due to the omission of fundamentals factors like unsystematic risks in the analysis. The impact of liquidity on return assessment has been under-researched, this study attempts to fill the gap by quantifying the impact of liquidity explicitly in explaining the excess return of real estate investment. The empirical result is consistent with the intuition that investors require compensation in holding illiquid assets.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rreal estate investment</field><field name="subject">Investment performance</field><field name="subject">Property stocks</field><field name="subject">Hong Kong</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/46308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework of university incubator to maintain financial sustainability</field><field name="creator">Hsiao, Yu-Chan Helen</field><field name="description">Business incubation is a dynamic process of business enterprise development. Incubators nurture young firms, helping them to survive and grow during the start-up period. Among various types of incubators the university-based incubators are particularly studied. Although most university incubators are quite successful in terms of the success rate and the growth rate of tenant companies, their financial contributions to the sponsoring universities, however, are still not satisfied. It is found that behind the successful history records there are still some barriers impeding the development of an efficient incubator. In this research, a new model, which integrates merits of public and private incubators into the university incubator, is proposed for the betterment of its management scheme. The goal is to develop a successful incubator, which can earn profits not only for its own financial sustainability but also be able to generate income for the university. The outcomes of this research are summarized as follows: 1. From questionnaire survey around more than 100 university incubators around the world, this research received constructive opinions from incubator experts to support the proposed concept. This inspires the author to consider the necessity of a new incubation model for long-term sustainability. 2. The method of this survey study combines the Delphi Method and Scenario Analysis, called modified Delphi method, for worldwide survey and the Microsoft Excel method for data statistic for both of the Taiwan and worldwide surveys. By breaking down long questionnaire into two successive surveys, the replied rate did significantly increase. 3. An integrative framework for the new incubation model has been proposed for the sustainable operation of university incubator. National Taiwan University has validated this model in a similar way. 4. The process of privatization of university incubator is proposed to meet the university administrative procedure. Both of the government initialized top-down and incubator initialized bottom-up processes are considered. A Business Plan to suit for the proposed incubation company is also designed in this work. The sustainability in terms of financial status has been predicted based on some reasonable assumptions. 5. In order to verify the proposed model, three case studies through on-site visits have been carried out to compare their incubation systems and financial status up-to-date. This can provide a guideline to adjust the proposed model of this work. Finally, a comprehensive conclusion and discussions are given to summarize the contribution and future work of this research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Manufacturing Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">University incubator</field><field name="subject">Financial sustainability</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/42985</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:31139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ADVANCED MODELLING OF EMULSION TERPOLYMERISATION FOR ONLINE OPTIMISATION AND CONTROL</field><field name="creator">Srour, Mourtada H</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">emulsion, terpolymerisation, modelling, control</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3688</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between training load and incidence of injury and illness over a pre-season at an Australian Football League Club</field><field name="creator">PIGGOTT, Benjamin</field><field name="description">In any competitive sporting environment, it is crucial to a team's success to have the maximum number of their players free from injury and illness and available for selection in as many games as possible throughout the season.

Limited knowledge, however, exists about who, when, why, and if New Zealand teenagers are getting their daily dose of health-related physical activity. At conception of this thesis, available information was predominantly survey-derived with no New Zealand data and few international studies that had assessed adolescent physical activity levels objectively. Data were collected from three projects. Convenience sampling was used across all projects to recruit students from low-decile high schools located in the Auckland region. For Project 1, 236 Year 9 to Year 13 students each wore a pedometer for five days (three weekdays and two weekend days) and reported their mode of transportation to and from school. To explore ethnic and sex-specific perceptions of physical activity among youth (i.e., barriers, benefits, potential physical activity enhancing strategies), Project 2 involved nine focus group discussions with 44 Year 9 and Year 10 students who identified as M&#257;ori or European. Project 3 was a large cross-sectional study of 3,451 high school students (Years 9 - 13) from seven low-decile schools. Through this project the following self-reported data were collected: demographics, physical activity levels during four school-day physical activity opportunities (i.e., active travel, lunchtime physical activity, recess physical activity, after-school physical activity), sedentary behaviour (i.e., school-day television (TV) watching), level of perceived encouragement to be active, and the presence of home policies regarding TV use. Analyses revealed low physical activity participation and high TV use behaviours. Pedometer data showed that only 14.5% of participants achieved a conservative criterion of 10,000 steps daily. Also, daily steps varied by age group (junior students: 11,079 &#177; 330; senior students: 9,422 &#177; 334), sex (males: 10,849 &#177; 381; females: 9,652 &#177; 289), time of week (weekday: 12,259 &#177; 287; weekend day: 8,241 &#177; 329), and transportation mode to/from school (walkers: 13,308 &#177; 483; car transit users: 10,986 &#177; 435).  Low school-day physical activity levels emerged, especially during school hours (i.e., during recess and lunchtime). Based on dichotomised grouping (less active versus more active), the proportion of students in the &#8216;more active&#8217; group during morning recess and lunchtime, after school, and as part of active travel to/from school were 26%, 32.4%, 56.3%, 58.1% respectively. Only 11.1% of participants were in the &#8216;more active&#8217; group across all four physical activity opportunities.  The focus group data revealed primarily social benefits of physical activity (e.g., meeting new people, fun). Barriers were mainly environment-related and included lack of peer support, low accessibility to and availability of physical activity opportunities, alternative sedentary activities, structure of physical education classes (females only), and distance between home and school (in terms of active transportation). Potential strategies to increase physical activity reflected the articulated barriers and benefits (e.g., increase peer support, parents to turn off the TV, organised activities at school, restructure physical education classes to allow student involvement in the decision-making process of class content). No ethnic and few sex differences in perceptions were found. Focusing on the verbalised importance of social support from the focus groups, Project 3 data showed that the strength of association between perceived encouragement from different support sources (i.e., parents, older siblings/cousins, peers, school) and physical activity participation varied by the physical activity opportunity examined. In particular, multivariate logistical regression showed reduced odds of being in the &#8216;more active&#8217; group was associated with low parental encouragement (Juniors, OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.38-0.58; Seniors, OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.29-0.60) and low peer encouragement (Juniors, OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.51-0.74; Seniors, OR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.35-0.69) for after-school physical activity, low peer encouragement (Juniors, OR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.32-0.48; Seniors, OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.29-0.57) for lunchtime activity, and low peer encouragement (Juniors, OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.66-0.92) for active transportation (junior students only).  No significant difference in physical activity was found between students who received high encouragement from two parents than students who reported high encouragement from their sole parent in a single parent family. Concentrating on the after-school period, Project 3 data were analysed to examined the relevance of the displacement hypothesis during this school-day period. The association between parental strategies (i.e., encouragement to be active and having TV limits) and youth after-school activity behaviours (i.e., hours spent viewing TV, physical activity participation) was also examined.  Support for the displacement hypothesis emerged. In particular, compared to students who watched less than one hour of TV, those who watched greater than four hours of TV were half as likely to be in the more active group for after-school physical activity participation (adjusted OR:  0.51; 95% CI: 0.40-0.65). Comparing activity profile groups (i.e., based on combined TV use and after-school activity levels), compared to the participants in the &#8216;low TV/active&#8217; group, participants in the other three activity groups (e.g., &#8216;high TV/low active&#8217;) were at least 1.28 times more likely to have parents that executed only one parental strategy and up to 4.77 times more likely to have parents that did not carry out either strategy. Substantive opportunities exist for youth to be active every day, and in different contexts and environments, yet a large proportion of young people are not maximising these opportunities to be active. If the health issue of inactivity is to be tackled in a comprehensive and efficient manner, a multi-strategy, multi-environment, coordinated approach among local authorities, government agencies, schools, families, and neighbourhoods is required to address the noted policy, physical, and social-related associates of an active lifestyle for youth. Future effort, whether in the form of strategy development, intervention work, or research, needs to be founded upon ecological theory, where both individual and a range of familial, social, and physical environmental factors (and there potential interactions) are considered. Lastly, equal research attention should be directed at improved physical activity levels, and just as importantly, reducing time youth spend in a sedentary state.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">Adolescence</field><field name="subject">Television watching</field><field name="subject">Questionnaire</field><field name="subject">Focus groups</field><field name="subject">Youth-centred approach</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A phenomenological and thematic interpretation of the experience of creativity</field><field name="creator">Bellingham, Robin</field><field name="description">Creativity is a nebulous concept, lacking both clear articulations and common understandings of meaning. Due to a lack of clear alternatives the concept of creativity is increasingly becoming infused with economically driven vocabulary, associations, interests and ideologies. There is an immediate need to provide alternatives to the &#8222;creative economy&#8223; view of creativity, because of its insidious effect on educational institutions and practices and because it promotes a generally impoverished view of the meaning of creativity and of human potential. Reductionist thought; the tendency to understand concepts as separate and distinct from one another prevents us from easily conceptualising an experience such as creativity which involves the simultaneous experience of seemingly paradoxical elements such as individuality and unity, intellect and intuition and freedom and discipline. Democracy is a metaphor which can help to articulate and understand the paradoxical experience of creativity. Democracy stands for the potential to make meaning from the integrated exploration of individuality and of unity, which I argue is a fundamental dynamic of the creative experience. I further suggest that the essence of the creative experience is a democratic attunement to existence, in which subject and object, self and environment, intellect and intuition and freedom and discipline are experienced as in a democratic relationship with one another. This way of understanding creativity provides an alternative to the creative economy view. It implies some significant changes to traditional educational emphases, including a movement away from primarily individualistically oriented curricula and toward curricula and educational values which situate the individual within an integrated eco-system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conceptualisation</field><field name="subject">phenomenological method</field><field name="subject">Heidegger's phenomenology of boredom</field><field name="subject">Creative experience</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Educating requirements engineers in Australia : effective learning for professional practice</field><field name="creator">Armarego, Jocelyn</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to address the issue of education for Requirements Engineers.

While theoretically impressive, LDPC codes present some challenges for practical implementation. In general, LDPC codes have higher encoding complexity than turbo codes both in terms of computational latency and architecture size. Decoder circuits for LDPC codes have a high routing complexity and thus demand large amounts of circuit area. There has been recent interest in developing analog circuit architectures suitable for decoding. These circuits offer a fast, low-power alternative to the digital approach. Analog decoders also have the potential to be significantly smaller than digital decoders. In this thesis we present a novel and efficient approach to LDPC encoder / decoder (codec) design. We propose a new algorithm which allows the parallel decoder architecture to be reused for iterative encoding. We present a new class of LDPC codes which are iteratively encodable, exhibit good empirical performance, and provide a flexible choice of code length and rate. Combining the analog decoding approach with this new encoding technique, we design a novel time-multiplexed LDPC codec, which switches between analog decode and digital encode modes. In order to achieve this behaviour from a single circuit we have developed mode-switching gates. These logic gates are able to switch between analog (soft) and digital (hard) computation, and represent a fundamental circuit design contribution. Mode-switching gates may also be applied to built-in self-test circuits for analog decoders. Only a small overhead in circuit area is required to transform the analog decoder into a full codec. The encode operation can be performed two orders of magnitude faster than the decode operation, making the circuit suitable for full-duplex applications. Throughput of the codec scales linearly with block size, for both encode and decode operations. The low power and small area requirements of the circuit make it an attractive option for small portable devices.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Low-density</field><field name="subject">parity-check codes</field><field name="subject">Systems Theory</field><field name="subject">Information Systems Development Methodologies</field><field name="subject">Signal Processing</field><field name="subject">Processor Architectures</field><field name="subject">Optical and Photonic Systems</field><field name="subject">Architecture</field><field name="subject">Error control</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/46679</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:34061</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulating Heavy Vehicles on Australian Rural Highways</field><field name="creator">Fry, John</field><field name="description">The major purpose of this thesis is to offer a detailed look at the development of two models used to assist in the detailed study of Australian two lane two way highways with particular reference to heavy vehicles.

The modified titania surface was characterised using a number of techniques: tapping mode AFM, streaming potential, X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle measurements. With a partial surface coverage of OTHS, a bell-shaped dependence of contact angle with respect to pH was observed, with the maximum advancing contact angle occurring at the point of zero charge of the titanium dioxide substrate. The contact angle change was also influenced by the surface coverage and salt concentration. At extreme pH values there was no further decrease in the contact  angle, i.e. saturation occurred. A thermodynamic model was used to describe the influence of surface charge on the contact angle. The results were interpreted as a reduction in the solid-liquid  interfacial free energy.

They are promising candidates to be used as building blocks with which to construct new generation nanoarchitectures and nanodevices for sensing, electronic and optoelectronic applications. The aggregation and dispersion of colloidal nanoparticles is one of the key issues closely related to their potential applications. Our knowledge of the colloid stability of nanoparticle dispersions with small sizes is still in its infancy, however, thymine is one of the bases in DNA, and is a pH sensitive and chromatic molecule. In the present study, thymine-functionalized self-assembled monolayer protected gold nanoparticles were synthesized. Their morphology and surface structure were characterized using TEM, UV-vis, FTIR, DSC-TGA and XPS techniques. The colloid stability of thymine-capped gold nanoparticle dispersions as a function of the type and concentration of monovalent salt, pH and particle size in alkaline aqueous solution were investigated. The manipulation of colloid stability with light was further explored.

A review of existing storage and manipulation techniques for mesh data is given followed by a framework for mesh editing. The proposed framework combines complex mesh editing techniques, automatic level of detail generation and mesh compression for storage. These methods work coherently due to the underlying data structure. The problem of storing and manipulating data for 3D models is a highly researched field. Models are usually represented by sparse mesh data which consists of vertex position information, the connectivity information to generate faces from those vertices, surface normal data and texture coordinate information. This sparse data is sent to the graphics hardware for rendering but must be manipulated on the CPU. The proposed framework is based upon geometry images and is designed to store and manipulate the mesh data entirely on the graphics hardware. By utilizing the highly parallel nature of current graphics hardware and new hardware features, new levels of interactivity with large meshes can be gained. Automatic level of detail rendering can be used to allow models upwards of 2 million polygons to be manipulated in real time while viewing a lower level of detail. Through the use of pixels shaders the high detail is preserved in the surface normals while geometric detail is reduced. A compression scheme is then introduced which utilizes the regular structure of the geometry image to compress the floating point data. A number of existing compression schemes are compared as well as custom bit packing. This is a TIF funded project which is partnered with Unlimited Realities, a Palmerston North software development company. The project was to design a system to create, manipulate and store 3D meshes in a compressed and easy to manipulate manner. The goal is to create the underlying technologies to allow for a 3D modelling system to become integrated into the Umajin engine, not to create a user interface/stand alone modelling program. The Umajin engine is a 3D engine created by Unlimited Realities which has a strong focus on multimedia. More information on the Umajin engine can be found at www.umajin.com. In this project we propose a method which gives the user the ability to model with the high level of detail found in packages aimed at creating offline renders but create models which are designed for real time rendering.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer graphics</field><field name="subject">three-dimensional modelling</field><field name="subject">mesh data</field><field name="subject">mesh editing techniques</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280300 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interior design proposal for the Hulme F1 supercar : a written component completed in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Design at Massey University, College of Creative Arts, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Young, Kenneth</field><field name="description">This research project focused on the development of an appropriate interior design proposal for the Hulme F1 supercar.

The existing design established the package, window openings, basic controls and door architecture for this study. Based on this material, the interior study focused on an overall aesthetic and its integration with ergonomic, technical and functional requirements. The conceptual nature of this project allowed for the inclusion of speculative and experimental design proposals that were not constrained by local contemporary manufacturing and economic issues. Consequently, the project based itself on a technological forecast of five to ten years. Research first explored and defined several key design motifs central to the Hulme F1 supercar. This involved studies into supercars, luxury, high-performance, exoticness, contemporary Formula One Grand Prix racing and the existing exterior form language. The results from this research established initial themes for development of the interior design proposal. A review of contemporary theory in visual product communication and experience was undertaken to identify an appropriate framework for this investigation. The research of Mon&#246; (1997), Norman (2004a) and Warell (2007) was reviewed. Review focused on two areas; a structure appropriate for defining design criteria and a comprehensive framework for visual analysis of exemplars to identify visual design trends. The Visual Product Experience (VPE) framework by Warell offered the most appropriate visual framework for this investigation. Using the VPE framework, a visual analysis of contemporary luxury motorcars, professional race cars and supercars was undertaken. Analysis focused on interior and interior/exterior related design trends. Findings illustrated that luxury motorcars have simple aesthetic compositions with frequent interior/exterior form element repetition. Conversely, professional race cars have complex aesthetic compositions with minimal interior/exterior form element repetition. Meanwhile, supercar interior aesthetics and appear to vary between these two spectrums depending on their overall aesthetic expression. To this end, the analysis illustrated the opposing visual qualities between luxury and high-performance. This suggested the interior design proposal required a delicate balance between complex and simple aesthetic elements to obtain an appropriate overall visual expression. Consequently, the interior design proposal used a combination of flowing soft surfaces and complex detailing to express luxury and high-performance. Research also established criteria for the design of interior functional systems required within the interior design proposal. Interior functional systems included control, body-support, display, storage and safety systems. The development process for the interior design proposal consisted of iterative design methods. This included concept generation, concept development and three-dimensional form studies. Throughout the development process, concepts were screened against design criteria in order to further direct the iterative process. Contemporary Formula One race car illustrated an abundance of visual inspiration for the interior design proposal during the development process. Elements such as exhaust and aerodynamic wing details were referenced within the interior design proposal. The intent of this was to create visual harmony between interior and exterior aesthetics. Research into ingress and egress found a conventionally fixed steering unit impeded participants. As a result, the final design proposed a steering unit that swung towards the centre of the interior for greater entry/exit space. The interior design proposal was assessed by internal and external &#8216; design evaluation&#8217; methods. Testing indicated that the interior design proposal had fulfilled most of the experience and performance design criteria and achieved the aim of this research. Overall, this investigation designed an interior design proposal to compliment the exterior design of the Hulme F1 supercar. The interior design proposal was supported by visual framework developed from this research investigation. In addition, the investigation proposed functional and ergonomic solutions to support the interior design proposal.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interior design</field><field name="subject">supercars</field><field name="subject">automotive design</field><field name="subject">visual analysis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building::310100 Architecture and Urban Environment::310106 Interior and environmental design</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being local : a sense of place : an exegesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">White, Patrick Valdimar</field><field name="description">Being Local; a sense of place - details a journey during which I explore the notion that one aspect of art is seen best as a local activity, with the artist exploring his/her sense of place. Reading of relevant texts, and research of the conceptual basis of the notion, resulted in written and visual works. The writing records selected aspects of my thinking, detailing arrivals and discoveries, the development of art objects. Ultimately the research suggests that a sense of place is unfinished business; an ongoing process, a constant part of any vernacular or local activity. &#8216;Place&#8217; is a story to be told and retold, a relationship constantly being renewed. Specifically, the story told here is from my own past to arrival in the settlement of Gladstone where I live on a three acre farmlet. That farmlet is the particular site in which I have carried out work exploring my thesis during 2007. The idea that art works are intrinsically local, inherently determined by my relationship with the place where I work, is an important part of the story. The acting of creating, is one of many relationships entwined in stories without which there can be no place to have a sense of. Another is the sharing of food. I have combined both the making of objects, and the sharing of food, as relational activities expressing &#8216;know how&#8217;, an art project.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">locality</field><field name="subject">sense of place</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies::410202 Fine arts studies (incl. sculpture and painting)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of the potential of ecotourism to contribute to local sustainable development : a case study of Tengtou Village, China : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Jingjing</field><field name="description">In the last few decades, &#8220;ecotourism&#8221; has emerged as a much talked about topic that is frequently linked to the term &#8220;sustainable development&#8221;. Despite the fact that the definition of ecotourism has been expanded from primarily pristine nature-based areas to modified areas, relatively few studies have been devoted to evaluating the relationship between &#8220;ecotourism&#8221; and &#8220;sustainable development&#8221; in those destinations. To address this research need, this thesis attempts to analyse the potential of ecotourism as a strategy for sustainable development, where it does not depend only on nature-based opportunities. Relevant literature on the topics of ecotourism and sustainable development was examined to develop a framework to assess ecotourism in a case study area. The case study employed was Tengtou village, China, which is one of the earliest national eco-villages. Tengtou hosted 76,200 tourists in 2006. Data was collected using qualitative methods, which included semi-structured interviews, informal discussions, focus groups, participant observation and questionnaire surveys. The research revealed that ecotourism has brought a variety of favourable impacts, and the local people hold optimistic attitudes about ecotourism, which indicate the feasibility of the ecotourism industry and the comparative success it has achieved. On the other hand, the research also found several potentially adverse effects, which suggest that ecotourism does not yet make a full contribution to local sustainable development. This thesis concludes that effective regulation and sound planning play a significant role in enabling the sustainability of ecotourism. Meanwhile, the importance of local people&#8217;s active involvement at different levels of ecotourism development in ensuring ecotourism&#8217;s success, in the long term, was also revealed. This issue of local participation, strongly pushed in the international ecotourism literature, is not something which has characterised most ecotourism initiatives in China to date. Further, considering the increasing number of tourists, the management of tourists and the expansion of physical infrastructure need to be strengthened in the research area.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ecotourism</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Low-complexity block dividing coding method for image compression using wavelets : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhu, Jihai</field><field name="description">Image coding plays a key role in multimedia signal processing and communications. JPEG2000 is the latest image coding standard, it uses the EBCOT (Embedded Block Coding with Optimal Truncation) algorithm. The EBCOT exhibits excellent compression performance, but with high complexity.  The need to reduce this complexity but maintain similar performance to EBCOT has inspired a significant amount of research activity in the image coding community. Within the development of image compression techniques based on wavelet transforms, the EZW (Embedded Zerotree Wavelet) and the SPIHT (Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees) have played an important role. The EZW algorithm was the first breakthrough in wavelet based image coding.  The SPIHT algorithm achieves similar performance to EBCOT, but with fewer features. The other very important algorithm is SBHP (Sub-band Block Hierarchical Partitioning), which attracted significant investigation during the JPEG2000 development process. In this thesis, the history of the development of wavelet transform is reviewed, and a discussion is presented on the implementation issues for wavelet transforms.  The above mentioned four main coding methods for image compression using wavelet transforms are studied in detail.  More importantly the factors that affect coding efficiency are identified. The main contribution of this research is the introduction of a new low-complexity coding algorithm for image compression based on wavelet transforms. The algorithm is based on block dividing coding (BDC) with an optimised packet assembly.  Our extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms JPEG2000 in lossless coding, even though it still leaves a narrow gap in lossy coding situations</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">image compression</field><field name="subject">wavelet transforms</field><field name="subject">multimedia signal processing</field><field name="subject">efficiency</field><field name="subject">low-complexity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280500 Data Format::280502 Data storage representation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Cannabis Use Problems Identification Test (CUPIT) : development and psychometrics : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bashford, Janet Lorraine</field><field name="description">Lack of a brief empirically-verified screener for problematic and potentially problematic cannabis use has hampered implementation of a proactive opportunistic cannabis screening and early intervention (SEI) initiative in New Zealand. Addressing this instrumentation need was the primary aim of this thesis. This thesis also investigated the nature, prevalence, severity, and natural history of cannabis-related problems among a heterogeneous sample of 212 &#8216;at risk&#8217; adolescent and adult users recruited from the community. In a 3-phase developmental design the CUPIT question candidates were first generated employing an Expert Panels methodology. The CUPIT structure, crosssectional, and longitudinal psychometric properties were then systematically tested, incorporating measures of cannabis-related pathology and DSM-IV/ICD-10 diagnoses of cannabis use disorders as criterion standard. High levels of cannabis consumption and related health and psychosocial problems reported portrayed a highly-disordered sample, most marked among adolescents. DSMIV/ICD-10 diagnoses were almost universal with no significant adolescent/adult differences in dependence symptoms count or severity. The two CUPIT subscales (Impaired Control, Problems) derived from principal components analyses exhibited good test-retest and internal consistency reliability and highly significant ability to discriminate diagnostic subgroups along the severity continuum (nonproblematic, risky, problematic use). At the 12-month follow-up, 194 adolescents and adults reported significantly increased cannabis consumption (adolescents), symptoms, and dependence severity. Baseline CUPIT subscale scores demonstrated highly significant longitudinal predictive utility for respondents&#8217; diagnostic group membership, health and psychosocial problems, and significantly improved prediction of other measured outcomes in conjunction with age and gender. ROC analyses identified a CUPIT score of 12 to be the optimal cut-point for maximum sensitivity for both currently diagnosable cannabis use disorder and those &#8216;at risk&#8217; in this sample. The empirical findings of this thesis research provide a compelling rationale for systematic implementation of opportunistic SEI among consumers of publicly-funded health and social services in New Zealand. Data confirmed that the vast majority of those needing help are unaware, or do not perceive, they need help. This thesis argues that, facilitated by the CUPIT, reliable proactive detection and appropriate intervention for early-stage cannabis use problems has potential for enormous cumulative impact on public health gains and the individual&#8217;s quality of life.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cannabis use disorder</field><field name="subject">screening</field><field name="subject">early intervention</field><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">cannabis-related problems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an Instrumented and Powered Exoskeleton for the Rehabilitation of the Hand</field><field name="creator">Abolfathi, Peter Puya</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Artificial muscles</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation Glove</field><field name="subject">Continuous Passive Motion</field><field name="subject">Smart Materials</field><field name="subject">Force-Position Transducer</field><field name="subject">Powered Exoskeleton</field><field name="subject">Human-Machine Interface</field><field name="subject">Shape Memory Alloy Actuators</field><field name="subject">Binary Actuation</field><field name="subject">Hand Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Hand Therapy</field><field name="subject">Hand Assessment</field><field name="subject">Functional Aid Device</field><field name="subject">Intelligent Polymers</field><field name="subject">Work Summation</field><field name="subject">Movement Facilitation Device</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3690</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anchorage in Aboriginal affairs: A.

It responds to the historical absence of children in anthropological research and in studies of domestic violence. The research is based on data gathered through group activities and discussions with children, five to twelve years old, in a domestic violence education and support group. A series of life history interviews was also undertaken. The study uncovers a myriad of ways that children make sense of domestic violence; incorporate their experiences of domestic violence into their identities; and manipulate, adapt, disrupt, or reproduce cultural knowledge about domestic violence in their own lives and relationships. Special focus is given to the role of helping or compassionate social relationships in children&#8217;s lives, not only for the physical safety of children but also for their ability to cope with domestic violence and bounce back from other hardships in life. The children&#8217;s narratives shared in this study have practical implications for domestic violence service delivery in New Zealand, as well as applied research with children more generally. The study also highlights children&#8217;s capacities for powerful observations, insights, and critical analysis. The thesis itself incorporates many different modes of data (re-)presentation, including poetry, drama, vignettes, and experiments with narrative voice and researcher reflexivity. The use of these literary forms helps to weave multiple perspectives into the thesis, allowing participants to speak for themselves. It also assists in producing an engaging and accessible account of children&#8217;s lives, which shows or represents lived experience, an alternative to the large number of statistical analyses that exist in the literature on domestic violence.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">domestic violence</field><field name="subject">abused children</field><field name="subject">resilience</field><field name="subject">relationships</field><field name="subject">adaptability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology::370302 Social and cultural anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/708</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethniehubs: A Case Study of Sydney, Australia</field><field name="creator">Widhyastuti, Ichsanna Samba Rukmie</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ethniehub(s)</field><field name="subject">consumer behaviour</field><field name="subject">ethnic stores</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">place branding</field><field name="subject">place marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discrete Lax pairs, reductions and hierarchies</field><field name="creator">Hay, Mike</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Integrable</field><field name="subject">Nonlinear</field><field name="subject">Lax pair</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Holistic Approach to Sustainability Analysis of Industrial Networks</field><field name="creator">Beck, Jessica Mareile</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainability, industrial ecology, complex systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">COMPUTER MEDIATED COLLABORATIVE DESIGN IN ARCHITECTURE: THE EFFECTS OF COMMUNICATION CHANNELS ON COLLABORATIVE DESIGN COMMUNIATION</field><field name="creator">Gabriel, Gerard Cesar</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">COMPUTER MEDIATED COLLABORATIVE DESIGN</field><field name="subject">PROTOCOL ANALYSIS</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From their perspectives: Children and young people's experience of a paediatric hospital environment and its relationship to their feeling of well-being</field><field name="creator">Bishop, Katherine G</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children's hospitals</field><field name="subject">paediatric healthcare design</field><field name="subject">adolescents in hospital</field><field name="subject">children in hospital</field><field name="subject">children's hospital design</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A yield mapping system for sugar cane chopper harvesters</field><field name="creator">Cox, Graeme J.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Yield maps provide essential information for the spatial analysis and evaluation of crop production management at a within field level. Technology has been developed to conduct yield mapping in various crops including grain, potatoes and forage, but as yet no technology exists for yield mapping sugar cane. The chopper harvester is the most common form ofmechanical harvester for sugar cane. Therefore, the goal of this research is to develop a yield mapping system for the chopper type sugar cane harvester.After a review, it is proposed that a suitable accuracy goal for the sugar cane mass flow sensor would be &#8216;less than 5% cumulative measurement error, 95% of the time (2 standard deviations), measured over a 100m2 harvest area&#8217;.Existing mass flow sensors for other crops are reviewed.Based on this review four potential techniques are proposed to measure the mass flow rate of sugar cane. These were defined as the chopper power, elevator power and feed roller separation and weigh pad. These weretested simultaneously by placing various sensors on a single harvester and comparing the sensor outputs with the mass flow rate as measured by a weigh truck. In this trial, all techniques offered potential but none produced results close to the accuracy goal. A weighing technique, known as the &#8216;weigh pad&#8217;, offered the most potential for improvement and potential to accurately measure the mass flow rate with a single calibration under all conditions. The weigh pad technique suffered from very small load cell sensitivity to flow rate, drift in baseline readings and susceptibility to mechanical noise/acceleration dynamics.An opportunity arose to install a complete yield mapping system on a harvester within a commercial operation. This opportunity was accepted to assess the potential for applying yield maps to the agronomic management of sugar cane. Because the weigh pad sensor required further development at this stage, chopper and elevator power were used as a measure of mass flow rate. A full yield mapping system was developed. Yield mapping, directed soil sampling and variable rate gypsum application was conducted on a case study field. Economic analysis shows a clear economic benefit when compared with standardmanagement.Analysis is conducted on the weigh pad sensor examining its susceptibility to mechanical noise/acceleration dynamics. Theory is developed to mathematically model the effects of acceleration dynamics on the accuracy of weigh pad sensor. Laboratory bench testing supported the mathematical model. From the theoretical and experimental analysis a number of conclusions are drawn:&#183; The weigh pad should be made as light as possible to minimise the error due todynamic conditions.&#183; Electronic analogue filters should be used to reduce the noise due to externalacceleration.&#183; The weigh pad should be as rigid as possible to maximise its natural frequency.A new weigh pad sensor was designed based on these conclusions. Field trials indicated the effects of external accelerations dynamics were significantly reduced. Baseline drift was then found as the next major factor limiting accuracy. The baseline drift was principally caused by the secondary extractor fan of the harvester inducing a negative pressure on the weighpad. A rubber curtain placed between the weigh pad and the secondary extractor fan reduced the negative force on the weigh pad due to the secondary extractor fan by 74% (from 17 N to 4.4 N). Therefore it is recommended the curtain be used to minimise the impact of the secondary extractor fan on the baseline drift of the weigh pad.A yield mapping system has been developed for the sugar cane chopper harvester incorporating the weigh pad sensor, a ground speed sensor, a DGPS receiver, a yielddisplay/monitor and data logger. Three identical systems have been constructed and installed on three harvesters for the 1998 cane harvest season. The results show sugar cane could be yield mapped using standard yield mapping principles.The level of accuracy being achieved by the yield mapping system is less than 16% error, with 95% confidence, over a measurement area of approximately 1400 m2. Although theaccuracy achieved is not to the desired research goal, yield maps were produced with satisfactory detail to make agronomic management decisions. The reliability of the sugar cane yield mapping system under field condition in a commercial operation was satisfactory. However, two techniques are proposed (&#8220;auto-zeroing&#8221; and &#8220;batch weighing&#8221; techniques) to improve the accuracy and reliability of the weigh pad readings during wet or adverseharvesting conditions.After note: At the time of writing the NCEA along with Case Austoft (CNH) were continuing to conduct research and development on the system and are intending to make theyield mapping system available as a standard item on new harvesters and a retrofit unit on existing harvesters in the near future (C. Barret, per. comm. 2001). The proposed &#8220;autozeroing&#8221; and &#8220;batch weighing&#8221; techniques are being tested.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">yeild</field><field name="subject">mapping</field><field name="subject">system;</field><field name="subject">crop</field><field name="subject">production</field><field name="subject">management;</field><field name="subject">sugar</field><field name="subject">cane;</field><field name="subject">chopper</field><field name="subject">harvesters</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004617/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Cognitive Anatomy of Moral Understanding and the Moral Education Question: A study in the philosophy of moral education</field><field name="creator">Cooper, James A.</field><field name="description">This study investigates the problem of contemporary interpretations of the moral education question, as informed by rival moral-philosophical and epistemological traditions. In this study, the moral education question is taken to mean, &#8216;What educational form and content may best assist students in becoming ethically minded and morally good people?&#8217; Accordingly, this necessitates a consideration of what is meant by morality and what are the central characteristics of the moral life (i.e. moral philosophical perspectives), as well as how such accounts of morality are seen to relate to the educational aims of knowledge and intellectual development (i.e. underlying epistemology).This study shows that current interpretations of moral education (as efforts to &#8216;teach values&#8217;) are predominantly informed by the &#8216;juridical ethical tradition,&#8217;which, in turn, is underpinned by a distinctive epistemology (or &#8216;Juridicalism&#8217;).The thesis proposes that Juridicalism is philosophically contestable because it leads to a partially distorted conception of the moral life and hence of moral education. Generally, by regarding the cognitive dimensions of moral thought and action as separate from and independent of the emotional-volitional dimensions, Juridicalism is an obstacle to understanding the proper moral educational task of schools. Notably, Juridicalism leads to a questionable emphasis on the importance of &#8216;values&#8217;, as expressed in generally agreed rules and principles, as opposed to particular and substantive moral judgements.A critique of Juridicalism is developed, focussing on its underlying conception of human reason as inspired by a distinctly Modern mind-body/world dualism argue that the fragmented and reductive epistemology of Juridicalism signals the need for a richer and more variegated theory of cognition, marked specifically by an integrated anthropology and substantive theory of reason. Further, such an epistemology is located in the realist philosophy of classical antiquity particularly within the Aristotelian tradition. I propose a defence of what I call &#8216;Classical Realism&#8217;, in contrast to Juridicalism, highlighting its distinctively integrated account of the mind/soul and body/world relationship, and substantive conception of practical rationality or moral understanding. Classical Realism also makes central the notion of knowledge as &#8216;vision&#8217; in order to explain how the rational and affective dimensions of human nature come together in moral thought and action. Finally, the moral education question is reconsidered in light of the visional ethical perspective emerging from Classical Realism. In this light I interpret the moral education question as a matter of nurturing the (intellectual) capacity for and habit of correct vision and, relatedly, moral judgement. Further, this task is shown to be vitally connected with the school&#8217;s focus on developing knowledge and the intellect through the teaching of traditional academic and practical disciplines. Some initial comments are made concerning the pedagogical implications of such an interpretation, while some associated challenges and questions for further research are highlighted.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Moral education</field><field name="subject">Juridicalism</field><field name="subject">Classical Realism</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp180.20112008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the &#8216;Mixed Ability&#8217; Program in Catholic Secondary Schools in Mauritius: Perceptions of educators for best practice in the middle years of schooling</field><field name="creator">Dauguet, Kathleen</field><field name="description">The mission of Catholic Education in Mauritius is to &#8216;humanise&#8217; education and pedagogies to be consistent with Catholic values. The vision of a &#8216;humanised&#8217; education explicitly teaches collaboration and cooperation. In January 2005, the Catholic Education Bureau (BEC) opted for a &#8216;mixed ability&#8217; philosophy whose articulation fosters inclusiveness in all Catholic secondary schools. To achieve this, schools need to re-invent and restructure themselves into learning organisations to make obvious the &#8216;mixed ability&#8217; philosophy at the middle level of schooling from Form I to Form III.The first purpose of this study is to explore an integral model for an effective education for Catholic secondary schools in Mauritius that acknowledges diversity in the classroom particularly in Form I. The second purpose is to investigate the beliefs and understandings of educators in Catholic secondary education in Mauritius of this model.For the first purpose, a review of the literature was undertaken to understand the concepts of middle schooling, differentiation, learning theories and implications for practice, the enabling structures for Catholic secondary schools to develop into learning communities and the leadership role of key actors. For the second purpose, the perceptions of educators were investigated using a predominantly qualitative, interpretative methodology around an instrumental multi-site case study.The study found a number of challenges faced by Catholic educators in Mauritius regarding the implementation of the integral model. These challenges present a new direction for these schools to focus on the human person, leading to the development and implementation of the &#8216;mixed ability&#8217; program. The study concluded with a cogent set of recommendations and directions which need to be put in place in order to improve student learning outcomes at the middle level of schooling and achieve the vision of a human-centered education within the espoused Catholic mission.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mixed Ability</field><field name="subject">Catholic secondary schools</field><field name="subject">Mauritius</field><field name="subject">Middle school years</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp181.20112008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing Better Practice for Beginning Primary Teachers: The significance of the practicum</field><field name="creator">Elligate, John Edward</field><field name="description">&#8220;Practicum&#8221; refers to the time students undertaking initial teacher education programs spend in schools during their training. Its purpose is to enable the university and accredited teachers to assist student teachers to gain experience in translating educational theory into classroom practice. It is recognised as a vital component of teacher education. In 1998 the Australian Catholic University (ACU National) Melbourne campus, introduced the &#8216;extended practicum&#8217; into their teacher education program. The extended practicum, undertaken by students in their final year, is significant to student learning as it enables them to spend an extended period of time with the same group of pupils. However, to date this program has not been formally evaluated. This study used qualitative methodology to investigate the effectiveness of the extended practicum in the Bachelor of Education course offered through the Trescowthick School of Education at ACU National Melbourne Campus. Literature pertaining to the development and current understandings of the practicum in teacher education and the partnership between the university and schools in managing the practicum was reviewed. Questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and focus groups were used to gather data about the experiences and reflections of pre-service teachers, first year teachers, supervising teachers and university staff involved in the extended practicum. The data were analysed and key themes were identified and compared between groups. The findings suggested that while all stakeholders recognised the importance and value of the extended practicum in teacher education, their ideas about its major aims and strengths differed. A number of issues were identified that could improve the quality of the extended practicum and thus enhance the learning experience for pre-service teachers. These issues included preparation of the pre-service teachers, length and timing of the practicum, supervision and assessment of pre-service teachers during the practicum, professional development for supervising teachers and most importantly improved communication between the university and schools. Information from this study can inform the development of the extended practicum, and as a consequence, the total practical teaching program at ACU, (National), Melbourne. This will further support the ongoing relationships between the university and schools and teachers who support the program and who provide an improved learning opportunity for pre-service teachers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Primary teacher training</field><field name="subject">Practicum</field><field name="subject">Australian Catholic University</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp182.20112008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maternal and Child Emotional Regulation in Paediatric Chronic Pain</field><field name="creator">Franks, Sophia</field><field name="description">Pain is influenced by biological, social, emotional and cognitive factors. Emotions are not simply a consequence of pain but rather a fundamental part of the pain experience. In addition, the social context cannot be isolated when constructing the meaning of the child&#8217;s pain, and in understanding the influence of mother-child interactions on children&#8217;s physiology. This research consists of two studies, study one investigated the relationship between anxiety, depression and physical functioning in children and adolescents experiencing chronic pain. The participants were 73 childen and adolescents who were referred to either the Children&#8217;s Pain Management Clinic at the Royal Children&#8217;s Hospital or the Sydney Westmead Children&#8217;s Hospital aged between 7-18 years old. The results indicated that these young people were reporting anxiety and depression within the normal range with significant anxiety and depression levels both below prevalent rates found in the normal population. Furthermore, depression but not anxiety was associated with increasing leves of physical disablity in children and adolescents. This led to the investigation of the relationship between maternal emotions on children and adolescents&#8217; anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms and physical functioing in children and adolescents experiencing chronic pain. Study two investigated the association of maternal and child emotions in children and adolescents with chronic pain. Participants included 62 mothers and 62 children and adolescents between the ages of 7-18 years (M=13). Mothers&#8217; emotional distress (empathy, emotional involvement, and distress) was examined as a significant factor to be associated with children&#8217;s pain sensitive temperament and functional outcomes (anxiety, depression, somatisation, and physical functioning). Children&#8217;s perceptual sensitivity and avoidance of sensation, which are components of children&#8217;s pain sensitive temperament, were investigated in relation to children&#8217;s ability to regulate emotions. The association between maternal and child emotional regulation and children&#8217;s functional outcomes was also explored. Mothers completed questionnaires assessing children&#8217;s somatisation, their own difficulties with having a child with persisting pain and an empathy scale. Mothers also completed a semi-structured interview by Katz and Gottman (1991) the Meta-Emotion Interview which discusses mothers&#8217; awareness of their own and their child&#8217;s emotions, mothers acceptance of their own and their child&#8217;s emotions, the regulation of their own and their child&#8217;s emotions and coaching of their child&#8217;s emotions. Children and adolescents completed quesionnaires measuring anxiety, depression, emotional involvement, somatisation and pain sensitive temperament. The results indicated low maternal emotional regulation was significantly associated with children's depression, anxiety and somatisation scores, whilst children&#8217;s emotional regulation was associated with children&#8217;s anxiety and depression, but not with somatisation scores. Maternal emotional distress was associated with children's pain sensitive temperament, emotional distress and reduced physical functioning. Furthermore, emotional regulation in children was associated with children's pain sensitive temperaments. It is proposed that young people with chronic pain may have a biological vulnerability to respond to stress and traumatic events as pain, and pain related symptoms. This biological sensitivity may be associated with children&#8217;s threshold of pain, whereby children&#8217;s perceptual sensitivity may be associated with reporting of somatic complaints. Thus, maternal emotions and social factors may be associated with children&#8217;s somatosensory processing and the chronic pain experience.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chronic pain</field><field name="subject">Mother-child interactions</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp183.27112008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Assessment of Animal Repellents in the Management of Vehicle-Macropod Collisions in New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Gibson, Craig Phillip</field><field name="description">Collisions between animals and motor vehicles are frequent and often result in animal mortality. In Australia, macropods are regular victims of these collisions. This has serious implications for animal welfare and conservation as well as aesthetics and tourism. Collisions with large animals and secondary collisions caused by the presence of animals on road easements, can lead to serious personal injury and property damage. A range of mitigative measures to prevent animal-vehicle collisions exists, but no single measure can be fully effective and the efficacy of many mitigation measures remains untested. An integrated management approach, employing many mitigative techniques is required to reduce vehicle-animal collisions. Repellents have recently been identified as a potential mitigative measure for reducing vehicle-animal collisions. The aim of this study was to identify the potential role of repellents in reducing macropod-vehicle collisions in New South Wales. This required the identification and assessment of potential repellents since research investigating repellents in an Australian context is scant. Macropus rufogriseus banksianus was selected as a test species for this research as a high abundance of this species exists in southeastern Australia and it is a common victim of roadkill in New South Wales. Preliminary screening trials of four potential macropod repellents highlighted the utility of two of the substances: Plant Plus, a synthetic compound based on the chemistry of dog urine; and a formulation consisting of chicken eggs. Feeding by M. rufogriseus banksianus was significantly reduced when these substances were applied near feed trays. Modest results were also detected for &#916;3-isopentenyl methyl sulfide (a constituent of fox urine), while a commercial animal repellent (SCAT&#174; Bird and Animal Repellent) was ineffective in altering feeding by M. rufogriseus banksianus. A barrier trial conducted with the two most successful repellents indicated that Plant Plus was a more effective macropod repellent then the egg formulation. Plant Plus displayed qualities of an area repellent and elicited a stronger response from M. rufogriseus banksianus when compared to the egg formulation. Further captive trials determined that the habituation of response to Plant Plus by M. rufogriseus banksianus was minimal after six weeks of constant exposure and Plant Plus retained repellent properties after exposure to ambient environmental conditions for at least ten weeks. Field trials to establish the effectiveness of Plant Plus with free ranging macropods (M. rufogriseus banksianus and M. giganteus) were unsuccessful due to methodological limitations stemming from high background variance in observed responses, equipment failure and site disturbance from outside influences. The potential role of Plant Plus as a repellent for managing macropod-vehicle collisions was highlighted by the captive trials. However, several factors requiring further research were identified. This included assessing the repellent abilities of Plant Plus in the field and further defining the properties of Plant Plus with captive trials. The effects of Plant Plus on non-target species and an assessment of potential environmental impacts also requires attention. Research assessing the potential role of repellents in other management contexts in Australia would be beneficial and the identification and assessment of repellents for other species should proceed. However, in the context of assessing repellents for use in the management of vehicle-macropod collisions, immediate focus should concentrate on extending the research to assess the effects of Plant Plus with other species of large macropod, and assessing if Plant Plus can reduce the numbers of macropods in road easements.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal repellants</field><field name="subject">Motor vehicles</field><field name="subject">Macropod-vehicle collisions</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp187.09122008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Meaning-Making: A key pedagogical paradigm for schooling in the third millennium</field><field name="creator">Hack, Joanne</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the need for schools to provide a method for young people to come to terms with the complexity of their changing world as they seek to make meaning for themselves. It begins by tracing the theoretical foundations for an increased focus on meaning in Australian schooling and its establishment as a stated pedagogical principle in federal and state policies, syllabi and Catholic Church documentation on education. It analyses the literatures of the future direction of schooling, youth spirituality and the foundation documentation on Catholic education. It proposes that there is a degree of overlap in these literatures and the common discourse and the emerging paradigm addresses the need for students to develop a sense of personal meaning. The thesis provides an historical overview of schooling in terms of the societal contexts and the educational and philosophical assumptions that underpin the curriculum and pedagogical activities. It develops a model that identifies changes in the process of meaning-making and proposes a framework that could help schools become more effective resource agents for students in the development of their meaning-making capacities. It uses this framework to investigate the key documents of one Catholic system of secondary schools. It identifies the extent to which the system actually puts into action this pedagogical principle through its policy, research material, strategic planning, school culture (charism) and religious education programmes. Finally the thesis relates the findings of the specific school system to the overall process of secondary schooling within a Catholic context in Australia and proposes some issues for further consideration.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Meaning</field><field name="subject">Catholic Secondary Schooling</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp188.09122008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Chameleon Principal: A reconceptualisation of the notion of leadership as seen within the context of a rural primary school and its community</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Angela</field><field name="description">This narrative autoethnography tells the story of a small rural community over a ten year period through the ethnographic eye. It is told within the context of a primary rural school and the community that supports it. It reflects the aspirations, the pain and the dreams of the community. Within the telling of stories, lies the question of what a leader needs to &#8216;be&#8217; for the people (the concept of educational leadership). This &#8216;being&#8217; for the people should certainly be part of the body of thought on educational leadership. The literature review examines concepts of educational leadership pertaining to aspects or issues of change, community, teaching and learning and the inner life of the Principal. These issues are explored within the framework of the school and its community. Combining literary and ethnographic techniques allows the creation of a story that intends to devise a concept of educational leadership created by and authentic to the community to which the leadership belongs. This narrative autoethnography provides the vehicle for the researcher to explore Principal / Leadership. It connects modern day educational theory to an understanding of lived experiences &#8211; the stories lived by the people in the research. A multi-perspective approach is applied to provide analytical interpretation and reflection of the lived experience documented. The findings of this research study suggest that Principals need to reflect on the lived experiences of the communities they are within in order to understand the path of leadership. The research strongly recognizes that the formation of meaningful, ethical relationships is a vital foundation for authentic leading in an education world that is constantly changing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Primary school principals</field><field name="subject">Educational Leadership</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp189.09122008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Psychosocial Issues of Orphaned Youth by HIV/AIDS in Western Kenya</field><field name="creator">Kiyiapi, Lucy Irene</field><field name="description">Despite the elaborate intervention strategies and huge emphasis on AIDS and orphan hood, there is a looming danger that might create a lost generation of young people who are growing up without role models, parental guidance, warmth, love and proper care. Young people in these times of AIDS are charged with the responsibility of caring for their infected parents until they die; and thereafter to care for their siblings. Despite playing these important roles coupled with their complex developmental issues young people face as they negotiate their independence towards adulthood, there is generally a lack of concern as far as the psychosocial issues experienced by youth who are orphaned due to AIDS is concerned as evidence by paucity of published literature. This research therefore, focused on the psychosocial issues of youth orphaned by HIV/AIDS in Western Kenya. This comparative study compared youth who have lost their parent(s) to AIDS, to those who have lost parent(s) through other causes and youth from intact families. The study explored the daily hassles and uplifts as experienced by these three categories. Their psychological well-being was studied in a bid to understand how this phenomenon has impacted on the orphaned young people emotional well-being. The extend to which self-efficacy (resilience), perceived social support and good coping strategies buffer young people from HIV/AIDS impact were studied. Data was obtained from 156 students at the Moi University. One way ANOVA test used to test the mean hassles and mean uplifts scores revealed there were not significantly different across the participants&#8217; status. Investigations to determine whether the mean scores for anxiety, self esteem, and depression depend on participants&#8217; status; a further one way ANOVA was carried out, which revealed based on overall F-test the mean self esteem and depression scores are significantly different at 5% level of significant. A pair- wise Pearson correlation was performed to investigate whether anxiety, depression and self esteem scores depend on the coping skills, self-efficacy and perceived social support. Results indicate depression significantly associated with social support, while self esteem is significantly associated with self-efficacy. The qualitative data further validated these findings by revealing that orphaned youth by AIDS were depressed and had poor self-esteem.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Youth</field><field name="subject">Psychosocial issues</field><field name="subject">Orphans</field><field name="subject">HIV</field><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Kenya</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp184.28112008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploration of a Contemporary Youth Spirituality Among Senior Students in Three Catholic Schools</field><field name="creator">Maroney, Michael</field><field name="description">The theory and practice of Catholic schooling, particularly with respect to religious education, have the purpose of promoting the spiritual and moral development of young people. This includes a special emphasis on acquainting them with the religious traditions and spirituality of the Catholic Church. Because Catholic schooling has always endeavoured to meet the religious and personal needs of students, there has been an ongoing interest in monitoring the spirituality of youth to inform the development and planning of a relevant and effective religious education. Hence, there has long been an interest within the Catholic education sector in research on youth spirituality. A significant volume of research has been conducted on the spirituality of contemporary youth within the last decade. This has included a number of major studies in Australia (Crawford and Rossiter, 2006; Flynn and Mok, 2002; Hughes, 2007; Mason et. al. 2005, 2007) and in North America, Smith &amp; Denton (2004). This project reports on an empirical investigation of the views of senior school students in three metropolitan Catholic schools in Australia. The first part of the study, a literature review, provided an opportunity to review research on the spirituality of young people to give a broad perspective on developments and issues, particularly for young people in westernised cultures. The first section of the review considered the way in which structural development theories have been used to interpret young people&#8217;s spirituality. The second section explored research related to the components and development of youth spirituality. The third section examined a number of cultural influences on young people&#8217;s spiritual and moral development. The second part of the project canvassed the views of all 207 Year 12 students in three metropolitan Catholic high schools about their understanding of spirituality and about the links between their spirituality and the experience of Catholic schooling. Each school has its own gender, charism, and multicultural dynamic. A systematic questionnaire provided quantitative data, a summary of which was then discussed in focus groups of students in each of the three schools. In this way, students were invited to interpret the empirical data and to attempt to explain why young people thought and felt as they did &#8211; yielding qualitative data. The focus groups also responded to an innovative use of cartoon caricatures of God which prompted participants to talk about the ways in which they and other teenagers imagined God and God&#8217;s role in the world and in their own lives. The study contributed to the current body of research information on youth spirituality, especially in a sample group of senior school students in Catholic schools. The key findings were: Evidence that youth spirituality is both eclectic and diverse; Evidence of some non-religious elements to spirituality; it is not linked exclusively with religion; Young people are conscious of their roles in &#8216;choosing&#8217; and &#8216;constructing&#8217; a spirituality, rather than just accepting a &#8216;traditional&#8217; pattern of spirituality; Acknowledged a strong parental influence; also the importance of friends; While a number of students identified their spirituality as &#8216;religious&#8217;, the trend was a spirituality that was not as strongly rooted in religious traditions as was the case for previous generations; The most prominent image of God for this sample of young people was a God of unconditional love and forgiveness. There was less emphasis on a &#8216;checking&#8217; and &#8216;punishing&#8217; God that seemed more prominent for earlier generations of Catholics. In discussing the meaning and significance of the empirical data, a comparison was made between the results of this study and those of five recent major studies of youth spirituality examined in the literature review. In conclusion, the project explored a number of issues and implications for educators interested in the spiritual and moral education of young people, especially in the Catholic education sector. These included: In the light of a significant and continuing increase in both &#8216;individualism&#8217; and &#8216;moral selfreliance&#8217; in children and adolescents, there is a need for refinement in the ways developmental theories (such as those of Kohlberg and Fowler in particular) are used for interpreting the spiritual and moral development of young people; There is a need for further understanding of how cultural factors like &#8216;postmodernity&#8217;, &#8216;individualism&#8217; and &#8216;relativism&#8217; affect young people&#8217;s spirituality, particularly as regards linkage with religious traditions; Young people&#8217;s images of God and their ideas about how God might &#8216;work&#8217; within the world are key transcendent elements to youth spirituality; Planning for a &#8216;relevant&#8217; religious education &#8211; which helps young people negotiate contemporary spiritual/moral issues, as well as provide access to spiritual heritage &#8211; needs to take into account the findings of research on youth spirituality.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Youth</field><field name="subject">Spirituality</field><field name="subject">Religious education</field><field name="subject">Catholic secondary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp177.11112008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Practical Theology of Mental Health: A critical conversation between theology, psychology, pastoral care and the voice of the witness</field><field name="creator">Pierce, Pauline Emma</field><field name="description">What exactly do we mean by mental illness? Is it an organic disease? Or are its causes psychological and requiring therapy or counselling with, at times, medication to alleviate any accompanying organic symptoms? Or could one even consider that, in some instances, it is neither of these and is best described as a &#8216;spiritual dis-ease&#8217;? If there is evidence that this is the case, then its causes [and remedies] must be sought elsewhere. In other words, could one argue that there are no substantial grounds for assuming that care of the mentally ill be relegated exclusively to the expertise of the secular sciences? This is the question that drives this dissertation. This dissertation named &#8220;A Practical Theology of Mental Health: a critical conversation between psychology, theology, pastoral care and the voice of the witness&#8221; addresses this question that has lurked without answer in the shadows of the human mind for as long as there has been mental illness. Beyond the primary question there are subsequent questions. Can it afflict anyone, or is it specific to some people for some, as yet unknown, reason? Is it possible to fully recover from this illness, whatever its cause, or does the sufferer remain ever after mentally, emotionally and/or spiritually fragile? This thesis will argue that in the absence of evidentiary knowledge it seems reasonable to assume that the primary and subsequent questions can be answered by the voice of the witness, the one who has experienced the phenomenon of mental illness and recovered from it &#8230; if indeed that is possible. The author of this dissertation claims to be such a voice. In 1965 I was first treated with medication for anxiety neurosis. By 1970 I was diagnosed with manic depression, now called bi-polar disorder. Certainly I suffered from delusions, illusions and hallucinations. In 1972 I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital where I remained for several weeks. After years of professional treatment that included psychotherapy, drug therapy, group therapy and electro-convulsive therapy, I encountered a self and mutual help organisation (1974) where other sufferers of mental illness claimed to have discovered a path to recovery, a path that rejected the medical model of treatment. In this setting I began my journey of recovery. By 1976 I had ceased all professional treatment, including medication. My last clinical link with the medical model was broken. However, I continued for more than 15 years to be involved in the mental health arena, saturating my mind with psychological interpretations and the findings of psychiatric research, as well as attending GROW groups in a leadership capacity, before starting my own &#8220;Faithrough&#8221; groups. Several attempts to share my experience with professional mental health carers fell on deaf ears. For example, in 1987 a complimentary copy of Ordinary Insanity, my autobiography of recovery from mental illness, was sent to every psychiatrist listed in the Yellow Pages of the Sydney Telephone Directory. An invitation to dialogue with me was extended, along with my contact details. The silence was deafening. Several attempts to absent myself from the mental health arena also proved futile. My entry into formal theological education (1993) was one such attempt, but it seemed God had other ideas! In this attempt I was surprised by two things which now appear to be related. First, my experience of both mental illness and recovery from it had reference frames in theology which allowed the experience to be articulated. This is distinct from psychology which talks about &#8216;a condition&#8217; from the outside. It does not speak to the experience from the inside. Part of the surprise was that in more than 20 years of searching and re-searching I remained utterly ignorant of any theological connection. The second surprise came some years into my education when I began to recognise contradictions between theological and psychological paradigms of the &#8216;human person&#8217;. There was contradiction here that it seemed to me had remained unaddressed from the time Freud laid the blame for neuroses at the feet of God, or more precisely at belief in God. If theology ever mounted a challenge to this Freudian assertion, that challenge went largely unnoticed. Perhaps, from this, society is left with the impression that theological perceptions of the &#8216;human person&#8217; are &#8216;less real&#8217;, and therefore subservient to, those of the human sciences. The absence of a spiritual dimension is today being addressed, indeed formally recognised in institutions such as Heythrop College. However theological and psychological contradictions on what it means to be human, if recognised, remain largely unaddressed. Those involved in mental health care from a theological perspective are essentially those in a ministry of pastoral care. While they bring a very human dimension of compassionate caring to the mentally ill, they are obliged to work within the framework of the theoria established by the human sciences. Theology seems to accept its subservience to the human sciences in the field of mental health care. We will meet this acceptance in the words of Edward Schillebeeckx in the next chapter. One glaring distinction between the human sciences and theology is the voice of the witness. The task of science, including the human sciences, is to discover/establish fact. To this end they rely on weight of numbers &#8211; part of their quantitative methodology. On the other hand, theology is led forward by the voice of the witness. More often than not this is a lone voice. The ancient prophets of Israel are such voices. John the Baptist is such a voice. Jesus of Nazareth is such a voice. In our own time I believe Martin Luther King and Mother Teresa of Calcutta are such voices. These are examples of the power of the witness to speak and influence public perception of reality. Today witnesses speak and are heard in almost every arena involving issues of morality and social justice. Feminist theology, liberation theology and environmental theology all have their prophetic voices. But who speaks for the mentally ill? The voice of the witness in this arena is given little credibility. Yet that voice belongs to a human person, one who is as much a child of God and a member of the human family as every other voice. What other voice will speak for the 17 million children worldwide who consume prescribed mind-altering drugs that can cause them to become violent and suicidal? It is scientifically established that it is the drugs, not the initial behavioural problems that cause the violent and suicidal behaviour. What might theological investigation have to say about the &#8216;necessity&#8217; of treating the brain with chemicals that have such detrimental effects? Violent behaviour aside, psychiatrists have long been aware that their prescribed medications cause Parkinsonian and encephalitis lethargica symptoms in adults.7 What might be revealed if theology investigates research into psychiatric medication, focusing on just two relevant issues: a) by what criteria is such medication deemed suitable for human consumption, and b) by what criteria is it deemed beneficial to human mental health? Given that humans are the only known creatures gifted with reflective thought, mental health is not an area of research where the results of tests upon animals can be considered relevant and trustworthy. Surely theology does not acquiesce with the unspoken prejudice against the mentally ill &#8211; that there is a two-tiered humanity: those capable of taking responsibility for themselves and their lives, and those who are incapable &#8211; those who are victims of genetic and/or environmental heredity? The majority of witnesses in the mental health arena do not speak of what is needed to improve their lot. They do not know. What they do say with a resounding weight of numbers is: &#8216;You do not hear me. You are not listening to me. You do not understand me&#8217;. Surely even the human sciences can hear that much! If the &#8216;Burdekin Report&#8217; is to be believed, the mentally ill feel that what they have to say is given little, if any credibility. I believe the deafness of society to the voice of this. There is a wealth of reports and statistics on mental health issues &#8211; world wide &#8211; through the World Health Organisation (WHO) available from available from http://www.who.int/topics/mental_health/en/ Internet; accessed 12 May 2006.Robert Whitaker, Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill (U.S.A.: Perseus Publishing, 2002), 203.By 1993 more than 40 inquiries into mental health services had been conducted in New South Wales alone. During the press conference at which &#8220;The Burdekin Report&#8221; (popular name) was released, Brian Burdekin commented that one of the most alarming things he found was that in all the independent inquiries into mental health services across Australia, not one viewed the professional in a kindly light. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission, Human Rights and Mental Illness, (Canberra: Australian Government Publishing Service, 1993) suffering renders mentally ill people among the most vulnerable group in our society today. This dissertation seeks to address social ignorance of, and perhaps indifference to, the plight of the mentally ill. It seeks to give the mentally ill a voice, a place to speak its experience and be heard. This is not an easy task. There is no abundance of witnesses who have experienced mental illness, recovered and documented their experience. Such voices are rare. They should not be discounted on that account. Indeed, if there was only one witness to have recovered from mental illness, is it not in the tradition of theology to listen to the testimony of that witness? Perhaps a greater appreciation of this is something that theology can offer psychology. Very recently a book has come to light, intended for publication in the latter half of 2007. Back From the Brink is a collection of interviews with those who have suffered a variety of mental and emotional anguish from depression to the contemplation of suicide. The author, Graeme Cowan, is not a mental health professional but rather himself a witness. The book appears to have one objective: to give a voice to the witness, and in so doing give hope to those who suffer affliction(s) so badly misunderstood. I can only lament its late arrival in the public arena, but rejoice that the concept of listening to the voice of the witness is perhaps an idea whose time has at long last come. This dissertation seeks to answer the questions the human sciences have been unable to answer in terms of recovering mental health when one has been afflicted by mental illness. The answers are presented as they were discovered, in living experience, where the differences, even contradictions, between psychological and theological perceptions of what it means to be a human person are encountered. These contradictions are acknowledged, addressed, resolved where possible, or invited into ongoing theological/ psychological dialogue. What is sought is understanding: understanding that can lead us into transformative praxis, making this dissertation very much a practical theology. While reading this dissertation I would ask the reader to bear two things constantly in mind. The first is their own personal fear of mental illness and mentally ill people. Experience suggests that very few people who have not experienced mental illness are free from this fear. However great or small that fear might be it has some Graeme Cowan, Back From the Brink &#8211; is expected to be published about June, 2007.See appendix C. influence on personal perceptions of mental illness and mentally ill people. The second is that the author of this dissertation comes from the group of people so feared. No genuine human endeavour is achieved by a lone individual, and that is especially true in the case of this dissertation. My most sincere and heartfelt thanks go to the many &#8216;witnesses&#8217; who, over a period of 35 years gifted me with the privilege of sharing part of their life&#8217;s journey, even as I shared mine with them. They have been a continuing inspiration and motivation in my life as well as in my studies. Thanks is due also to the GROW organisation which was instrumental in my recovery from mental illness, as well as assisting with research undertaken for this dissertation. Special thanks is due to Rev. Dr Michael Whelan SM who guided me gently into formal theological education recognising when I did not, the relevance of theology to mental health care. If credit is due anyone for recognition of theological reflection in the experience of mental illness, it is due to Dr Whelan. His guidance, challenge and affirmation have not ceased for more than eighteen years. Thanks to his guidance I came to know many lecturers at the Catholic Theological Union at Hunters Hill, all of whom contributed in some measure to this dissertation .I am especially grateful to one of those lecturers, Rev. Dr Gerard Hall SM, who I encountered in my very first year as an undergraduate. His ability to challenge my thinking, inspire my writing, and encourage me as he has done throughout cannot be overstated. Dr Hall has been a most positive influence in my formal theological education from the very beginning. I was also fortunate in having Rev. Dr Tom Ryan SM as co-supervisor for this dissertation. Dr Ryan&#8217;s intellectual rigor proved itself invaluable. There are others whose assistance is gratefully acknowledge: the Catholic Institute of Sydney; the Sydney College of Divinity; staff at Veech library and the library of the Broken Bay Institute; friends who dialogued for endless hours helping me to clarify my thoughts, especially Fr. Michael Kelly OSB, Fr Michael O&#8217;Toole, Peter and Nada Herro, John and Marie Lizzio, Sue Christian and Troy Fisher, all of them giving invaluable assistance. Last, and paradoxically first, I thank my five children who suffered with me and for me during the difficult years, and then became friends and supporters in these latter years. Their encouragement and support has never wavered.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="subject">Theology</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="subject">Pastoral care</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp178.11112008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Inside Story of Living With Chronic Intractable Nonmalignant Back Pain: An autoethnography</field><field name="creator">White, Susan Patricia</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to uncover and understand the reality of living with chronic, intractable nonmalignant back pain, as it is understood by sufferers themselves. A narrative autoethnographic research design was chosen, enabling me to interact with participants during the interview process, as well as have the opportunity to further explore my own experiences, as a long time sufferer of chronic, intractable nonmalignant back pain. Thematic analysis of participant interviews, and a deep, introspective scrutiny of my own journey, resulted in four stories being written. These stories illustrate the startlingly similar experiences we share. Although each story is written around one central character, they are in fact composite characters, representing the participants&#8217; experiences as well as my own. The stories are: &#8216;The merry-go-round: Searching for a cure&#8217;, describing the endless visits to various specialists, in search of the elusive &#8216;cure&#8217;. &#8216;Mourning the loss&#8217;, illustrating the grief-like process we must go through when it becomes apparent that a cure is not possible and pain will be with us for the rest of our lives. &#8216;Walk a mile in my shoes&#8217;, giving a snapshot of issues facing us in our daily lives, and &#8216;Here we go again&#8217;, a description of a &#8216;typical&#8217; pain management hospital stay. A fifth story, &#8216;We&#8217;re not in Kansas anymore&#8217;, was added following a bizarre emergency admission I was forced to endure during the course of my research. It is therefore a story where I am the central character. These stories illustrate the impact chronic back pain has on a sufferer&#8217;s life, ranging from loss of mobility to an altered body image. They also illustrate the struggle to maintain normality, including masking the pain and facing labelling and stigma. These stories identify and demonstrate the often hidden aspects of chronic intractable back pain, and have the power to inform practicing nurses, students, teachers and the community of the &#8216;lived experience&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Back pain</field><field name="subject">Chronic pain</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp185.28112008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploration of Differences in Vertical Jump Performance Between Typically Developing Children and those Identified with DCD: A kinematic and kinetic analysis</field><field name="creator">Williams, Morgan</field><field name="description">This study compared the motor performance of children identified with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) with those of a matched group categorised as typically developing (TD). Based on the existing literature, vertical jumping was the task selected as it is a fundamental movement skill (Gallahue &amp; Ozmun, 2002), and a single optimal coordination pattern has been shown to exist (e.g., Bobbert &amp; van Ingen Schenau, 1998).Within the conceptual framework developed for this enquiry, jump height, the performance outcome, was the highest level variable. Level 2 variables described the centre of mass displacement at key instants during the jumping movement. Level 3 variables identified measures of velocity, force and power, which underpin the movement, and level 4 variables described the countermovement specific to this task. This provided a more thorough analysis than previously reported in DCD literature for jumping. The objective of this study was to identify possible mechanisms of DCD in order to advance the understanding of this impairment. A cross-sectional sample (n = 165) of males and females aged between 5 and 12 years was drawn from a school in Victoria, Australia. Using the Movement&#8211;Assessment Battery for Children (M-ABC), 62 children from the sample were identified as having DCD with total impairment scores below the 15th percentile for their age-band (Henderson &amp; Sugden, 1992). From the remaining children assessed, who all scored above the 15th percentile, 62 were matched with the DCD group to form the TD group (n= 62). Participants performed three maximal vertical jumps, standing on a single forceplate. Each child&#8217;s best vertical jump was analysed using forceplate (700 Hz) and 2D sagittal kinematic data from a single camera video (50 Hz) capture. The results confirmed previous findings that DCD children jump lower than their TD peers, although there was a considerable overlap in motor ability between the groups. Peak VCOM occurred earlier in the jumping movement in the DCD group, when compared to the TD group. This meant a longer elapsed time from the instant of peak VCOM to take-off, which was attributed to coordination error. The earlier occurrence of peak VCOM in the DCD group could be explained by the lower shank angular velocity at take-off. In addition, the DCD group produced lower jump impulse and peak power. Further probing of the jump height data revealed an interesting relationship between age band and jump height that was gender specific. It was noted that for the DCD males, less than 1% of the variance found in jump height could be accounted for by age-band. In contrast, the explained variance for jump height by age-band was 24% for the TD males. The females showed similar relationships for jump height and age-band in both groups. It was thought that this may reflect physical activity avoidance caused by greater social pressures on boys to be good at sports (e.g., Parker &amp; Larkin, 2003).In addition, a further analysis of the DCD group data was undertaken to compare those who had difficulties in dynamic balance and those who did not. In this analysis, body mass was found to have a significant effect on leg stiffness (Kleg), and when accounted for as a covariate, greater Kleg in the DCD group with dynamic balance difficulties was found. A possible explanation is that for the DCD group with dynamic balance difficulties, the transition from joint flexion to extension during the countermovement was problematic, and resulted in excessive muscle co-activation. This study provides some possible directions for further investigations into coordination issues for DCD children. The time elapsed from peak VCOM to take-off and the shank angular velocities at take-off were identified as key indicators of a poorly coordinated jump. High levels of Kleg reflected difficulties in the transition from joint flexion to extension during the countermovement in those DCD children with dynamic balance problems. Based on these key variables and others that differentiated between groups a more parsimonious conceptual framework is presented. For future enquiry, a more holistic approach for the study of children with such impairments is recommended. This includes exploring the environment these children are exposed to in order to gain a more thorough understanding of practice and learning effects. Understanding of differences in motor ability requires an expanded framework to include information on genetic and socio-cultural factors, and their impact upon important psychology, physical fitness, nutrition, body composition and physical activity parameters.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vertical jumping</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Developmental Coordination Disorder</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp186.29112008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation Into the Equity and Efficiency of Australia&#8216;s Higher Education System</field><field name="creator">Wright, Sarah Jean</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the impact of changes in higher education policy in Australia on equity for students and efficiency in resource allocation. This involves measuring the impact of the 2005 budgetary changes in the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) on the Private Rate of Return (PRR) and Social Rate of Return (SRR) to higher education for both males and females across different occupations and for different qualifications. This thesis examines the proposition that the movement of Australia&#8216;s higher education system towards a user pays model with price flexibility will deliver greater efficiency. It also considers the argument that students should pay a greater proportion of the cost of higher education as they are the direct beneficiaries. This thesis shows that the increase in HECS fees has coincided with a fall in the quality of university graduates and the demand for a university education by higher achieving and low income students. In addition, this study also found that not only is the SRR positive but is greater than both the real rate of return on Commonwealth Government bonds and Government Trading Enterprises. These findings suggest that there is an inefficient allocation of resources and a need for the Government to allocate relatively more funding to the discipline areas with high Social Rates of Return and graduate skills shortages. This thesis suggests ways to improve the equity and efficiency of Australia&#8216;s higher education system. These policy recommendations aim to increase the quality of and opportunity for higher education in Australia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Higher Education Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp179.11112008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spiritual, Moral and Social Development as the Outcomes of a Program for Youth.</field><field name="creator">Carthew, Michael J.</field><field name="description">This study investigates the development of, and relationships between, religiosity, spirituality, moral thinking and social attitudes among religious adolescents participating in an early morning weekday religious education program in Australia.

Students participating in the Early Morning Seminary program of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints form the population of interest for this study.  These students demonstrate high levels of religious practice, making them an important group to research when seeking greater understanding of the outcomes of religious and spiritual developmental arising from such programs and when investigating how religiosity relates to moral and attitudinal aspects in the lives of religious youth.  

The research is survey based and entails the administering of four waves over a two-year period, enabling longitudinal observations to be examined.  A sample of convenience is used consisting of Seminary students from South Australia and Victoria.  Various survey instruments are used to measure characteristics such as family background, educational background, student religious activity, Seminary program involvement, relationships with God, moral decision making and social attitudes.  Data analysis includes the use of Rasch scaling procedures, path analysis and Hierarchical Linear Modelling software in order to investigate multilevel effects on change in key dimensions over time.

The fact that specific research regarding highly religious youth in Australia is not common and that research regarding Latter-day Saint youth in Australia is almost non-existent makes this study an important and seminal contribution in the Australian religious research field.  This study provides several other important contributions to the field as it explores developmental outcomes of a specific religious education program across a range of religious and psychosocial dimensions.

The oft-reported strong influence of the family on the religiosity of teenagers is reflected in the findings of this study.  There is also evidence to indicate that private religious activity is especially important for the level of spirituality among students.  The findings indicate that spirituality, rather than public or private religious practice, influences moral reasoning.  Furthermore, private religious practice tends to have more positive influence than spirituality on social attitudes.  Participation in the Seminary program appears to influence religiosity and spirituality significantly and independently of other variables included in the study, although the influence of participation is mediated by the feelings of students concerning the program.

Generally, students show a decline in both participation levels and feelings towards the Seminary program over time.  However, there is evidence of increased positive attitude toward a religious lifestyle, religious belief and awareness of God&#146;s influence in life.  Religious practice appears to influence change in several practical, attitudinal and spiritual dimensions positively.  The findings indicate that the developmental role of Seminary participation is largely through the influence of the class environment.

From this study it appears that religious participation in both public and private forms can have a major influence on key dimensions of spirituality and that religious and spiritual characteristics can have some influence on moral decision making and the forming of social attitudes.  Participation in a religious education program, such as the Latter-day Saint Seminary program, can influence these dimensions especially if there is a positive attitude towards the program on the part of students and the class the environment is appropriate.

In recent decades, the role of religion in psychological and social reality has seen greater attention and acceptance in academic circles.   Accordingly, the body of academic research regarding religion and associated fields has increased and diversified opening the way for further exploration of the role of religion in the broader context of human life as is found in this study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">religiosity</field><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="subject">moral development</field><field name="subject">social development</field><field name="subject">adolescent</field><field name="subject">youth</field><field name="subject">Latter-day Saint</field><field name="subject">seminary</field><field name="subject">religious education</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20081022.143905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic Studies Towards the Tridachione Family of Marine Natural Products</field><field name="creator">Kasprzyk, Milena</field><field name="description">Since the middle of the 20th century, significant interest has evolved from the scientific community towards the polypropionate family of marine natural products. A number of these compounds have been shown to possess significant biological activity, and this property, as well as their structural complexity, has driven numerous efforts towards their synthesis. The first chapter provides an introduction into the world of polypropionates, with a discussion on synthetic studies into a number of members of the tridachiapyrone family. Fundamental synthetic concepts utilised in this thesis towards the preparation of polyketides are also described, with a focus on their application towards the synthesis of 9,10-deoxytridachione, anti tridachiahydropyrone and syn tridachiahydropyrone.
 
Chapter 2 describes the work undertaken towards the total synthesis of 9,10-deoxytridachione. The novel tandem conjugate addition-Dieckmann condensation of complex enones developed previously in the Perkins group was used to generate anti methylated cyclohexenones as key synthetic intermediates. The conversion of the cyclohexenones into the corresponding cyclohexadienes via allylic alcohols was attempted, utilising a Grignard-mediated reaction to achieve the selective 1,2-reduction. Studies into the Grignard-mediated reduction were also undertaken on seven additional cyclohexenones, in order to investigate the utility and scope of the reaction.
 
The extension of the methodology previously developed for the synthesis of cyclohexenones is the subject of Chapter 3. This section describes investigations into the synthesis of stereochemically-diverse cyclohexenones from complex enones. The conjugate addition-Dieckmann condensation strategy was extended successfully towards the synthesis of a syn methylated cyclohexenone, which allowed the synthesis of the proposed true structure of tridachiahydropyrone to be pursued.
 
The methodology developed in Chapter 3 was utilised in Chapter 4 to synthesise a model system of syn tridachiahydropyrone. A comparative analysis of the NMR data of the syn model, an anti model and anti tridachiahydropyrone with the natural product indicated that the true structure of tridachiahydropyrone may indeed have syn stereochemistry. The synthesis of syn tridachiahydropyrone was attempted, and to this end a suitable cyclohexanone was successfully synthesised. However, the subsequent methylation-elimination cascade failed to furnish the desired syn methylated cyclohexenone, producing only an anti methylated cyclohexanone. The stereochemistry of the methylation was deduced using high and low variable temperature NMR coupled with selective irradiation NOESY.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polypropionates</field><field name="subject">polyketides</field><field name="subject">tridachiapyrone</field><field name="subject">9</field><field name="subject">10-deoxytridachione</field><field name="subject">tandem conjugate addition-Dieckmann condensation</field><field name="subject">cuprate addition</field><field name="subject">Grignard-mediated reduction</field><field name="subject">allylic alcohols</field><field name="subject">tridachiahydropyrone</field><field name="subject">cyclohexenones</field><field name="subject">variable temperature NMR</field><field name="subject">selective irradiation NOESY</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20081107.085933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physicochemical determinants of the non-specific binding of drugs to human liver microsomes</field><field name="creator">McLure, James Alexander</field><field name="description">Accurate determination of the in vitro kinetic parameters Km (Michaelis constant) and Ki (inhibition constant) is critical for the quantitative prediction of in vivo drug clearance and the magnitude of inhibitory drug interactions. A cause of inaccuracy in vitro arises from the assumption that all drug added to an incubation mixture is available for metabolism or inhibition. Many drugs bind non-specifically to the membrane of the in vitro enzyme source. 
The aims of this thesis were to: 1) investigate the comparative importance of lipophilicity (as log P), and pKa as determinants of the non-specific binding of drugs to human liver microsomes; 2) develop and validate an ANS fluorescence technique for measuring the non-specific binding of drugs to human liver microsomes; 3) characterise the non-specific binding of a large dataset of physicochemically diverse drugs using the ANS fluorescence procedure; 4) evaluate relationships between selected physicochemical characteristics and the extent of non-specific binding of drugs to human liver microsomes and; 5) computationally model the non-specific binding of drugs to discriminate between high binding (fu(mic) less than 0.5) and low binding (fu(mic) greater than 0.5) drugs.
The comparative binding of the basic drugs atenolol (log P = 0.1; fu(mic) = 1.00), of propranolol (log P = 3.1; fu(mic) = 0.36 - 0.84),  and  imipramine (log P = 4.8; fu(mic) = 0.42 - 0.82) suggested that lipophilicity is a major determinant of non-specific binding. In contrast, the comparative binding of diazepam (pKa = 3.3; fu(mic) = 0.69 - 0.80), a neutral compound; and the bases propranolol (pKa = 9.5; fu(mic) = 0.36 - 0.84) and lignocaine (pKa = 9.5; fu(mic) = 0.98), indicated that pKa was not a determinant of the extent of non-specific binding. The non-binding of lignocaine, a relatively lipophilic base, was unexpected and confirmed by the non-binding of the structurally related compounds bupivacaine and ropivacaine. These results implicated physicochemical characteristics other than lipophilicity and charge as important for the non-specific binding of drugs to human liver microsomes.
An assay based on 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS) fluorescence was developed using the seven drugs employed in the initial study. Non-specific binding data from equilibrium dialysis and the ANS fluorescence methods were compared and a linear correlation (r2 = 0.92, p less than 0.01) was observed at drug concentrations of 100 and 200 micromolar. The approach was further validated by characterising the microsomal binding of nine compounds (bupropion, chloroquine, chlorpromazine, diflunisal, flufenamic acid, meclofenamic acid, mianserine, triflupromazine, and verapamil) using both binding methods (i.e. equilibrium dialysis and ANS fluorescence). A significant logarithmic relationship (r2 greater than or equal to 0.90) was demonstrated between fu(mic) and the modulus of ANS fluorescence for all drugs and for basic drugs alone at concentrations of 100 and 200 micromolar, while the acidic/neutral drugs showed a significant linear relationship (r2 greater than or equal to 0.84) at these two concentrations (p less than 0.01). The non binding of bupropion provided further evidence that physicochemical properties other than log P and charge were important for non-specific binding of drugs to human liver microsomes.
The ANS fluorescence technique was then used to characterise the non-specific binding of 88 physicochemically diverse compounds. In general, acids and neutrals bound to a &#145;low&#146; extent (fu(mic) greater than 0.5) whereas bases bound the full fu(mic) range (0.0001 to 1). Statistically significant relationships were observed between the non-specific binding of bases and log P, the number of hydrogen bond donors and hydrogen bond acceptors per molecule, and molecular mass. 
Preliminary in silico modeling of the dataset generated by the ANS fluorescence technique, using the program ROCS, provided discrimination of all but one (itraconazole) of the &#145;high&#146; binding bases. However, there were 14 false positives, resulting in low overall prediction accuracy.

The design and development of a Large Image Microscope Array (LIMA), an integrated whole organ serial sectioning and imaging system, is described with emphasis on whole lung tissue. This system provides a means for acquiring 3D pathology of fixed whole lung specimens with no infiltrative embedment medium using a purpose-built vibratome and imaging system. This system enables spatial correspondence between histology and non-invasive imaging modalities such as Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET), providing precise correlation of the underlying 'ground truth' pathology back to the in vivo imaging data. The LIMA system is evaluated using fixed lung specimens from sheep and mice, resulting in large, high-quality pathology datasets that are accurately registered to their respective CT and H&amp;E histology.

The implementation of an in vivo micro-CT imaging system in the context of pulmonary imaging is described. Several techniques are initially developed to reduce artifacts commonly associated with commercial micro-CT systems, including geometric gantry calibration, ring artifact reduction and beam hardening correction. A computer controlled Intermittent Iso-pressure Breath Hold (IIBH) ventilation system is then developed for reduction of respiratory motion artifacts in live, breathing mice. A study validating the repeatability of extracting valuable pulmonary metrics using this technique against standard respiratory gating techniques is then presented.

The development of an ex vivo laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and an in vivo catheter based confocal microscopy (CBCM) pulmonary imaging technique is described. Direct high-resolution imaging of sub-pleural alveoli is presented and an alveolar mechanic study is undertaken. Through direct quantitative assessment of alveoli during inflation and deflation, recruitment and de-recruitment of alveoli is quantitatively measured. Based on the empirical data obtained in this study, a new theory on alveolar mechanics is proposed.

Finally, a longitudinal mouse lung cancer study utilizing the imaging techniques described and developed throughout this thesis is presented. Lung tumors are identified, tracked and analyzed over a 6-month period using a combination of micro-CT, micro-PET, micro-MRI, LSCM, CBCM, LIMA and H&amp;E histology imaging. The growth rate of individual tumors is measured using the micro-CT data and traced back to the histology using the LIMA system. A significant difference in tumor growth rates within mice is observed, including slow growing, regressive, disappearing and aggressive tumors, while no difference between the phenotype of tumors was found from the H&amp;E histology. Micro-PET and micro-MRI imaging was conducted at the 6-month time point and revealed the limitation of these systems for detection of small lesions ( &lt; 2mm) in this mouse model of lung cancer. The CBCM imaging provided the first high-resolution live pathology of this mouse model of lung cancer and revealed distinct differences between normal, suspicious and tumor regions. In addition, a difference was found between control A/J mice parenchyma and Urethane A/J mice &#145;normal&#146; parenchyma, suggesting a 'field effect' as a result of the Urethane administration and/or tumor burden. In conclusion, a comprehensive murine lung cancer imaging study was undertaken, and new information regarding the progression of tumors over time has been revealed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pre-clinical imaging</field><field name="subject">pulmonary imaging</field><field name="subject">multi-modal imaging</field><field name="subject">lung cancer</field><field name="subject">micro-Computed Tomography</field><field name="subject">micro-CT</field><field name="subject">Confocal Microscopy</field><field name="subject">Urethane A/J</field><field name="subject">3D pathology</field><field name="subject">alveolar mechanics</field><field name="subject">pores of Kohn</field><field name="subject">alveolar recruitment</field><field name="subject">small animal imaging</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20081013.044657</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Misguided hope: a narrative analysis of couples' stories of childlessness despite treatment with assisted reproductive technology</field><field name="creator">Peters, Kathleen</field><field name="description">Abstract

Societal expectations for procreation often result in infertile couples accessing assisted reproductive technology (ART). In the current state of this technology, the successful outcome of the birth of a child does not always occur. This study contributes to nurses' understanding of what it is like for couples to remain involuntarily and permanently childless after infertility treatment has ended, and aims to bring about change in attitudes and practice towards this group. Literature that acknowledges individuality as well as shared experience for couples who remain childless after infertility treatment is scarce. Health professionals may therefore encounter difficulties in providing this group with appropriate support. 
This research used a qualitative approach informed by feminist perspectives to gather stories of five couples' experiences of childlessness after accessing ART. Individual conversations with both members of the marital partnership were recorded, transcribed and analysed. 
The study found that due to the societal expectation of procreation, and the falsely elevated 'success rates' of ART, couples often delayed decisions about whether they should persevere with treatment, hence reducing the possibility of exploring alternative methods of parenting. As well as highlighting the ambiguity of the term 'success', the study suggests that the hope that technology brings childless couples prolongs decision making and simultaneously serves to compound the sense of failure experienced by these couples. The couples' engagement with ART, as well as their inability to conform to the normative family of parents and their biological children, also contributed to periods of isolation. Following the decision to remain childless, the participants found that setting achievable and challenging goals assisted in re-building their self-esteem, and enhanced the process of adapting to their life without children. Although participant couples expressed obvious grief at remaining childless, they also showed resilience by managing attached difficulties and stigmatisation, and by creating positive future outcomes. For these childless couples, the strength of their relationships was seen as critical in the process of overcoming adversity. This study suggests ART clinics should provide more realistic information to individual couples regarding the likelihood of taking home a baby. Further to this, independent counselling support is recommended for couples prior to and during ART treatment, and when this treatment is ceased.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">infertility</field><field name="subject">feminist research</field><field name="subject">in vitro fertilisation</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20061011.123633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Colliding Realities: An Ethnographic Account of the Politics of Identity and Knowledge in Intercultural Communication in Child and Family Health</field><field name="creator">Grant, Julian Maree</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT
Cultural beliefs and values implicitly shape every aspect of the way we parent our children and how we communicate about parenting. For parents who are migrants and experiencing parenting in a new country it is essential that child and family health professionals better understand how the cultural self influences practice. Child and family health professionals work with families who come from cultures other than their own on a daily basis. How they communicate with these families is the subject of this ethnographic study into culture and communication in child and family health.
 
Taking culture as its starting point this study explored the everyday communication experiences of child health professionals including child and family health nurses, social workers and doctors in a statewide child and family health service in South Australia. Data included participant observation, video and in-depth interview data. Drawing on insights from cultural studies including postcolonial and feminist scholarship the analysis showed that child health professionals attempted to use contemporary discourses of service provision such as partnership with enthusiasm and with genuine intent. However their application of partnership was limited by unexamined binary constructs within dominant pedagogic tools of culture and communication. Analysis showed that four key binaries structured the communication practice of participants in this study; public or private knowledge, ideologies of sameness or difference, organisational or professional philosophies of practice and the expert or partner in intercultural communication. 

Three body analysis is introduced as a strategy to work with these binary challenges that seem to present when practice attempts to incorporate theory without consideration of the contexts of use. The combination of postcolonial feminist critique and three body analysis stimulates an explicit examination of health care inequalities as they intersect with the ongoing effects of colonisation.

Current professional strategies for working with people who are new arrivals or migrants to Australia focus on understanding differences associated with particular ethic and cultural groups. Despite much work being undertaken to understand difference, in practice this culturalist approach underpinned by a belief in the essential nature of human kind, has resulted in people who are migrants or new arrivals continuing to report poor communication by health professionals as a primary barrier to their health care. Theoretical analysis suggests that this approach ignores differences in power relations among ethnic groups and ultimately manifests in racism.
 
Further, contemporary communication pedagogies in child and family health reinforce this inattention to relations of power when health professionals are instructed to communicate in ways that are regardless of difference. By advocating that people are treated the same, historic and situated issues of gender, race, and socioeconomic inequalities are ignored. In this way binaries of sameness/difference are perpetuated. Those parents located in marginalised positions of difference experience inequities in health care.

In this study, child and family health professionals frequently drew from their own personal experiences of parenting to determine the content of information given to new parents, and to inform their approach to intercultural communication. In doing so they unselfconsciously conflated their personal and professional pedagogies and presented all information as professional. Child and family health practices are deeply cultured. Many practices are not scientifically proven and as such do not fit comfortably with the rational scientific medical paradigm with which they are aligned. Where disciplinary knowledge can be assessed and evaluated, this study found that there was no equivalent place for the evaluation of understanding of cultural knowledge &#151; it was assumed as universal. 

Deeply cultured personal information tendered by participants represents a normative world that is white, western, middle class and gendered. Participants did not recognise themselves as cultured, nor did they recognise the potential impact of bringing this unexamined cultural self into the professional encounter. This resulted in seepage of practice that was democratically racist. This is where outward commitments to justice equality and fairness paradoxically exist with conflicting personal ideologies of sameness. Challenged to find a place for these constructs to coexist participants outwardly identify with the organisationally preferred position of social justice or evidence-based practice. However, participant observation and discussion of practice demonstrated that when conflicting personal beliefs and values were left unattended they found ways of surreptitiously creeping into and shaping the consultation. It seems that modernist theories do not provide adequate ontological and epistemological understandings for working with, and valuing pluralism in multiculture. Rather they constrict and limit practice which leads to an unrecognised perpetuation of colonising agendas in child and family health.
 
Findings from this study contribute to the growing need to find ways to work with and unsettle existing binaries of communication and culture. The methods also suggest ways forward to support change in practice leading to professional development that is mindful and regardful of plurality in culture and communication. Interweaving three body analyses with postcolonial feminism offers a decolonising strategy for application in the multiculture that is Australia. Due to the spatial and temporal spaces created by using three bodies alongside postcolonial feminism, this combination becomes a tangible approach to deconstruction, for child and family health professionals that is both theoretical and practical.</field><field name="date">11.11.08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intercultural communication</field><field name="subject">child and family health</field><field name="subject">cultual competence</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">postcolonialism</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20081111.095203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">LIFE HISTORY STRATEGIES OF AUSTRALIAN SPECIES
OF THE HALOPHYTE AND ARID ZONE GENUS
FRANKENIA L. (FRANKENIACEAE).</field><field name="creator">Easton, Lyndlee Carol</field><field name="description">This thesis is a comparative study of the life history strategies, and in particular seed germination requirements, in Australian species of the halophyte plant genus Frankenia L. (Frankeniaceae). Frankenia is a cosmopolitan genus that occurs in Mediterranean, semi-arid, and arid regions on distinctive soil types &#150; commonly on saline, sodic or gypseous soils &#150; in habitats such as coastal cliffs, and on the margins of salt lakes, salt-pans and saltmarshes (Summerhayes 1930; Barnsley 1982). The plants are small shrubs or cushion-bushes with pink, white or pale purple flowers, and salt-encrusted recurved leaves. 
This project investigates germination requirements for Frankenia in relation to seed age, light requirements, temperature preferences, salinity tolerance, and soil characteristics. It also explores two divergent reproductive strategies &#150; notably seed packaging strategies &#150; in relation to environmental variables. Within the 46 currently recognized endemic Australia species, some species have a few ovules per flower and produce only a few larger seeds per fruit, while other species have many ovules per flower and produce many small seeds per fruit. Large-seededness is thought to increase the probability of successful seedling establishment in drought and salt-stressed environments. As both larger- and smaller-seeded species of Frankenia co-occur in close geographical proximity, hypotheses regarding the advantages of large-seededness in stress environments can be tested. By restricting the analysis of seed mass variation to similar habitats and within a single plant genus, it is possible to test ecological correlates that would otherwise be masked by the strong effects of habitat differences and phylogenetic constraints.
Overall, larger-seeded Frankenia species were demonstrated to be advantageous for rapid germination after transitory water availability, and for providing resources to seedlings if resources became limiting before their successful establishment. Smaller-seeded species delayed germination until both soil-water availability and cooler temperatures persisted over a longer time period, improving chances of successful establishment for the more slowly growing seedlings that are more reliant on their surroundings for resources.
This study produces information on the seed and seedling biology of many Australian species of Frankenia including several that are of conservation significance, e.g. F. crispa with its isolated populations, and the rare and endangered F. plicata. This information is important for the development of conservation management plans for these and other arid zone, halophyte species. In addition, the results of this study are of practical significance in determining the suitability of Frankenia for inclusion in salinity remediation and mine-site rehabilitation projects, and for promoting Frankenia as a drought and salt tolerant garden plant.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">germination strategies;  seed size and number; salinity tolerance; arid zone plants; Australian flora; soil properties; revegetation potential</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20081124.105244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional Regulation of Human UDP-Glucuronosyltransferases</field><field name="creator">Gardner-Stephen, Dione Anne</field><field name="description">The UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are a superfamily of enzymes that glucuronidate small, lipophilic molecules, thereby altering their biological activity and excretion. In humans, important examples of UGT substrates include molecules of both endogenous and xenobiotic origin; thus, UGTs are considered essential contributors to homeostatic regulation and an important defence mechanism against chemical insult. In keeping with both roles, UGTs are most strongly expressed in the liver, a predominant organ involved in detoxification.
Rates of glucuronidation in humans are neither uniform among individuals, nor constant in an individual over time. Genetic determinants and non-endogenous signals are both known to influence the expression of UGTs, which in turn may affect the efficacy of certain pharmaceutical treatments or alter long-term risk of developing disease. Thus, this thesis focuses on the transcriptional regulation of UGT genes in humans, particularly on mechanisms that are likely to be relevant to their expression and variation in the liver. Two major approaches were used: firstly, extensive studies of several UGT promoters were performed to identify and characterise transcriptional elements that are important for UGT expression; and secondly, important hepatic transcription factors were investigated as potential regulators of UGT genes. 
UGT1A3, UGT1A4 and UGT1A5 are a subset of highly related, but independently regulated, genes of the human UGT1 subfamily. UGT1A3 and UGT1A4 are expressed in the liver, whereas UGT1A5 is not. The presented analysis of the UGT1A3, UGT1A4 and UGT1A5 proximal promoters demonstrates that a hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)1-binding site common to all three promoters is important for UGT1A3 and UGT1A4 promoter activity in vitro, but is insufficient to drive UGT1A5 expression. Two additional elements required for the maximal activity of the UGT1A3 promoter were also identified that may distinguish this gene from UGT1A4. UGT1A3 was investigated further, focusing on mechanisms that may contribute to interindividual variation in UGT1A3 expression. Polymorphisms in the UGT1A3 proximal promoter were identified and their functional consequences tested. Known variants of HNF1alpha were also tested for altered activity towards the UGT1A3 gene.
UGT1A9 is the only hepatic member of the UGT1A7-1A10 subgroup of UGT1 enzymes. Previous work had identified HNF1-binding sites in all four genes, and HNF4alpha as an UGT1A9-specific regulator. The work presented herein extends these findings to show that HNF1 factors and HNF4alpha synergistically regulate UGT1A9, and that HNF4alpha is not the only transcription factor responsible for the unique presence of UGT1A9 in the liver.
Liver-enriched transcription factors screened as potential UGT regulators were chosen from the HNF1, HNF4, HNF6, FoxA and C/EBP protein families. Functional interactions newly identified by this work were HNF4alpha with UGT1A1 and UGT1A6, HNF6 with UGT1A4 and UGT2B11, FoxA1 and FoxA3 with UGT2B11, UGT2B15 and UGT2B28 and C/EBPalpha with UGT2B17. Observations were also made regarding different patterns of interaction between each UGT and the transcription factors tested, particularly HNF1alpha.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">UDP-glucuronosyltransferase</field><field name="subject">hepatocyte nuclear factor</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">transcriptional regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20081111.223136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MONITORING AND MODELLING NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC INPUTS OF NITROGEN INTO AN UNCONFINED AQUIFER IN THE SOUTH EAST OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Gorey, Phil</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to apply a variety of investigative methods to identify the causes of elevated concentrations of nitrate reported in an unconfined aquifer around the township of Coonawarra in the South East region of South Australia.  For nearly 30 years elevated nitrate concentrations have been of concern to Government Departments, however the source of these elevated nitrate concentrations remained unknown.

Examination of an extensive historical water quality dataset for the study area identified that while nitrate concentrations were elevated during the late 1970s &#150; early 1980s, they have declined since this time.  The study demonstrates a variety of inherent biases that can exist within nitrate groundwater datasets, and presents methods that can be used for determining temporal trends in concentration that minimise the impacts of these characteristics.

The quantification and spatial variability of diffuse recharge was investigated using groundwater tritium concentrations measured in the aquifer during the late 1970s.  The modelling produced estimated recharge rates that were generally below those now adopted for the study area, and the methodology may not be appropriate in areas where high irrigation rates are occurring.  The assessment of the variability of recharge illustrates that the high recharge areas corresponded to the previously identified areas of higher nitrate concentrations in groundwater.

This correlation was further investigated statistically, and used a dual isotopic technique that applied the natural variability of nitrogen and oxygen isotopes (of nitrate) to source determination.  The statistical approach was only able to explain 39% of the variability observed in groundwater nitrate concentrations using field observations.  This approach indicated that there was a significant spatial relationship between bores located in close proximity to septic tanks and elevated nitrate concentrations in groundwater.  The applications of the dual nitrate isotopic method further demonstrated that nitrate in the groundwater is from multiple sources, with septic tanks being a probable source of nitrate.  This isotopic method is shown to be effective in source determination, with the results comparing well to literature and field observations.

Modelling of diffuse inputs from the main landuse types supports the conclusion that the elevated nitrate levels are most likely due to localised sources.

It is concluded that while high nitrate concentrations have existed within the Coonawarra area, the data interpretation methods previously used to report the &#145;plume&#146; of nitrate contamination have over-estimated the extent of nitrate in groundwater.  The elevated nitrate concentrations in the groundwater are primarily the result of anthropogenic sources (e.g. septic tanks) and natural sources (e.g. the mineralisation of soil organic nitrogen).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nitrate</field><field name="subject">diffuse</field><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">Coonawarra</field><field name="subject">South East</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20081209.091635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Explorations In Searching Compressed
Nucleic Acid And Protein Sequence
Databases And Their
Cooperatively-Compressed Indices</field><field name="creator">Gardner-Stephen, Paul Mark</field><field name="description">Nucleic acid and protein databases such as GenBank are growing at a rate that perhaps eclipses even Moore&#146;s Law of increase in computational power. This poses a problem for the biological sciences, which have become increasingly dependant on searching and manipulating these databases. It was once reasonably practical to perform exhaustive searches of these databases, for example using the algorithm described by Smith and Waterman, however it has been many years since this was the case. This has led to the development of a series of search algorithms, such as FASTA, BLAST and BLAT, that are each successively faster, but at similarly successive costs in terms of thoroughness.

Attempts have been made to remedy this problem by devising search algorithms that are both fast and thorough. An example is CAFE, which seeks to construct a search system with a sub-linear relationship between search time and database size, and argues that this property must be present for any search system to be successful in the long term.

This dissertation explores this notion by seeking to construct a search system that takes advantage of the growing redundancy in databases such as GenBank in order to reduce both the search time and the space required to store the databases and their indices, while preserving or increasing the thoroughness of the search.

The result is the creation and implementation of new genomic sequence search and alignment,
database compression, and index compression algorithms and systems that make progress toward resolving the problem of reducing search speed and space requirements while improving sensitivity. However, success is tempered by the need for databases with adequate local redundancy, and the computational cost of these algorithms when servicing un-batched queries.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">databases</field><field name="subject">genomics</field><field name="subject">information retrieval</field><field name="subject">text compression</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20081111.105047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology and conservation of the swift parrot - an endangered austral migrant</field><field name="creator">Saunders, Debra</field><field name="description">The swift parrot (Lathamus discolor, Psittacidae) is an endangered, austral migrant that inhabits forests and woodlands of south-eastern Australia.  With a small population size (2500 birds), broad winter distribution (1 250 000 km2) and often cryptic nature, the swift parrot is a challenging species to study.  In autumn they migrate north from their Tasmanian breeding grounds in search of suitable food resources throughout their winter range on mainland Australia.  They are therefore dependent on a combination of suitable wintering, migration and breeding habitats.  Although they spend a large proportion of their lives within winter habitats, the spatial and temporal dynamics of habitat use in this part of their range is poorly understood.  This thesis aims to provide a greater understanding of large-scale winter habitat use by swift parrots, in both historic and current contexts, and provide a basis for future conservation management.
&#182;
Swift parrots, or red-shouldered paroquets as they were previously known, were among the first Australian birds to be scientifically described and illustrated following European settlement in 1788.  However, within 60 years of settlement, habitats throughout the range of the species were being impacted upon.  An important aspect of this habitat loss is the speed and spatial extent with which it occurred throughout the parrots&#146; broad distribution.  Although the most extensive habitat loss in some areas occurred during colonial times, habitats continue to be lost as a result of various land management practices.  Such impacts are also likely to be exacerbated by the ongoing cumulative impact with rapid climate change.  As a result the swift parrot is an endangered species and is the subject of an ongoing national recovery program, to which this thesis contributes.
&#182;
Conserving habitat for the swift parrot, and other wide-ranging fauna species, is challenging since impacts in one area tend to be dismissed based on the assumption that there is sufficient habitat in other areas.  These conservation challenges are discussed in regard to the national swift parrot recovery program.  Although recovery program implementation for this species has been successful in identifying and protecting some important habitats, there are still many gaps in our knowledge that need to be addressed through a continuing and adaptive recovery effort, including an understanding of variable habitat use throughout their winter range.
&#182;
A study of swift parrot winter habitat use was therefore conducted at 53 sites across New South Wales over five years (2001-2005).  Swift parrots used a diversity of winter foraging habitats in coastal and/or western slopes regions of New South Wales each year, including several habitats that occur in endangered ecological communities.  Landscapes containing winter foraging habitat included scattered trees, remnant vegetation and continuous forests, and swift parrots foraged extensively on lerp and nectar from a diversity of tree species within these.  The occurrence of swift parrots at foraging sites was primarily associated with the abundance of lerp, nectar and non-aggressive competitors.  Although swift parrot abundance fluctuated significantly between years and regions, over half of all foraging sites were used repeatedly, highlighting their likely importance for conservation.
&#182;
Patterns of habitat use throughout the species&#146; winter range were also studied across five states/territories using volunteer data from 4140 surveys.  These surveys were conducted by up to 300 volunteers twice a year, for seven years (1998-2004) with swift parrots detected in 19% of surveys.  As a result, this study provided the first demonstration of large-scale drought related movements by a migratory population throughout their winter range.  It also demonstrated the dynamic spatial and temporal patterns of winter habitat use, including repeated use of sites, by an austral migrant.  Four regions in central Victoria were used most consistently, although the birds also visited other regions each year.
&#182;
During drought swift parrot abundance was significantly correlated with rainfall, whereby most of the population either concentrated in a few regions or migrated longer distances (up to 1000km) to drought refuges in wetter coastal areas.  However, swift parrot abundance was not associated with specific climate variables during years of average to high rainfall throughout most of their range. Instead they appeared to prefer habitats within particular regions.  Importantly this study emphasises that conservation measures need to be implemented throughout the distribution of migratory species, including drought refuge habitats and areas outside conservation reserves.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">swift parrot</field><field name="subject">lathamus discolor</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">austral</field><field name="subject">migrant</field><field name="subject">winter habitat</field><field name="subject">movement</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="subject">drought</field><field name="subject">foraging</field><field name="subject">environmental history</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">recovery plan</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20081010.161656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Liar Paradox and its Relatives</field><field name="creator">Eldridge-Smith, Peter</field><field name="description">My thesis aims at contributing to classifying the Liar-like paradoxes (and related Truth-teller-like expressions) by clarifying distinctions and relationships between these expressions and arguments. Such a classification is worthwhile, firstly, because it makes some progress towards reducing a potential infinity of versions into a finite classification; secondly, because it identifies a number of new paradoxes, and thirdly and most significantly, because it corrects the historically misplaced distinction between semantic and set-theoretic paradoxes. I emphasize the third result because the distinction made by Peano [1906] and supported by Ramsey [1925] has been used to warrant different responses to the semantic and set-theoretic paradoxes. I find two types among the paradoxes of truth, satisfaction and membership, but the division is shifted from where it has historically been drawn. This new distinction is, I believe, more fundamental than the Peano-Ramsey distinction between semantic and set-theoretic paradoxes. The distinction I investigate is ultimately exemplified in a difference between the logical principles necessary to prove the Liar and those necessary to prove Grelling&#146;s and Russell&#146;s paradoxes. The difference relates to proofs of the inconsistency of naive truth and satisfaction; in the end, we will have two associated ways of proving each result. &#182;
Another principled division is intuitively anticipated. I coin the term 'hypodox' (adj.: 'hypodoxical') for a generalization of Truth-tellers across paradoxes of truth, satisfaction, membership, reference, and where else it may find applicability. I make and investigate a conjecture about paradox and hypodox duality: that each paradox (at least those in the scope of the classification) has a dual hypodox.&#182;
In my investigation, I focus on paradoxes that might intuitively be thought to be relatives of the Liar paradox, including Grelling&#146;s (which I present as a paradox of satisfaction) and, by analogy with Grelling&#146;s paradox, Russell&#146;s paradox. I extend these into truth-functional and some non-truth-functional variations, beginning with the Epimenides, Curry&#146;s paradox, and similar variations. There are circular and infinite variations, which I relate via lists. In short, I focus on paradoxes of truth, satisfaction and some paradoxes of membership. &#182;
Among the new paradoxes, three are notable in advance. The first is a non-truth functional variation on the Epimenides. This helps put the Epimenides on a par with Curry&#146;s as a paradox in its own right and not just a lesser version of the Liar. I find the second paradox by working through truth-functional variants of the paradoxes. This new paradox, call it &#145;the ESP&#146;, can be either true or false, but can still be used to prove some other arbitrary statement. The third new paradox is another paradox of satisfaction, distinctly different from Grelling&#146;s paradox. On this basis, I make and investigate the new distinction between two different types of paradox of satisfaction, and map one type back by direct analogy to the Liar, and the other by direct analogy to Russell's paradox.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">paradox</field><field name="subject">hypodox</field><field name="subject">logic</field><field name="subject">Epimenides paradox</field><field name="subject">Liar paradox</field><field name="subject">Truth-teller</field><field name="subject">ESP paradox</field><field name="subject">Unsatisfied paradox</field><field name="subject">Curry's paradox</field><field name="subject">Grelling's paradox</field><field name="subject">Russell's paradox</field><field name="subject">Yablo's paradox</field><field name="subject">types of paradox</field><field name="subject">classification of paradoxes</field><field name="subject">semantic paradoxes</field><field name="subject">set-theoretic paradoxes</field><field name="subject">theory of truth</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20081016.173200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimisation of Iterative Multi-user
Receivers using Analytical Tools</field><field name="creator">Shepherd, David Peter</field><field name="description">The objective of this thesis is to develop tools for the analysis and optimization of an iterative receiver. These tools can be applied to most soft-in soft-out (SISO) receiver components. For illustration purposes we consider a multi-user DS-CDMA system with forward error correction that employs iterative multi-user detection based on soft interference cancellation and single user decoding. Optimized power levels combined with adaptive scheduling allows for efficient utilization of receiver resources for heavily loaded systems.&#182;

Metric transfer analysis has been shown to be an accurate method of predicting the convergence behavior of iterative receivers. EXtrinsic Information (EXIT), fidelity (FT) and variance (VT) transfer analysis are well-known methods, however the relationship between the different approaches has not been explored in detail. We compare the metrics numerically and analytically and derive functions to closely approximate the relationship between them. The result allows for easy translation between EXIT, FT and VT methods. Furthermore, we extend the $J$ function, which describes mutual information as a function of variance, to fidelity and symbol error variance, the Rayleigh fading channel model and a channel estimate. These $J$ functions allow the \textit{a priori} inputs to the channel estimator, interference canceller and decoder to be accurately modeled. We also derive the effective EXIT charts which can be used for the convergence analysis and
performance predictions of unequal power CDMA systems.&#182;

The optimization of the coded DS-CDMA system is done in two parts;
firstly the received power levels are optimized to minimize the
power used in the terminal transmitters, then the decoder activation
schedule is optimized such that the multi-user receiver complexity is
minimized. The uplink received power levels are optimized for the system load using a constrained nonlinear optimization approach. EXIT charts are used to optimize the power allocation in a multi-user turbo-coded DS-CDMA system. We show through simulation that the optimized power levels allow for successful decoding of heavily loaded systems with a large reduction in the convergence SNR.&#182;

We utilize EXIT chart analysis and a Viterbi search algorithm to derive the optimal decoding schedule for a multi component receiver/decoder. We show through simulations that decoding delay and complexity can be significantly reduced while maintaining BER performance through optimization of the decoding schedule.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EXIT chart</field><field name="subject">CDMA</field><field name="subject">multi-user detector</field><field name="subject">turbo codes</field><field name="subject">iterative receiver</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20081114.221408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive User Interfaces for Mobile
Computing Devices</field><field name="creator">Bridle, Robert Angus</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the use of adaptive user interface elements on a mobile phone and presents two adaptive user interface approaches. The approaches attempt to increase the efficiency with which a user interacts with a mobile phone, while ensuring the interface remains predictable to a user.
&#182;
An adaptive user interface approach is presented that predicts the menu item a user will select. When a menu is opened, the predicted menu item is highlighted instead of the top-most menu item. The aim is to maintain the layout of the menu and to save the user from performing scrolling key presses. A machine learning approach is used to accomplish the prediction task. However, learning in the mobile phone environment produces several difficulties. These are limited availability of training examples, concept drift and limited computational resources. A novel learning approach is presented that addresses these difficulties. This learning approach addresses limited training examples and limited computational resources by employing a highly restricted hypothesis space. Furthermore, the approach addresses concept drift by determining the hypothesis that has been consistent for the longest run of training examples into the past. Under certain concept drift restrictions, an analysis of this approach shows it to be superior to approaches that use a fixed window of training examples. An experimental evaluation on data collected from several users interacting with a mobile phone was used to assess this learning approach in practice. The results of this evaluation are reported in terms of the average number of key presses saved. The benefit of menu-item prediction can clearly be seen, with savings of up to three key presses on every menu interaction. 
&#182;
An extension of the menu-item prediction approach is presented that removes the need to manually specify a restricted hypothesis space. The approach uses a decision-tree learner to generate hypotheses online and uses the minimum description length principle to identify the occurrence of concept shifts. The identification of concept shifts is used to guide the hypothesis generation process. The approach is compared with the original menu-item prediction approach in which hypotheses are manually specified. Experimental results using the same datasets are reported. 
&#182;
Another adaptive user interface approach is presented that induces shortcuts on a mobile phone interface. The approach is based on identifying shortcuts in the form of macros, which can automate a sequence of actions. A means of specifying relevant action sequences is presented, together with several learning approaches for predicting which shortcut to present to a user. A small subset of the possible shortcuts on a mobile phone was considered. This subset consisted of shortcuts that automated the actions of making a phone call or sending a text message. The results of an experimental evaluation of the shortcut prediction approaches are presented. The shortcut prediction process was evaluated in terms of predictive accuracy and stability, where stability was defined as the rate at which predicted shortcuts changed over time. The importance of stability is discussed, and is used to question the advantages of using sophisticated learning approaches for achieving adaptive user interfaces on mobile phones. Finally, several methods for combining accuracy and stability measures are presented, and the learning approaches are compared with these methods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mobile computing</field><field name="subject">adaptive</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">user interface</field><field name="subject">concept drift</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20081117.184430</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Camera Motion Estimation for Multi-Camera Systems</field><field name="creator">Kim, Jae-Hak</field><field name="description">The estimation of motion of multi-camera systems is one of the most important tasks in computer vision research. Recently, some issues have been raised about general camera models and multi-camera systems. Using many cameras as a single camera is studied [60], and the epipolar geometry constraints of general camera models is theoretically derived. Methods for calibration, including a self-calibration method for general camera models, are studied [78, 62]. Multi-camera systems are an example of practically implementable general camera models and they are widely used in many applications nowadays because of both the low cost of digital charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras and the high resolution of multiple images from the wide &#64257;eld of views. To our knowledge, no research has been conducted on the relative motion of multi-camera systems with non-overlapping views to obtain a geometrically optimal solution. &#182;

In this thesis, we solve the camera motion problem for multi-camera systems by using linear methods and convex optimization techniques, and we make &#64257;ve substantial and original contributions to the &#64257;eld of computer vision. First, we focus on the problem of translational motion of omnidirectional cameras, which are multi-camera systems, and present a constrained minimization method to obtain robust estimation results. Given known rotation, we show that bilinear and trilinear relations can be used to build a system of linear equations, and singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to solve the equations. Second, we present a linear method that estimates the relative motion of generalized cameras, in particular, in the case of non-overlapping views. We also present four types of generalized cameras, which can be solvable using our proposed, modi&#64257;ed SVD method. This is the &#64257;rst study &#64257;nding linear relations for certain types of generalized cameras and performing experiments using our proposed linear method. Third, we present a linear 6-point method (5 points from the same camera and 1 point from another camera) that estimates the relative motion of multi-camera systems, where cameras have no overlapping views. In addition, we discuss the theoretical and geometric analyses of multi-camera systems as well as certain critical con&#64257;gurations where the scale of translation cannot be determined. Fourth, we develop a global solution under an L&#8734; norm error for the relative motion problem of multi-camera systems using second-order cone programming. Finally, we present a fast searching method to obtain a global solution under an L&#8734; norm error for the relative motion problem of multi-camera systems, with non-overlapping views, using a branch-and-bound algorithm and linear programming (LP). By testing the feasibility of LP at the earlier stage, we reduced the time of computation of solving LP.&#182; 

We tested our proposed methods by performing experiments with synthetic and real data. The Ladybug2 camera, for example, was used in the experiment on estimation of the translation of omnidirectional cameras and in the estimation of the relative motion of non-overlapping multi-camera systems. These experiments showed that a global solution using L&#8734; to estimate the relative motion of multi-camera systems could be achieved.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motion Estimation</field><field name="subject">Global Optimization</field><field name="subject">Second-Order Cone Programming</field><field name="subject">Linear Programming</field><field name="subject">Multi-Camera System</field><field name="subject">Plucker coordinates</field><field name="subject">Generalized Essential Matrix</field><field name="subject">Visual Odometry</field><field name="subject">Non-Overlapping View</field><field name="subject">Multi-Camera Rigs</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20081211.011120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regularity Results for Potential Functions of the Optimal Transportation Problem on Spheres and Related Hessian Equations</field><field name="creator">von Nessi, Gregory Thomas</field><field name="description">In this thesis, results will be presented that pertain to the global regularity of solutions to boundary value problems having the general form \begin{align} F\left[D^2u-A(\,\cdot\,,u,Du)\right] &amp;= B(\,\cdot\,,u,Du),\quad\text{in}\ \Omega^-,\notag\\ T_u(\Omega^-) &amp;= \Omega^+, \end{align} where $A$, $B$, $T_u$ are all prescribed; and $\Omega^-$ along with $\Omega^+$ are bounded in $\mathbb{R}^n$, smooth and satisfying notions of c-convexity and c^*-convexity relative to one another (see [MTW05] for definitions). In particular, the case where $F$ is a quotient of symmetric functions of the eigenvalues of its argument matrix will be investigated. Ultimately, analogies to the global regularity result presented in [TW06] for the Optimal Transportation Problem to this new fully-nonlinear elliptic boundary value problem will be presented and proven. It will also be shown that the A3w condition (first presented in [MTW05]) is also necessary for global regularity in the case of (1). The core part of this research lies in proving various a priori estimates so that a method of continuity argument can be applied to get the existence of globally smooth solutions. The a priori estimates vary from those presented in [TW06], due to the structure of F, introducing some complications that are not present in the Optimal Transportation case.&#182;

In the final chapter of this thesis, the A3 condition will be reformulated and analysed on round spheres. The example cost-functions subsequently analysed have already been studied in the Euclidean case within [MTW05] and [TW06]. In this research, a stereographic projection is utilised to reformulate the A3 condition on round spheres for a general class of cost-functions, which are general functions of the geodesic distance as defined relative to the underlying round sphere. With this general expression, the A3 condition can be readily verified for a large class of cost-functions that depend on the metrics of round spheres, which is tantamount (combined with some geometric assumptions on the source and target domains) to the classical regularity for solutions of the Optimal Transportation Problem on round spheres.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">partial differential equations</field><field name="subject">PDE</field><field name="subject">fully-nonlinear elliptic PDE</field><field name="subject">Optimal Transportation</field><field name="subject">geometric analysis</field><field name="subject">calculus of variations</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20081215.120059</field></doc><doc><field name="title" /><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This document has could not be found.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">error,404,document not found</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.library.qut.edu.au/404.html</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing representations of mosquito borne disease risk in Reunion</field><field name="creator">Weinstein, Philip</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] In March 2005, the Indian Ocean island of Reunion, a former colony and now overseas department of France, saw the first cases of what was to become a massive epidemic of the mosquito borne viral infection Chikungunya. More than 250,000 people, one third of the Island's population, were subject to high fevers, rash, and joint and muscle pains over the next 18 months, yet the public health authorities in metropolitan France were arguably slow to take the epidemic seriously. The research presented here explores attitudes underlying the management of the epidemic by examining both metropolitan and local representations of mosquito borne disease from historical, epidemiological and media perspectives. The research seeks to answer the general question Does colonial history continue to influence the representation and management of mosquito borne disease in Reunion? Three parallel approaches are taken to answering this question, using a common framework of tropicality (a Western discourse that exalts the temperate world over its tropical counterpart, and overlaps with colonialism and orientalism).  ...  Several factors are likely to have contributed to the persistence of tropicality in public health practice in Reunion: Othering as a universal phenomenon; the cost of administering interventions to combat tropical diseases in the remote environments of French overseas departments and territories; the denial of a serious public health risk as a cultural trait in Reunion; and the significant role of the colonies in forming and maintaining the French national identity. It has to be acknowledged that historically, tropicalism does appear to have played one positive role in the management of mosquito borne disease:</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communicable diseases</field><field name="subject">Dengue -- Reunion</field><field name="subject">Epidemics -- History</field><field name="subject">Malaria -- Reunion</field><field name="subject">Mosquitoes as carriers of disease -- Reunion</field><field name="subject">Public health -- Political aspects -- Reunion -- History</field><field name="subject">Reunion -- History</field><field name="subject">Colonialism</field><field name="subject">Indian Ocean</field><field name="subject">Chikungunya</field><field name="subject">Mosquitoes</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0174</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-operative load bearing rehabilitation following autologous chondrocyte implantation</field><field name="creator">Ebert, Jay Robert</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI) has shown early clinical success as a repair procedure to address focal articular cartilage defects in the knee, and involves isolating and culturing a patient's own chondrocytes in vitro and re-implantation of those cells into the cartilage defect. Over time, repair tissue can develop and remodel into hyaline-like cartilage. A progressive partial weight bearing (PWB) program becomes the critical factor in applying protection and progressive stimulation of the implanted cells, to promote best chondrocyte differentiation and development, without overloading the graft. The aim of this thesis was to investigate whether patients could replicate this theoretical load bearing model to possibly render the best quality tissue development. In addition, this proposed external load progression is only a means to loading the articular surface. Several factors, including those that may result from pathology, have the potential to influence gait patterns, and therefore, articular loading. The association between increasing external loads (ground reaction forces - GRF) and knee joint kinetics during partial and full weight bearing gait was, therefore, investigated in the ACI patient group, as was the contribution of other gait variables to these knee joint kinetics which may be modified by the clinician. Finally, current weight bearing (WB) protocols have been based on early ACI surgical techniques. With advancement in the surgical procedure and ongoing clinical experience, we employed a randomised controlled clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of an 'accelerated' load bearing program, compared with the traditionally 'conservative' post-operative protocol. ... Although similar spatio-temporal, knee kinematic and external loading parameters were observed between the traditional and accelerated rehabilitation groups, the accelerated group was 'more comparable' to the controls in their external knee adduction and flexion moments, where the traditional group had lower knee moments. Knee moments greatly affect knee articular loading, and large adduction moments have been related to poor clinical outcomes after surgery. Therefore, the return of normal levels may be ideal for graft stimulation, however, may overload the immature chondrocytes. Acceleration of the intensive rehabilitation program will enable the patient to return to normal activities earlier, whilst reducing time and expenses associated with the rehabilitative process, and may enhance long-term tissue development. However, continued follow-up is required to determine if there are any detrimental effects that may emerge as a result of the accelerated load bearing program, and assess the recovery of normal gait patterns and whether longer term graft outcomes are affected by the recovery time course of normal gait function, and/or abnormal loading mechanics in gait. Furthermore, analysis at all levels of PWB is needed to identify a more complete set of variables attributing to the magnitude of external knee joint kinetics and, therefore, knee articular loading, while the influence muscle activation patterns may have on articular loading needs to be investigated. This becomes critical when you consider loads experienced by the articular surface throughout the early post-operative period following ACI may be important to short- and long-term graft development.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Articular cartilage -- Surgery</field><field name="subject">Cartilage -- Wounds and injuries -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Knee -- Surgery -- Patients -- Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Knee -- Wounds and injuries -- Patients -- Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0196</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maintenance and structuring of two temperate Haliclonid sponge populations</field><field name="creator">Abdo, David A.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Sponges have an invaluable ecological importance through the provision of shelter and habitat, consolidation of reefs, bio-erosion, and in benthic-pelagic coupling processes. In addition, sponges are known to be an incredible source of compounds with bio-medicinal and commercial applications. Despite their ecological and economic importance, our understanding of the processes which maintain and structure sponge populations is severely lacking compared to other sessile invertebrates (e.g. Cnidarians). This study examines the processes which help maintain and the factors which structure the populations of two sympatric Haliclona species (Demospongiae; Haplosclerida; Chalinidae) at Hamelin Bay on the south west coast of Australia. In addition, the importance of both species to the broader marine community is examined. The reproductive biology of both species was determined from histological sections taken from each species over two years at Hamelin Bay. No evidence of asexual reproduction was observed in either species. Sexual reproduction occurred from November to April in Haliclona sp. 1 (hereafter green Haliclona) and November to May in Haliclona sp. 2 (hereafter brown Haliclona). The green Haliclona is viviparous with both gonochoric and hermaphroditic individuals observed in the population. The brown Haliclona is also viviparous with separate sexes. The onset and progression of reproduction in both species corresponded to increases in water temperature and photoperiod, but only decreasing wave height showed a significant correlation to gametogenesis. ...  A significant (P &lt; 0.05) difference in concentration between seasons was also observed, suggesting environmental and physiological factors affect the production of salicylihalamide A in the green Haliclona. The importance of each species to the marine environment was assessed by investigating the endofauna inhabiting each species across their known range ( [approx. ]1000 km's). A total of 948 and 287 endofaunal individuals were found associated with the green and brown Haliclona, respectively. Twenty four endofaunal taxa were found (from mysid shrimps to teleost fish), and the endofaunal assemblages of each species were significantly different. However, only the endofaunal assemblage associated with the green Haliclona varied among locations. Overall, this study demonstrates that the populations of both species are maintained by limited sexual reproductive output and larval dispersal. Abiotic factors (e.g. water temperature, wave exposure) influence the growth and physiology of both species, which is intimately connected to their abilities to reproduce. This has important consequences for the species populations with regard to their resilience to environmental change, and potential for harvesting of biomass for supply of bioactive compounds. Additionally, both species provide important habitats for many other organisms. The findings highlight the need for a detailed understanding of the ecology of potentially exploitable sponge species, to ensure their conservation and limit the impact on the organisms which rely on the sponges.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Haliclona</field><field name="subject">Haliclona -- Western Australia -- Hamelin Bay -- Ecology</field><field name="subject">Haliclona -- Western Australia -- Hamelin Bay -- Reproduction</field><field name="subject">Haliclona -- Western Australia -- Hamelin Bay -- Phylogeny</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contribution of different components of innate and adaptive immunity to severity of flavivirus-induced encephalitis in susceptible and resistant hosts</field><field name="creator">Shomiad Shueb, Rafidah Hanim</field><field name="description">[Truncate abstract] Flaviviruses are small, positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family Flaviviridae. Flavivirus infection in humans could cause diseases ranging from febrile illnesses to fatal encephalitis. Mice provide a useful small animal model to study flavivirus-induced encephalitis in humans since mice also develop encephalitis during flavivirus infection. Some strains of mice have been shown to be resistant to flavivirus challenge and this resistance is conferred by a single autosomal dominant gene, designated as Flvr. Recently, OAS1b gene has been identified to be a gene candidate for Flvr. Several congenic resistant mouse strains have been developed by introducing resistance genes from outbred or wild mice onto the genetic background of susceptible C3H mice. These new resistant strains that carry different allelic variants at the Flv locus include C3H/PRI-Flvr (RV), C3H.MOLD-Flvmr (MOLD) and C3H.M.domesticus-Flvr-like (DUB), the latter two being developed in the same laboratory in which the work described in this thesis was accomplished. Preliminary studies in this laboratory found that flavivirus resistant mice are vulnerable to certain flavivirus infections, particularly when challenged by intracerebral (i.c.) route. Intracerebral (i.c.) challenge with flaviviruses such as West Nile virus (WNV) Sarafend strain and Kunjin virus (KUNV) MRM16 strain were found to induce high mortality in flavivirus resistant mice while infection with Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) OR2 strain did not cause any apparent disease in the same mice. ... Thus, it can be concluded that CD8+ T cells exerted harmful effect to resistant DUB mice during KUNV i.c. infection by producing excessive IFN[gamma] that could be toxic, causing functional loss of the CNS cells. It was shown from in vitro studies that WNV had the highest tropism for macrophages and dendritic cells, followed by KUNV. MVEV however did not replicate well in these cells. This combined with the data from the in vivo studies indicates that macrophages might be involved in the pathogenesis of intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection of WNV but not KUNV and MVEV. The reason for this could be that the production of KUNV in macrophages may not be high enough to induce viraemia and subsequent fatal encephalitis in mice. In contrast, MVEV appears to use different mechanism or cells for virus dissemination. Although macrophages may not be involved in KUNV pathogenesis after i.p. infection, the fact that macrophages support KUNV replication in vitro may indicate the possibility that blood-borne macrophages were recruited to the brain where they can get infected with KUNV during i.c. infection and therefore could participate in KUNV pathogenesis in DUB mice. This study provides evidence for the first time on the detrimental effect of host antiviral immunity and inflammatory mediators during flavivirus i.c. infection in resistant mice. However, it also launches a new question on the selective cell tropism of KUNV versus MVEV responsible for inducing different pattern of immune responses and consequently leading to different outcomes of infection in resistant mice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flavivirus</field><field name="subject">RNA viruses</field><field name="subject">Encephalitis</field><field name="subject">Flaviviruses</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0199</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sapphire room temperature optical frequency reference : design, construction and application</field><field name="creator">Dawkins, Samuel T</field><field name="description">A pair of high-stability optical frequency references has been developed. The devices are based on room temperature Fabry-Perot cavities with mirrors spaced apart by a hollow single-crystal sapphire element. The sapphire element delivers mechanical sti ness that provides improved immunity to vibrational perturbations compared with the more common spacers made from ultra-low expansion glass. The system is housed in an vacuum chamber designed to provide isolation from environmental perturbations through the use of an active thermal control system, suspension legs and a unique beam alignment system. The dimensional stability of the Fabry-Perot was translated into a highly stable laser frequency by frequency locking a 1064nm Nd:YAG laser to the centre of a mode of the cavity. This frequency lock was implemented by the Pound-Drever-Hall scheme. By careful design, this control system was able to hold the frequency of the laser to within parts in 1016 of the frequency of the fundamental cavity mode. The minimum fractional frequency stability of the laser frequency was measured at 2.1x10[-]14 for integration times of 0.8 s, limited by the residual instability of the Fabry-Perot cavity. The experimental methods used to measure the performance of the system have also been considered in depth. For example, the most common way of characterizing the frequency stability of a frequency standard is the Allan variance. It is demonstrated that, without care, data taken with modern frequency counters can produce erroneous and distorted results when their output is supplied to this algorithm. The method to avoid or account for these errors is also presented. The Fabry-Perot cavity performance is limited on long timescales by residual temperature  uctuations, which can be ameliorated in future by enhancing the design of the thermal control system. At short timescales, the system is limited by vibration-induced  uctuations together with a white noise source, that is yet to be identi ed, but may relate to fundamental thermodynamic temperature  uctuations of the sapphire spacer. This system was used to measure the stability of an optical signal synthesised from a cryogenic microwave sapphire oscillator using an wide-band optical frequency comb. This was the  rst demonstration of a multiplication of an ultra-stable signal from the microwave frequency domain into the optical frequency domain, without loss of  delity at the level of 2x10[-]14.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nd-YAG lasers</field><field name="subject">Fabry-Perot interferometers</field><field name="subject">Frequency standards</field><field name="subject">Optical communications</field><field name="subject">Optical resonance</field><field name="subject">Laser stabilization</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of male secondary sexual traits in human mate choice : are they preferred by females and do they signal mate quality ?</field><field name="creator">Peters, Marianne</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]Judgements of physical attractiveness are thought to reflect evolved preferences for a high quality mate. The central aim of this thesis was to investigate the hypothesis that female preferences are adaptations for finding good quality mates and that faces and bodies signal honest information about mate quality. To date, most human mate preference studies have examined face or body attractiveness alone, and many have created stimuli using computer graphic techniques. Throughout these studies, I endeavoured to maximise the biological relevance of my studies by incorporating both face and body attractiveness, and using photographs of individual participants. Most research on attractiveness has focused on faces or bodies separately, while our preferences have evolved based on both seen together. A fundamental requirement of studying face and body attractiveness independently is that there is no interaction between the two. My first study confirmed that the face and body did not interact when an overall attractiveness judgment was made. I also investigated the independent contributions of rated attractiveness of the face and the body to ratings of overall attractiveness. Face and body attractiveness each made significant independent contributions to overall attractiveness in males and females. For both sexes, facial attractiveness predicted overall attractiveness more strongly than did body attractiveness, and this difference was significant in males. ...  This study indicates that although current levels of T covary with male mating success, this effect may not be mediated by women's preferences for visual cues to T levels conveyed in static face or body features. The fourth study in this thesis investigated the phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis, which proposes that females obtain reliable information on male fertility from male expression of sexual traits. A previous study of Spanish men reported that facial attractiveness was positively associated with semen quality. I aimed to determine whether this effect was widespread by examining a large sample of Australian men. I also extended my study to determine whether cues to semen quality are provided by components of attractiveness: masculinity, averageness, and symmetry. I found no significant correlations between semen quality parameters and attractiveness or attractive traits. While male physical attractiveness may signal aspects of mate quality, my results suggest that phenotype-linked cues to male fertility may not be generalised across human populations. Together, these studies challenge current methodologies and theories of preferences for secondary sexual traits as honest signals of mate quality. The findings show that it is important to study human mate preferences in biologically relevant contexts, for example by using photographs of both faces and bodies, to maximise the real life application of results. In addition, the findings suggest that male attractiveness does not signal cues to testosterone or semen quality, although testosterone is associated with mating success. The implications of these findings and possible avenues for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sexual attraction -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Sexual attraction -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Secondary sexual characteristics</field><field name="subject">Attractiveness</field><field name="subject">Testosterone</field><field name="subject">Mate quality</field><field name="subject">Masculinity</field><field name="subject">Semen quality</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping of chromosome regions associated with seed zinc accumulation in barley</field><field name="creator">Sadeghzadeh, Behzad</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Zinc deficiency in crops is the most widespread micronutrient deficiency, with about 50% of the cereal-growing areas worldwide containing low levels of plant-available Zn.

Furthermore, Zn-dense seeds have agronomic benefits, resulting in greater seedling vigour, bigger root system and higher crop yield when sowed to soils with low plant-available Zn. Enhancing nutrient content and nutritional quality of crops for human nutrition is a global challenge currently, but it was mostly ignored during the breeding process in the past. There is a significant genotypic variation for seed Zn accumulation in several crops (including barley) which could be exploited in the breeding programs to produce genotypes with higher seed Zn concentration and content. However, the progress in Zn efficiency until now has mainly relied on conventional plant breeding approaches that have had limited success. Therefore, reliable alternative methods are required. Enhancing mineral nutrition through plant biotechnology may be a sustainable and beneficial approach in developing Zn-dense seeds in the staple crops. ... This DNA band was sequenced and converted into a simple sequence-specific PCR-based marker, which was designated as SZnR1 (seed Zn-regulator1). The developed marker is very easy to score, is inexpensive to run and amenable for a large number of plant samples. The successful development of SZnR1 molecular marker linked to chromosome region associated with seed Zn concentration and content using MFLP in this study illustrates the advantage of this technique over some other DNA fingerprinting methods used for identification of molecular markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS). In conclusion, the greater Zn efficiency of Sahara over Clipper under sufficient Zn supply may be attributed to its higher uptake of Zn. It appears that soil-based pot experiments under controlled condition may offer potential improvements over field experiments in screening for seed Zn accumulation. Shoot and seed Zn concentration and content can be used to diagnose the Zn statues of barley genotypes, and may be a useful selection criterion for Zn efficiency in large populations like doubled-haploid populations aimed at developing molecular markers for Zn efficiency. Identified QTLs influencing seed Zn concentration were repeatable in the field and glasshouse conditions, suggesting their robustness across environments as well as their value in marker-assisted selection. The developed PCR-based marker SZnR1 and other molecular markers associated with the QTLs on the short and long arms of chromosome 2H have the potential to be used for marker-assisted selection in breeding for Zn-dense seed in barley.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Barley -- Genetics</field><field name="subject">Barley -- Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Plant genome mapping</field><field name="subject">Plant molecular genetics</field><field name="subject">Plants -- Effect of zinc on</field><field name="subject">Soils -- Zinc content</field><field name="subject">Molecular marker</field><field name="subject">Seed Zn accumulation</field><field name="subject">Barley</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0204</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The economics of measuring fiscal decentralisation</field><field name="creator">Vo, Duc Hong</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates economic aspects of the measurement of fiscal decentralisation to establish how a nation's fiscal arrangements can be consistently measured, so they can be compared internationally.

A robust body of research confirms that teacher quality contributes to quality of education (Darling-Hammond, 2000; Hay McBer, 2000; Kaplan &amp; Owings, 2002; OECD, 2002; Ramsay, 2000). Staffing histories of rural and remote schools identify persistent difficulties in recruiting and retaining teachers, but previous research has failed to address the experiences and perspectives of rural and remote teachers from the earliest phases of appointment, tracking their experiences over time. In times and places of persistent teacher shortages, teacher quality of worklife issues are paramount. Factors impacting on teacher quality of worklife may impact on teacher retention, staffing levels and ultimately the quality of education for children. For these reasons, this study aimed to develop substantive theory about the experiences of teachers commencing appointments in rural and remote schools by investigating the perspectives of novice, interstate and overseas-qualified teachers. The study sought to develop understandings of rural and remote teachers quality of worklife. In order to achieve this aime, the experiences of 29 teachers were examined, in four categories of teachers likely to be appointed to rural and remote locations: young novices; mature-aged novices; interstate; and overseas-qualified teachers in a qualitative collective case study. ...  Awareness of the variety of factors in multiple environments, and the complex interplay between them, helps to account for the diversity of perspectives and quality of worklife outcomes for rural and remote teachers. Two theories were generated from ten propositions. The first theory, Quality of Worklife for Rural and Remote Teachers: Person-Environment Fit to Multiple Environments, identified protective and risk factors associated with workrole, workplace, organisation, geographic and socio-cultural community environments. The theory recognises spillover between work and non-work life experiences, impacting on quality of teacher worklife; however, factors directly associated with worklife impacted most significantly on quality of worklife. The second theory, Processes of Adaptation to Multiple Rural and Remote Environments, identified processes (teacher expectations, evaluations of environments, responses to environments) and coping strategies (direct-action, palliative and avoidant) as leading to one of four outcomes: integration; resilient integration; disequilibrium; and withdrawal. The case study findings offer original understandings of experiences of teachers newly appointed to rural and remote schools, through the development of theory about multiple environments teachers encounter and processes of adaptation associated with their relocation to rural and remote areas. The findings have implications for theory, policy and practice, and contribute new dimensions to the general quality of worklife literature.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Distance education -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Education, Rural -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Teachers -- Recruiting -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Teachers, Foreign -- Employment -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Rural education</field><field name="subject">Quality of worklife</field><field name="subject">Novice teachers</field><field name="subject">Overseas-qualified teachers</field><field name="subject">Interstate teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of the forced oscillation technique for clinical assessment of young children with cystic fibrosis</field><field name="creator">Gangell, Catherine Louise</field><field name="description">Background: Measurements of lung function are routinely used in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) to provide information that may be clinically relevant. Spirometry is the conventional lung function measurement used, however young children find spirometry difficult to perform and often cannot achieve the strict acceptability criteria for the test. The forced oscillation technique (FOT) is a lung function measurement that only requires tidal breathing and is easy for young children to perform. However, there is limited information about the utility of this technique in the clinical assessment of young children with CF who are unable to perform spirometry. Aims: The aim of this project was to evaluate the FOT for clinical assessment in 2 to 7 year old children with CF. Specifically this involved: 1. Technical assessment of the FOT in children with CF; 2. Comparisons of lung function using the FOT in children with CF and healthy children; 3. Evaluation of associations with factors known to be associated with lung disease including: i) inflammation ii) infection and iii) structural damage. Methods Lung function was measured in a cohort of 59 children between the ages of 2 and 7 years with CF at the time of quarterly clinic visits. Resistance and reactance at 6, 8 and 10Hz (Rrs6, Rrs8, Rrs10, Xrs6, Xrs8, Xrs10, respectively) were reported and expressed as Z scores. Children were classified as asymptomatic or symptomatic based on a respiratory questionnaire and physical examination at the time of testing. Bronchoalveolar lavage and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) were performed annually under general anaesthesia annually. BAL fluid was assessed for the presence of micro-organisms and quantification of a range of inflammatory markers and HRCT used to determine the extent of structural abnormalities. Results: The between test repeatability (n=25) for lung function was within limits previously described in healthy children. No systematic bias was observed and repeatability was not affected by the presence of respiratory symptoms. Children with CF (n=57) had significantly increased Rrs6-10 (p&lt;0.0001) and decreased Xrs6-10 (p&lt;0.004) compared to healthy children. Rrs6 and Xrs6-10 were significantly worse in the presence of respiratory symptoms, and Rrs6-10 progressively worsened from an asymptomatic to a symptomatic clinic visit. Children with CF (n=48) had no greater bronchodilator response (BDR) compared to healthy children. BDR was not influenced by the presence of an infection or respiratory symptoms. No relationships between inflammatory markers and lung function (n=39) were identified when the presence of an infection was adjusted for. Children with a current infection (n=20) had increased Rrs6-10 (p&lt;0.01) and decreased Xrs6-10 (p&lt;0.04) compared to children who were uninfected (n=23). These relationships were most marked for children infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with children having a reduced lung function between 0.95 and 1.47 of a Z score. No relationships with the presence or absence of mild structural abnormalities (bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening and air trapping) and lung function at the time of HRCT were identified (n=34). Conclusion: The FOT is a repeatable measurement of lung function in children with CF and reliable results can be obtained in children as young as 2 years old. Young children with CF exhibit altered respiratory function which was affected by the presence of factors known to be associated with lung disease. The FOT has the potential to provide useful information about changes in clinical status in young children with CF and may be used to direct management of patient lung disease.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cystic fibrosis in children</field><field name="subject">Pulmonary function tests</field><field name="subject">Cystic fibrosis</field><field name="subject">Forced oscillation technique</field><field name="subject">Preschoolers</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the spatial and temporal variation in anthropogenically induced channel response in the Irwin River catchment</field><field name="creator">Warman, Craig S.</field><field name="description">The Irwin River catchment, located in the central western region of Western Australia, has been the scene of significant geomorphological change over both historical and geological timescales. This thesis focuses on the most recent of these changes, the anthropogenic imprint, through the development of a catchment-scale understanding of system behaviour. Analysis and modelling of changes in the hydrological behaviour of the system indicates that while the Irwin River has displayed a natural susceptibility to large flood events, these have been exacerbated by the widespread clearing of native vegetation throughout the catchment. As a result, when such events do occur, the catchment response is now larger, more direct and has a greater ability to cause erosion. However, the nature and detail of sediment yield processes and stream channel response varies markedly throughout the system. A series of representative channel reaches, as defined by their planform characteristics, geometry and architecture, are presented to illustrate spatial changes in stream channel behaviour. A distinct variation in river morphotypes is seen both downstream throughout the system as well as across the tributary sub-catchments of the Irwin River, Lockier River and Green Brook. This inter and intra sub-catchment variation in stream channel response can be attributed to changes in the boundary conditions and coupling mechanisms in operation throughout the Irwin River system. The pronounced spatial variability in response to human disturbance and the changing nature of catchment-scale connectivity seen in the Irwin River system differs markedly to that reported elsewhere in the literature. Appreciation of the variability in form, behaviour and evolutionary history throughout the Irwin River catchment not only provides the foundation for effective management but also contributes to a wider understanding of fluvial system behaviour. Unlike the majority of existing literature, which tends to identify and measure channel changes in a single catchment where historical variation to the sediment and discharge regime is well known, this study demonstrates the role of boundary conditions in determining the response of the fluvial system to changing environmental controls.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fluvial geomorphology</field><field name="subject">Nature -- Effect of human beings on</field><field name="subject">Watersheds -- Western Australia -- Effect of human beings on</field><field name="subject">Anthropogenically induced change</field><field name="subject">Channel responses</field><field name="subject">Boundary conditions and coupling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0214</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Steroid receptor-associated immunophilins : influence of targeted knockdown and altered expression on receptor signalling</field><field name="creator">Cluning, Carmel</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Steroid receptors belong to the superfamily of nuclear receptors, and include the androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptors (ER[alpha] and ER[beta], glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and the progesterone receptors (PRA and PRB). Before binding ligand, the receptor undergoes biochemical and structural modifications through a series of interactions with molecular chaperones and cochaperones all within a receptor heterocomplex. The mature receptor complexes with the major chaperone Hsp90, the stabilising cochaperone p23, and one member of a group of cochaperones termed immunophilins. Steroid receptor-associated immunophilins include the cyclophilin, CyP40, two FK506-binding proteins, FKBP51 and FKBP52, and the protein phosphatase, PP5. Immunophilins are characterised by the presence of TPR domains which compete directly for the TPR-acceptor site within Hsp90. This leads to mutually exclusive, immunophilin-containing receptor complexes. While PP5 contains a C-terminal phosphatase domain, CyP40, FKBP51 and FKBP52 each contain an N-terminal peptidyl prolyl isomerase (PPIase) domain, which catalyses the cis/trans isomerisation of prolyl peptide bonds. FKBP52 has been demonstrated to potentiate the ligand-dependent activity of AR, GR and PR, but not ER[alpha]. Knowing that CyP40 is the preferred immunophilin associated with the ER[alpha] heterocomplex, it was hypothesised that this immunophilin plays a role in ER[alpha] function. ... As all mutants maintained this potentiating activity it was concluded that the five altered residues found within gpGR do not contribute to the altered interaction of FKBP52 and receptor. However, it cannot be discounted that FKBP51 is more competitive for gpGR. Immunophilins are hormonally regulated, with FKBP52 found to be essential for female fertility in mice. It was hypothesised that levels of immunophilins, associated with steroid receptors important in the menstrual cycle, would be regulated to reflect hormonal activity within cycling endometrium. Human pre-menopausal endometrial sections taken from different phases of the menstrual cycle were examined immunohistochemically for expression of CyP40, FKBP51, FKBP51 and PP5. Immunophilin levels peaked at the mid-secretory phase correlating with stromal decidualization, a process essential for eventual blastocyst implantation. The importance of immunophilins to steroid receptor action was therefore reinforced by the observation that immunophilins appear to be hormonally regulated in cycling pre-menopausal human endometrium. Further studies into the effects of immunophilin loss and knockdown on steroid receptor-mediated responses in specific mouse tissues, knockout-derived mouse embryo fibroblasts and cancer cell lines may contribute to our understanding of the receptor-selective and tissue-specific actions of the immunophilins. Elucidation of the mechanisms through which they modulate receptor function may provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention in steroid-related disease.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hormones, Sex -- Receptors</field><field name="subject">Peptidylprolyl isomerase</field><field name="subject">Immunophilins</field><field name="subject">Steroid receptors</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0215</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dendritic cells and macrophages in the mammalian cornea : distribution, morphology, phenotype and their role in responding to microbial challenge</field><field name="creator">Chinnery, Holly Rose</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The cornea plays a major role in the refraction of light and thus the maintenance of its transparency is critical for optimal vision. Infection or trauma can initiate a host inflammatory response, which can cause edema of the collagenous stroma. This tissue edema compromises vision by disrupting the regular arrangement of the corneal stromal lamellae, whose organization is critical to its refractive properties. Until recently, it was the accepted dogma that the cornea was an immune privileged tissue owing in part to its avascular nature and paucity of resident macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) in the central region of the cornea. However, recent studies have identified heterogenous populations of macrophages and DCs in both the corneal stroma and epithelium. Despite the recognition of the existence of these cells in the cornea, very little is known about their biological role. The overall purpose of the experiments described in this thesis is to characterise corneal macrophages and DCs in homeostatic conditions and investigate their role in the initiation of inflammatory responses to bacterial ligands that induce corneal inflammation and contribute to the severity and resolution of bacterial keratitis. Experiments described in this thesis utilized a range of transgenic, knock-out and bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice to address the immunological function and characterization of BM-derived cells in the mouse cornea. Of particular importance was the use of Cx3cr1 transgenic mice, which contain an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) encoding cassette knocked into the Cx3cr1 gene that disrupts its expression but facilitates GFP expression under the control of the Cx3cr1 promoter. ... This highlights a novel functional role for corneal BM-derived cells in the recognition and initiation of inflammatory responses to LPS. Finally, a novel observation of a potential mechanism by which DC in the cornea communicate with neighbouring DCs via fine membrane extensions was identified in both chimeric and wild-type mice. These membrane nanotubes, found exclusively on MHC class II+ cells in the corneal stroma, significantly increased in density in the central cornea under inflammatory conditions, suggesting a role for these cell protrusions in the immune response. These data represent the first ever description of nanotubes in vivo, the only previous evidence of their presence being in vitro studies. In summary, the data presented in this thesis supports a role for Cx3cr1 in the homing of DCs to the normal corneal epithelium and also suggests that Cx3cr1-deficiency may influence the ability of corneal macrophages and DCs to respond to bacteria. In addition, the thesis supports a role for resident corneal macrophages and DCs in the initiation of immune responses following challenge with LPS, which is possibly supported by a newly discovered system of membrane nanotubes. A greater understanding of the biology of the resident corneal immune cells could lead to the development of potential therapies aimed at targeting macrophages and DCs as a means of regulating potentially harmful inflammatory responses in the cornea.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bacteria</field><field name="subject">Cornea</field><field name="subject">Dendritic cells</field><field name="subject">Keratitis</field><field name="subject">Macrophages</field><field name="subject">Cornea</field><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="subject">Macrophage</field><field name="subject">Dendritic cell</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Call-independent identification in birds</field><field name="creator">Fox, Elizabeth J. S.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The identification of individual animals based on acoustic parameters is a non-invasive method of identifying individuals with considerable advantages over physical marking procedures. One requirement for an effective and practical method of acoustic individual identification is that it is call-independent, i.e. determining identity does not require a comparison of the same call or song type. This means that an individuals identity over time can be determined regardless of any changes to its vocal repertoire, and different individuals can be compared regardless of whether they share calls. Although several methods of acoustic identification currently exist, for example discriminant function analysis or spectrographic cross-correlation, none are call-independent. Call-independent identification has been developed for human speaker recognition, and this thesis aimed to: 1) determine if call-independent identification was possible in birds, using similar methods to those used for human speaker recognition, 2) examine the impact of noise in a recording on the identification accuracy and determine methods of removing the noise and increasing accuracy, 3) provide a comparison of features and classifiers to determine the best method of call-independent identification in birds, and 4) determine the practical limitations of call-independent identification in birds, with respect to increasing population size, changing vocal characteristics over time, using different call categories, and using the method in an open population. ... For classification, Gaussian mixture models and probabilistic neural networks resulted in higher accuracy, and were simpler to use, than multilayer perceptrons. Using the best methods of feature extraction and classification resulted in 86-95.5% identification accuracy for two passerine species, with all individuals correctly identified. A study of the limitations of the technique, in terms of population size, the category of call used, accuracy over time, and the effects of having an open population, found that acoustic identification using perceptual linear prediction and probabilistic neural networks can be used to successfully identify individuals in a population of at least 40 individuals, can be used successfully on call categories other than song, and can be used in open populations in which a new recording may belong to a previously unknown individual. However, identity was only able to be determined with accuracy for less than three months, limiting the current technique to short-term field studies. This thesis demonstrates the application of speaker recognition technology to enable call-independent identification in birds. Call-independence is a pre-requisite for the successful application of acoustic individual identification in many species, especially passerines, but has so far received little attention in the scientific literature. This thesis demonstrates that call-independent identification is possible in birds, as well as testing and finding methods to overcome the practical limitations of the methods, enabling their future use in biological studies, particularly for the conservation of threatened species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Birds -- Identification</field><field name="subject">Birdsongs</field><field name="subject">Speech perception</field><field name="subject">Acoustics</field><field name="subject">Individual recognition</field><field name="subject">Acoustic identification</field><field name="subject">Willie wagtail</field><field name="subject">Artificial neural network</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional characterisation of a novel osteoclast-derived factor</field><field name="creator">Davey, Tamara</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Intracellular communication between osteoclasts and osteoblasts is imperative to maintain bone integrity. A myriad of molecules are responsible for regulating osteoblast and osteoclast activity. In particular, it is well documented that osteoblast-derived factors are crucial in directly controlling osteoclast formation and function. Since bone formation is coupled to bone resorption, it would be expected that osteoclasts also have some role in regulating the growth and function of osteoblast cells. However, despite extensive research upon osteoclast and osteoblast biology, the mechanisms by which osteoclasts regulate osteoblast growth and function is not well understood. In an attempt to further elucidate the mechanisms by which osteoclasts and osteoblasts communicate, the technique of subtractive hybridisation was used to identify a novel osteoclastderived factor identical to that of mouse Seminal Vesicle Secretion VII (SVS VII). Previous characterisation of the gene in bone demonstrated that SVS VII was abundantly and specifically expressed by mature osteoclasts (Phan, 2004). Additional research hinted that SVS VII acted as a novel osteoclast-derived factor, that by paracrine mechanisms, targeted osteoblast function (Phan, 2004). However, it remained open as to whether the SVS VII molecule did uniquely target the osteoblast, and whether this interaction influenced bone formation in vivo. Therefore, this thesis endeavoured to functionally characterise the role of the SVS VII molecule in the bone environment. ... Further work is needed to identigy a clear consensus binding sequence, to determine the specificity of the interaction between SVS VII protein and each phage clone, and to isolate a specific binding partner for SVS VII. In conclusion, the studies of this thesis sought to characterise the significance of SVS VII expression by mature osteoclasts, relative to its effects on osteoblast behaviour, but failed to conclusively determine a role for SVS VII in bone. Given that the effects of SVS VII on in vitro osteoblast activity and function are minimal, it is doubtful that SVS VII primarily acts as a paracrine factor integral to osteoblast function. Therefore, these findings conflict with those presented previously (Phan, 2004). However, it was demonstrated that SVS VII treatment was associated with in vivo effect on the skeleton, suggesting that SVS VII may target other elements of the bone microenvironment. Via mechanisms not yet understood, which possibly involves additional factors of the bone 11 extracellular matrix, SVS VII may target a subset of osteoprogenitor cells within the bone environment and act to regulate their proliferation. Therefore, SVS VII may enhance osteogenic precursor cell number at sites of bone formation which would increase the pool of cells that can differentiate down the osteoblast linage and contribute to bone formation. In this regard, SVS VII might function in a manner homologous to the Ly-6 molecule Sca-1 and act as an important factor that maintains a balance between the bone formation and resorption process. Clearly, more work focusing on alternative facets of bone biology is needed to identify whether there is a significant role for SVS VII in skeletal tissue.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Seminal vesicles</field><field name="subject">Bones -- Growth</field><field name="subject">Bone resorption</field><field name="subject">Bone cells</field><field name="subject">Seminal vesicle secretion VII (SVS VII)</field><field name="subject">Osteoblast</field><field name="subject">Osteoclast</field><field name="subject">Bone formation/resorption</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Body dissatisfaction and its relationship with the perceptual effects of exposure to bodies and attentional biases toward bodies</field><field name="creator">Glauert, Rebecca</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Socio-cultural processes are often cited as one of the main causes of body dissatisfaction amongst women. Numerous studies have found that exposure to thin, idealized images in the media increases women's body dissatisfaction. The central aims of this thesis are to investigate how exposure to thin and fat bodies alters womens perceptions of body normality and body ideals, whether body dissatisfaction is related to these changes, and whether body dissatisfaction is associated with an attentional bias toward thin bodies. In Chapter 1 I review the main theories dominating body dissatisfaction research. In Chapter 2 I present two studies which investigate how exposure to thin and fat bodies influences perceptions of body normality and ideal body size. Women who varied on a measure of body dissatisfaction (Experiment 1 &amp; 2) and awareness and acceptance of societal standards of beauty (Experiment 2) rated a range of computer generated bodies, varying in simulated BMI, for how normal (Experiment 1 &amp; 2) and ideal they looked (Experiment 2). They were then exposed to either thin or fat bodies, and they re-rated the bodies. Increased levels of body dissatisfaction and internalisation of societal standards of beauty were related to a thinner most normal and ideal rated body, before any exposure, as well as a greater discrepancy between the most normal and ideal rated bodies. Both Experiments 1 &amp; 2 revealed that brief exposure to thin or fat bodies altered women's perceptions of body normality and body ideal, where exposure to fat bodies made womens perceptions of a normal and ideal body fatter, and exposure to thin bodies, made perceptions of the most normal and ideal rated body thinner. ... In Chapter 5 I present normative data for the Body Shape Questionnaire-34 (a measure of dissatisfaction with body weight and shape) (Cooper et al, 1987) from an Australian university sample. Many researchers use university samples iv when investigating body dissatisfaction, so it is useful to have normative data for such a sample. One thousand and fifty two women aged between 16 and 30 completed the BSQ-34. A mean score of 94.4 (SD = 34.5) was found, with a range of 34-203. My scores are comparable with those found in an American undergraduate sample, and are significantly higher than those found in community, undergraduate and clinical samples in the UK and Italy. Results indicate that levels of body dissatisfaction may be higher in Australia than in the UK and Italy. Together, these studies provide some important new findings. 1) Body dissatisfaction and internalisation of societal standards of beauty are related to thinner body norms and ideals. 2) Women's perceptions of normal and ideal female body sizes can be readily altered by exposure to thin and fat bodies, and 3) women selectively attend to thin bodies, but the more dissatisfied she is with her own body, the less she attends to thin bodies. Potential implications of these results for the treatment of body dissatisfaction may include the incorporation of treatment programs which target not only unnaturally slim body ideals, but perceptions of what constitutes a normal body, as well as trying to alter selective attention toward thin bodies in the environment. The results may also highlight to the media that consistently showing ultra slim models will very likely affect women's perceptions of normal and ideal female body sizes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Body image in women -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Attention -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Body dissatisfaction</field><field name="subject">Exposure</field><field name="subject">Adaptation</field><field name="subject">Attentional bias</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of hydrotherapy on recovery of muscle-damage and exercise-induced fatigue</field><field name="creator">Vaile, Joanna</field><field name="description">Achieving adequate and appropriate recovery from exercise is essential in ensuring optimal performance during repeated bouts of exercise. The use of various recovery interventions has become popular in an attempt to enhance subsequent performance and accelerate post-exercise recovery. The application of various post-exercise hydrotherapy interventions has become increasingly popular, however, the majority of current recovery practices appear to be based largely on anecdotal evidence as opposed to rigorous scientific research or evidence based findings. Physiologically, various hydrotherapy protocols have been shown to affect the body via fluid shifts (interstitial to intravascular space), changes in blood flow and cardiovascular function, and reductions in oedema. The possible psychological effects of water immersion must also be considered, with athletes commonly reporting reduced sensations of fatigue and soreness following immersion. Current literature suggests both hydrostatic pressure and water temperature to be important factors influencing the success of hydrotherapy. The overall aim of the present thesis was to enhance current knowledge and understanding with regards to the physiological and performance effects of various forms of hydrotherapy, used as a post-exercise recovery intervention. Initially, four cold water immersion interventions were compared to active recovery, performed between two bouts of high intensity cycling in hot environmental conditions. Effectiveness of recovery was determined via performance in a subsequent exercise bout; in addition, core body temperature, lactate, and heart rate were recorded. The remaining studies were designed to investigate the effects of cold water immersion, hot water immersion, contrast water therapy, and passive recovery 4 (control) following exercise-induced fatigue and exercise-induced muscle damage. Rate of recovery was assessed through changes in performance, core body temperature, thigh girths, blood markers, and perceived exertion/soreness. The results of the combined studies indicate cold water immersion to be more effective than active recovery when performed immediately post-exercise between two bouts of high intensity cycling in hot environmental conditions. Additionally, both cold water immersion and contrast water therapy were effective in aiding recovery from exercise-induced fatigue and exercise-induced muscle damage. Performance variables indicated an improved maintenance or return of performance following these recovery protocols. The present studies have provided additional information to the limited knowledge base regarding the effect of post-exercise hydrotherapy interventions, specifically, the effect of such interventions on subsequent athletic performance. In conclusion, cold water immersion and contrast water therapy appear to be superior to hot water immersion, active recovery, and passive recovery following fatiguing and muscle damaging exercise. Functional and physiological recovery was enhanced following the use of these two recovery protocols.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exercise -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Fatigue -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Hydrotherapy -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Muscles -- Wounds and injuries</field><field name="subject">Sports physical therapy</field><field name="subject">Recovery</field><field name="subject">Hydrotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns of coastal tourism growth and multiple dwelling : implications for informal camping along the Ningaloo coastline</field><field name="creator">Lawrie, Misty Suanne</field><field name="description">Over the past few decades, the development of coastal areas has become an increasingly contested arena. For many years, tourism in remote coastal areas has been the preserve of a few intrepid campers, surfers and recreational fishers. More recently, however, numbers along parts of the coast have increased rapidly, not only contributing to an expansion of camping activity, but also pressure for more commercially oriented tourism. This has contributed to concerns about the environmental sustainability of tourism in remote coastal areas. Governments have increasingly been faced with the challenge of balancing ecological concerns with the pursuit of economic development. Adding to the complexity are the differing needs and demands of various segments of the tourism market all looking to enjoy particular places. Balancing the demands of campers, backpackers, package tourists and others in a single place is often wrought with conflict. This study explores some of these issues in a remote coastal area in Western Australia. The Ningaloo coast has evolved from a difficult to reach destination used by a small number of campers, to one of Western Australia's most popular tourist destinations in just two decades. The thesis examines the factors underlying the growth and change of tourism in the region, tracing its evolution from a few small rudimentary campsites to proposals for large scale resort developments. Of particular interest to this thesis is how planning and policy processes aim to address developmental pressures and resource use/planning conflicts. Additionally, this study provides an insight into the issues facing the informal, long term camper as the traditional segment of Ningaloo's tourism market. It examines how current planning and policy for the Ningaloo coastline affects this group by reshaping traditional tourism use of the area.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism -- Western Australia -- Carnarvon Region</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Western Australia -- Planning</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Government policy -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Tourism and city planning</field><field name="subject">Camping</field><field name="subject">Ningaloo Reef (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Long term camping</field><field name="subject">Ningaloo</field><field name="subject">Second homes</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Iterative detection for wireless communications</field><field name="creator">Shaheem, Asri</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The transmission of digital information over a wireless communication channel gives rise to a number of issues which can detract from the system performance. Propagation effects such as multipath fading and intersymbol interference (ISI) can result in significant performance degradation. Recent developments in the field of iterative detection have led to a number of powerful strategies that can be effective in mitigating the detrimental effects of wireless channels. In this thesis, iterative detection is considered for use in two distinct areas of wireless communications. The first considers the iterative decoding of concatenated block codes over slow flat fading wireless channels, while the second considers the problem of detection for a coded communications system transmitting over highly-dispersive frequency-selective wireless channels. The iterative decoding of concatenated codes over slow flat fading channels with coherent signalling requires knowledge of the fading amplitudes, known as the channel state information (CSI). The CSI is combined with statistical knowledge of the channel to form channel reliability metrics for use in the iterative decoding algorithm. When the CSI is unknown to the receiver, the existing literature suggests the use of simple approximations to the channel reliability metric. However, these works generally consider low rate concatenated codes with strong error correcting capabilities. In some situations, the error correcting capability of the channel code must be traded for other requirements, such as higher spectral efficiency, lower end-to-end latency and lower hardware cost. ... In particular, when the error correcting capabilities of the concatenated code is weak, the conventional metrics are observed to fail, whereas the proposed metrics are shown to perform well regardless of the error correcting capabilities of the code. The effects of ISI caused by a frequency-selective wireless channel environment can also be mitigated using iterative detection. When the channel can be viewed as a finite impulse response (FIR) filter, the state-of-the-art iterative receiver is the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) based turbo equaliser. However, the complexity of this receiver's MAP equaliser increases exponentially with the length of the FIR channel. Consequently, this scheme is restricted for use in systems where the channel length is relatively short. In this thesis, the use of a channel shortening prefilter in conjunction with the MAP-based turbo equaliser is considered in order to allow its use with arbitrarily long channels. The prefilter shortens the effective channel, thereby reducing the number of equaliser states. A consequence of channel shortening is that residual ISI appears at the input to the turbo equaliser and the noise becomes coloured. In order to account for the ensuing performance loss, two simple enhancements to the scheme are proposed. The first is a feedback path which is used to cancel residual ISI, based on decisions from past iterations. The second is the use of a carefully selected value for the variance of the noise assumed by the MAP-based turbo equaliser. Simulations are performed over a number of highly dispersive channels and it is shown that the proposed enhancements result in considerable performance improvements. Moreover, these performance benefits are achieved with very little additional complexity with respect to the unmodified channel shortened turbo equaliser.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coding theory</field><field name="subject">Iterative methods (Mathematics)</field><field name="subject">Random noise theory</field><field name="subject">Signal detection</field><field name="subject">Signal processing</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Iterative detection</field><field name="subject">Block turbo codes</field><field name="subject">Channel state information</field><field name="subject">Joint equalisation and decoding</field><field name="subject">Channel reliability metrics</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of the concept of Third Stream music and its applicability to selected works by Gunther Schuller and Mark-Anthony Turnage</field><field name="creator">Styles, Matthew John</field><field name="description">In a public lecture given by Gunther Schuller in 1957, the term 'third stream music' was suggested as a way of describing the combination of 'first stream music' (Western classical) and 'second stream music' (American jazz) within a musical work.

It has major economic and social implications with considerable burden of illness. Approximately 140,000 Australians have been diagnosed with T1DM with an annual increase in incidence rate of 3% per year, comparable to the overall global increase. The management of T1DM requires insulin therapy which places considerable burden on the patient and their carers. Coping with daily insulin injections, dietary changes, modification of physical activity and vigilant monitoring of blood glucose levels, will impact on patient?s quality of life. The optimum goal for the treatment of type 1 diabetes is to safely achieve near-normal glycaemia and failure to maintain this goal accelerates the progression of the devastating long term complications of diabetes. Unfortunately attempts to achieve near normal glycaemia are limited by the risk of excessive lowering of blood glucose levels and hypoglycaemia remains a major barrier to strict glucose control of diabetes. In general this thesis focuses on two fundamental issues related to the epidemiology of severe hypoglycaemia. Namely, methodological consideration when analysing prospective observational data and application of the most robust methodology. A prospective open cohort study of the Princess Margaret Hospital diabetes clinic established in 1992, with 99% case ascertainment was used. This hospital is the only paediatric referral centre for type 1 diabetes and every child diagnosed in the state of Western Australia is treated at this centre. ... The results of this study showed that severe hypoglycaemia remains a major problem and recent approaches to therapy may be allowing a degree of improved control without the expected increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia. The study in chapter 7 investigates genetic risk factors related to severe hypoglycaemia. A significant relationship where the presence of the iv deletion (D) allele of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) increases risk of severe hypoglycaemia has been reported. This study concludes that the presence of D allele of the ACE gene does not predict a significantly higher risk of severe hypoglycaemia. In an attempt to optimize glycemic control, patients may suffer multiple episodes of severe hypoglycaemia which can adversely affect quality of life as well as educational and intellectual disadvantage. The study in chapter 8 investigates the factors related to recurrent severe hypoglycaemia. A rigorous and informative time-to-event approach is used to account for within child correlation, staggered enrolment and timevarying covariates. This allows important risk factors to change over time. Preschool children have an increased risk of experiencing recurrent severe hypoglycaemia. The findings of this thesis highlights the importance of selecting appropriate analytical methodology to identify risk factors associated with severe hypoglycaemia and also to dismiss factors that had previously been thought to be important. This will help in formulating management plans in order to limit the impact of severe hypoglycaemia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diabetes -- Complications</field><field name="subject">Diabetes in adolescence</field><field name="subject">Diabetes in children</field><field name="subject">Glycemic index</field><field name="subject">Hypoglycemia -- Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silver, mercury and ruthenium complexes of N-heterocyclic carbene linked cyclophanes</field><field name="creator">Haque, Rosenani S. M. Anwarul</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the synthesis and isolation of silver, mercury, ruthenium and palladium complexes of bidentate N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), derived from imidazolium-linked cyclophanes and related bis-imidazolium salts. The cyclophane structures contain two imidazolyl links between ortho- and meta- substituted aromatic rings and the related structures are ortho-, meta- and para-xylyl linked bis-imidazolium salts. The complexes have been characterised by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The synthesis of five new silver complexes has been achieved via a simple complexation reaction of the cyclophane and bis-imidazolium salts with the basic metal source Ag2O. The new silver carbene systems are thermally stable. Three of the complexes are dinuclear, cationic complexes, while two are mononuclear complexes, one cationic and one neutral. A number of mono- and di-nuclear mercury(II)-NHC complexes have been synthesised from the ortho- and meta-linked cyclophanes and the related meta-linked bis-imidazolium salts. The mercury complexes were prepared by direct mercuration method using mercury(II) acetate. The syntheses were perfomed in air and the complexes are stable to air and moisture. Mercury complexes I and II represent the first example of mononuclear metal complexes derived from meta-substituted imidazolium-linked cyclophanes. NHC-ligand transfer reactions from NHC-silver complexes and NHC-mercury complexes are described. An ortho-cyclophane ligand was successfully transfered from a silver complex to its palladium counterpart. Furthermore, palladium complex III, bearing a para-xylyl linked bis-NHC ligand, was made by transmetallation from both a silver and mercury complex. This is the first reported NHC-palladium complex of a para-xylyl linked bis-NHC ligand. A new redox transmetallation method for NHC ligand transfer, using a mercury complex, is presented. A palladium complex was made via redox transmetallation using a mercury complex of an ortho-NHC-cyclophane. A ruthenium(II)-NHC complex, IV containing an ortho-cyclophane ligand has been prepared via silver transmetallation and in situ complexation methods. In the transmetallation route, a silver complex of an ortho-cyclophane was treated with RuCl2(PPh3)3 to form IV. This complex represents the first example of a ruthenium complex bearing an NHC-cyclophane ligand, v and is also the first example of a metal complex derived from an imidazolium-linked cyclophane where the arene unit of the cyclophane is also involved in bonding to the metal centre.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Carbenes (Methylene compounds)</field><field name="subject">Cyclophanes</field><field name="subject">Heterocyclic compounds</field><field name="subject">Organometallic compounds -- Synthesis</field><field name="subject">Palladium</field><field name="subject">Ruthenium</field><field name="subject">Silver</field><field name="subject">N-Heterocyclic carbenes complexes</field><field name="subject">Nithenium</field><field name="subject">Silver</field><field name="subject">Mercury</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An ecophysiological comparison of rare ironstone endemics and their common congeners</field><field name="creator">Williams, Aleida Helen</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] In south-western Australia a rare plant community occurs on shallow soils overlaying massive ironstone rock. These 'ironstone communities' are open shrublands, which are subject to extremes in drought and solar radiation and support many rare and endemic species. The restricted distribution of many of these species may be related to their high degree of specialisation to this harsh habitat and their inability to respond plastically to different environmental conditions. Indeed, earlier work has shown that ironstone Hakea species (Proteaceae) have a specialist root-system morphology investing mainly in deep roots, thereby increasing their chance of accessing cracks in the rock surface and obtaining water before the onset of summer drought. In this thesis I further examine aspects of specialisation and its possible consequences for species rarity using two ironstone Hakea species and comparing them with two of their widely distributed congeners. In the first experiment (Chapter 2) I explore inherent drought tolerance, independent of root-system morphology, as a further specialisation to the ironstone environment. All species were grown in sand in pots in a glasshouse for 7 months and then droughted for 5 weeks. There was no evidence that the ironstone species had a greater inherent drought tolerance than their common congeners. During drought all species maintained leaf water content of mature leaves by reducing stomatal conductance and osmotically adjusting, though ironstone species tended to OA (osmotic adjustment) more than common species. ... This suboptimal investment of resources may result in a lower competitive ability in shadier environments, and thus could partially explain their restricted distribution. In Chapter 4, I investigated the plasticity of root traits in response to levels of phosphorus supply. South-western Australian soils are phosphorus impoverished and phosphorus is well known to elicit plastic responses in root allocation and architecture. Ironstone species showed less plasticity in total root length, producing similar root length across P treatments, while common species showed an increase in root length with increasing [P]. Other root characteristics were similarly plastic in response to P treatment between species. However, when supplied with increasing [P], ironstone species invested an increasing proportion of roots in the bottom of pots while common species invested more in the top. This differential response in root allocation in response to P may reflect a fundamental trade-off between nutrient and water acquisition, with the ironstone species mainly foraging for water and investing in deeper roots, while the common species invest more in superficial roots to obtain nutrients. In conclusion, the rarity and restricted distribution of the ironstone Hakea species may be related to their specialist root-system morphology as well as a lowered phenotypic plasticity of functional traits. A reduction in plasticity may reduce their competitive ability outside their ironstone habitats, and thus contribute to the restricted distribution of these species. This may also be the case for other rock-outcrop endemics and more generally, for other rare plant species restricted to particular habitats where a lowered phenotypic plasticity in traits relevant to their particular habitat may contribute to their restricted distribution.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hakea -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Phenotypic plasticity</field><field name="subject">Proteaceae -- Western Australia -- Southwestern</field><field name="subject">Rare plants -- Western Australia -- Southwestern</field><field name="subject">Rarity</field><field name="subject">Ecophysiology</field><field name="subject">Phenotypic plasticity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The immunogenetics of natural killer cell alloreactivity</field><field name="creator">Foley, Bree Amanda</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Natural killer (NK) cell alloreactivity can be exploited in haploidentical haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to improve graft survival, reduce graft versus host disease and decrease leukaemic relapse. NK cells lyse cells that have reduced expression of class I HLA molecules. In an allogeneic setting, donor NK cells may be activated by the absence of donor (self) class I HLA molecules on recipient cells; the absence of self-epitopes being detected by inhibitory KIR receptors on donor NK cells. The way in which genetic polymorphism of the receptors and ligands affects NK allorecognition of missing self, has not been fully elucidated. HLA-C molecules are divided into two groups, C1 and C2, with KIR2DL1 recognising cells expressing C2 and KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 recognising cells expressing C1. Donor NK cells expressing KIR2DL2 or KIR2DL3 can be alloreactive towards a recipient if they lack the C1 epitope and donor NK cells expressing KIR2DL1 can be alloreactive towards a recipient if they lack the C2 epitope. KIR3DL1 recognises the Bw4 epitope present on one-third of HLA-B alleles and certain HLA-A alleles. NK cells from donors expressing KIR3DL1 can be alloreactive towards recipients whose cells lack Bw4. Mismatches of KIR related HLA epitopes does not always results in NK alloreactivity. Therefore it is not possible to reliably predict NK alloreactivity based solely on the donor's HLA type and KIR repertoire and the recipient's HLA type. ... All Bw4-positive HLA-B alleles, with the exception of HLA-B*1301 and B*1302, protected targets from lysis. HLA-A*2402 and HLA-A*3201 unequivocally protected target cells from lysis whereas HLA-A*2501 and HLA-A*2301 provided only weak protection from lysis. KIR3DL1-dependent alloreactive NK clones were identified in donors whose only Bw4 positive allele was HLA-A*2402 but not in donors whose only Bw4 positive HLA allele was HLA-B*1301 or B*1302. Finally this thesis demonstrated that an activating KIR can control NK cell alloreactivity. Donors who are C2 negative and KIR2DS1 positive had NK cells that expressed the activating receptor KIR2DS1 and were capable of lysing cells expressing the C2 epitope. More so, KIR2DS1 dependent NK clones were shown to override inhibitory signals generated by NKG2A interacting with its ligand, HLA-E. The identification of these NK clones has important implications for haploidentical HSCT in that recipient expressing all three NK epitopes, C1, C2 and Bw4 were previously thought to be resistant to alloreactive NK cells controlled by inhibitory receptors. Such patients may be amenable to haploidentical HSCT from C2 negative, KIR2DS1 positive donors. These results will improve the ability to predict NK cell alloreactivity based on a donor's HLA type and KIR repertoire and the recipient?s HLA type.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bone marrow -- Transplantation</field><field name="subject">HLA histocompatibility antigens</field><field name="subject">Killer cells</field><field name="subject">Killer immunoglobulin like receptors (KIR)</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface and interface anisotropies measured using inductive magnetometry</field><field name="creator">Kennewell, Kimberly</field><field name="description">In this thesis, an inductive ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) technique is developed to measure the magnetisation dynamics in thin films across a wide range of frequencies and fields. In particular, this project concentrates on measuring higher order exchange dominated modes to observe surface and interface effects in bilayer films. The experimental technique was first developed as a time domain technique, utilising a fast rise time (~50 ps) step pulse to disturb the equilibrium position of the magnetisation. The subsequent precessional damped decay was measured at different applied fields to observe the resonant modes. The data is Fourier transformed to extract a frequency dependent susceptiblity, and results are presented for the frequency and linewidth dependence of excitations of a permalloy film as a function of applied field. This technique is limited to a frequency range dictated by the rise time of the pulse. The technique was then extended so as to use a continuous wave perturbation, utilising a network analyser as both the excitation source and the measurement device. The scattered wave parameters of both the transmission and reflection from the sample were measured, and a magnetic susceptibility is extracted. This method has a frequency range which is dictated by the bandwidth of the network analyser and the microwave circuit. In this project, results are presented for frequencies up to 15 GHz. The signal to noise ratio was also found to be lower than the pulsed technique. Fundamental resonant mode studies are presented for a Fe/MnPd exchange bias bilayer film. Crystalline and exchange anisotropies are extracted from angular measurements, and the behaviour of the magnetisation is investigated during its reorientation to a hard axis direction. Information about the distribution of the local exchange field strength and direction is predicted. Fundamental mode studies are also presented for a Py/Co exchange spring bilayer film. Two modes are observed, approximating an optical and acoustical excitation. Film systems were also designed with suitable thicknesses to observe in the experimentally available frequency range non-uniform exchange dominated excitations through the thickness of the film. The broadband nature of the experiment allowed the frequency of the modes to be measured as a function of field. Results from a single permalloy layer showed two observable modes, the fundamental and the first exchange mode. Measurements were also taken of bilayer films where permalloy is coupled to cobalt. In this system the effect of the cobalt is seen to shift the single layer Py mode frequencies, as well as introduce new modes. The relative intensities of the modes also change with the addition of cobalt. Results are shown for a Pt/Co multilayer coupled to a permalloy layer through a Cu spacer of varying thickness. The observation of excitations through the thickness of the film motivated the development of a suitable theory. A system of integro-differential equations were derived which account for dipole and exchange coupling in the film as well as the field screening by the metal of the coplanar line. The conductivity of the sample and the finite wavevector excitation of the stripline are also included. Numerical solution of the equations results in a spectrum of acoustical, optical and higher-order modes. Fitting of the model to the experimental results allowed extraction of the film parameters including; the exchange constants in the film; the surface pinning from any surface layer anisotropy; as well as the interlayer exchange coupling across the interface.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anisotropy</field><field name="subject">Ferromagnetic resonance</field><field name="subject">Ferromagnetism</field><field name="subject">Thin films</field><field name="subject">Ferromagnetic resonance</field><field name="subject">Interface effects</field><field name="subject">Thin films</field><field name="subject">Inductive magnetometry</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prosodic features for a maximum entropy language model</field><field name="creator">Chan, Oscar</field><field name="description">A statistical language model attempts to characterise the patterns present in a natural language as a probability distribution defined over word sequences. Typically, they are trained using word co-occurrence statistics from a large sample of text. In some language modelling applications, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), the availability of acoustic data provides an additional source of knowledge. This contains, amongst other things, the melodic and rhythmic aspects of speech referred to as prosody. Although prosody has been found to be an important factor in human speech recognition, its use in ASR has been limited. The goal of this research is to investigate how prosodic information can be employed to improve the language modelling component of a continuous speech recognition system. Because prosodic features are largely suprasegmental, operating over units larger than the phonetic segment, the language model is an appropriate place to incorporate such information. The prosodic features and standard language model features are combined under the maximum entropy framework, which provides an elegant solution to modelling information obtained from multiple, differing knowledge sources. We derive features for the model based on perceptually transcribed Tones and Break Indices (ToBI) labels, and analyse their contribution to the word recognition task. While ToBI has a solid foundation in linguistic theory, the need for human transcribers conflicts with the statistical model's requirement for a large quantity of training data. We therefore also examine the applicability of features which can be automatically extracted from the speech signal. We develop representations of an utterance's prosodic context using fundamental frequency, energy and duration features, which can be directly incorporated into the model without the need for manual labelling. Dimensionality reduction techniques are also explored with the aim of reducing the computational costs associated with training a maximum entropy model. Experiments on a prosodically transcribed corpus show that small but statistically significant reductions to perplexity and word error rates can be obtained by using both manually transcribed and automatically extracted features.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automatic speech recognition -- Statistical methods</field><field name="subject">Mathematical linguistics</field><field name="subject">Language modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alternative life-history strategies in the trematode Coitocaecum parvum (Opecoelidae) : effects of environmental factors and within-host competition</field><field name="creator">Lagrue, Clement</field><field name="description">From simple beginnings, when only one host was required, numerous parasitic organisms have evolved complex life-cycles involving two or more host species. For example, trematode parasites reproduce in vertebrates, their definitive host, but their current life cycle also typically involves two intermediate hosts that were added during the course of evolution. Vertebrates are often considered to be the ancestral hosts of trematodes although other scenarios exist. While multi-host life cycles are observed in distantly related groups of parasites, their evolution remains largely unexplored. 
 In trematodes, while recent phylogenetic studies have shed light on the sequence along which the different hosts were incorporated in the cycle, conditions that favoured the evolution of such complex life cycles can only be hypothesized. However, one opportunity to understand the force shaping the evolution of complex life cycles is provided by the few trematode species in which the classical three-host cycle facultatively reverts to a shorter cycle (i.e. life cycle abbreviation). In this study, the effects of different environmental factors on the life history strategy of the trematode Coitocaecum parvum were investigated using laboratory and field studies. C. parvum is able to abbreviate its life cycle from three to two hosts by maturing early (i.e. progenesis) and producing eggs inside the second intermediate host; both life history strategies occur simultaneously in C. parvum populations. 
 Environmental factors such as predator densities should strongly influence parasite life history strategies. In fact, this study shows that laboratory reared Coitocaecum parvum adopt preferentially the normal three-host cycle when chemical cues from the definitive host are added to their environment, while the shorter cycle is favoured when these cues are absent. However, in nature, multiple environmental factors are likely to be perceived by parasites. Consequently, C. parvum&#65533;s ability to adapt its developmental strategy to definitive host densities may be confounded by the complex combination of various environmental parameters. 
 Within-host competition between parasites sharing a common host is also likely to influence individual life history strategies. Parasites could then use alternative life strategies to adaptively respond to intraspecific and interspecific competition. Indeed, this study found that C. parvum preferentially adopts the abbreviated cycle in the presence of competitors. However, in interspecific competition, C. parvum&#65533;s strategy also depends upon the competitor species, possibly influenced by the other species&#65533; transmission route. Furthermore, intensity of intraspecific competition proved to constrain C. parvum&#65533;s ability to use the abbreviated life cycle. Finally, genetic relatedness between co-infecting C. parvum individuals seems to affect parasite life strategy through kin selection: closely related individuals are more likely to adopt the same developmental strategy, when they share a host, than unrelated ones. 
 C. parvum individuals adopting the abbreviated cycle are enclosed within a cyst in their intermediate host and must produce eggs by self-fertilization, the most severe case of inbreeding. It was hypothesized that their offspring would have reduced fitness due to inbreeding depression, therefore selecting against the shorter cycle. However, this study found no difference in the survival and infection success of offspring produced through the abbreviated and normal cycles. Furthermore, no evidence for a genetic basis of life cycle abbreviation was detected: the same proportion of offspring from both reproductive strategies adopted the shorter life cycle. 
 The work in this thesis provides evidence that although life cycle abbreviation provides Coitocaecum parvum with a viable alternative life strategy, numerous factors promote or restrict the adoption of this strategy. While this life history strategy has no detectable effect on parasite fitness, both environmental parameters and within-host competition affect C. parvum life-history strategies, alternatively selecting for either the shorter or normal life cycle. Overall, the complexity of the parasite environment could maintain both developmental strategies in C. parvum populations and, on a broader scale, could have influenced the evolution of complex life cycles in parasites.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trematoda</field><field name="subject">life cycles</field><field name="subject">parasites</field><field name="subject">host-parasite relationships</field><field name="subject">Coitocaecum parvum</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080905.111744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The functional biology of Porphyra sp. in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Schweikert, Katja</field><field name="description">The intertidal red algal genus Porphyra is found on rocky shores worldwide. In the Northern Hemisphere the genus is well studied but there is a paucity of data on southern hemisphere Porphyra and even less on New Zealand Porphyra. The species&#65533; taxonomy has been undergoing revision since the late 1990&#65533;s, when it was discovered that the main species P. columbina and P. lilliputana reported for New Zealand were a combination of several endemic species. These species are found from the low to the high intertidal watermark; hence they are exposed to fluctuating stresses such as desiccation, temperature, high light and UV radiation. Algae have evolved a number of mechanisms to adapt to naturally changing increasing abiotic conditions, such as accumulation of screening pigments and changes in antioxidant metabolism during light stress. For terrestrial plants, polyamines (small aliphatic amines) have been shown to be involved in protecting cells from damage under conditions of stress including UV-B radiation; such mechanisms have yet to be identified in algae. 
 The overall aim of this study was to determine the importance of cellular processes in shaping the community structure of Porphyra on a wave-exposed shore on the east coast of the South Island, New Zealand. Porphyra distribution and community structure was assessed by regular monthly monitoring of presence and absence of Porphyra along four transect lines at the site. Enviromnental information was recorded to determine the effects of temperature, light, UV radiation, humidity and wind on Porphyra&#65533;s spatial and temporal distribution. Regular tissue samples were taken for species identification by the application of primers, which were specifically designed during this study. P. cinnamomea and Porphyra spec. "ROS 54" were identified as dominant species present almost throughout the year with a pronounced maximum in presence during late winter and spring, and some weeks of absence during April or May. The two dominant species were recorded from the low to the high intertidal shore, but the mid intertidal was identified as the preferred habitat. Other species that were found were rare and only present for a few months in a very restricted area. It was hypothesised that free radical generation and antioxidant metabolism are associated with desiccation tolerance in Porphyra. An attempt was made to investigate the impact of desiccation stress on Porphyra. The extraction process of antioxidants was problematic and no reproducible results could be obtained. It was attempted to investigate the spatial distribution of spores and conchocelis of different Porphyra species in the field, and determine if those found at Brighton Beach are species-specific in their morphology. This indicated that the two main Porphyra species at Brighton Beach not only prefer to occupy the same habitat but that they also have a morphologically similar conchocelis phase. 
 Mechanisms on a cellular level such as polyamine metabolism affected by environmental (abiotic) stresses are related to the alga&#65533;s ability to adapt to stress and therefore can have an effect on Porphyra&#65533;s distribution along the shore and its presence throughout the year. The depletion of the ozone layer has become an important issue as the effects of increased UV radiation on the environment, especially the intertidal habitat, are revealed. Marine macrophytes possess the main three. polyamines: putrescine, spermidine and spermine of varying levels. For the few species studied, Rhodophyta generally contain higher levels of polyamines than Chlorophyta, while polyamine levels for the one heterokontophyte analysed were between Chlorophyta and Rhodophyta. Levels of the three most common polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, spermine) were determined in P. cinnamomea under controlled UV exposure. Tissue discs were exposed to visible light (PAR), PAR and UV-A or PAR, UV-A and UV-B radiation. Discs exposed to PAR and PAR and UV-A showed little change in polyamine levels over a six day trial period, while discs exposed to PAR, UV-A and UV-B showed a significant increase in free, bound soluble and bound insoluble polyamines over the same period of time. Correspondingly levels of ADC and ODC, two enzymes involved in polyamine synthesis, were measured. ODC levels changed little while ADC levels increased significantly during UV-B treatment, indicating that under UV-B stress polyamines are mainly synthesized via the ADC pathway. The experimental set-up and process of this study has not been applied in macroalgal polyamine research and results obtained are the first indication that increased levels of polyamines are involved in protection and/or protection mechanisms in macrophytic algae to prevent UV-B damage.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Porphyra</field><field name="subject">red algae</field><field name="subject">effect of stress</field><field name="subject">cell metabolism</field><field name="subject">intertidal ecology</field><field name="subject">seashore biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Dunedin</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080910.114121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding genetic recoding in HIV-1 : the mechanism of -1 frameshifting</field><field name="creator">Mathew, Suneeth Fiona</field><field name="description">The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) uses a mechanism of genetic recoding known as programmed ribosomal frameshifting to translate the proteins encoded by the pol gene. The pol gene overlaps the preceding gag gene in the -1 reading frame relative to gag. It contains neither a start codon nor an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to initiate translation of its proteins. Rather the host ribosomes are forced to pause due to tension placed on the mRNA when they encounter a specific secondary structural element in the mRNA. This tension is relieved by disruption of the contacts between the mRNA codons and tRNA anticodons at a &#65533;slippery&#65533; sequence within the ribosomal decoding centre. Re-pairing of the tRNAs occurs in the new -1 frame after movement of the mRNA backwards by one nucleotide, allowing the ribosome to translate the pol gene as a Gag-Pol polyprotein. A change in ratio of Gag to Gag-Pol proteins affects viral assembly, and most significantly dramatically reduces viral infectivity. 
 The prevailing model for the mechanism of -1 frameshifting has focussed on a pre-translocational event, where slippage occurs when the slippery sequence is within the ribosomal A and P sites. This model precludes a contribution from the codon immediately downstream of the slippery sequence leading into the secondary structural element. I have termed this the &#65533;intercodon&#65533;. Often at frameshifting sites it is a termination codon, whereas in HIV-1 it is a glycine codon, GGG. When the intercodon within the frameshift element was changed from the wild-type GGG to a termination codon UGA, the efficiency of frameshifting decreased 3-4-fold in an in vivo assay in cultured human cells. This result mimicked previous data in the group within bacterial cells and cultured monkey COS-7 cells. Changing the first nucleotide of the intercodon to each of the three other bases altered frameshifting to varying degrees, but not following expected patterns for base stacking effects. Such a result would support a post-translocational model for -1 frameshifting. It suggested that the intercodon might be within the ribosomal A site before frameshifting, and that the slippery sequence was therefore within the P and E sites. 
 This was investigated by modulating the expression of decoding factors for the intercodon - the release factor eRF1 and cognate suppressor tRNAs when it was either of the UGA or UAG termination codons, and tRNA[Gly] for the native GGG glycine codon. These were predicted to affect frameshifting only if slippage were occurring when the ribosomal elongation cycle was in the post-translocational state. Overexpression of tRNA[Gly] gave inconsistent effects on frameshifting in vivo, implying that its concentration may not be limiting within the cell. When eRF1 was overexpressed or depleted by RNAi, significant functional effects of decreased or increased stop codon readthrough respectively were documented. Expression of suppressor tRNAs increased readthrough markedly in a stop codon-specific manner. These altered levels of eRF1 expression were able to modulate the +1 frameshifting efficiency of the human antizyme gene. Overexpression of eRF1 caused significant reduction of frameshifting of the HIV-1 element with the UAG or UGA intercodon. Depletion of the protein by contrast had unexplained global effects on HIV-1 frameshifting. Suppressor tRNAs increased frameshifting efficiency at the UAG or UGA specifically in a cognate manner. These results strongly indicate that a post-translocational mechanism of frameshifting is used to translate the HIV-1 Gag-Pol protein. 
 A new model (&#65533;almost&#65533; post-translocational) has been proposed with -1 frameshifting occurring for 1 in 10 or 20 ribosomal passages during the end stages of translocation, because of opposing forces generated by translocation and by resistance to unwinding of the secondary structural element. With translocation still incomplete the slippery sequence is partially within the E and P sites, and the intercodon partially within the A site. The nature of the intercodon influences frameshifting efficiency because of how effectively the particular decoding factor is able to bind to the partially translocated intercodon and maintain the normal reading frame.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV (viruses)</field><field name="subject">HIV infections</field><field name="subject">genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">genetic code</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081006.115352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping first semester challenges : first-year students making sense of their teaching and learning environments</field><field name="creator">van der Meer, Jacques</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates first-year students&#65533; challenges in making sense of the learning and teaching environment during their first semester at university. The aims for the research are threefold. Firstly, mapping the range of challenges students at one university faced in their learning and teaching environments in the first semester. Secondly, developing a greater understanding of those challenges. Thirdly, identifying what educational initiatives the university could consider that might assist students to meet those challenges. The challenges were examined in the context of changes in higher education. 
 My interest and motivation for this research project concerns improved practices in the first-year teaching and learning environment, rather than improved students. This means that I did not look for deficits within students, but for indications of what helps or does not help students&#65533; introduction to the new environment of academia. By mapping students&#65533; challenges in the first semester, I hope to contribute to the understanding of academic staff of the range of challenges students have to deal with. 
 The interpretation of the results and my line of argument are partly influenced and shaped by the theoretical framework of academic literacies, and the notion of de-familiarisation. 
 For this project, two data sources were used. The first source was data from a survey carried out in May 2004 amongst students enrolled in 100-level courses. The second source was data from interviews conducted with first-year students in the same year. In considering the analysis as a whole, a number of key issues could be discerned. These related to communication, academic skills, access to resources and help, and engagement and connection. The results showed that some of these issues had less to do with educational practices, and more to do with contested understandings of the nature of university education, and the nature of students now entering university. I argue that underlying these issues there are contentious questions of who should adjust or adapt to whom: students to the university, or the university to students? 
 Students&#65533; reported experiences further suggest that some teachers seemed more aware than others that first-year students face particular challenges. Students did not consider their experiences as reflective of the university as a whole. The university was experienced as an institution with divergent ways of organising courses, of valuing aspects of university learning, and of interpreting seemingly similar things. This suggests that where students experienced challenges, these were not necessarily a function of students&#65533; characteristics, or students&#65533; attitudes to studying, but of particular course environments. 
 The overall picture that presents itself, then, is that there are challenges that could be considered unnecessary. Whereas few students would experience all of the challenges identified in the results chapters, I argue that there are some aspects that warrant improvement. Improvement initiatives in first-year education, however, are not necessarily considered important by all academic staff. This is another contested issue in universities. 
 A more explicit introduction of first-year students to academia as a range of heterogeneous communities would respond to first-year students&#65533; needs for familiarisation and clarity, as well as reflect some of the values that universities could be said to espouse. Successful interventions in first-year education, however, will also depend on ongoing dialogue with staff about various contested issues, the changed and changing context of higher education, and related challenges and opportunities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">college student development programs</field><field name="subject">college student orientation</field><field name="subject">college freshmen</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">services for college students</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081029.154312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alcohol in society and education : Durkheimian perspectives</field><field name="creator">Mundy-McPherson, Stuart</field><field name="description">The present study utilises a Durkheimian approach to study alcohol in society and education, centrally drawing on the sociological works of Emile Durkheim and those of the neo-Durkheimian sociologist, Stjepan Mestrovic. Durkheim&#65533;s sociological concepts and commentary, and Mestrovic&#65533;s perspective, refashioned, is applied to the present context, of which alcohol is a part. The arument to be advanced, is that in the Durkheimian sense, societal and educational alcohol issues, as part of wider social change, are in a state of excessive anomie and egoism caused by neoliberal philosophy, policy and practice. Mostly, the theory of James M. Buchanan will be drawn upon as standing for neoliberalism. 
 Mestrovic&#65533;s interpretation of Durkheim in the light of his view of the indirect influence of Arthur Schopenhauer on Durkheim, particularly with regard to Schopenhauer&#65533;s view of will and representation, provides a fresh reading of Durkheim&#65533;s work. Mestrovic&#65533;s adaptations challenge the received view of Durkheim as a functionalist, and Enlightenment positivist interested in social order. This is explained by noting Mestrovic&#65533;s application of those adaptations to some of Durkheim&#65533;s central concepts, and, Mestrovic&#65533;s identification of the contemporary relevance of Durkheim, culminating in what Mestrovic calls postemotionalism. 
 Mestrovic&#65533;s Shopenhauerian Durkheimianism, and Durkheim, can be critiqued from the perspectives of a number of commentators, poststructuralism and, Jennifer Lehmann&#65533;s critical structuralism with regard to issues of particularly gender, but also culture, as well as for exhibiting essentialist and liberal strains. Buchanan is also liberal and essentialist, but differently to Durkheim, holds to an economic, individualistic and clearly positivist view of society and education. By comparison with Durkheimianism, however, Buchanan&#65533;s perspective is a good representative example of true neoliberalism. Durkheim in particular, is rendered as a liberal - by comparison to Buchanan, a very social democratic liberal thinker, but one still in need of further adaptations over and above those made by Mestrovic for a Durkheimianism relevant to contemporary issues of gender and culture with regard to policy and practice in society and education where alcohol is concerned. 
 Mestrovic&#65533;s perspective and Durkheim&#65533;s concepts, when modified by way of discussed and synthesised supplementary, high-modern and poststructural, post-Freudian feminist, and semiological, radical theories of gender and culture, is relevant for studying society and education. 
 The application of Durkheimian perspectives, so rendered, means that various issues related to alcohol such as, alcohol and other addictions and dysfunctions, gendered drinking, gendered family relations, alcohol use and abuse, media advertising, research studies philosophies, culture, local and global markets, as well as legislation, can be seen in an alternative way. 
 Following Durkheimian perspectives means that education can be contextualised accordingly. Educational governance, professionalism, teacher training and curriculum reform policies and programmes related and specific to alcohol education, can be interpreted in alternative ways to those currently accepted. 
 Durkheimian perspectives on society and education: highlight the damage caused and the conservatism entailed by neoliberal philosophy, policy and practice, and; provide alternatives to the current societal situation, as well as the current drug education market in Aotearoa/New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alcohol</field><field name="subject">alcohol use</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Durkheimian school of sociology</field><field name="subject">Emile Durkheim (1858-1917)</field><field name="subject">Stjepan Gabriel Mestrovic</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081029.155006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life-history ecology of two New Zealand echinoderms with planktotrophic larvae</field><field name="creator">Poorbagher, Hadi</field><field name="description">The importance of parental nutritional status on planktotrophic larvae was investigated in both laboratory-conditioned and field (populations) parents of two New Zealand echinoderms: the sea urchin Pseudechinus huttoni and the starfish Sclerasterias mollis. 
 Three questions were addressed: (i) Does parental nutritional status affect the reproductive features (gonad index, gametogenesis, fecundity and biochemical composition) both in the laboratory and under natural conditions? (ii) Does parental nutritional status affect egg characteristics (diameter, number, dry weight, fertilization rate and biochemical composition)? (iii) Are the characteristics of larvae (growth, development, morphology, mortality rate and body composition) influenced by parental or larval nutrition (or both)? 
 To answer the first question, adult P. huttoni and S. mollis were maintained in the laboratory with a low or high diet (in terms of quantity and quality for P. huttoni, and in terms of quantity for S. mollis) for one year. The effect of low and high diets on reproductive features was studied and the same parameters were studied in two parental populations with dissimilar food availability (for P. huttoni: Otago Shelf and Doubtful Sound populations; for S. mollis: Otago inshore and offshore populations). To address the second question, egg characteristics of the laboratory-held and field parents were measured. The third question was answered by rearing larvae of the laboratory and field parents with both low and high concentration planktonic diets. 
 P. huttoni reared in the laboratory with a higher food ration had greater gonad indices and lipid concentration and larger oocyte area. Sea urchins from the Doubtful Sound population had higher food availability, greater gonad lipid concentration and larger oocytes. 
 Parental nutrition had some effect on the characteristics of the egg in P. huttoni. The laboratory-held urchins fed a high diet produced larger eggs: P. huttoni from Doubtful Sound produced larger eggs with a greater carbohydrate concentration. 
 P. huttoni larvae from low-fed laboratory and Otago Shelf parents had faster development The effect of larval nutrition was more important than parental food availability on larval growth and development. Feeding parents in the laboratory had no effect on larval morphology but larvae from Doubtful Sound, which had better food availability, had longer arms relative to body width. A higher cell concentration in the planktonic diet led to shorter larval arm relative to body width. 
 In S. mollis reared in the laboratory, a higher food ration led to larger gonad and pyloric caeca indices. The starfish from an Otago inshore population mainly had a higher gonad index than those from an Otago offshore population. 
 In the laboratory-held parents S. mollis, nutrition had no effect on the egg characteristics. In the field, starfish with higher food availability produced smaller eggs with lower carbohydrate concentration. 
 There was no significant difference between development rates of S. mollis larvae from low and high fed laboratory parents. However, those from the Otago inshore parents, with better food availability, had faster development than the larvae from Otago offshore parents. 
 In S. mollis larvae, the origin of the parents (either from the laboratory or the field) had no effect on larval shape. A higher concentration planktonic diet led to longer larvae relative to body width in larvae from high-fed laboratory parents. 
 In both P. huttoni and S. mollis, parental and larval diet had no effect on rate of instantaneous larval mortality. 
 In both P. huttoni and S. mollis larvae, biochemical composition of the larvae and the egg were different to each other. Egg reserves appear not to be a factor which affects larval characteristics in these species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">echinodermata</field><field name="subject">starfishes</field><field name="subject">sea urchins</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Pseudechinus huttoni</field><field name="subject">Sclerasterias mollis</field><field name="subject">larvae</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081029.160011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuromuscular control of thigh and gluteal muscles following hamstring injuries</field><field name="creator">Sole, Gisela</field><field name="description">Although traditional prevention and management strategies for hamstring injuries have focussed on optimising muscle strength, flexibility and endurance, incidence and/or recurrence rates of these injuries remains high. A theoretical framework was developed considering additional factors that increase the stabilising demand of the hamstrings. These factors included loss of related stability at the knee and lumbopelvic regions and extrinsic factors during functional and sporting activities. The aims of this research were to determine whether electromyographic (EMG) derived hamstrings, quadriceps and gluteal muscle activation patterns as well as isokinetic torque generation patterns could differentiate athletes who had incurred a hamstring injury from uninjured control athletes. It was hypothesised that the EMG activity of the injured participants would be decreased compared to uninjured control participants during maximal activities, but increased during weight bearing activities. 
 The research included the identification of laboratory-based tasks relevant to the function of the hamstring muscles; test-retest reliability of EMG variables recorded during these tasks; and a comparative cross-sectional study of hamstring-injured (hamstring group, HG) and control athletes (control group, CG). Electromyographic activation patterns were determined during assessment of concentric and eccentric isokinetic strength of the thigh muscles, during transition from double- to single-leg stance, and forward lunging. 
 Isokinetic and EMG onset and amplitude variables were compared both within- and between-groups. Despite no significant differences for peak torque, the HG injured limb generated lower average eccentric flexor torque towards the outer range of motion in comparison to the HG uninjured limb (P = 0.034) and the CG bilateral average (P = 0.025). Furthermore, the EMG root mean square (RMS) decrease from the start to the end range of the eccentric flexor contraction was greater for the HG injured limb hamstrings than the CG bilateral average. 
 During the transition from double- to single-leg stance, the EMG onsets of the HG injured limb (biceps femoris [BF] P &lt; 0.001, medial hamstrings [MH] P = 0.001), and the HG uninjured limb (BF P = 0.023, MH P = 0.011) were earlier in comparison to the CG bilateral average. The transition normalised EMG RMS was significantly higher for the HG injured side BF (P = 0.032), MH (P = 0.039) and vastus lateralis (VL, P = 0.037) in comparison to the CG bilateral average. During the forward lunge, no significant differences were observed within- and between-groups for the normalised EMG amplitude prior to and following initial foot contact. 
 These results suggest that during maximal isokinetic eccentric flexor contractions, the average torque and EMG activity is decreased towards the lengthened position of the hamstring-injured limb. This may be due to structural changes or neurophysiological inhibitory mechanisms. During the static weight bearing task an earlier onset of the HG hamstring muscles was evident in comparison to controls. The hamstrings and the VL of the injured limbs were activated at greater normalised amplitude. The increased muscle activation in the hamstring-injured limbs during the support phase may indicate a greater demand towards stability of the kinetic chain or changes in proprioceptive function. Future research should consider the mechanisms and clinical implications underlying a loss of eccentric flexor torque towards the outer range of contraction, and investigate why increased activation of thigh muscles occurs during the static weight bearing task in hamstring-injured athletes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neuromuscular transmission</field><field name="subject">thigh muscles</field><field name="subject">buttocks muscles</field><field name="subject">hamstring muscle</field><field name="subject">wounds and injuries</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081103.100628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Raman spectroscopy of complex mixtures</field><field name="creator">McGoverin, Cushla Maree</field><field name="description">This thesis presents several Raman spectroscopic studies of bovine milk-derived products (skim and whole milk powder, anhydrous milk fat, processed cheese and soy cheese made from milk protein). Raman spectroscopy, unlike infrared spectroscopy (both mid- and near-infrared), has not been widely used as an analytical tool within the dairy industry. The purpose of this project was to assess the utility of Raman spectroscopy in several dairy industry relevant problems. FT-Raman spectroscopy coupled with partial least squares (PLS) reliably predicted the concentration of fat and protein within whole milk and protein within skim milk powders as evidenced by ratios of prediction to deviation in excess of three. It was shown that sample geometry did not significantly affect the calculated predictive models, thereby allowing the simplest, quickest method of sample presentation to be utilised without harming quantification model efficacy. 
 The fat fraction of milk was further investigated, and it was shown that Raman spectra collected from anhydrous milk fat samples were a good basis for solid fat content (SFC) determination. Such spectra were collected when the samples were held at 40 &#65533;C, pretreated by baselining and area normalisation, and analysed using PLS with modified jack-knifing (PLS1-JK). Triacylglycerol class concentrations were also well predicted by PLS1-JK models developed from Raman spectroscopic data. Resonance enhancement of &#946;-carotene within fat was shown to have little effect on the reliability of the optimal prediction model when compared to SFC Raman quantification. 
 Raman microscopic mapping for heterogeneity description of processed cheese and soy cheese mimics was examined. The FT-Raman milk powder constituents study had shown fat and protein Raman spectra within complex dairy mixtures could be distinguished, hence this utility was applied to mapping of cheese systems. Univariate, principal components analysis and multivariate curve resolution methods of analyses were compared; as expected the more complex samples required multivariate methods of analyses. Raman microscopic mapping was not a time efficient method in comparison to the standard method of confocal laser scanning microscopy. However, Raman spectroscopic mapping is a more universal technique which allowed the presence of an unexpected localised constituent within the soy cheese mimics to be observed. It was proposed that this constituent was a crystalline form of a short saturated fatty acid.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Raman spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">dairy products</field><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081103.112612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proton and iron capture mechanisms of Bacillus sp. strain TA2.A1 at alkaline pH values</field><field name="creator">McMillan, Duncan George Glenn</field><field name="description">The thermoalkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain TA2.A1 was able to grow in pH-controlled batch culture containing a fermentable growth substrate (i.e. sucrose) from pH 7.5 to 10.0 with no significant change in specific growth rate, suggesting that this bacterium is a facultative alkaliphile. However, when strain TA2.A1 was grown on non-fermentable carbon sources like succinate, no growth was observed until the external pH was &gt; 9.0, suggesting this bacterium is an obligate alkaliphile. Growth on succinate at pH 9.5 was sensitive to both carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and monensin revealing that both the proton and sodium motive force ([Delta][mu][H&#8314;] and [Delta][mu][Na&#8314;], respectively) were obligate requirements for growth at alkaline pH values. Transport of succinate was driven by a chemical gradient of Na&#8314; ([Delta]pNa&#8314;) that was strictly coupled to [Delta][Psi]. A single transport system was detected for the uptake of succinate, with an apparent K[m] of 19 [mu]M and V[max] of 0.45 nmol succinate/min/mg protein. Succinate transport was pH-dependent, and showed optimal activity at pH values greater than 8.5. Other C&#8324;-dicarboxylates (e.g. malate, fumarate) inhibited the uptake of succinate suggesting that the permease was general for other C&#8324;-dicarboxylates. 
 Cytochrome content, succinate dehydrogenase oxidoreductase, and F&#8321;F&#8320;-ATPase activities were lower in membranes from strain TA2.A1 cells grown at pH 7.5 compared to those cultured at 9.5. These data suggest that oxidative phosphorylation-linked processes are down-regulated at neutral pH values, an observation that mirrored oxygen consumption profiles of strain TA2.A1 in whole cells. To study this phenomenon at a molecular level, we measured ATP synthesis by the F&#8321;F&#8320;-ATP synthase from strain TA2.A1 as a function of pH. The strain TA2.A1 F&#8321;F&#8320;-ATP synthase had a pH optimum for ATP synthesis of 9.0-9.5, and significantly lower rates of ATP synthesis observed below pH 9.0. Analysis of the atp operon from the thermoalkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain TA2.A1 and comparison with other atp operons from alkaliphilic bacteria reveals the presence of a conserved lysine residue at position 180 (Bacillus sp. strain TA2.A1 numbering) within the a subunit of these F&#8321;F&#8320;-ATP synthases. We hypothesize that the basic nature of this residue is ideally suited to capture protons from the bulk phase at high pH. To test this hypothesis, a heterologous expression system for the ATP synthase from Bacillus sp. TA2.A1 (TA2F&#8321;F&#8320;) was developed in Escherichia coli DK8 ([Delta]atp). Amino acid substitutions were made in the a subunit of TA2F&#8321;F&#8320; at position 180. Lysine (aK180) was substituted for the basic residues histidine (aK180H) or arginine (aK180R), and the uncharged residue glycine (aK180G). ATP synthesis experiments were performed in ADP plus P[i]-loaded right-side out membrane vesicles energized by ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate. When these enzyme complexes were examined for their ability to perform ATP synthesis over the pH range from 7.0 to 10.0, TA2F&#8321;F&#8320; and aK180R showed a similar pH profile having optimum ATP synthesis rates at pH 9.0 to 9.5 with no measurable ATP synthesis at pH 7.5. Conversely, aK180H and aK180G showed maximal ATP synthesis at pH&#65533;s 8.0 and 7.5, respectively. ATP synthesis under these conditions for all enzyme forms was sensitive to DCCD. These data strongly imply that amino acid residue K180 is a specific adaptation within the a subunit of TA2F&#8321;F&#8320; to facilitate proton capture at high pH. At pH values near the pK[a] of K180, the trapped protons readily dissociate to reach the subunit c binding sites but this dissociation is impeded at neutral pH values causing either a blocking of the proposed H&#8314; channel and/or mechanism of proton translocation, and hence ATP synthesis is inhibited. 
 The mechanisms where by alkaliphilic bacteria obtain iron remains unknown. Growth of strain TA2.A1 at pH 9.5 in the presence of the artificial iron chelators ethylenediamine O-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (EDDHA) and 2&#65533;2&#65533; dipyridal revealed that iron is an important requirement for aerobic growth at alkaline pH values. Furthermore, biochemical analysis showed that Bacillus alcalophilus and Bacillus pseudofirmus both synthesized orange catecholate siderophores, whilst Bacillus halodurans synthesized a hydroxamate siderophore. These tests showed that strain TA2.A1 synthesized both orange catecholate and hydroxamate siderophore/s. Attempts to purify the catecholate were unsuccessful. No homologues of previously identified non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) genes in Bacillus subtilis and B.halodurans were detected in the genome of strain TA2.A1 using both PCR and Southern hybridization using known non-ribosomal peptide synthase genes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">protons</field><field name="subject">iron</field><field name="subject">Bacillus (bacteria)</field><field name="subject">hydrogen-ion concentration</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081104.090840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mode of action of dysgalacticin and mechanism of its producer cell immunity</field><field name="creator">Swe, Pearl M</field><field name="description">Dysgalacticin is a large, 21.5 kDa bacteriocin that belongs to subgroup B of the class III bacteriocins. It is ribosomally produced by Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strain W2580 and exerts inhibitory activity mainly against the medically important pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes by a "non-lytic" mechanism. Despite numerous studies of the mechanisms of action of a wide variety of bacteriocins and of the basis of their producer strain self-immunity, relatively little is known about the "non-lytic" class of bacteriocins. The structural gene encoding for dysgalacticin (dysA) was known to be carried on a small, rolling circle plasmid pW2580 (3.04 kb) (Heng et al., 2006). However, the dysgalacticin immunity gene (dysI) had not been identified prior to the present study. The aims of this research were to elucidate the mechanism of action of dysgalacticin against S. pyogenes and to identify the genetic basis and the mechanism of producer strain self-immunity. Recombinantly-produced dysgalacticin was used to determine the mode of action against S. pyogenes. Dysgalacticin was bactericidal for S. pyogenes, increasing the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane and ultimately leading to leakage of intracellular potassium ions. Moreover, dysgalacticin dissipated the membrane potential and inhibited [&#65533;&#8308;C]serine uptake, a membrane potential-dependent process in S. pyogenes. Interestingly, dysgalacticin inhibited glucose fermentation by non-growing cell suspensions and blocked transport of both glucose and the nonmetabolisable analogue 2-deoxyglucose. This finding indicates that dysgalacticin may target the phosphophenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent glucose and mannose phosphotransferase system (PTS) of S. pyogenes. Taken together, these data suggest that dysgalacticin targets the glucose-PTS and/or mannose-PTS as a receptor, leading to inhibition of sugar uptake, and a subsequent dissipation of the membrane potential leading to cell death. 
 Complementation studies demonstrated that dysI is located on pW2580. RNA analysis showed that dysI is co-transcribed with genes encoding for the plasmid copy control protein, copG and replication initiation protein, repB. S. pyogenes transformed with a plasmid containing dysI displayed a markedly higher dysgalacticin MIC (1024 nM) than the corresponding dysgalacticin-sensitive, plasmid-negative strain (8 nM). Further studies of this DysI-expressing S. pyogenes showed that membrane integrity, glucose fermentation and [&#65533;H]2DG uptake were not affected by dysgalacticin treatment. These findings are consistant with a mechanism whereby the immunity peptide binds to the target-binding site of dysgalacticin, effectively blocking access by the bacteriocin. H&#8326;DysI was found to localise to the cytoplasmic membrane, further indicating that DysI may bind to the proposed target of dysgalacticin, i.e., the membrane-bound glucose-PTS and mannose-PTS. Thus both the mode of action and the producer strain self-immunity of dysgalacticin are likely to be cytoplasmic-membrane based. 
 Homology searching revealed that the bacteriocin SA-M7 produced by M-type 57 S. pyogenes has structural similarities to dysgalacticin, as do two hypothetical proteins, EF1097 and YpkK, of Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, respectively (Heng et al., 2004, 2006). These proteins were all predicted to contain relatively unstructured N-termini and helix-loop-helix structured C-termini. In each case the C-termini contain two conserved cysteine residues that are predicted to form a disulphide bridge. Heterologous expression of SA-M57, EF1097 and YpkK in Escherchia coli demonstrated that all three proteins have antimicrobial activity, but of differeing activity spectra. Reductive-alkylation of SA-M57, EF1097 and YpkK confirmed that their predicted disulphide bonds were essential for biological activity. These proteins were later renamed streptococcin A-M57, enterococcin V583 and corynicin JK respectively. The outcome of preliminary domain-swapping experiments supported the existence of functional domain-type segments in streptococcin A-M57, enterococcin V583, corynicin JK and dysgalacticin. The N-terminal domain of each of these proteins and also the C-terminal domain of corynicin JK were successfully expressed in E. coli. The failure to express the C-termini of the remaining proteins was thought possibly due to toxicity of thses pepetides for the E. coli host. Nevertheless, the C-terminus of corynicin JK displayed an inhibitory spectrum apparently identical to that of the full-length corynicin, indicating that the N-terminus may not always be required for target binding of this class of antimicrobials. Preliminary mode of action studies revealed that streptococcin A-M57, enterococcin V583 and corynicin JK all resemble dysgalacticin in that they exert inhibitory activity by non-lytic means. These results, in combination with the protein structural predictions indicate that dysgalacticin, streptococcin A-M57, enterococcin V583 and corynicin JK are all members of the same basic class of "non-lytic" bactericoicns.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dysgalacticin</field><field name="subject">Bacteriocins</field><field name="subject">Streptococcus pyogenes</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081119.111402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology and taxonomy of meiofauna at Papanui Inlet, with particular emphasis on nematodes</field><field name="creator">Leduc, Daniel</field><field name="description">Meiofauna are an ecologically significant component of marine benthic communities worldwide. Nematodes, in particular, are arguably the most abundant metazoans on Earth and often form highly diverse communities in marine sediments. The study of meiofauna, however, often lags behind that of macrofauna, probably due to the small size of meiofaunal organisms and the paucity of suitably-trained taxonomists or para-taxonomists. Our understanding of basic ecological questions, such as the role of meiofauna in the energetics of benthic communities, as well as the nature and extent of possible relationships between meiofauna and macrofauna in detritus-based communities, is still limited. The present study aimed to address these questions in the context of intertidal seagrass (Zostera muelleri) meadows and adjoining unvegetated sediments in Papanui Inlet, Otago Peninsula. The near absence of taxonomical and ecological studies on free-living marine nematode species in New Zealand also prompted the description of several new species and as well as a comparison of species assemblages from the study sites. 
 Meiofaunal abundance (range: 1325-4979 ind. 10cm&#65533;) in the top 5cm of sediments was not significantly different inside and outside the seagrass meadow. Meiofaunal biomass and production estimates were small relative to macrofauna (approx. 1 and 5% of macrofaunal values, respectively), with little variation in both meiofaunal and macrofaunal values between vegetated and unvegetated habitats. Analysis of the isotopic and fatty acid composition of primary producers, sediment organic matter, and consumers at the study sites suggest that a significant proportion of secondary productivity in seagrass meadows is fuelled by macrophyte detritus. These data suggest that secondary productivity in the seagrass meadow was limited by the low palatability of macrophyte detritus compared with microalgal food sources, resulting in lower trophic transfer efficiency in vegetated sediments. These results contrast with previous findings showing a large contribution of meiofauna to the secondary productivity of vegetated sediments, as well as greater secondary productivity inside than outside seagrass meadows. The nature of the sediments (coarse particle size with low organic matter content) is likely to have led to low meiofauna biomass whilst favouring large suspension feeders. The low availability of high quality food sources (i.e. seston, benthic microalgae, and epiphytes) in vegetated sediments may have contributed to the lower than expected secondary productivity inside the seagrass meadow. 
 Most of the dominant nematode species found at the study sites were new to science, and 6 new species were described. Significant differences were found in the nematode assemblages between sites and sediment depths. There was a trend of greater nematode diversity and abundance in vegetated sediments, but this was restricted to the uppermost 2cm of sediments. The effect of seagrass on nematode assemblages is likely to be mediated by the effect of blades on sediment characteristics and the presence of roots. The present study suggests that the presence of Zostera muelleri results in greater biodiversity of sheltered soft-shore communities on a local scale. 
 The addition of &#65533;&#65533;C-labelled macroalgal detritus (Enteromorpha) to microcosms in a feeding experiment resulted in minimal labelling of harpacticoid copepods and nematodes. Lack of change in the fatty acid composition of the latter also suggests limited assimilation of detritus during the experiment. It is likely that consumers choose benthic microalgae over detritus when both food sources are available in the field. High content of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) in nematodes from the field suggests, for the first time, that they are a high quality food source to higher trophic levels. 
 A feeding experiment investigating the effect of bacterivorous nematodes on detritus assimilation rates by amphipods did not support the hypothesis that nematodes increase the trophic transfer efficiency between detritus and macrofaunal detritivores. It is unclear whether amphipods preferentially fed on detritus or whether nematodes escaped predation by burrowing deeper in the sediment. Data obtained in the present study, however, shows that marine bacterivorous nematodes can biosynthesise/accumulate HUFAs in high concentrations despite their low concentrations in their diet. Nematodes could, therefore, provide an important source of these essential nutrients to bulk deposit feeders living in otherwise HUFA-poor sediments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">meiofauna</field><field name="subject">nematodes</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Papanui Inlet</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081124.143019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is Kierkegaard&#146;s radical faith a defensible justification for religious belief?</field><field name="creator">petergn@rocketmail.com</field><field name="description">Fideism, or basing one&#146;s religious belief on faith, is popular especially amongst modern Protestant Christians. For the fideist, religious belief-systems are not subject to rational evaluation, and faith as the act of belief forms the essence of truth and the ultimate criterion for embracing a religion. Critics of fideism say that epistemologically, a hierarchy of methods can be used to derive the truth, and each method gives us varying confidence levels. These methods include mathematics and logic, science, personal experience, history, expert testimony, inference and Faith. Among these, the critic says, pure faith in something is the least successful in getting at the truth. Radical fideists like Kierkegaard do not cite logical reasons for defending their belief that God exists. Personal reasons are instead offered for their decision to believe. In this thesis I seek to demonstrate that the radical fideism advocated by Kierkegaard constitutes good justification for belief in the Christian God. I will begin with a discussion on fideism and some of its proponents, followed by a discussion on the place of faith (as a non-rational belief in God&#146;s existence) in religion. I will then appeal to Kierkegaard&#146;s philosophy in defending my view that religious belief in God is a matter of faith and personal commitment, feeling and passion, and this is an inner process not grounded in arguments. References will be drawn from Kierkegaard&#146;s themes of faith, subjectivity and inwardness. I conclude by saying that even if no objective grounds exist to justify our belief, Kierkegaard standpoint remains right in two ways: Firstly, the fideist rejection of the attempt to justify his belief through offering reasons for it is precisely what makes his decision to believe deeply meaningful in his life. Secondly, those who &#145;try to judge faith by objective, critical reflection will go on forever that way, and will never reach the point of having faith and of being religious&#146;.

This thesis deals with an epidemiological investigation of equine herpesvirus infection, particularly gammaherpesvirus infections, in foals and if there was evidence of reactivation of latent virus infections by stressors such as those associated with weaning.  
A longitudinal study of EHV infections in young foals and the effect of stressors such as weaning on the prevalence of virus infection was undertaken by the detection of DNA and mRNA of EHV2, EHV5, EHV1 and EHV4 in peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) and nasal swabs (NS) from 13 mares and 46 foals in 4 stables.  EHV2 and EHV5 infections were detected commonly in the study population but infections with the alphaherpesviruses EHV1 and EHV4 were not detected, although lytic infections by the alphaherpesviruses may have been missed due to the frequency of sampling.  Age differences in the prevalence of EHV2 and EHV5 infection were detected: the prevalence of EHV2 was higher in young foals than in older foals and adult animals; the prevalence of EHV5 was higher in older foals and adults than in younger foals.  The prevalence of EHV2 and EHV5 infection increased in association with weaning, presumably in association with stressors associated with weaning, but was not clearly associated with disease in the weaned animals.  It was also observed that EHV5 produced a transient lytic infection in PBL of young foals but tended to produce a persistent lytic infection of PBL in older foals and adults.  Persistent lytic EHV5 infections of &#161;&#221;37 weeks duration were also detected in 2 of 13 adult mares and this has not been reported previously.  The persistent lytic infection of PBL was not associated with the detection of virus in NS and the mares with persistent lytic infection of PBL with EHV5 did not transfer the infection to their foals.  
To determine if any of the animals examined were latently infected with the alphaherpesviruses, an examination for transcripts of genes 63 and 64 of EHV1 and EHV4, putative latency-associated transcripts (LAT) of EHV, was undertaken. Evidence of these transcripts was detected in PBL and bronchiolar lymph nodes in the absence of transcripts of the structural gB, supporting previous studies indicating that transcripts of genes 63 and 64 may represent LAT.  In PBL, EHV1 gene 64 RNA transcripts but not gene 63 transcripts were detected in PBL. In bronchiolar lymph nodes, EHV1 gene 64 (but not gene 63) RNA transcripts were detected. In contrast, EHV4 infection was detected in the trigeminal ganglia only and there was no evidence of EHV4 infection in lymph nodes or PBL. In the trigeminal ganglion, EHV4 gB DNA and gene 63 RNA transcripts were detected. The presence of RNA transcripts of EHV1 gene 64 in PBL and lymph node in the absence of any evidence of the replication of structural proteins suggests PBL and lymph node are sites of EHV1 latent infections. The presence of EHV4 gene 63 transcripts in trigeminal ganglia in the absence of any evidence of replication of structural proteins suggests the trigeminal ganglion is the major site of latency of EHV4. 
As a potential means of detecting latency of the gammaherpesvirus EHV2, 4 EHV2 genes ORF74, E4, E8 and E10 were selected as having possible roles during EHV2 latency based on sequence analysis and comparison with gene products identified or postulated as having roles in latency in other gammaherpesviruses. Kinetic transcription of these genes was evaluated in an in vitro time course study using a non neuronal cell line (equine kidney [EK] cells). While the gB and gH genes encoding structural glycoproteins were abundantly transcribed in vitro, the 4 putative EHV2 latency-associated genes were minimally transcribed during lytic infection in EK cells, a result analogous to results obtained for the expression of LATs in other gammaherpesviruses. Attempts to demonstrate transcription products of these genes in PBL or other tissues of horsed presumed to be latently infected with EHV2 (in which gB transcripts had been detected previously) and actively infected with EHV2 (in which gB transcripts had been detected at the time of sampling), were unsuccessful.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081022.131528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational Learning: An Exploration of Learning Strategy Practices in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">an99war@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">This study explores the Malaysian understanding and definition of the concept and terminology of organisational learning (OL) as well as the learning strategies and practices Malaysian organisations use to implement learning. As part of Malaysia's Vision 2020, the government has made a substantial and public commitment to promoting organisational learning to assist industry move to a first world economy status. A number of authors have defined organisational learning as a process of knowledge acquisition that involves continuous change to create, acquire, and transfer knowledge (Garvin 1993; Miller 1996; Williams 2001).  The objective is to explore if this conceptualisation has been accepted and implemented within Malaysia and if not, where opportunities exist to improve both the understanding and practice of Organisational Learning.  

The study explores the understanding of OL and the learning strategies practiced by Malaysian organisations.  In-depth interviews were conducted among human resources managers, executives, professors and lecturers from the manufacturing, health, government and academic sectors in Malaysia. The information gathered was analysed using Nudist (v6) software to interrogate and explore similarities and differences in responses within and across the sectors. Trends emerging from the data were drawn together to present a picture of what happens in practice and to identify opportunities to improve and better manage the implementation of organisational learning and knowledge management strategies. 

The results suggest Malaysian industry representatives were, in general, able to define OL as a concept, however there was variable evidence that it is being implemented effectively in organisations. The manufacturing respondents had a higher level of understanding of OL than other industries. In practice, learning strategies also vary; health organisations emphasize seminars and conferences, the manufacturing sector emphasizes experiential learning, government departments focus more on attachment and exposure, whereas academic respondents were more reliant on self-learning. Overall, the most popular learning strategy is structured training and development programs, which suggests more needs to be done to inculcate learning strategies within the various industries. Those industries with stronger implementation patterns favoured a specialist department to provide a hub for handling knowledge and skills acquisition, for both internal and external learning sources.  In contrast, the understanding of knowledge management was much lower, and indeed, the term was unfamiliar to some respondents. 

These findings may be limited due to the small size of the sample and the findings being from a management perspective.  Nonetheless, given the government's strong commitment to organisational learning and the current lack of empirical industry studies within Malaysia, this study serves as a benchmark.  It does identify that the uptake of OL is still relatively limited and more needs to be achieved to promote a greater understanding of OL if it is to be successfully implemented in Malaysia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organisational Learning</field><field name="subject">Learning Strategy</field><field name="subject">Knowledge Management</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081104.104824</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Queer Being and the Sexual Interstice: A Phenomenological Approach to the Queer Transformative Self</field><field name="creator">J.Horncastle@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis explores a notion of &#147;queer being&#148; in relation to a difficult yet creative articulation of queer self-consciousness. The difficulty of attempting to &#147;particularise&#148; self-consciousness is challenged and dismantled by proposing ways in which putatively exclusive esoteric knowledges of being can be exposed and expanded. This is achieved by justifying singular (queer) experience as it coincides with the disparities between subjectivity and objectivity, experience and existence. I argue that two key perspectives (those of interstitiality and self-transformativity) provide a basis whereby we can &#147;force&#148; a radical articulation of queer being-ness into general and contemporary philosophical discourses of being. In doing so, a particularised theory of intersubjective being emerges as a way to identify the complicity of ethics and ontology.

&#147;Queerness&#148; in this thesis is especially articulated as an eccentricity or poetics of being, experienced at the juncture of diverse knowledge spaces. These include not only the threshold and radical spaces of sexuality and gender, but also the perceived limits of theories of being which allow us to formulate understandings of self-consciousness. This is evidenced through a critical analysis of feminist, queer, transgender, phenomenological and existential texts and/or practices, paying special regard to &#147;everyday, real-life&#148; experience. By using a combination of the &#147;logic of the interstice&#148;, genealogical methods, hermeneutical analysis and a deconstructionist theoretical approach, the thesis seeks out, and insists upon, ways to articulate and determine the possibility of a queer sensibility as both a practice of self-transformativity and a more broadly applicable knowledge heuristic.

The thesis demonstrates that by increasing an awareness of a particular kind of self-transformative queer being-ness &#150; one that embraces a critical ethics of being &#150; the rich insights of queer experiences and knowledges can act as a valuable resource for reviewing the horizons of the ontology of the subject. It also suggests that particularising the term &#147;queer&#148; in relation to a complex theory of &#147;sensibility&#148; provides new depths for understanding, and practical ways to make use of, a queer theory of being.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phenomenology</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">queer</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">being</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081105.142124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rural veterinary practice in Western Australia 1964 to 2007</field><field name="creator">jmaxwell@katel.net.au</field><field name="description">Concern for the plight of rural veterinary practice in Australia existed throughout the 20th century. During the 1970s, the profession highlighted the problems faced by rural practitioners and in 2003, the Frawley Review examined current rural veterinary services. However, neither influenced the course of rural practice in Australia. 

The present thesis examined the status of rural practice in Western Australia from the 1960s to the present day. It did this by investigating the historical changes in agriculture during this period and their effect on rural practice. The practice at Katanning, in rural Western Australia, was used as a case study &#150; a study of the changes and adaptions made by that practice to remain viable. 

In 2006, surveys of both rural practitioners and government veterinary officers were conducted to obtain information of the veterinary services being provided to rural Western Australia. In addition, oral history interviews with a number of respondents to the surveys were carried out.

Rapid expansion of Western Australian agriculture took place during the 1960s and was matched by growth in rural veterinary services. A government subsidy scheme recruited a number of veterinarians to the state. A Preventive Medicine/Animal Production service with sheep was established at Katanning in 1967. The reasons for developing such a service, its promotion, the results achieved and its subsequent failure are documented in the thesis.

The 1970s was a troubled decade for agriculture and for those servicing it. The collapse of the beef-cattle boom was accompanied by a 20% reduction in veterinary staff in rural practice Australia-wide and a number of changes were implemented at Katanning to meet these circumstances. 
The 1980s saw a reduction in the economic significance of agriculture in Western Australia. At the same time, students from the Veterinary School at Murdoch University began graduating and, for the first time in the profession&#146;s history, an overproduction of veterinarians existed.  

The 1990s was a period of relative stability, but was accompanied by major changes for the profession and rural practice. Many practices adopted merchandising and the sale of pet foods to supplement dwindling income. Previously, a male dominated profession, during this decade, it rapidly changed to one dominated by female graduates. Accompanying this gender change there was an increase in the demand for part-time work, whereas previously the profession had been predominantly a full-time vocation.

The present decade opened with a questioning of the direction being taken by the profession and its undergraduate education. The current study revealed that the government veterinary services in Western Australia have contracted in size and scope, whilst at the same time, most rural practitioners attend companion animals at the expense of economic livestock. As a result, veterinary services to economic livestock have reduced and are likely to continue to do so and suggestions are made to counter this trend.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="subject">veterinary</field><field name="subject">practice</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081113.142241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A mediated crisis : news and the national mind</field><field name="creator">johnbott@westnet.com.au</field><field name="description">The thesis examines a mediated crisis and how The Straits Times and The Australian
approach the reporting of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). It looks at how
this mediated crisis exemplifies the culture of the national newspaper and in turn how the
national newspaper has an historical influence on the national psyche. A total of 649
reports and headlines and 141 letters about SARS in The Straits Times (including The
Straits Time Interactive) were examined from April 2003 to November 2003 as were 125
headlines from The Australian.

The early sections of the thesis discuss how a crisis makes news; examine how the media
report a crisis and what emphasis is given to aspects such as: actors, primary definers,
vocabulary, lexical choices, subjects, themes, issues and value dimension or stance. The
first chapter defines crisis, journalism and crisis journalism and discusses where the latter
sits within the continuing expansion and development of major theoretical frameworks,
including living in a risk society. The implication here is that crisis and risk have a
symbiotic relationship.

Historical perspectives of news are discussed in Chapter 2, and the newspaper is placed
within the context of contemporary media. The chapter discusses how newspapers are
aligned with the concept of the national mind and demonstrates the roles and formations
of the two newspapers in relation to the SARS crisis.

Chapter 3 codes the headlines, article titles and subtitles of The Straits Times and The
Australian and using content analysis of the headlines, analyses the reporting of a serious
health crisis SARS that lasted from March to November, 2003. The quantification within
content analysis enables a researcher to read and interpret questions that relate to the
intensity of meaning in texts, their social impact, the relationships between media texts
and the realities and representations they reflect (Hansen et al, 1998). The theory and
method of content analysis is used in this chapter to consider differences between The
Straits Times and The Australian and to exemplify the media&#146;s representation of the
narratives of SARS as it happened in the countries of Singapore and Australia.

Aspects of crisis and risk, the newspaper and the national mind, narratives, presentations,
and post SARS events are discussed in the last chapter. It is concluded from these
discussions there is a world narrative that tells the story of how the human condition likes
to live and rely on a safe social environment always being available. The relationship
between a mediated crisis and risk are also discussed. In addition, it is maintained that
reporting in 2003 was not just about SARS but a way of reporting that allowed one to
view journalism as an aid to good governance, particularly with regard to living in a risk
and crisis-ridden society.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">crisis journalism</field><field name="subject">crisis</field><field name="subject">severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) media</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081113.143044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Good for the Soul:
The Relationship between Work,
Wellbeing, and Psychological Capital</field><field name="creator">Cole, Kenneth</field><field name="description">Both economic and psychological research provides strong evidence that unemployment
adversely affects a person's mental, emotional, and physical wellbeing, which in turn may
impair his/her ability to regain employment. Studies also suggest a person's "psychological
capital" (personality traits that influence the productivity of labour) may mediate (1) the impact
of unemployment on wellbeing and facilitate re-employment. While the effects of
unemployment have been well documented, the simultaneous relationship between wellbeing
and labour market status and the influencing role of psychological capital have received much
less attention, requiring further investigation. There is still concern in the literature that "the
exact nature of the interrelationships between labour market experience and mental health
remains unclear and complicated by questions over the direction of causality and
heterogeneous impacts across individuals." (Dockery, 2006, p. 2)
The purpose of this research is to explore the interrelationship between labour market status,
wellbeing, and psychological capital in more detail. The thesis combines key concepts from
various economic and psychological theories, each partially describing how labour market
status, wellbeing, and psychological capital interact with each other. The validity of the
integrated model is then tested by estimating structural equations for labour market status and
wellbeing using cross-sectional and longitudinal data from the Household, Income and
Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey. The HILDA Survey is a broad social and
economic survey that focuses on family and household formation, income and work. The
survey contains economic, psychological, and demographic data with sound psychometric
qualities for a large sample of working aged Australians that makes it well suited to this type of analysis.
As well as the regression analyses, the results of a case study conducted with a group of jobseekers
at an employment agency are also reported. The study sought to evaluate the
effectiveness of personal development training for the unemployed (designed to improve
psychological capital), and its subsequent influence on their ability to regain employment.
While the research was halted before completion, some valuable insights were gleamed from
the study, and these warrant discussion.
Findings of the research indicate a simultaneous relationship exists between labour market
status and wellbeing. Individuals with healthier wellbeing are more likely to be employed,
and employment contributes to healthier wellbeing. The results also indicate psychological
capital is an important variable influencing wellbeing, partially mediating the impact of
unemployment on wellbeing. Employed individuals have significantly higher psychological
capital than those who are unemployed or not in the labour force, or those who transition in
and out of employment. Psychological capital appears to be a relatively stable, but somewhat
malleable, personality construct that does not vary greatly for individuals experiencing
changes in labour market status (LMS). People who develop poor psychological capital
during youth may therefore be predisposed to a higher risk of being unemployed when they
enter the labour market.
The results suggest programs/policies that foster healthier wellbeing and psychological capital
during youth, or repair damaged psychological capital once in the labour market, could help
lower unemployment or the duration of unemployment. Recent Australian government policy
initiatives designed to improve labour force participation and productivity by enhancing
human capital are likely to be more effective if they also target psychological capital. The
research also highlights shortcomings in mainstream economic theory, which are discussed
along with the weaknesses of the study, and opportunities for further research.

Accounting for Natural Disturbance and
a Reference Condition defined by Good Management Practices for
River Protection</field><field name="creator">Sellens, Claire</field><field name="description">This study has contributed to the development of the reference condition approach in
disturbed landscapes. The reference condition approach has been an important development
for the bioassessment of aquatic ecosystems by providing a practical tool for the accurate
assessment of river condition. The selection of appropriate reference sites is critical to the
success of the predictive model in terms of being able to distinguish between natural variation
in biota and the effects of human disturbance. Capturing natural variability and explaining it
is a key difference between the reference condition approach and other study designs (e.g.
before/after/control/impact). Natural disturbances such as drought or bushfire can
significantly alter the ecological condition of streams, and although the ecological condition
of streams affected by natural drought or bushfire is part of the natural cycle, this natural
variation of the ecological condition is rarely incorporated into many study designs because of
a mismatch in time scales. Human disturbance has also significantly altered the condition of
landscapes through the development of agriculture and urbanisation. In urban or agricultural
landscapes it can be impossible to locate streams that have not been modified by human
activity for use as a reference condition. This study looked at the effects of natural disturbance
on the reference condition, in terms of the way natural disturbance affects the prediction of
stream condition and also the incorporation of the condition of streams experiencing natural
disturbance into a predictive model. Additionally this study identified an alternative
benchmark for modified landscapes based on the presence of good management practices for
river protection, and tested this benchmark for the assessment of streams impacted by
urbanisation.
Drought and bushfire regularly disturb aquatic ecosystems in Australia, and affected reference
sites in the ACT and South Coast region of New South Wales in 2002 and 2003. Drought and
bushfire conditions affected macroinvertebrates and environmental variables across these
streams, and the majority of sites were assessed as significantly impaired using regional
AUSRIVAS (AUstralian RIVers Assessment System) models. This indicated the existing
reference conditions for these regions had not incorporated the ecological conditions of
reference sites suffering these natural disturbances. Many of the environmental variables used
to predict the condition of streams were also affected by drought or bushfire. The changes to
environmental variables affected how sites were assessed in models, but the overall
assessment was not significantly changed from the initial assessment that drought or bushfire
had significantly impaired the ecological condition.
To reduce potential assessment errors associated with changes to predictor variables an
attempt was made to construct new models with changeable variables excluded. However, it
was not possible to completely exclude these types of variables, and subsequent models were
no better than the original models in terms of changes to predictor variables affecting the
generation of expected taxa lists. The changes to environmental variables did not affect the
actual assessment of site condition because although group membership probabilities were
changed the probabilities of taxon occurrence did not change significantly. The different
reference site groups all contained some common taxa that occurred at most sites and even
when group probabilities changed this did not change the probability of these taxa occurring
at a test site. For regional models, such as the ACT or NSW South Coast, changes to predictor
variables may not significantly affect the assessment of site condition.
Incorporating reference sites under drought conditions into a predictive model was an
effective way of discriminating the effects of drought from human disturbance. The model
only provided two different ecological conditions, a single drought measurement and a single
non-drought measurement, so the model did not fully encompass the potential natural
variability. The model has value as a starting point and was effective in distinguishing sites
affected by human disturbance from sites affected by drought.
Good Management Practice (GMP) for river protection is any intervention that minimises
human impact on stream condition. Urban sites protected by GMP were used as an alternative
benchmark to a minimally impacted reference condition. The criteria used to select reference
sites were not sufficiently robust to detect a significant benefit of GMP on physical or
chemical characteristics of protected sites, compared to sites without GMP. In general
however, the physical and chemical condition of GMP sites was better than sites without
GMP and there were significant differences in macroinvertebrate assemblages of GMP and
non-GMP sites. A refinement to the site selection process is proposed to include a specific
assessment of GMP effectiveness for the protection it is designed to provide. This will
substantially improve the robustness of a GMP benchmark and provide a clearer picture of the
factors controlling biota in urban streams protected by GMP.
The GMP benchmark was developed into a predictive model for the assessment of urban
stream health, and in terms of the assessment of test site condition, it did not differ
significantly from a model using minimally impacted sites. The purpose of the GMP
benchmark was to provide an alternative reference condition for the assessment of stream
health in modified landscapes when minimally impacted sites are unavailable or provide an
unattainable benchmark. The GMP reference condition as an alternative can provide an
attainable and realistic benchmark. The development and application of the suggested site
selection protocol will improve the robustness of the GMP benchmark and better account for
natural variation in the biota and physical characteristics of the sites used to determine the
reference condition.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reference condition approach</field><field name="subject">aquatic ecosystem</field><field name="subject">stream</field><field name="subject">river</field><field name="subject">australia</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081029.131335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Construction of Youth in Australian
Young Adult Literature
1980-2000</field><field name="creator">Heuschele, Margaret</field><field name="description">Adolescence is an incredibly complex period of life. During this time young people are searching for and wanting to create their own unique identity, however being confronted with a plethora of roles and directions is challenging and confusing. These challenges are reflected in the vast array of young adult literature being presented to young people today. As a result young adult literature has the potential to function as scaffolding to assist teenagers in the struggles of adolescence by serving as an important source of information about the world and the people in it. Teenage novels also give young people the opportunity to try on different identities and vicariously experience consequences of actions while developing their own distinctive personality and character.
As this study reveals, the Australian young adult novel has undergone considerable developments, with 1989 serving as a milestone year in which writers and publishers turned in new directions. In general, Australian young adult novels have changed from books set predominately in rural areas, incorporating major themes of child abuse, death, friendship and survival with introverted characters aged between twelve and sixteen in the early 1980s to novels with urban settings, a large increase in books about crime, dating, drugs and mental health and sexually active, extroverted characters aged between fourteen and eighteen in the late 1990s.
To chart the progression of these changes and gain an understanding of the messages young adults receive from adolescent novels an evaluative framework was developed. The framework consists of two main sections. The first part applies to the work as a whole,
obtaining data about the novel such as plot, style, setting, temporal context, use of humour,
issues within the text and ending, while the second part collects information about character demographics including gender, age, occupational status, family type, sexual orientation, relationships with family and authority figures, personality traits and outlook for character. To qualitatively and quantitatively assess the construction of youth in Australian young adult literature a random selection of 20 per cent of Australian young adult books published in each year from 1980 to 2000 were analysed using the evaluative framework, with 186 novels being studied altogether.
During the 1990s in particular, Australian young adult literature was heavily criticised for being too bleak, too dark, presenting a picture of life that was all gloom and doom. This research resoundingly dismisses this argument by showing that rather than being a negative influence on the lives of young people, Australian books for young people present a comprehensive portrayal of youth. They probe the entire gamut of teenage experiences, both the good and the bad, providing a wide range of scenarios, roles, relationships and characters for young people to explore. Therefore Australian young adult literature provides an important source of information and support for the psycho-social development of young people during the formative years of adolescence.
This research is significant because it gives hard evidence to support the promotion of a representative selection of Australian young adult novels both in the classroom and in home, school and public libraries. By establishing the available range of contemporary Australian young adult literature through this study, young adult readers, teachers and librarians can be confident in the knowledge that appropriate titles are accessible which meet the needs and interests of young people. Consequently, the substantial amount of data gathered from this
study will considerably add to the knowledge and understanding ofAustralian young adult novels to date and provide an excellent starting point for further research in the future.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">young adult literature</field><field name="subject">adolescent</field><field name="subject">teenage</field><field name="subject">late 20th century</field><field name="subject">novels</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081029.171132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INNOVATIONS IN SYSTEMATIC TOXICOLOGICAL ANALYSIS:
AMPHETAMINETYPE
SUBSTANCES AND DESIGNER ANALOGUES</field><field name="creator">Apollonio, Luigino Giuseppe</field><field name="description">Recently, several novel technologies have emerged with substantial benefits in
toxicological analysis. These include the development of beadbased
multiplex
immunoassay (Suspension Bead Array, SBA), the use of reduced-volume
centrifugal ion-exchange
extraction (SpinSPE),
and Ultra-Performance
(TM) liquid chromatographic
separation coupled to mass spectrometry (UPLC(TM)/MS n ). This work sought to investigate
the efficacy and practicality of these innovative approaches against a benchmark of
established methods and instrumentation for the screening and confirmation of
amphetaminetype
substances.
This study begins with a statistical survey of amphetaminetype
substances encountered in
an accredited forensic laboratory supporting the Australian Capital Territory and regional
New South Wales. Over the 5year
period 2001-2005, it was determined that 6683 case
submissions required presumptive screening for amphetamines. Of these cases, 1269
(19.0%) required confirmative analysis of amphetaminetype
substances, including
amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDA, MDMA, MDEA, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine,
and phentermine. Such analytical needs were then used in comparative assessment of the
novel and established methodologies, including examination of immunoassay specificity,
extraction efficiency, chromatographic resolution, general resource efficiency, and total
analysis time.
Development of a beadbased
immunoassay platform (SBA) for multiplex amphetamines
analysis proved to be a complex task. Efforts to multiplex the amphetamine and
methamphetamine immunoassay models into a single assay exhibited a significant degree
of non-specific
antibody cross-reactivity.
However, the merits of the individual bead
assays were demonstrated. Upon comparison with commercially available enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays for amphetamine or methamphetamine (ELISA), it was observed
that the SBA models exhibited specificity comparable to that of the ELISA assays and
linearity over a concentration range of toxicological relevance (0-1000 ng/mL
amphetamine or methamphetamine). In addition, the results indicated the practical
applicability of the individual SBA assays for an oral fluid matrix, and demonstrated
significant reductions in the volumes of reagents required and length of time of analysis.
Additionally, in an optimised multiplex system, the amount of sample required for
screening could be reduced as the SBA technology theoretically permits analysis of up to
100 different drugs or metabolites from one volume of sample.
The aspect of forensic sample conservation was further explored with investigation of
reduced-volume
extraction techniques, such as the application of centrifugal ionexchange
extraction columns (SpinSPE).
Following initial development, the SpinSPE
technique
was applied to the isolation of amphetaminetype
substances from oral fluid and compared
with a mixedmode
SPE method for both extraction and resource efficiency. From the
observed results, both extraction methods were demonstrated to be effective in the
isolation of amphetamine, methamphetamine, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, PMA, MDA,
MDMA, MDEA, MBDB, and 2CB from an oral fluid matrix with detection by
heptafluorobutyric acid derivatisation (HFBTA) and GC/MS. The SpinSPE
model
demonstrated comparable efficacy with reduced sample volume (200 &#49961;, as well as
significant reductions in the volumes of reagents required for column conditioning,
washing, and elution. In addition, the linear working range (0-2000 ng/mL) and
sensitivity of the method indicated the potential to further reduce sample volume.
In the confirmative separation and identification of drug compounds, the technological
advancement of UltraPerformance
(TM) liquid chromatography (UPLC(TM)) has recently
evolved from efforts to improve LC resolution, sensitivity, and time of analysis. In this
research, UPLC(TM) coupled to mass spectrometry was demonstrated to be capable of
rapidly identifying several amphetaminetype
substances (phenylethylamine,
amphetamine, phentermine, methamphetamine, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, PMA, 4MTA,
MDA, MDMA, MDEA, MBDB) and ketamine in an analysis time of less than five
minutes. In addition, UPLC(TM)/MS demonstrated a resolving power comparable to GC/MS
with significantly reduced instrumental analysis time.
This research reveals the promise of these new applications in advancing towards a more
efficient and modernised systematic toxicological approach. The continued development
and optimisation of SBA multiplex immunoassays will permit customisable systems
capable of simultaneously detecting numerous compounds with antibodybased
sensitivity
and selectivity. In circumstances where low sample volumes are required for confirmation
of drug use, such as in roadside saliva drug testing for driving under the influence
offences, reducedvolume
SpinSPE
has been demonstrated to be a practical and effective
alternative for sample preparation. In addition, a more streamlined procedure is further
enhanced with the use of UPLC(TM) coupled to mass spectrometry for analyte separation
and molecular identification.
It is expected that illicit drug use will remain a significant public concern. With the
continued desire for more rapid and comprehensive methodologies, further study of these
and other innovative technologies will be of considerable future benefit to laboratories
such as that serving the Australian Capital Territory region.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="subject">Amphetamines</field><field name="subject">Toxicology</field><field name="subject">Methamphetamine</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081030.110007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IMPLEMENTING NEW PUBLIC MANAGEMENT IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY:
THE CASE OF THAILAND</field><field name="creator">Mongkol, Kulachet</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the impact of the New Public Management (NPM) paradigm on public sector reform in Thailand. The main objective of the thesis is to explore the question of whether Thai public sector reform belongs to the NPM paradigm, especially whether the intentions and contents of policy documents are actually realised in the implementation process. The study commences by reviewing the transformation of public administration to NPM and how this has affected developing countries. In theory, the traditional model of public administration, namely bureaucracy, has been considered as dysfunctional, no longer able to cope with changing circumstances and the new environment. NPM was introduced during the 1980s and 1990s in some rich countries in order to replace the traditional model of public administration. However, there are doubts about the appropriateness of NPM for the public sector in developing countries.
The thesis is specifically concerned with Thailand and as a first step delineates the history of public administration and its reform in Thailand including current policies. This includes the introduction of NPM. The remainder of the thesis is comprised of a case study of one ministry in Thailand. Much of the data was collected from semi-structured interviews with officials in the ministry and government agencies responsible for reform.
The case study focused on four dimensions of reform: organisational restructure and redesign of internal authority, public culture and values reform, workforce reduction, and internal NPM reform initiatives. The findings were mixed. Some NPM style initiatives such as restructuring of roles and functions were accomplished. However, some areas of NPM have either been partially implemented (downsizing) or not introduced at all (greater competition in public sector). It was also found that some reform initiatives, such as public culture and values reform, fell outside of the NPM paradigm. The research concluded that the NPM paradigm had made limited progress in the Thai public sector.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">New Public Management (NPM)</field><field name="subject">public sector reform</field><field name="subject">public administration</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081030.121244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CRISIS MANAGEMENT:
A CASE STUDY OF THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT
TOURISM PUBLIC POLICY
AFTER THE FIRST AND SECOND BALI BOMBINGS</field><field name="creator">ANDARI, WIPSAR ASWI DINA TRI</field><field name="description">This research discusses the tourism crisis management approach used in handling the recovery of
Bali as a tourism destination after the first Bali bombings in 2002 and second Bali bombings in
2005. It acknowledges the importance of a crisis management especially in a situation where the
crisis repeatedly occurs in the same place and targeted the similar target. This research examines
the crisis management approach through the tourism public policy formulated and implemented
by the government of Indonesia. An external perspective from the industry private sector is also
investigated as many scholars note that other observations and opinion from senior executives
following every episode are necessary because they have different perceptions of the crises.
Finally, an investigation of any existence of organisational learning the first and second Bali
bombings is also presented. This research concludes in three new findings. First, the Indonesian
government did not present any crisis management framework after the first and second Bali
Bombings; rather they established a National Recovery Program that lacks few main aspects of
crisis management. Second, although the Indonesian government initiated the recovery program
after the first Bali Bombings it was the private sector (Bali Tourism Board) who initially
instigated the recovery program after the second Bali Bombings. Third, the absence of an
organisational learning was also discovered after the first and second Bali Bombings incidents</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">crisis management</field><field name="subject">Bali bombings</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">public policy</field><field name="subject">National Recovery Program</field><field name="subject">terrorism</field><field name="subject">Bali</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081107.104034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clipped Wings:
Management discourses during organisational
change at Australia's
Civil Aviation Authority</field><field name="creator">Mahoney, James Scott</field><field name="description">Structural change in organisations is stressful for staff and the managers who must implement it. Most change programs use employee communication techniques to support change directions set by senior executive decision makers-dominant coalitions.
This research used a single case study to explain the context and management discourses of a major re-structure of an Australian Federal Government agency, the former Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), during the early 1990s. A content analysis examined the use of keywords in management discourses that argued the need for change. The keywords represented the two major change discourses: micro-economic reform and aviation safety regulation. A critical discourse analysis investigated the dominant coalition's discourse strategies to justify change. Content and process communication theories, and the role of framing in organisational change, were used to explain how employees may have reacted to change directions.
The research found that change directions were framed as an economic imperative that clashed with a traditional organisational culture that emphasised the primacy of aviation safety. It found that mixed messages by the two principal members of the dominant coalition who drove change exacerbated the clash.
The results suggest a need for further analysis of management discourses used to inform employees about structural change, especially in organisations that have legislative responsibilities. Further analysis of change messages framed by dominant coalitions could lead to a deeper understanding ofhow they affect employees and the change process.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Aviation Authority</field><field name="subject">CAA</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">government agency</field><field name="subject">restructure</field><field name="subject">communication.</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081113.153047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EXPLORING MOTIVATION AND TOURIST TYPOLOGY:
THE CASE OF KOREAN GOLF TOURISTS TRAVELLING IN THE ASIA PACIFIC</field><field name="creator">Kim, Jae Hak</field><field name="description">Koreans are increasingly participating in overseas golf holidays in the Asia Pacific region and this trend is expected to continue. The popularity of golf holidays has been linked to the growing demands of special interest tourism and sport tourism where tourists seek to satisfy specific travel needs and wants to meet their travel motivations. Research into travel motivation using the concept of the push and pull framework is therefore a focus of study in tourism research.
To date, little or no research has examined travel motivation and tourist typology using the push and pull framework in the markets of special interest tourism, sport tourism, or golf tourism. This thesis fills the gap in the literature and contributes to knowledge of tourist motivation and typology. The aims of the research were therefore three-fold: to identify the push and pull factors of golf travel motivation, to classify heterogeneous golf tourists into homogeneous groups, and to profile the clusters with respect to socio-demographics, golf related behaviour and travel characteristics, destination attributes, and destination preferences. This was achieved by collecting empirical data on Korean golf tourists travelling in the Asia Pacific region.
The methodology comprised both qualitative research based on semi-structured interviews and quantitative research based on self-completed questionnaires. A principal component factor analysis was employed to identify five push based socio-psychological motivations and seven pull based destination attributes. A cluster analysis was then conducted to classify golfers into three different clusters, namely, Golf-intensive Golfers, Multi-motivated Golfers, and Companion Golfers. The golf clusters were then profiled based on the findings in respect to socio-demographics, golf related behaviour and travel characteristics, destination attributes, 
and destination preferences. A cross tabulation with chi-square tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to test the hypotheses of this thesis.
Results revealed that golf tourists were not homogeneous in their push based socio-psychological travel motivations. Their profiles are theoretically and statistically feasible because the research tested hypotheses indicate that each cluster had both similarities and differences in socio-demographics, golf related behaviour and travel characteristics, destination attributes, and destination preferences. This suggests that marketing strategies should target both the different and similar aspects of golf travel behaviour.
The research is of benefit not only to academics and practitioners in the study of travel motivations and tourist typology in the field of special interest tourism, sport tourism, and, in particular, golf tourism, but also to tourism marketers and tour operators in the development, promotion and packaging of golf holiday products.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Golf tourism</field><field name="subject">Korea</field><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">Pacific area</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">golf</field><field name="subject">active sport tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081128.145648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Secondary Head of Department
Professional Development Requirements, Expectations and Directions</field><field name="creator">Mulford, David John</field><field name="description">The study sought to hear the voice of the Head of Department (HOD) in independent, non-government
secondary schools in the ACT Region on their changing leadership role and their recommendations for targeted professional development.
Heads of Academic Departments (HODs) face significant challenges by being in the middle of the organisational structure of a secondary school. They are required to be competent change agents for whole-of-school "macro" initiatives on one hand, yet on the other hand foster "micro" initiatives that support effective learning and teaching in individual classrooms. HODs deal on a daily basis with a broad range of important school issues that include influencing people; management; departmental structures; administration; leadership; student success and progress; educational theory and practice; department and school culture; communication; parents; external educational bodies; professional development; up-to-date pedagogy; and their own teaching and learning. There is frequently a lack of clarity of expectations about their role in a rapidly and ever-changing school system. The incumbents have rarely received targetted professional development for this crucial middle-ranking leadership position.
The study describes and analyses the findings of detailed research with 24 Heads of Department and six Professional Development Coordinators at six independent, non-government
secondary schools. The prime focus was on the changing leadership expectations of Heads of Department and, as a result, the professional development required to support the emerging requirements and expectations of and the directions for the role. The study followed an earlier Dinham et al. (2000) research project, of which I was one of the researchers, into the roles of Heads of Department in independent, non-government secondary schools. The study used analysis of existing job descriptions of Heads of Department, structured interview questionnaires that required quantitative categorisation and analysis, and open-ended interview questions requiring qualitative analysis. The respondents were all leaders of a major academic department within an independent, non-government secondary school.
The five major themes that developed were the forces acting upon and tensions experienced by the Head of Department whilst maintaining credibility as an excellent teacher; the relatively newly developed Professional Development Coordinator role; the definition of the
leadership approach, resultant implications and, as a result, the alternative structures that secondary schools are examining for academic leadership; communication between the middle ranking subject leaders and their senior executive; and the targetted professional development required for the changing role of a HOD.
In independent, non-government secondary schools, the department structures and leadership quality can be powerful forces to assist or resist any reform agenda. Effective leadership of these academic departments becomes important to secure a constant quest to improve the quality of learning and teaching; to improve student outcomes; to nurture staff for more senior leadership positions and to transfer the benefits of a distributive leadership to more staff.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">head of department (HOD)</field><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="subject">ACT non-government secondary schools</field><field name="subject">teacher</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081201.154838</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utilisation of Still-Water Patches by Fish and Shrimp in a Lowland River, With Particular Emphasis on Early-Life Stages</field><field name="creator">Price, Amina</field><field name="description">In lowland river systems, in-channel, slow-flowing or still-water areas (still-water patches, SWPs) are considered to be important habitats for many organisms, particularly the early-life stages of fish and shrimp. However, the distribution of the early life-stages of fish and shrimp among these habitats appears to be very patchy and studies suggest that the quality and diversity of microhabitat conditions within SWPs and the accessibility of SWPs to spawning adults and dispersing young may be important determinants of their suitability as nursery habitat. The aims of this thesis were to examine the utilisation of still-water patches by fish and shrimp in a lowland river in relation to habitat suitability and accessibility, with particular emphasis on early-life stages. To determine the factors influencing habitat selection among SWPs, the environmental variability in SWP habitat, and both the distribution and the movement patterns of fish and shrimp, were examined in the Broken River, a lowland river in south-eastern Australia.
SWP habitat was found to be highly spatially and temporally variable in the Broken River. SWPs differed in relation to permanence, accessibility and microhabitat variables, and all life-stages of fish and shrimp were found to be significantly spatially aggregated among SWPs. This suggests that individual SWPs may differ in their suitability as habitat, and/or in their accessibility to dispersing organisms and indicates either differential rates of retention, movement into SWPs, spawning effort or survival among SWPs for these organisms.
Significant associations were found for all species and life-stages in relation to the microhabitat characteristics of SWPs. The two introduced species, carp and gambusia, were found to have fewer associations, which suggests that these species are habitat generalists. Cover and SWP morphology variables were shown to be important for all native species. Significant, positive associations were found for most species and life-stages with large, deep, SWPs containing instream cover, however, the extent of cover preferred was variable. It was hypothesised that large, deep SWPs that contain instream cover are more environmentally stable and provide better foraging efficiency and reduced competition for space, whilst also providing refuge from predators and, that they may be easier to locate than smaller patches.
Specific associations with microhabitat variables differed among all species and life-stages, and this was attributed to differences in diet and predation rates. Consequently, generalised microhabitat relationships for particular life-stages or species could not be identified and the results from this thesis suggest that a diversity of microhabitat conditions are required to meet the differing requirements of various life-stages and species.
Significant associations were also found for most groups in relation to the accessibility characteristics of SWPs, indicating that the ability of individuals to access SWPs is an important factor in determining their distribution among SWPs. This further suggests that movement is an important factor in the distribution pattern of fish and shrimp among SWPs. Significant associations were found for most groups in relation to patch isolation, adjacent hydraulic habitat and entrance conditions, indicating that landscape composition and configuration as well as boundary conditions may be important determinants of organisms being able to locate suitable patches. Associations with accessibility variables differed among species and life-stages, and may be attributable to differences in movement capabilities.
Field manipulations of instream cover and entrance depth were conducted to further examine the habitat associations found. The results confirmed a positive relationship between instream cover and fish and shrimp abundances. No species, however, responded consistently to the manipulation of entrance depths, and this was attributed to water level rises throughout the experiment and/or the correlation of entrance depth with SWP depth. However, the results from the field manipulations suggested that deeper habitats are able to be exploited by small-bodied adults and larvae when significant levels of instream cover are also available as refuge from predation.
In order to confirm the importance of movement in the selection of SWP habitat by fish and shrimp, the movement patterns of fish and shrimp into and out of SWPs were investigated. Whilst the results from this aspect of the study were inconclusive for fish, the results for shrimp confirmed that adults and larvae moved routinely into and out of SWPs. However, for all shrimp species, movement appeared to be limited to a certain period of larval development, indicating that SWP quality and stability may be more important at particular stages of development than others.
The results of this thesis have demonstrated the importance of SWP quality and stability for fish and shrimp in the Broken River and have shown that habitat preferences vary among individual species and life-stages. Consequently, in order to manage for multiple species and life-stages, consideration must be given not only to the availability of SWPs, but also to their stability over time and to the availability of a diverse range of microhabitats. In addition, consideration must also be given to the accessibility of SWPs and this will require a greater knowledge of the specific spawning and dispersal requirements of the organisms which utilise these patches, in combination with a greater understanding of the impacts of flow modification on riverine landscape composition and configuration.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">river system</field><field name="subject">still water areas</field><field name="subject">fish</field><field name="subject">shrimp</field><field name="subject">microhabitat</field><field name="subject">Broken River</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081202.090600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Commonwealth Higher Education Policies: Their Impacts on Autonomy and Research in Australian Universities</field><field name="creator">Quann-Youlden, Cathy</field><field name="description">In recent years, the Australian Government's (Commonwealth) relationship to universities has become one of greater involvement as political circles recognise the escalation in the significance of higher education as a key determinant in Australia's economic, social, cultural, and intellectual development. The increasing role of the Commonwealth in Australian universities is largely a consequence of this recognition, but it is also due in part to changes in the way governments approach the public sector and publicly funded institutions.
Both the literature and extensive Commonwealth reports provide an array of details in relation to: what the Commonwealth wants from its universities; why it wants it; what it is doing to ensure that it gets what it wants; and the results of its actions-at least from the perspective of the Commonwealth. But what is missing is how universities themselves perceive the impact of the Commonwealth's increasing involvement in universities. Although academics and managers in Australian universities have much to say about how current and proposed Commonwealth policies affect their working environment they are not given much of a venue to opine. As such there is a lack of literature on how universities perceive the impact of this increasing involvement. This dissertation aims to fill the gap by providing a forum that addresses universities' perceptions of how Commonwealth policies affect their universities.
Specifically, this dissertation sets out to discover if and how Commonwealth policies change universities and focuses on how policies influence autonomy and research in Australian universities through the responses of those who work in the offices of the deputy vice chancellors of research in twelve Australian universities.
One of the most significant findings of the thesis is that the Commonwealth's increasing involvement in universities is viewed by respondents as a consequence of the Commonwealth's mistrust of Australian universities. Furthermore, the Commonwealth is seen as lacking expertise in areas relating to universities-their needs, history, purpose, mission, and how they best relate to and contribute to society-and their need for autonomy. This dissertation offers some insights into perspectives whereby policies built on the Commonwealth's mistrust and lack of expertise in university matters negatively influence autonomy and research productivity in Australian universities.

Multimodal Information Displays</field><field name="creator">Chang, Dempsey H.</field><field name="description">The theory of Gestalt was proposed in the nineteenth century to explain and predict the way that people perceptually group visual elements, and it has been used to develop guidelines for designing visual computer interfaces. In this thesis we seek to extend the use of Gestalt principles to the design of haptic and visual-haptic displays.
The thesis begins with a survey of Gestalt research into visual, auditory and haptic perception. From this survey the five most commonly found principles are identified as figure-ground, continuation, closure, similarity and proximity. This thesis examines the proposition that these five principles can be applied to the design of haptic interfaces.
Four experiments investigate whether Gestalt principles of figure-ground, continuation, closure, similarity and proximity are applicable in the same way when people group elements either through their visual (by colour) or haptic (by texture) sense. The results indicate significant correspondence between visual and haptic grouping. A set of haptic design guidelines for haptic displays are developed from the experiments. This allows us to use the Gestalt principles to organise a Gestalt-Taxonomy of specific guidelines for designing haptic displays. The Gestalt-Taxonomy has been used to develop new haptic design guidelines for information displays.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gestalt</field><field name="subject">visual perception</field><field name="subject">hapatic display</field><field name="subject">computer interface</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081203.123314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A THEORY OF LEGISLATION FROM A SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE</field><field name="creator">Harrison, Peter</field><field name="description">In this thesis I outline a view of primary legislation from a systems perspective. I suggest that systems theory and, in particular, autopoietic theory, as modified by field theory, is a mechanism for understanding how society operates.
The description of primary legislation that I outline differs markedly from any conventional definition in that I argue that primary legislation is not, and indeed cannot be, either a law or any of the euphemisms that are usually accorded to an enactment by a parliament. I cite two reasons for such a conclusion.
The primary reason for my conclusion is that I see primary legislation as being an output of a particular subsystem of society, while the law is the output of another subsystem of society. I argue that these outputs are the discrete products of separate subsystems of society. I argue that primary legislation should be viewed as a trinity. The first state of this trinity is that, upon enactment, primary legislation is a brute fact in that it is but a thing and the only property of this thing is that of being a text. The second state of this trinity is that following the act of enactment, the thing enacted will be reproduced and this reproduction is a separate thing that will sit in some repository until used. The third state of this trinity is that, upon use, this thing that is primary legislation will be transformed into an object and the user will attribute such functions and attributes to that object as are appropriate to the context within which the object is used. The thing has therefore become an object and an institutional fact. The second reason for my conclusion that primary legislation is not a law relates to the fact that the thing that is primary legislation is a text and the only function of a text is that it is available to be read. That is to say, of itself, a text is incapable of doing anything: it is the reader who defines the status of the text and attributes functions and attributes. Upon use, primary legislation thus becomes a censored input for future action and one of these actions may be some statement by a court of law.
I assert that the view of primary legislation that has been accepted within the body politic is the product of the discourse of a particular subsystem of society that I have designated ?the legal practice?, and I outline why and how this has occurred. Outlining a view about primary legislation also necessitates outlining a view as to the nature of the law. I assert that the law is a myth and I see this myth as a product of the discourse of the legal practice. I have asserted that although it is the judges that state the law, such statements flow from the discourse of those who practise the law.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">law philosophy</field><field name="subject">system theory</field><field name="subject">Primary Legislation</field><field name="subject">.</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081204.115715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The slab houses of Canberra:

For
Requirements Engineering</field><field name="creator">Adikari, Sisira</field><field name="description">For over two decades user-centric methods and techniques have been proposed to assist the
production of usable, useful, and desirable software products. Despite these approaches,
usability problems are still identified in finished software products creating problems at
systems acceptance, rework and impacting end user experience. Part of the reason for these
continuing problems is that user-centric approaches are not part of the traditional software
engineering process. The literature review shows that software engineering and human-computer
interaction are largely different communities.
The aim of this thesis is to investigate whether the incorporation of user modelling and
usability modelling into software requirements specifications would improve design quality
and usability of software products. This research study used a Design Science dominant
mixed research methodology consisting of case study and action research for creating,
analysing and evaluating artefacts for improving the effectiveness of user-centred design and
usability of software artefacts. Using the functional specification of an existing system in a
government agency, ten designers created screen and interaction designs. The specification
was then enhanced with usability specifications and the designers redeveloped their designs
in the light of the enhanced specification. Both designs were subject to pre-defined usability
tests and designers described their design experience as they worked.
The results of the research demonstrated that enhancing traditional software requirements
specifications with additional specifications of user modelling and usability modelling made
a positive difference to both designer perception as well as design quality of user interface
artefacts. The theoretical and practical values of these findings are explored.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer</field><field name="subject">user interface</field><field name="subject">usability</field><field name="subject">user-centred design</field><field name="subject">software engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081204.145827</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Extent to Which Clubs Are Perceived As Learning
Organizations</field><field name="creator">McCaffrey, John</field><field name="description">In 1995 a Federal Government Report, Enterprising Nation: Renewing
Australia?s Managers to Meet the Challenges of the Asia-Pacific Century (Karpin,
1995) was published. One of the key themes of this report was that "The "learning
organisation" will be standard philosophy for many Australian enterprises and a
major way they cope with change and turbulence. Managers will create conditions
conducive to learning for both individuals and the enterprise as a whole, within and
between groups, across individual business units and between enterprises and their
external environments."
There is a dearth of published literature internationally, not only on clubs and
the degree to which they are learning organizations but organizations in general. A
systematic search of the literature identified only one published report in which there
was an in-depth exploration of an organization to determine if it was a learning
organization. Therefore, this study has a dual purpose. Firstly, it provides an in-depth
study of a specific industry; and secondly it helps to fill a knowledge gap in the study
of organizations.
This study has used as its theoretical framework Marquardt?s (2002) learning
organization model to determine the extent to which the characteristics of the learning
organization are perceived to apply to a group of clubs in a regional area of Australia.
The study has used a survey method utilising the Learning Organization Profile (LOP)
questionnaire developed by Marquardt (1996) and validated by Griego, Geroy and
Wright (2000) and interviews with the CEOs and Human Resource Managers from
four clubs. The LOP was distributed to permanent staff working in these clubs
resulting in 36% of the LOPs being returned.
Statistical analysis of the returned LOPs indicated that the clubs had not adopted
the characteristics of the learning organization to any great extent. The clubs divided
into two groups. The perceptions of staff from two clubs were that the clubs had
adopted learning organization characteristics to a minor extent. The perceptions of
staff from the other two clubs was that the two clubs had adopted learning
organization characteristics to a moderate extent. In all cases the pattern of
perceptions of staff represented differences of degree rather than fundamental
differences.
When the data obtained from the managers were examined, managers
perceptions were that the clubs had adopted the characteristics of a learning
organization to a moderate extent. These results compare favourably with the results
of the Byers study (1999), which found that the perceptions of senior managers in
Australian organizations were that the characteristics of a learning organization
applied to a moderate extent. The perceptions of non-managers were that the
characteristics applied to a minor extent. Statistical analysis of the data indicated that
there were no significant differences between managers and non-managers, with the
differences being in the degree rather than there being any fundamental differences.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enterprising nation</field><field name="subject">learning organisation</field><field name="subject">clubs</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081205.095000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate Governance
in the
Australian Public Service. An examination of success andfailure, with particular reference to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship</field><field name="creator">Tucker, Tony Ralph</field><field name="description">The introduction of New Public Management reforms to the Australian Public Service in the 1980s and 1990s marked a substantial shift away from the traditional process-based public sector model to a market-driven one. These reforms accelerated with the election of the Howard government in 1996, which moved the public sector to become more like the private sector, but failed to address directly the changes needed in accountability and control of the APS. This study explores the evolution of corporate governance as a means of filling that gap in the APS. The ultimate responsibility for ensuring corporate governance is appropriately applied in departments of state rests jointly with the minister and the secretary, in their roles in administering and managing the organisation, and in particular fostering and modelling appropriate organisation citizenship behaviour.
Corporate governance exists In the APS, as in the private sector, as a dichotomy offormal and informal elements, and the informal elements play a paramount role in achieving results for government that are lawful, fair and reasonable; adherence to formal corporate governance processes alone is insufficient to protect an organisation from failure. The example of DIMA was used to demonstrate that even an organisation with a proud international record in assisting the most vulnerable in the world through its refugee and humanitarian programs can fail if its corporate governance mechanisms are not universally and correctly applied throughout the organisation, resulting in outcomes described as "catastrophic" for the individuals concerned.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">public service</field><field name="subject">reform</field><field name="subject">corporate governance</field><field name="subject">Department of Immigration</field><field name="subject">DIAC</field><field name="subject">DIMA</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081209.091200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protein Bound
3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine
as a Signal for Enhanced
Antioxidant Defences</field><field name="creator">Nelson, Michelle Amy</field><field name="description">Protein-bound 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (PB-DOPA), a long-lived, redox-active product of
protein oxidation, is capable of functioning as both a pro- and anti-oxidant. A number of
in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated a toxic, non-toxic or even beneficial effect of
free DOPA, however little investigation has examined the physiological activity of PB-DOPA.
Furthermore, as free DOPA is currently the major treatment available for Parkinson?s disease,
most studies have focused on the effect of DOPA within neurological cells or tissues,
although the presence of PB-DOPA in other locations, for example within atherosclerotic
plaques, suggests that broader research is needed to fully understand the physiological effects
of both free and PB-DOPA.
The hypothesis presented in this thesis is that under physiological conditions, when little
redox active transition metal is available, PB-DOPA can function as a redox signalling
molecule, triggering an enhancement of cellular antioxidant defences, with a potentially
specific role in the regulation of defences targeted against protein oxidation. Physiological
levels of PB-DOPA are very low, however the level on individual proteins can change to a
proportionally large degree during oxidative stress, an appropriate property for a signalling
molecule. In addition, remarkably elevated levels occur in some pathologies, including
atherosclerosis. As an initial and commonly formed product of protein oxidation, PB-DOPA
is well placed for a signalling role, promoting a significant up-regulation of antioxidant
defences in the early stages of oxidative stress, before extensive damage has occurred. As an
initiator of antioxidant defences, PB-DOPA would be potentially useful as a therapeutic for
the treatment of diseases involving oxidative stress or the accumulation of oxidative damage.
The main objective of this thesis was, therefore, to examine the effect of PB-DOPA on the
cellular antioxidant defence system using monocytic and macrophage-like cells, key cells
involved in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. The incorporation of free DOPA into
protein during protein synthesis, a process previously shown to occur both in vitro and in vivo,
was used to generate PB-DOPA. Neither free nor PB-DOPA were found to be toxic to
monocytic or macrophage-like cells in culture, but rather were both capable of protecting
these cells from oxidative stress. Free DOPA was shown to be capable of directly scavenging
radicals, a process that was thought to be in part responsible for the protection induced during
oxidative stress. The presence of free and PB-DOPA up-regulated the activity of catalase and
NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, two enzymatic antioxidants, however the activity of
superoxide dismutase and the concentration of oxidised and reduced glutathione were not
affected. Whilst it was thought that PB-DOPA would have a specific effect on the activity of
antioxidant defences targeted against protein oxidation, proteolysis and bulk chaperone
activity were not affected by a combination of free and PB-DOPA. Oxidatively-induced
protein aggregation, however, was inhibited by the presence of free and PB-DOPA,
suggesting that a more specific chaperone regulation may be taking place.
The regulation of gene and protein expression was thought to be one possible mechanism by
which PB-DOPA could function as a signalling molecule. To test this hypothesis, the effect of
free and PB-DOPA on transcription factor activation and protein expression were investigated.
Free and PB-DOPA did not induce the expression or activation of Nrf2, AP-1 or NFJB, three
transcription factors thought to be involved in the expressional regulation of genes involved in
the antioxidant defence system. However, the expression of a number of proteins, including
antioxidants, chaperones and proteins involved in cell cycle progression, were regulated in
monocytic and macrophage-like cells following the administration of free DOPA under
conditions that resulted in either a high or low level of PB-DOPA generation. The regulated
proteins differed between the two conditions, suggesting that the level of PB-DOPA may be a
key factor in determining the specific defences targeted.
The results presented in this thesis support the hypothesis that PB-DOPA can function as a
signalling molecule, triggering an enhancement of cellular antioxidant defences, with a
specific role in the regulation of the chaperone system, a key defence targeted against protein
oxidation. This thesis may provide the basis for the potential use of free or PB-DOPA as a
therapeutic for diseases known to involve oxidative stress or oxidative damage, however more
research will be required to determine if the effects demonstrated in this thesis are also
capable of occurring in vivo.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">3</field><field name="subject">4-dihydroxyphenylalanine</field><field name="subject">PB-DOPA</field><field name="subject">DOPA</field><field name="subject">antioxidant defences</field><field name="subject">atherosclerosis</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081209.125208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of Cytokines and Chemokines
during Lung Infection with Nontypeable
Haemophilus influenzae</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Jodie Louise</field><field name="description">An animal model of respiratory infection was used to determine the effect of
various factors, thought to influence the ability of the host to clear bacteria, on
the host?s innate response to an NTHi lung infection.
Mucosal immunisation with NTHi has previously been shown to enhance the
clearance of NTHi from the lung in an animal model of infection through the
increased recruitment of phagocytes. Comparisons of cytokine and chemokine
kinetic profiles were made in order to determine differences between innate and
acquired immune response and the way in which mucosal immunisation
controls the innate immune response to NTHi. Increased production of proinflammatory
cytokines and chemokines in the early stages of NTHi lung
infection enhanced the ability to clear bacteria from the rat lung in the immune
animals through the increased recruitment of phagocytes to the site. Mucosal
immunisation was found to alter the cytokine and chemokine mRNA profiles of
CD4+ and CD8+ cells, with increased levels of MCP-1 protein being detected in
both types of immune cells.
An antecedent viral infection has been shown to increase the chance of
developing a respiratory bacterial infection. The NTHi model of respiratory
infection was used to characterise the effect that a viral infection had on the
host response to the host?s innate response to a bacterial infection and the
ability to clear the bacteria. The host?s ability to clear NTHi from the rat lung
was enhanced by an antecedent viral infection through alterations to the innate
immune response and the cytokine and chemokine kinetic profiles.
The use of a mutant strain of NTHi deficient in a component of
Lipooligosaccharide (LOS), Phosphorylcholine (ChoP), was utilised as a tool to
characterise the innate immune response to LOS. Animals challenged with the
LOS mutant strain had a reduced inflammatory response to NTHi through the
decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the
reduced recruitment of phagocytes to the site of infection.
This thesis has contributed valuable information to enable a better
understanding of the host?s innate immune response to respiratory infection.
This study has identified the role of cytokines and chemokines in the innate
response to a respiratory bacterial infection and the enhanced ability of the host
to clear NTHi from the lung.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">respiratory infection</field><field name="subject">Lung</field><field name="subject">Cytokines</field><field name="subject">Chemokines</field><field name="subject">immune response</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081210.084252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is tourism education meeting the needs of the tourism industry?
An Australian case study</field><field name="creator">Wang, Jie</field><field name="description">Despite the rapid growth in the provision of tourism higher education in the past 40 years,
uncertainties remain about the content and nature of tourism degrees and how these are
aligned with the needs of the tourism industry. Some research has been done on tourism
higher education curriculum design, but the extent to which tourism higher education meets
industry needs has not yet been closely investigated. This study aims to ascertain whether a
gap exists between what education institutions provide in their undergraduate curricula in the
way of tourism knowledge and skills sets, and what knowledge and skills sets are required by
the tourism industry.
A conceptual framework was developed to outline the research process, which involved two
steps. First, content analysis of tourism curricula was conducted as the preliminary research.
A list of 34 subject areas was synthesised from all core subjects offered in tourism courses in
a sample of Australian universities according to subjects? titles, themes and detailed
descriptions. A list of 27 skills and abilities was identified by collating university generic
skills and tourism discipline attributes from these institutions. Based on the study of tourism
curricula, two web-based surveys were then designed and distributed in order to investigate
the respective perceptions of industry professionals and academic providers on the subjects
and skills sets necessary for tourism employment.
In analysing the data, perceptions about the subjects and skills sets were compared between
tourism industry professionals and academic providers. Importance- performance analysis,
gap analysis, and SPSS statistical tools were applied to analyse this data.
The study found considerable variance between the views of industry professionals and
academic providers in Australia. Their views vary firstly on the relative value of tertiary
degrees for tourism professionals; secondly, on the relative merits of skills and abilities
needed to work in the tourism sector; and thirdly, on the relative merits of various subjects
taught at university. These findings establish the existence of a gap between the existing
tourism curriculum at university level, and the needs of the tourism industry. The findings of
this study also provide evidence to suggest that tourism higher education provision should not
be isolated from real practice and that those involved in curriculum design should work
closely with industry representatives to ensure a strong connection between theory and
practice, thus improving the likelihood that graduates of tourism higher education courses will
graduate with knowledge and skills sets which are closely aligned with the needs and
expectations of the tourism industry</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">university degree</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">case study</field><field name="subject">tourism industry</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081211.112039</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biliteracy in English and Korean:
A Case Study of Writing Development
during Primary Years</field><field name="creator">Ko, Bo-Ai</field><field name="description">In the era of globalization, growing numbers of children are living in situations where the language of their formal schooling is different from that of the everyday communication in their family. In such a bilingual context, this study documents biliteracy development of two Korean background children growing up in Australia. The children?s written texts (both in English and Korean) were collected over the period of 5 years 8 months (from preschool through primary school) both in home and school contexts, and analyzed using the Systemic Functional Grammar as well as genre and register theory. Throughout the researcher?s regular classroom observation and participation in their school?s literacy activities as well as in the home context, a detailed documentation of the children?s socio-linguistic environment is also provided as an important part of this longitudinal case study?s data collection and analysis.
Over the period, the children?s writing in both English and Korean developed quite significantly in terms of their control of the register in text. With the introduction of Genre-based Approach in their school, they had opportunities in learning to write a range of genres such as Narrative, Report, Explanation, Argument and Procedure in English to meet the expectations of the mainstream curriculum. The children?s writing in Korean was mainly developing to satisfy their personal and interpersonal communication needs, largely through diary writing, E-mails and personal letters to extended family. Their developmental patterns of writing different genres as well as their control of written language have been examined largely through the analysis of the system of Transitivity, the use of nominal groups, Theme choice and Mood system. The similarity and difference in literacy practices between the two children (the brother and the sister) are also discussed.
As the key to the two ESL background children?s successful biliteracy development throughout their primary schooling period, this case study emphasizes the importance of the supportive parents? role through mother tongue maintenance and an effective literacy program, such as Genre-based Approach, which provides practical guidance for developing written language 
through learning a range of genres with different social functions and purposes. The literacies in English and Korean have been found to be mutually supportive and thus it is argued that the whole biliteracy development in this case study has an enhancing effect on the children?s academic achievement in their Australian schooling. Simultaneously, with their continuous biliteracy development, the children were able to enjoy being part of a caring Korean-speaking family and community. Moreover, this whole process of biliteracy development certainly provided the two ESL children with a positive self-concept and socio-cultural identity as a balanced proud bilingual. In this regard, it is argued that the successful outcome of this case study of the ESL children?s bilieracy development can be identified as a case of an ?empowering? additive bilingualism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Korea</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Korean language</field><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">biliteracy</field><field name="subject">bilingual</field><field name="subject">ESL</field><field name="subject">systemic functional grammar</field><field name="subject">childhood</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081215.150126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A southern hemisphere search for ultra-high-energy gamma ray sources</field><field name="creator">Ciampa, Dominic.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 138-153.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Gamma ray sources</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phc565.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:6339652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mining in national parks : a case study--An integrated environmental evaluation of possible magnesite mining in Weetootla Gorge within the Gammon Ranges National Park, South Australia</field><field name="creator">Stoll, J.

REPORT MAKING TO THEIR PROGRAMS AND

Training since 1981. Regular classroom teachers are responsible for implementing this policy
at the classroom level. In order to achieve this, teachers need to make informed decisions
about aspects of the class program and practice that may need to be adapted or modified to
provide opportunities for integrated students to participate meaningfully in regular classroom
environments.
The purpose of this study is twofold: to extend research into adaptations made by New South
Wales teachers under a policy of integration by surveying teachers' perceptions on various
adaptations/modifications and to explore factors related to teachers? implementation of these
adaptations/modifications to programs and practices for students with mild disabilities and/or
learning difficulties. Researchers have studied integration (variously named and interpreted)
since the eighties and the current research is based on a body of research conducted over the
last twenty-five years. The current research identified the frequency of different types of
adaptations/modifications used by regular classroom teachers. An attempt is made to identify
various barriers and isolate particular factors that may influence the use of these
adaptations/modifications in regular classrooms.
Results indicated that teachers reported using different adaptations and modifications to
varying degrees. Teachers indicated that they held a preference for adaptations and
modifications that could easily be implemented for all students in the class. Teachers reported
that barriers such as: 'Lack of preparation and planning time'; 'Demands on instruction time';
and 'Inadequate staff ratios' have the greatest affect on their implementation of adaptations
and modifications. The level of qualifications held by the teachers was the only factor that
had a significant correspondence to the frequency of adaptations and modifications
implemented for students with mild disabilities and learning difficulties. Further research is
recommended to investigate across a larger area of population, the type and level of
disabilities experienced by the students and the influence of teachers? choice on frequency of
adaptations and modifications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Classroom management</field><field name="subject">Children with disabilities</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Inclusive education</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081216.113453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investment in Being Human

YEAR 9 STUDENT EXHIBITIONS
AN ACT CASE STUDY</field><field name="creator">McKenzie, Anna</field><field name="description">ACT Year 9 Exhibitions Program aligns curriculum, pedagogy and assessment
in the design and implementation of rich learning tasks, which are focussed on transdisciplinary,
problem-based, community-centred issues. It provides an authentic
assessment model through a panel assessment process of demonstrated student
achievement.
This case study research examines the uptake of an Exhibitions approach in three
ACT high schools. It discovers, through their own telling, what inspires commitment
by participants to the program and the ways that they measure success. The study
draws on a rich data set of narrative inquiry and semi-structured interviews with
teachers and students from the case study schools.
Analysis of the 'lived experiences' of the participants indicates that how individuals
profit by the program is determined by five critical factors which are realized
differently for them. Further, for the Year 9 Student Exhibitions Program to succeed
in meeting its goals of providing for teacher renewal and improved student learning
outcomes, and of promoting high school reform, certain conditions must prevail.
These conditions converge around the support afforded teachers to build their
capacity for curriculum and pedagogical change, and the opportunities for
engagement and agency of both teachers and students in the design of the
Exhibition task and its implementation.
This study investigates the realities of implementing change in schools and its
findings augment what theorists would predict for school change. It indicates that the
extent to which Exhibitions can drive a wedge into the 'business-as-usual' approach
of the ACT's more traditional high schools, and provide an alternative view of what it
means to educate for the 21st century, depends ultimately upon the human and
structural conditions created in the school, and the authenticity of the approach to
uptake. This study contains important recommendations for government and
education systems alike as they pursue school change.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">high school</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">curriculum change</field><field name="subject">case study</field><field name="subject">exhibition project</field><field name="subject">educational methods</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081216.140527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE EVOLUTION OF GENOMIC IMPRINTING AND
X CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION IN MAMMALS</field><field name="creator">Hore, Timothy Alexander</field><field name="description">Genomic imprinting is responsible for monoallelic gene expression that depends on the sex of the parent from which the alleles (one active, one silent) were inherited. X-chromosome inactivation is also a form of monoallelic gene expression. One of the two X chromosomes is transcriptionally silenced in the somatic cells of females, effectively equalising gene dosage with males who have only one X chromosome that is not complemented by a gene poor Y chromosome. X chromosome inactivation is random in eutherian mammals, but imprinted in marsupials, and in the extraembryonic membranes of some placentals. Imprinting and X inactivation have been studied in great detail in placental mammals (particularly humans and mice), and appear to occur also in marsupial mammals. However, both phenomena appear to have evolved specifically in mammals, since there is no evidence of imprinting or X inactivation in non-mammalian vertebrates, which do not show parent of origin effects and possess different sex chromosomes and dosage compensation mechanisms to mammals.&#182; 

In order to understand how imprinting and X inactivation evolved, I have focused on the mammals most distantly related to human and mouse. I compared the sequence, location and expression of genes from major imprinted domains, and genes that regulate genomic imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation in the three extant mammalian groups and other vertebrates. Specifically, I studied the evolution of an autosomal region that is imprinted in humans and mouse, the evolution of the X-linked region thought to control X inactivation, and the evolution of the genes thought to establish and control differential expression of various imprinted loci. This thesis is presented as a collection of research papers that examines each of these topics, and a review and discussion that synthesizes my findings.&#182; 

The first paper reports a study of the imprinted locus responsible for the human Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes (PWS and AS). A search for kangaroo and platypus orthologues of PWS-AS genes  identified only the putative AS gene UBE3A, and showed it was in a completely different genomic context to that of humans and mice. The only PWS gene found in marsupials (SNRPN) was located in tandem with its ancient paralogue SNRPB, on a different chromosome to UBE3A. Monotremes apparently have no orthologue of SNRPN.  The several intronless genes of the PWS-AS domain also have no orthologues in marsupials or monotremes or non-mammal vertebrates, but all have close paralogues scattered about the genome from which they evidently retrotransposed. UBE3A in marsupials and monotremes, and SNRPN in marsupials were found to be expressed from both alleles, so are not imprinted. Thus, the PWA-AS imprinted domain was assembled from many non-imprinted components relatively recently, demonstrating that the evolution of imprinting has been an ongoing process during mammalian radiation.&#182; 

In the second paper, I examine the evolution of the X-inactivation centre, the key regulatory region responsible for X-chromosome inactivation in humans and mice, which is imprinted in mouse extraembryonic membranes. By sequencing and aligning flanking regions across the three mammal groups and non-mammal vertebrates, I discovered that the region homologous to the X-inactivation centre, though intact in birds and frogs, was disrupted independently in marsupial and monotreme mammals. I showed that the key regulatory RNA of this locus (X-inactive specific transcript or XIST) is absent, explaining why a decade-long search for marsupial XIST was unsuccessful. Thus, XIST is eutherian-specific and is therefore not a basic requirement for X-chromosome inactivation in all mammals.&#182; 

The broader significance of the findings reported in these two papers is explored with respect to other current work regarding the evolution and construction of imprinted loci in mammals in the form of a review.  This comparison enabled me to conclude that like the PWS-AS domain and the X-inactivation centre, many domains show unexpected construction from disparate genomic elements that correlate with their acquisition of imprinting.&#182; 

The fourth and last paper examines the evolution of CCCTC-binding Factor (CTCF) and its parologue Brother Of Regulator of Imprinted Sites (BORIS) which contribute to the establishment and interpretation of genomic imprinting at the Insulin-Like Growth Factor 2/H19 locus. In this paper I show that the duplication of CTCF giving rise to BORIS occurred much earlier than previously recognised, and demonstrate that a major change in BORIS expression (restriction to the germline) occurred in concert with the evolution of genomic imprinting. The papers that form the bulk of this thesis show that the evolution of epigenetic traits such as genomic imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation is labile and has apparently responded rapidly to different selective pressures during the independent evolution of the three mammal groups. I have introduced these papers, and discussed them generally in terms of current theories of how and why these forms of monoallelic expression have evolved in mammals.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genomic imprinting</field><field name="subject">X-chromosome inactivation</field><field name="subject">eutherians</field><field name="subject">marsupials</field><field name="subject">monotremes</field><field name="subject">parental conflict</field><field name="subject">evolution</field><field name="subject">epigentics</field><field name="subject">comparative genomics</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20081216.152553</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating art or vexing nature? : ethics and the manipulation of nature, a critical study of arguments from Nature</field><field name="creator">Kirkham, Georgina Katharine</field><field name="description">This dissertation comprises a series of five separate papers, arranged as chapters, linked thematically and also in their conclusions. The thematic connection between the chapters is that, in each, I investigate some aspect, either historical or contemporary, of how moral limits have been, or might be, applied to the human manipulation of nature through technology. More specifically, I explore how the concept of naturalness has been, and still is, employed in ethical arguments that seek to place limits upon or defend the use of various technologies. In each chapter, I argue that arguments which appeal to nature or naturalness as a normative concept make proper sense only when understood from the perspective of virtue ethics. The conclusions of each chapter are connected, and connected to the conclusions of the dissertation as a whole: firstly, that what I call 'arguments from nature', as they are used in debates about the moral limitations on the use of technology, are defensible only from within a virtue ethics framework; secondly, that such arguments have an important, although limited, role in such debates; and, finally, that virtue ethics more broadly can inform debates about the ethics of technology and the environment. In the first two chapters, by comparing contemporary debates over the ethics of technological manipulation of nature with historical debates over the proper relationship between art and nature, I demonstrate that virtue ethics have played, and still do play, a significant role in our ethical understanding of our relationship with the non-human world. I argue that the ethical issues that arise from our relationship with the non-human world, in response to advances in technology and to problems with the environment, indicate the need for an understanding of ethics that goes further than the mere consideration of rights and utility. In chapters three and four, I argue that virtue ethical theory provides the most promising understanding of the argument from nature as it is applied in attempts to place limits on the human manipulation of nature. In the final chapter, I explore what a modern environmental or technological virtue or vice might be. I explain and defend the environmental and technological virtue of 'living in place' and, in doing so, bring together and validate the claims made in previous chapters that the appeal to human nature does have a role as a normative guide for our ethical evaluations of how we should live and, more generally, that virtue ethical theory can be of guiding and foundational significance in an overarching ethics of the environment and technology.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental ethics</field><field name="subject">Ethics</field><field name="subject">Nature -- Moral and ethical aspects</field><field name="subject">Philosophy of nature</field><field name="subject">Virtue</field><field name="subject">Environmental virtue ethics</field><field name="subject">Biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Alchemy</field><field name="subject">Argument for nature</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0163</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of marketing control and a resource-based view (RBV) on export performance of SMEs in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Theingi</field><field name="description">For the past three decades, export manufacturing has played an important role in Thailand's economic success. Among the exporters, the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have increasingly taken part. As a result, export performance at both micro and macro level has become of interest to academics, exporting firms, intermediaries and Thai government policy makers. Thus, extensive studies concerning determinants of export performance are reported in literature on export marketing. However, despite the significance of resources in implementing marketing strategies and performance, the Resource-Based View (RBV) has not been explicitly and fully explored in this literature. Moreover, the vital role of intermediary resources in export performance has been also largely ignored. Hence, the applicability of RBV should be examined to investigate the effects of firm resources and export intermediary resources on export performance. Similarly, marketing control, in spite of its importance, used by manufacturing exporters in relation to their intermediaries, has not been substantially explored. The availability of firm and export intermediary resources provides flexibility for manufacturing exporters in maintaining marketing control over their intermediaries, which in turn, influences export performance. Hence, the aim of the study is to investigate the applicability of RBV and marketing control theory in determining export performance. Moreover, in the export marketing literature, there are very few studies in developing countries, particularly in Southeast Asia: this study, therefore focusses on export performance of SMEs in an export-driven, developing economy, Thailand. During the course of its investigation, this study used the 'drop-in questionnaire' method of delivering and collecting the questionnaires in person with the purpose of enhancing responses from export managers. With respect to their individual export ventures, they were asked to provide answers regarding the availability of firm resources, their perception of the availability of export intermediary resources, and the use of marketing control mechanisms on export intermediaries. Preliminary data analysis used Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and was followed by the development of a structural model, which was then tested with AMOS 4.0 Package. ix The results from the above analyses substantiate the empirical link between resources, firm and export intermediary resources, and strategic export performance, and also between the availability of resources and the use of marketing controls. The findings show that production and marketing capabilities (firm resources) and good relationships and cooperation with exporters (export intermediary resources) have an important direct effect on export performance. Hence, the study confirms the applicability of RBV in export literature. The results also indicate that firm's marketing capabilities, export intermediary's relationship and cooperation, and knowledge and experience, influence the use of marketing control, thereby supporting the hypotheses that the availability of firm and export intermediary resources facilitates the use of marketing control.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exports -- Thailand</field><field name="subject">Small business -- Thailand -- Marketing</field><field name="subject">Marketing control</field><field name="subject">Resource-based view</field><field name="subject">Export performance</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of piezocone data for displacement pile design</field><field name="creator">Schneider, James A</field><field name="description">Due to the similarity between the geometry and full displacement installation method of a cone penetrometer and displacement pile, the axial capacity of displacement piles is often assessed using data from a cone penetration test (CPT). As there are many more factors influencing pile axial capacity than affecting CPT cone resistance, there are a wide range of CPT-based empirical design methods in use. These methods have various levels of predictive success, which usually depends upon the soil conditions, pile geometry, pile installation method, and time between installations and loading. An improved understanding of the basis and reliability of respective design methods is essential to improve the quality of predictions in the absence of site specific load test data. This thesis explores the influence of soil state and drainage conditions on piezocone penetration test (CPTU) tip resistance (qc) and penetration pore pressures (u2). For cone penetration testing identified as 'drained', factors influencing the correlation between cone tip resistance and displacement pile shaft friction in sand are investigated through (i) a review of previous research and the performance of existing design methods; (ii) centrifuge studies of piles of differing widths with measurements of local lateral stress; (iii) field tension tests at different times between installation and loading for uninstrumented driven piles with different diameters and end conditions; and (iv) field tension tests at different times between installation and loading on closed ended strain gauged jacked segmented model piles with different installation sequences. CPTU qc and u2 are primarily controlled by soil state and drainage conditions, with effective stress strength parameters and soil stiffness also influencing the measurements. The primary mechanisms identified to control the correlation between cone tip resistance and shaft friction on displacement piles are identified as; (i) the initial increase in radial stress due to soil displaced during installation of a pile; (ii) different levels of soil displacement induced by open, closed, and partially plugged piles; (iii) reduction in radial stress behind the pile tip; (iv) additional reduction in radial stress with continued pile penetration (friction fatigue); (v) changes in radial stress during loading; (vi) constant volume interface friction angle between soil and steel; and (vii) changes in the effects of the above mentioned mechanisms with time between installation and loading. The relative effect of each of these factors is investigated in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Axial loads</field><field name="subject">Piling (Civil engineering)</field><field name="subject">Soil mechanics</field><field name="subject">Soil penetration test</field><field name="subject">Soils -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Foundation design</field><field name="subject">Geotechnical engineering</field><field name="subject">In situ testing</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evasion in Australia's parliamentary question time : the case of the Iraq war</field><field name="creator">Rasiah, Parameswary</field><field name="description">Given that the basic functions of parliamentary Question Time are to provide information and to hold the Government accountable for its actions, the possibility of evasion occurring in such a context is of crucial importance. Evasion (equivocation) has been identified as a matter of concern in political interviews, but no systematic study has been undertaken in the context of parliamentary discourse, notably Question Time, anywhere in the world. This study applies and adapts Harris's (1991) coding framework on various types of responses, Bull and Mayer's (1993) typology of non-replies and Clayman's (2001) work on how politicians 'resist' answering questions, all of which are based on political news interviews, to the study of evasion in Australia's House of Representatives' Question Time. A comprehensive, unified framework for the analysis of evasion is described, a decision flow-chart for the framework is provided, and an illustrative example of the applied framework is given based on Australia's Federal House of Representatives' Question Time. Put simply, the study was undertaken to determine if evasion occurred, how frequently it occurred and how it occurred. It involved the classification of responses as 'answers' (direct or indirect), 'intermediate responses' (such as pointing out incorrect information in the question), and 'evasions' based on specific criteria. Responses which were considered evasions were further analysed to determine the levels of evasion, whether they were covert or overt in nature and the types of 'agenda shifts' that occurred, if any. The thesis also involved a discourse-analytical study of other factors that appear to facilitate Ministerial evasion in Australia's House of Representatives, including the Speaker's performance and the use of 'Dorothy Dixers'. The research data was sourced from Question Time transcripts from the House of Representatives Hansard for the months of February and March 2003, dealing only with questions and responses on the topic of Iraq. In those months there were 87 questions on the topic of Iraq, representing more than two thirds of all questions on Iraq for the whole of 2003. Of these 87 questions, the majority (48) came from the Opposition party, through its leader. The balance (39) was asked by Government MPs. Analysis of the question/answer discourse for all 87 questions revealed that every question asked by Government members was answered compared to only 8 of the 48 Opposition questions. Of the 40 remaining Opposition questions, 21 were given intermediate responses and 19 were evaded outright. The fact that the overwhelming majority (83%) of Opposition questions were not answered together with other findings such as instances of partiality on the part of the Speaker; the use of 'friendly', prearranged questions by Government MPs; and the 'hostile' nature of questions asked by Opposition MPs casts serious doubt on the effectiveness of Question Time as a means of ensuring the Government is held accountable for its actions. The study provides empirical evidence that evasion does occur in Australia's House of Representatives' Question Time.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia. -- Parliament. -- House of Representatives -- Freedom of debate</field><field name="subject">Australia. -- Parliament. -- House of Representatives -- Rules and practice</field><field name="subject">Ambiguity</field><field name="subject">Politicians -- Australia -- Interviews</field><field name="subject">Parliamentary discourse</field><field name="subject">Evasion</field><field name="subject">Question time</field><field name="subject">Political discourse</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Music education in the knowledge-based economy of Singapore : designing a music curriculum framework for neighbourhood secondary schools</field><field name="creator">Tan, Penny Peng Leng</field><field name="description">Education in Singapore is seen as a key instrument to equip the next generation with resources to meet the needs of a Knowledge-Based Economy in a globalize world. The goal of this study is to develop a Music Education Curriculum Framework consistent with a Knowledge-Based Economy (KMCF) for Singapore neighborhood secondary schools. It provides the general context of music education in Singapore and conducts research to reveal the perspectives of key cross-sector stakeholders in music education, namely: The Ministry of Education (MOE) music and curriculum planning and development officers, National Institute of Education music academics, principals, general classroom music teachers and over 600 students. The curriculum framework will focus on the desirable qualities of Knowledge-Based Economy (KBE), particularly creativity, innovation, risk-taking, entrepreneurship and lifelong learning which have been strongly emphasized by the Singaporean government. In the light of their vision of thinking Schools, Learning Nation, the Ministry of Education is repositioning and reorienting the education system by implementing numerous initiatives and policies. The intention is to foster flexibility and diversity in a broad-based and holistic education, but the main focus to date has been on information technology, problem-solving and core subjects rather than on the creative aspects of the arts. By surveying students, this research aims to find out to what extent students find their music lessons satisfactory and whether their perspectives is compatible with those of other stakeholders. Students generally do not take music seriously, and the public perception is that a music career is limited to performing and teaching. The model curriculum framework will indicate further related careers, and the personal growth that comes through a genuine engagement with music. The Ministry of Education controls the school curriculum, structure of education, examinations, teacher qualifications and conditions of service. In 2005 it initiated a Teach Less, Learn More initiative which promoted student engagement. However, despite the rhetoric of classroom-based, teacher-owned and school-driven learning, it did not consult teachers or students and therefore failed as a vital learning organization which involved all participants in deciding future directions. For Senge (1994, p.13), a learning organization is a place where people are continually discovering how they create their reality. The curriculum design is an example of an example of an open system which this thesis addresses the issue of providing a structured programme flexible enough to adapt to contextual needs while providing the standards and outcomes needed in a competitive knowledge-based economy. This thesis makes its original contribution to knowledge by applying an open system model from organisational theory to a conventional music curriculum.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High schools -- Curricula -- Singapore</field><field name="subject">Knowledge management -- Singapore</field><field name="subject">Music -- Instruction and study (Secondary) -- Singapore</field><field name="subject">School music -- Instruction and study -- Singapore</field><field name="subject">Music education</field><field name="subject">Knowledge based economy</field><field name="subject">Curriculum framework</field><field name="subject">Singapore secondary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predictors of cognitive decline in those with subjective memory complaint</field><field name="creator">Clarnette, Roger M</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Background: Dementia, largely due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), is a major public health problem. The early identification of disease is an important challenge for clinicians because treatment of AD is now available. A simple and accurate means of stratifying risk for AD and identifying early disease is needed so that risk factor modification and treatment can occur optimally. To date, despite many attempts, an accurate means of standardising an approach to the assessment of subtle cognitive symptoms has not been developed. A subjective complaint of poor memory has been identified as a possible marker for underlying brain disease. This study examines the utility of neuropsychological scores, homocysteine levels, APOE genotyping and brain imaging as predictors of cognitive decline in individuals with subjective memory complaint (SMC). Method Eighty subjects with SMC were recruited from memory clinics and the community (MC: 1). Forty-two control subjects were also examined (MC: 0). CAMDEX was used to describe baseline clinical features. The CAMCOG was used as a global test of cognition and was administered annually for four years. At baseline, neuropsychological testing was administered. Cranial CT scanning, measurement of plasma homocysteine and APOE genotyping were completed. Categorical variables were analysed using chi-square according to Pearson's method. Continuous data was analysed using Student's t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests. A logistic regression model was used to identify independent contributors to the presence of memory complaint. Participants were then matched for age, gender and time to follow-up (up for three years) to determine longitudinal predictors of cognitive decline. ... Baseline CAMCOG scores were greater in the control group (MC:0 = 98.3 ? 2.8, MC:1 94.2 ? 5.5, Z ?4.46, p 0.000). There were no differences in neuropsychological scores, concentration of total plasma homocysteine, APOE genotype or brain scan measurements. Using the Wald stepwise selection method, logistic regression could not be established due to non-convergence regardless of whether or not the continuous variables were re-coded into dichotomous variables. A matching process that created 32 pairs of controls/subjects allowed follow-up analysis. The controls showed significant improvement with time on the CAMCOG unlike subjects (mean ? SD, controls 1.5 ?-3.0, Z - 2.61, p 0.01, subjects 0.2 ? 3.2, Z ? 0.24, p 0.81). The logistic regression analysis showed that group membership could not be defined by any single independent variable. When group membership was abandoned and those with stable scores were compared to those who declined no clear meaningful independent predictors of decline apart from age were identified. Conclusions: Methodological issues such as small sample size and inadequate follow up duration were identified that may have precluded identification of predictive factors for cognitive decline. The results indicate that complaints of memory problems are not associated with established risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and fail to predict objective cognitive decline over three years. Future studies should continue trying to identify robust predictors of cognitive decline in later life.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Cognition disorders -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Dementia -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Memory disorders -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Neuropsychology</field><field name="subject">Presenile dementia</field><field name="subject">Cognitive decline</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aktionsart coercion</field><field name="creator">Barber, Nicole</field><field name="description">This study aimed to investigate English Aktionsart coercion, particularly novel coercion, through corpora-based research. Novel coercions are those which need some contextual support in order to make sense of or be grammatical. Due to the nature of the data, a necessary part of the study was the design of a program to help in the process of tagging corpora for Aktionsart. This thesis starts with a discussion of five commonly accepted Aktionsarten: state, activity, achievement, accomplishment, and semelfactive. One significant contribution of the thesis is that it offers a comprehensive review and discussion of various theories that have been proposed to account for Aktionsart or aspectual coercion, as there is no such synthesis available in the literature. Thus the thesis moves on to a review of many of the more prominent works in the area of Aktionsart coercion, including Moens and Steedman (1988), Pustejovsky (1995), and De Swart (1998). I also present a few theories drawn from less prominent studies by authors in the area who have different or interesting views on the topic, such as Bickel (1997), Krifka (1998), and Xiao and McEnery (2004). In order to study the Aktionsart coercion of verbs in large corpora, examples of Aktionsart coercion needed to be collected. I aimed to design a computer program that could ideally perform a large portion of this task automatically. I present the methods I used in designing the program, as well as the process involved in using it to collect data. Some major steps in my research were the tagging of corpora, counting of coercion 3 frequency by type, and the selection of representative examples of different types of coercion for analysis and discussion. All of the examples collected from the corpora, both by my Aktionsart-tagging program and manually, were conventional coercions. As such there was no opportunity for an analysis of novel coercions. I nevertheless discuss the examples of conventional coercion that I gathered from the corpora analysis, with particular reference to Moens and Steedman&#146;s (1988) theory. Three dominant types of coercion were identified in the data: from activities into accomplishments, activities into states, and accomplishments into states. There were two main ways coercions taking place in the data: from activity to accomplishment through the addition of an endpoint, and from various Aktionsarten into state by coercing the event into being a property of someone/something. Many of the Aktionsart coercion theories are supported at least in part by the data found in natural language. One of the most prominent coercions that is underrepresented in the data is from achievement to accomplishment through the addition of a preparatory process. I conclude that while there are reasons for analysing Aktionsart at verb phrase or sentence level, this does not mean the possibility of analyses at the lexical level should be ignored.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Semantics -- Data processing</field><field name="subject">Grammar, Comparative and general -- Aspect</field><field name="subject">Aktionsart</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages and habitat types in nearshore marine and estuarine waters along the lower west coast of Australia</field><field name="creator">M.Wildsmith@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The following four broad aims were addressed in this study. (1) To ascertain whether the characteristics of the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages within the different nearshore marine habitat types identified by Valesini et al. (2003) on the lower west coast of Australia differ significantly, and whether the pattern of those spatial differences matches those among the environmental characteristics that were used to distinguish those habitat types; (2) To develop a quantitative approach for classifying nearshore habitats in estuarine waters that employs readily-available data for a range of enduring environmental characteristics, and to use that approach to classify the various habitat types present in nearshore waters of the Swan-Canning Estuary on the lower west coast of Australia; (3) To test the hypothesis that the characteristics of the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in the in the Swan-Canning Estuary differ significantly among nearshore habitat types, and that the pattern of those differences matches that among the environmental characteristics used to distinguish those habitat types and (4) To test the hypothesis that, as a result of environmental changes in the Swan-Canning Estuary, the characteristics of the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages at various habitats in this estuary in 1986/7 differ from those in 2003/4.

To address the first aim, benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled seasonally for one year in the subtidal waters and intertidal zone (upper and lower swash zones) at the six nearshore habitat types that were identified by Valesini et al. (2003) on the lower west coast of Australia. The habitat types, which differed mainly in the extent of their exposure to wave activity and whether seagrass and/or nearshore reefs were present, had been distinguished quantitatively using values for a suite of seven statistically-selected enduring environmental characteristics. The faunal samples yielded a total of 121 species representing eight phyla, among which the Polychaeta, Malacostraca and Bivalvia were the most speciose classes and contributed ~ 38, 23 and 10%, respectively, to the total number of individuals. The total number of species and mean density of macroinvertebrates was far greater at the most protected habitat type (1), which also contained dense beds of seagrass, than at any other habitat type, i.e. 70 species and 209.2 individuals 0.1 m-2, compared to 32 species and 36.9 individuals 0.1 m-2 at the most exposed habitat type (6), which had a substrate comprised only of sand. Differences among habitat type influenced the benthic macroinvertebrate species composition to a greater extent than differences among either zones or seasons. Significantly different faunal compositions were detected among those latter two factors only at the most protected habitat type. The faunal assemblage at habitat type 1 was clearly the most distinct from those at the other five habitat types, particularly in the subtidal zone (R-statistics=0.642-0.831, p=0.1%), and was typified by five abundant polychaete species that were adapted to deposit-feeding. In contrast, the fauna at habitat type 6 was typified by four crustacean species and a species of bivalve and polychaete, whose mobility and tough external surface facilitated their survival and feeding in those turbulent waters. The extents of the differences in species composition among the six habitat types was significantly matched with that among the suite of enduring environmental characteristics that distinguished those habitat types, particularly in the case of the subtidal zone (Rho=0.676). Such results indicated that the environmental variables used to distinguish the nearshore habitat types could be used to reliably predict the types of benthic macroinvertebrate species likely to occur at any site along the lower west coast of Australia.
The above biological validation of the nearshore marine habitat classification scheme developed by Valesini et al. (2003) provided the justification for the approach to the second broad aim of this study, namely to develop a quantitative scheme for classifying habitat types in the Swan-Canning Estuary. This approach was similar to that employed by Valesini et al. (2003) in that it considers that differences among habitat types are well reflected by differences in a suite of enduring environmental variables. However, it improves on that earlier method by employing a completely objective and quantitative approach. 

Thus, a large number of environmentally-diverse nearshore sites (102) were initially selected throughout the Swan-Canning Estuary and a suite of 13 enduring environmental variables quantified at each using remotely-sensed images of the estuary in a Geographic Information System. Such variables were chosen to reflect either (i) the type of substrate and submerged vegetation present, (ii) the extent of exposure to wave action or (iii) the location of the site within the estuary with respect to its vicinity to marine and fresh water sources. These data were then subjected to the CLUSTER routine and associated SIMPROF procedure in the PRIMER v6 multivariate statistical package to quantitatively identify those groups of sites that did not differ significantly in their environmental characteristics, and thus represented habitat types. Eighteen habitat types were identified, which were shown to well reflect spatial differences in a suite of non-enduring water quality and sediment characteristics that were measured in situ at a range of estuarine sites during both summer and winter in 2005 (Rho=0.683 and 0.740, respectively, p=0.1%). However, those latter environmental characteristics required far more time in the field and laboratory to quantify than the enduring variables used to identify the habitat types.

Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled during summer and winter in 2005 in the shallow subtidal regions (~1 m depth) at sites representing eight of the habitat types identified in the Swan-Canning Estuary. These samples contained a total of 51 and 36 species during summer and winter, respectively, and, in both seasons, represented nine phyla, namely Annelida, Crustacea, Mollusca, Sipuncula, Nematoda, Platyhelminthes, Cnidaria, Uniramia and Nemertea. The compositions of the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages differed significantly among habitat types and, to a similar extent, between seasons (Global R-statistic=0.408 and 0.409, respectively, p=0.1%). However, the spatial differences were considerable greater in winter than in summer (Global R-statistic=0.536 vs 0.280, p=0.1%), presumably due to the greater spatial variation in particular non-enduring in situ environmental characteristics, such as redox depth and salinity. While the number of species, overall density and taxonomic distinctness of benthic macroinvertebrates also differed significantly among habitats, those variables differed to a greater extent between seasons, being greater in winter than in summer. While the measures of taxonomic distinctness tended to be greater at habitat types located in the lower to middle reaches, i.e. habitat types 6, 7, 9, 10, 13 and 18, than the upper reaches i.e. habitat types 1 and 3, the number of species and overall density reflected this trend only during winter. During summer, the mean numbers of species at habitat types 1, 3, 6 and 10 (3.4-6.0) were significantly lower than those at habitat types 7, 13, and 18 (8.8-10.9), whereas the overall density of benthic macroinvertebrates was far greater at habitat type 7 (32260 individuals 0.1 m-2)than at any other habitat type in this season (3135-18552 individuals 0.1 m-2).

Overall, the greatest differences in assemblage composition occurred between those at habitat types 1 and 18 (R-statistic=0.669, p=0.1%), which were located in the uppermost region of the estuary and the lower reaches of the basin, respectively, and differed to the greatest extent in their enduring environmental characteristics. The assemblage at habitat type 1, and also that at habitat type 3, located just downstream, were relatively distinct from those at all other habitat types, particularly during winter (R-statistics=0.666-0.993, p=0.1%). The fauna at the first of these habitat types was relatively depauperate, containing low numbers of species and densities, and was characterised by the polychaetes Leitoscoloplos normalis and Ceratonereis aequisetis and the bivalve Arthritica semen. The assemblage at habitat type 3 was also characterised by those three species and the amphipod Paracorophium minor and the polychaete Boccardiella limnicola. In contrast, the assemblage at habitat type 18 was characterised by a more diverse assemblage, i.e. the polychaetes Capitella capitata, C. aequisetis, L. normalis and Pseudopolydora kempi, the amphipods, Grandidierella propodentata and Corophium minor and the bivalve Sanguinolaria biradiata. The number of species was among the highest at this habitat type during both seasons, which was also reflected in the high taxonomic diversity, and the overall density was the highest in winter and second highest in summer. Despite the above faunal differences, those between assemblages at habitat types 7 and 9, which were both located in the basin of the Swan-Canning Estuary, were similar in magnitude to those that occurred between pairs of habitat types located in two different regions of the estuary. Although both habitat types 7 and 9 were characterised by a similar suite of species, i.e. Oligochaete spp., C. aequisetis, C. capitata, C. minor, G. propodentata, L. normalis, and S. biradiata, the substantial differences in assemblage composition between these habitat types in both summer and winter (R-statistics=0.570 and 0.725, respectively) was due to marked differences in the relative contributions of each of these species.

Significant and strong correlations were shown to exist in both summer and winter between the pattern of differences in the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages among habitat types and that among the enduring environmental characteristics used to identify those habitat types (Rho=0.625 and 0.825, respectively, p=0.1%). Furthermore, these correlations were greater than those obtained between the benthic macroinvertebrate fauna and any combination of the non-enduring environmental characteristics (i.e. water quality and sediment parameters) recorded in situ at each habitat type (Rho=0.508 and 0.824, in summer and winter, respectively, p=o.1%). This demonstrates the greater capacity of surrogate enduring environmental characteristics to account for differences in the range of variables that may influence the distribution of benthic invertebrate fauna. Thus, the lists of characteristic benthic macroinvertebrate taxa produced for each of the eight habitat types studied in the Swan-Canning Estuary provide a reliable benchmark by which to gauge any future changes in those fauna. Moreover, these results indicate that the above habitat classification scheme can be used to reliably predict the types of benthic macroinvertebrate fauna that are likely to occur at any nearshore site of interest in this estuarine system.

The final component of this study showed that the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages at four sites in the middle reaches of the Swan-Canning Estuary in 2003/4 differed significantly from those recorded at the same sites in 1986/7. Such differences were reflected in (1) changes in the relative densities of a suite of ten species that were responsible for distinguishing the faunas in these two periods, (2) the absence of 22 rare species in 2003/4 (i.e. 42% of the number of species recorded in 1986/7), (3) the presence of 17 new species in 2003/4, including an abundant polychaete that is likely to have been introduced and (4) a far greater extent of seasonal variation in the number of species and densities of benthic macroinvertebrates in 2003/4. Such changes are likely to be related to lower sediment oxygen levels in certain seasons in 2003/4, as well as an altered hydrological regime due to increased temperatures and decreased rainfall in that more recent period. The fact that these changes have occurred within the Swan-Canning Estuary highlights the need for effective management tools, such as the habitat classification scheme and associated faunal survey undertaken in this study. Such data will provide a sound basis by which to examine the ways in which fauna vary spatially within the system, and allow for the establishment of comprehensive benchmarks for detecting future changes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marine habitat</field><field name="subject">estuarine habitats</field><field name="subject">habitat classification</field><field name="subject">benthic macroinvertebrates</field><field name="subject">Swan-Canning Estuary</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081029.93910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and characterisation of two haplosporidian parasites of oysters in north Western Australia.</field><field name="creator">dbearham@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">A cryptic haplosporidian parasite was detected infecting rock oysters from the Montebello Islands in north-western Australia using a PCR targeting the parasite&#146;s small ribosomal subunit gene.  The PCR products were cloned and sequenced along with the remaining sections of the parasite&#146;s SSU rRNA gene.  Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence generated indicated a Minchinia species (Haplosporidia). The SSU sequence generated was used to develop two in situ hybridisation assays to visualise the parasite in H/E sections as well as a PCR assay to detect the parasite.  The molecular assays were assessed for specificity and sensitivity and were then used to compare the parasite to previous haplosporidian parasite infections of pearl oysters.  Both assays produced positive results from the infected pearl oysters but not from other closely related haplosporidian species.  An SEM and TEM electron microscopy analysis was performed on spores from both parasite species.  The spores of the pearl oyster parasite had two spore wall filaments wound around the spore originating for a posterior thickening while the spores of the rock oyster parasite were covered in microtubule-like structures.  These data suggests pearl oysters where co-infected with both the Haplosporidium sp. and the Minchinia sp. detected in rock oysters.  No evidence of a posterior thickening could be found on the spores of the rock oyster parasite.  Attempts to detect the parasite at the previous geographic sites of its detection in pearl oysters resulted in detection of the Minchinia species in tropical oysters in the Kimberley region of Western Australia by in-situ hybridisation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parasite</field><field name="subject">parasitology</field><field name="subject">pearling</field><field name="subject">aquaculture</field><field name="subject">bivalve</field><field name="subject">Bonamia</field><field name="subject">In-situ hybridisation</field><field name="subject">ISH</field><field name="subject">diagnostics</field><field name="subject">molecular probes</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081114.120135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Examination of the Psychodynamic Effects on Individuals Using Psalms of Lament Intentionally, in the Form of Ritual Prayer, as a Way of Engaging With Experiences of Personal Distress</field><field name="creator">david.cohen@vose.wa.edu.au</field><field name="description">The Psalter has formed the basis of Judeo-Christian worship since ancient times.  It has served, and continues to serve, individuals and communities of faith as a foundation for communal and personal devotion.  As a devotional tool it is unique in that it provides prayers which address God directly concerning the whole gamut of life experience.  While the Psalms can be examined and analysed as a literary text, they must be used and experienced by people to more fully discover and recognize their power in providing a pathway for expressing life experience.   

The lament psalms are of particular interest in this regard.  There appears to be a reluctance, in some quarters, to employ them as an expression of prayer.  As a result, the lament psalms as a way of engaging with experiences of personal distress, and voicing the reflections and responses such experiences produce, have often been ignored. 

This study suggests that psalms of lament provide a framework for expressing personal distress in the context of prayer.  The framework, identified as a matrix of lament, consists of various modes of articulation characterized as expressing, asserting, investing and imagining constellations.  The study examines what happens when individuals, who have first been made aware of the matrix of lament and its constellations, use lament psalms for prayer.  Praying of lament psalms in this study is embedded in a prescribed process through which participants engage with their experiences of personal distress.  

As a result of such a process any significant psychodynamic changes which may take place can be observed, examined and explored, thereby, highlighting the efficacy of using lament psalms as a form of prayer.  The study achieves this by examining the reflections and responses of selected individuals to see whether the process does in fact facilitate changes in the individual&#146;s levels of distress, sense of personal control over distress and the nature of relationship between the individual and God.  The reflections and responses also provide some indication of how the process might &#145;birth&#146; a fresh perspective on personal distress for those who choose to incorporate these psalms into their journey of faith.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psalter</field><field name="subject">Psalm</field><field name="subject">Psalms</field><field name="subject">lament</field><field name="subject">distress</field><field name="subject">psychodynamic</field><field name="subject">ritual</field><field name="subject">speech act</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081118.153252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermodynamic and related studies of aqueous copper(II) sulfate solutions</field><field name="creator">C.Akilan@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a systematic investigation of the thermodynamic quantities associated with the interaction between Cu2+ and SO42&#150; in aqueous solution.  A variety of techniques including UV-Visible spectrophotometry, Cu(II) ion-selective electrode potentiometry, dielectric relaxation spectroscopy and titration calorimetry have been used.

The values for the  (aq) association constants determined by UV-Vis spectrophotometry in NaClO4 media as a function of ionic strength were in good agreement with published data but were lower than the values obtained from Cu(II) ion -selective electrode potentiometry.  The source of this difference was traced to the presence of solvent-separated ion pairs which are only partially detected by UV-Vis spectrophotometry.  This was shown by a detailed investigation of CuSO4(aq) over a wide range of concentrations using modern broad-band dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS).  This technique revealed the presence of three ion-pair types: double solvent-separated, solvent-shared and contact ion pairs. 

Calorimetric titrations using the log KA values determined by potentiometry, have provided for the first time reliable values for the enthalpy and entropy changes associated with complex formation between Cu2+(aq) and SO42&#150;(aq) system over range of ionic strengths (in NaClO4 media).  These data were fitted to a specific ion interaction model to obtain the standard state value which was in excellent agreement with the values obtained in other studies and from the DRS work in this study.

In addition, investigations have been carried out into the physicochemical properties, (osmotic coefficients, densities, heat capacities, solubilities and viscosities) of ternary mixtures of CuSO4(aq) with Na2SO4(aq) or MgSO4(aq).  The isopiestic measurements (water activities) of the mixtures were in general well described by Zdanovskii&#146;s rule, especially for the mixtures of CuSO4 with MgSO4.  The densities of the ternary mixtures of CuSO4 with MgSO4 were found to follow Young&#146;s rule of mixing but those of CuSO4 with Na2SO4 deviated from linearity.  The solubilities of the salts in their ternary mixtures agree well with literature data and show that the solubility of MgSO4 or CuSO4 decreases with increasing Na2SO4 concentration.  The viscosities of all the ternary mixtures show clear negative departures from 'Young&#146;s rule' type behaviour.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081127.01328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge Management Platform for Promoting Sustainable Energy Technologies in Rural Thai Communities</field><field name="creator">jpayakpate@gmail.com</field><field name="description">Sustainable energy services aim to meet the energy demands and to improve the living standards of rural communities with the utilization of sustainable energy technologies. Such services are becoming increasingly important due to the reduction of traditional energy resources and the ongoing increase in the demands. The demands are mainly due to the growth of population, domestic consumptions and industrial uses. In addition, increasing awareness of issues such as global warming, carbon emission, peak oil and the need for a sustainable environment has kindled keen interests in sustainable energy around the world. Many projects on sustainable energy services have been launched and particularly in developing countries. In most areas, at least one type of sustainable energy resources is available. In the case of Thailand, in additional to resources such as solar and wind, there are other sustainable energy resources in the forms of biomass and waste residue from agricultural products. However, there exist practical problems hindering the success of many sustainable energy projects. Two key reasons are the lack of in depth knowledge regarding the sustainable energy systems among the local users, and the limited budgets for planning, research and development. Therefore, the need to promote better understanding of sustainable energy technologies is necessary in order to gain better utilization of the energy services and acceptance by the community. One possible solution is the use of a Knowledge Management System (KMS). Based on advanced Information and Communication Technology (ICT), the integration of knowledge management and web technologies has enabled KMS to be developed as an effective tool for the sharing, management and dissemination of valuable knowledge on any particular subject. This combination has the potential to promote the knowledge and initiate relevant activities thereby enabling the acquisition and management of diverse types of information and data.  Typical functions and services which could be provided are: checking updated information on sustainable energy resources around a particular area; teaching of sustainable energy systems development and maintenance processes; sharing of best practices and lessons learned&#133;etc. With the availability of the internet, a Web-based KMS will be a valuable channel for the gathering, sharing, extracting and dissemination of knowledge about the sustainable energy services for the Thai communities.  This thesis presents the research and development of a knowledge management (KM) platform for sustainable energy technologies. The system is implemented with web GIS server-side application and it is installed at the School of Renewable Energy Technology, Naresuan University, Phitsanulok, Thailand. To assess the effectiveness of the developed system, surveys in the form of pre-questionnaires and post-questionnaires from the users are used. Such information is used to determine the effectiveness of the system and to measure the improvement of the participants&#146; knowledge on the subject. There are three groups of participants involved in this study: local government administrators, researchers and general users. The overall results of the questionnaires reveal that the participants are satisfied with the performance of the KM platform. The results also indicated that the KM platform provides adequate knowledge on the subject and it has a high level of user friendliness. It was found that the participants&#146; knowledge is also increased and the increase is in proportion to the time they engaged with the KM platform. A linear regression analysis of the researchers and local government administrators has shown that the increment of the participants&#146; knowledge has a linear relationship with the learning period on the KM platform with statistical significance. Findings from this study can be used as a guideline and for further development on improving the local Thai communities&#146; knowledge on sustainable energy technologies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable Energy</field><field name="subject">Knowledge Management</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Rural Communities</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081203.115333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge Management Strategic Alignment in the Banking Sector at the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Countries</field><field name="creator">jaflah@itc.uob.bh</field><field name="description">An alignment or &#147;fit&#148; between an organization&#146;s objectives and knowledge management (KM) practices should be established in order for the organization to fully utilize its knowledge assets and to derive competitive advantages. The organization should deploy a holistic approach for KM that spans business strategy, information system (IS) strategy, organization culture, and human factors. This research has investigated the strategic alignment between knowledge strategy and business strategy - KMBS-SA and the strategic alignment between knowledge strategy and IS strategy - KMIS-SA in the banking sector among the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Using the proposed model, the study explored the impacts of KMBS-SA and KMIS-SA on the organizational performance. The main hypothesis of this research is that knowledge is the main resource in an organization, and by aligning this resource with the business strategy and IS strategy, the alignment will contribute positively on the performance of the organization. 
The research model was illustrated in two different conceptualizations hypothesizing the different relationships between knowledge strategies, business strategy and IS strategy. The first conceptualization illustrates the KMBS-SA and KMIS-SA, and an investigation on the contribution of theses alignments on the organizational performance.  The second conceptualization of the research model aims at investigating the impact of different types or profiles of KMBS-SA and KMIS-SA on the organizational performance. This study examined different alignments between two profiles of knowledge strategy - Aggressive Knowledge Strategy (AKS) and Conservative Knowledge Strategy (CKS), with various types of business strategy according to Miles and Snow&#146;s (1978) strategic typology, and, the alignment of the two profiles of knowledge strategy with various IS strategy based on the STROIS approach by Chan et al. (1997). Using both conceptualizations, the role of knowledge strategy as a moderator or a mediator in the contribution of the business strategy and IS strategy towards the organizational performance was examined. The primary data for this study was collected through a survey of 106 banks from the six Gulf countries: Kingdom of Bahrain, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Oman. The first overall conclusion demonstrated that there is a strong association between knowledge strategy and business strategy and that KMBS-SA clearly influenced the organizational performance. The second overall result of this research shows that in the context of GCC countries, knowledge strategy received stronger support as moderator of the IS congruence association with performance and that KMIS-SA is the primary determinant of the effectiveness of IS in the GCC banks. 
From the finding, it is recommended that the GCC banks should take KMBS-SA and KMIS-SA challenge seriously and should consider the alignment implication before moving ahead to implement a strategic plan. Furthermore, the research finding revealed that GCC bank should not ignore the different dimensions of knowledge strategic choices. The banks need to determine different profiles for their knowledge strategy in order to support all aspects of business strategy and IS strategic dimensions that are most important for the organization. They should then direct the organizational knowledge resources to support these profiles. Finally, it is recommended that the banks should define and establish a position in KM in order to oversee the knowledge strategy and KM issues.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge Management</field><field name="subject">Strategic Alignment</field><field name="subject">Gulf Cooperation Council</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081203.120238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"the lonely and the road&#148; (novel) &#147;What&#146;s your road, man?&#148;: my experiences with the life and work of Jack Kerouac in relation to the development of &#147;the lonely and the road&#148; (exegesis)</field><field name="creator">johnstubley@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">Thirty thousand feet above the Pacific Ocean&#151;somewhere between Sydney and Los Angeles&#151;the narrator of &#147;the lonely and the road&#148; doesn&#146;t really know where he is going, or why.

This vegetation community has high levels of species richness and endemism, and is of high conservation value. In many vegetation remnants in the wheatbelt the native tree species Allocasuarina huegeliana (rock sheoak) is expanding out from its normal range and encroaching into kwongan. A. huegeliana may ultimately dominate the kwongan, causing a decline in floristic diversity. Altered disturbance regimes, particularly the absence of fire and reduced or absent browsing mammal herbivores, are likely to be responsible for causing A. huegeliana encroachment. 

This study used experimental and observational data from patches of kwongan in three Nature Reserves in the central and southern wheatbelt to investigate the role of fire, native mammal activities and interactions between these two factors in shaping A. huegeliana woodland&#150;kwongan community boundaries. Investigations were carried out into the characteristics of encroaching A. huegeliana populations; the environmental factors affecting the extent of encroachment, naturally recruited juveniles, and seedling emergence and establishment; historical and current abundances of native mammals; and the effects of mammal herbivores on seedling establishment during inter-fire and post-fire periods.

Results from this study confirm that A. huegeliana has encroached into kwongan throughout the wheatbelt region and recruitment appears likely to continue in most areas. Few of the environmental factors measured in this study affected the extent of encroachment, the locations of naturally recruited A. huegeliana juveniles, and seedling germination and establishment. Western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) browsed extensively on seedlings, which largely prevented them from establishing in open areas of kwongan. However, numerous A. huegeliana seedlings escaped browsing herbivores by establishing in perennial shrubs, where they appeared to be tolerant of increased levels of inter-specific competition. 

There was no native mammal common to all three Reserves that declined around the time that A. huegeliana encroachment most likely began in the 1970s. In addition, tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) had little effect even where their densities were high. It is therefore unlikely that the decline of an individual mammal species initiated encroachment. A. huegeliana encroachment appears to be driven by increased propagule pressure, which is in turn caused by increased inter-fire intervals. Long periods of time without fire have enabled fire-sensitive A. huegeliana trees to produce increasing quantities of seed that are continuously released into kwongan. A range of other factors may interact synergistically with this process to affect encroachment and these are also discussed. This study considered the implications of these findings for management of remnant vegetation in fragmented landscapes, particularly kwongan in the Western Australian wheatbelt, and areas for further research are suggested.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Allocasuarina huegeliana; biotic refuge; browsing regime; community boundaries; encroachment; exclosure; facilitation; fire r</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081211.92011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional and Antigenic Characterisation of the
Moraxella catarrhalis protein M35</field><field name="creator">Easton, Donna Meredith</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the characterisation of a novel outer membrane protein (OMP)
from M. catarrhalis, designated M35, with a molecular mass of 36.1 kDa. This protein is
structurally homologous to classic Gram-negative porins, such as OMP C from E. coli and
OMP K36 from K. pneumoniae, with a predicted structure of 8 surface loops connecting 16
antiparallel -sheets. Comparison of the DNA sequences of the M35 genes from 18 diverse
clinical isolates showed that the gene was highly conserved (99.6-100 % of nucleotides)
with only one isolate (ID78LN266) having base variations that resulted in amino acid
substitutions.
A single amino acid mutation in the 3rd external loop of M35 in isolate ID78LN266
significantly affected antibody recognition, indicating that loop 3 contains an immunodominant
B-cell epitope. The reduction in antibody-binding to M35 from ID78LN266
was similar to that caused by complete removal of loop 3. Since loop 3 folds into the porin
channel in the classic structure, the antibody specificity to loop 3 was hypothesised to be
a potential mechanism for evasion of host immune responses targeted to M35, potentially
explaining the high degree of conservation across isolates.
A series of recombinant proteins were constructed to analyse the binding to M35 of
antibodies specificity for loop 3 or the remainder of the protein. It was found that loop 3-
specific antibodies were not able to bind to M35 on the surface of M. catarrhalis and
that this corresponds both with a lack of ability to enhance opsonophagocytosis in vitro
and bacterial clearance in vivo. Additionally, antibodies raised against a version of M35
lacking loop 3 and M35 from the variant isolate ID78LN266 were both no less effective
than the full consensus M35 by both these measures. It therefore appears that while the
majority of antibodies raised against M35 are specific for loop 3 these antibodies do not
mediate anti-M. catarrhalis actions.
Two deletion mutant strains of M. catarrhalis that do not contain the outer membrane
protein M35 were created by insertional inactivation of the M35 gene. Growth comparisons
between these mutant strains and their wildtype parent strains initially led to the
hypothesis that M35 is necessary for efficient glutamic acid uptake by M. catarrhalis,
however this hypothesis was later shown to be incorrect. Efficient uptake of glutamic acid
seemed to be mediated by a novel 40 kDa protein that was up-regulated in the deletion
mutant strains, presumably to compensate for the lack of M35. M35 was also found to
be essential for in vivo survival of M. catarrhalis in the nasal cavities of mice, indicating
that it is an essential functional protein for colonisation of the mucosal surface.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">outer membrane protein</field><field name="subject">OMP</field><field name="subject">M. catarrhalis</field><field name="subject">M35</field><field name="subject">antibody recognition</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081217.083105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DYNAMIC CHANGE PROCESS: HOW DO COGNITIVE

EMPLOYEE BEHAVIOURAL CHANGE INTENTION.</field><field name="creator">Wiener, Karl, Kilian, Konrad</field><field name="description">It is well accepted by now that most change initiatives are unsuccessful even though more
organisations are experiencing change as they fight to retain and improve their
competitiveness in the market place. It is against this background of change failure that
researchers have looked for new strategies to improve change outcomes. Theoretical
models conceptualising the dynamic change process advise on better change strategies, but
little empirical evidence has demonstrated that these models are effective in improving
change implementation outcomes. Theoretical models were also developed to counter
change resistance, but little emphasis has been placed on employee change readiness.
Some empirical research on employee change readiness explores employees? perception of
organisational readiness, but no empirical research has explored employee readiness from a
psychological perspective. That is, how to create change readiness in employees.
This thesis has contributed to both the theoretical and empirical understanding of the
change readiness model. Firstly, the theoretical readiness for change model Armenakis et
al.?s (1993, 2002) was extended by the inclusion of the ?understanding of the change?
driver. Secondly, this change readiness model was empirically tested on two distinct
organisational changes: organisational restructure and IT change. The extended model is
also examined for two change stages of the dynamic process to identify which readiness
drivers should be prioritised by change agents.

three change stages (planning, implementation and post-implementation) of employees ?

industry. At the two measurement points 189 and 141 employees returned completed
surveys. Six employee readiness drivers were operationalised and regressed against
behavioural change intention.
The quantitative findings using regression models across two change types and
longitudinally did not identify a specific change pattern. However, all six readiness drivers
including the ?understanding of the change? driver were influential on employees?
behavioural change intention. Furthermore, statistical differences between supervisors and
subordinates were identified in the organisational restructure change.
The quantitative findings using a triangulation approach with qualitative date including
data from two unstructured interviews and employee comments further validated the
quantitative findings. The thematic analysis of the employee comments enhanced the
findings and identified employee specific concerns including information dissemination of
the changes and a level of uncertainty.
The findings supported Armenakis et al.?s (1993, 2002) theoretical contribution that
change readiness drivers are an important part of the organisational change process
explaining why employee do and do not change. The empirical application of readiness
change driver evaluation during the dynamic change is supported as it permits change
agents to directly monitor employees? readiness perception of a specific change target.
This valuable information finds practical utilisation for change agents in providing targeted
guidance and support for employees thus facilitating a greater likelihood of a positive
change outcome.
Implications of these findings and future research opportunities are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">human resource organisations</field><field name="subject">Readiness for change</field><field name="subject">organisational change</field><field name="subject">readiness drivers</field><field name="subject">change efficacy</field><field name="subject">appropriateness of the change</field><field name="subject">understanding of the change</field><field name="subject">personal valence</field><field name="subject">principal support</field><field name="subject">need for change</field><field name="subject">behavioural change intention</field><field name="subject">supervisor</field><field name="subject">subordinate</field><field name="subject">dynamic change models</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081217.120215</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sex chromosome microsatellite markers from an
Australian marsupial:
development, application and evolution</field><field name="creator">MacDonald, Anna Jayne</field><field name="description">Microsatellites are simple repetitive DNA sequences that are used as genetic markers
throughout the biological sciences. The high levels of variation observed at microsatellite loci
contribute to their utility in studies at the population and individual levels. This variation is a
consequence of mutations that change the length of microsatellite repeat tracts. Current
understanding suggests that most mutations are caused by polymerase slippage during DNA
replication and lead to changes of a single repeat unit in length, but some changes involving
multiple repeats can also occur. Despite this simplistic overview, there is evidence for
considerable heterogeneity in mutation processes between species, loci and alleles. Such
complex patterns suggest that other mechanisms, including those associated with DNA
recombination, are also involved in the generation of microsatellite mutations. Understanding
which mutational mechanisms are responsible for variation at microsatellite markers is
essential to enable accurate data interpretation in genotyping projects, as many commonly
used statistics assume specific mutation models.
I developed microsatellite markers specific to the X and Y chromosomes and an autosome in
the tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii, and investigated their evolutionary properties using
two approaches: indirectly, as inferred from population data, and directly, from observation of
mutation events. First, I found that allelic richness increased with repeat length and that two
popular mutation models, the stepwise mutation model and the infinite allele model, were
poor at predicting the number of alleles per locus, particularly when gene diversity was high.
These results suggest that neither model can account for all mutations at tammar wallaby
microsatellites and hint at the involvement of more complex mechanisms than replication
slippage. I also determined levels of variation at each locus in two tammar wallaby
populations. I found that allelic richness was highest for chromosome 2, intermediate for the
X chromosome and lowest for the Y chromosome in both populations. Thus, allelic richness
varied between chromosomes in the manner predicted by their relative exposure to
recombination, although these results may also be explained by the relative effective
population sizes of the chromosomes studied. Second, I used small-pool PCR from sperm
DNA to observe de novo mutation events at three of the most polymorphic autosomal
markers. To determine the reliability of my observations I developed and applied strict criteria
for scoring alleles and mutations at microsatellite loci. I observed mutations at all three
markers, with rate variation between loci. Single step mutations could not be distinguished
because of the limitations of the approach, but 24 multi-step mutations, involving changes of
up to 35 repeat units, were recorded. Many of these mutations involved changes that could not
be explained by the gain or loss of whole repeat units. These results imply that a large number
of mutations at tammar wallaby microsatellites are caused by mechanisms other than
replication slippage and are consistent with a role for recombination in the mutation process.
Taken as a whole, my results provide evidence for complex mutation processes at tammar
wallaby microsatellites. I conclude that careful characterisation of microsatellite mutation
properties should be conducted on a case-by-case basis to determine the most appropriate
mutation models and analysis tools for each locus. In addition, my work has provided a set of
chromosome-specific markers for use in macropod genetic studies, which includes the first
marsupial Y chromosome microsatellites. Sex chromosome microsatellites open a new range
of possibilities for population studies, as they provide opportunities to investigate gene flow
in a male context, to complement data from autosomal and maternally-inherited mitochondrial
markers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microsatellites</field><field name="subject">repetitive DNA sequence</field><field name="subject">X and Y chromosomes</field><field name="subject">tammar wallaby</field><field name="subject">Macropus eugenii</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081217.122146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Floodplains as dynamic mosaics : sediment and nutrient patches in a large lowland riverine landscape</field><field name="creator">Southwell, Mark</field><field name="description">Rivers around the world are under increasing pressure from a variety of human activities.
Effective management of riverine landscapes requires an ecosystem approach and one that
recognises the complex interactions between their physical, chemical and biological
components. Perceptions of pattern and process are central to our understanding of riverine
landscapes. Pattern and process operate over multiple scales to produce heterogeneous
mosaics of landscape patches that change over time. Hierarchical patch dynamics provides a
useful approach to unravel pattern and process at multiple scales in riverine landscapes. This
thesis adopts a hierarchical patch dynamics approach to investigate floodplain sediment and
nutrient dynamics within the Barwon-Darling River in South Eastern Australia.
The flow regime of the Barwon-Darling River is highly variable. As a result, it has a complex
channel cross section featuring inset-floodplain surfaces that occur at multiple elevations
within the channel trough. These surfaces formed the focus of this study. The texture of inset- floodplain
surface sediments displays a patchy spatial distribution and one that did not reflect
lateral or longitudinal gradients within this floodplain landscape. Rather a sediment textural
patch mosaic was identified. Nutrient concentrations associated with the surface sediments of
the inset-floodplains were also shown to vary significantly resulting in a nutrient patch
mosaic. This spatial nutrient mosaic was enhanced by factors including the surface elevation
of the floodplain surface.
Sediment and nutrient exchange between the river channel and inset-floodplain surfaces was
measured during several flows in 2001, 2002 and 2005. Pin and sediment trap data showed
that significant quantities of sediment were exchanged between the river channel and
floodplain surfaces during inundation with both cut and fill processes occurring. Patterns in
sediment exchange appear to be related to local sediment supply and seasonal sediment
exhaustion, rather than the top down geomorphic constraints considered. These material
exchanges resulted in a change to the spatial configuration of the sediment textural patch
mosaic. Distinct new sediment textural patches were created following inundation, while
other patches were lost post inundation and other patches changed sediment textural character
to move into pre-existing patches. Thus a truly dynamic sediment textural mosaic exists
within this floodplain landscape.
Nutrient concentrations associated with floodplain sediments also changed over time. While
nutrient concentrations increased after the December 2001 flow event, they generally
decreased after the March 2002 event, highlighting their dynamic nature over time. The
spatial distribution of nutrient concentrations also varied over time, with a 40 percent change
to the nutrient mosaic as a result of the March 2002 flow event. In addition to the influence of
the changing physical template (sediment texture mosaic), nutrient concentrations were
shown to be influenced by rainfall processes on non flooded surfaces, and also a number of
top-down constraints and bottom-up influences operating over multiple spatial scales.
Overall, the inset-floodplains studied in this thesis acted primarily as sediment and nutrient
sinks, and were a source for dissolved nutrients. Nutrient exchange was associated with the
exchange of sediments in this riverine landscape, over both inter-flow and decadal timescales.
It was demonstrated that water resource development within the catchment reduced the
number, magnitude and duration of flow events down the Barwon-Darling River and as a
result reductions in the exchange of sediment, associated and dissolved nutrients between
inset-floodplains and the main river channel were calculated. The greatest reductions were
with the release of dissolved nutrients (42-25 percent) and the exchange of sediment and
associated nutrients from high level surfaces (43 percent).
Effective conservation and management of riverine ecosystems must occur at the correct
scale. This study identified potential nutrient hotspots at several scales in the Barwon-Darling
floodplain landscape that could be targeted by management. The low predictability of the
location of nutrient hotspots at the inset-floodplain scale over time means that environmental
flows should be targeted at high level surfaces (&lt;25 000 MLD-1) that provide long term
sources of carbon to the river channel. Conserving flows of this magnitude will also reinstate
flow variability, an important facet of the Barwon-Darling River?s hydrology that has been
changed by water resource development. The research presented in this thesis highlights the
importance of not only considering pattern and process at multiple scales, but also the way in
which these processes influence landscape patterns over time, leading to the identification of
the appropriate scales that can best be targeted for the conservation of these systems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">South Eastern Australia</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">river</field><field name="subject">ecosystem</field><field name="subject">riverine landscape</field><field name="subject">hierarchical patch dynamics</field><field name="subject">Barwon-Darling River</field><field name="subject">floodplains</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081217.144116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sniffer Packets &amp; Firewalls</field><field name="creator">Hearn, Kay</field><field name="description">Falun Gong protesters, the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, the spy
plane incident and a series of mine accidents are just some of the events over the past
decade that involved the Internet. In each incident the leadership of the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) was caught off guard by the circumvention of informational
flows as a consequence of the Internet. This is in some ways indicative of the impact
the medium is having on the ability of the CCP to manage political discourse within
the confines of the country. This thesis examines the way that political discourse in
contemporary China is managed in response to the development of the Internet, using
the concepts of time and space as conceived by Harold A. Innis.
This historical study considers the strategies used in the management of time and
space in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) across a broad range of ways in which
the medium is used by particular groups, such as online gamers, bloggers, hackers,
and activists. I have also looked at the way information flows are managed during a
crisis or disaster using critical textual analysis of Internet sources, and specific
examples. These sources are both official and unofficial including Chinese
government sites, journalistic sources both Chinese and Western and Chinese legal
databases that appear on the World Wide Web (WWW). The study finds that there is
an emerging shift from propaganda based media manipulation and suppression to a
style of stage managed spin. The CCP have used three strategies to contain and
maintain their hold over central power, including the rule of law, investment in the
development of content and technological means. The development of the Internet in
China is marked by a dialect of desire for the technology for economic purposes and
the perceived need to control the technology for political purposes. The Internet has
also enabled the central government in Beijing to reassert its position as a central
authority over local and provincial governments.
This study contributes to the existing knowledge about Chinese media policy and the
Internet, and will shed light on the ways in which the tehcnology influences the
production and consumption of media and the impact that the development of this
medium has upon media policy in China. Furthermore, this study will contribute to a
greater understanding of CCP's ability to manage information and the impact that this
medium will have on the operations of Chinese politics within the space of the
Internet, as well as the impact of the technology on politics, and China's interaction
with the international community.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Chinese Communist Party (CCP)</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">censorship</field><field name="subject">information flow</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">control.</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081217.153550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tourism destination recovery after the 2003 Canberra fires</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, Elizabeth Kate</field><field name="description">The tourism industry is vulnerable to crises and disasters and increasingly government and
industry stakeholders are turning their attention to how to prevent, manage and recover from
shock events. In the last decade there has been increasing interest in tourism research on crises
and disasters, prompted in part by recognition of the tourism industry's vulnerabilities and what
appear to be more frequent shock events. The beginning of this century has been marked by a
series of crises and disasters including the 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak in the United
Kingdom, the 2001 terrorist hijackings in the USA, the 2002 and 2005 Bali bombings, the 2003
SARS epidemic in southeast Asia and Canada, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane
Katrina in the southern USA in 2005 (Henderson, 2007). The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (2007a) has also predicted that the extreme weather events associated with
climate change will lead to more natural disasters. Crises and disaster have local, regional and
global repercussions on the tourism industry at business/corporate, industry and destination
levels and the need for more attention to preparation, response and recovery is acknowledged.
Much of the initial tourism research in this field focused on descriptions of crises and disasters
and their impacts on tourism with some reflection on their management. This foundation and the
comprehensive crisis and disaster literature from disciplines such as psychology, sociology,
economics, geography and environmental science led to development of crisis and disaster
management frameworks specifically designed for the tourism industry. These frameworks have
achieved varying degrees of acceptance amongst tourism researchers with Faulkner and
Vikulov's (2001) Tourism Disaster Management Framework (TDMF) being the most well
known and often cited. The more recent Crisis and Disaster Management Framework (CDMF)
developed by Ritchie (2004) is a useful destination-level framework based on a strategic
management approach.
Despite the development of these frameworks, relatively little tourism research effort has
focused on destination recovery and very little on medium and long term recovery. In addition,
there is little research on wildfires as a type of natural disaster. The extensive bushfires in the
Australian Capital Territory (ACT) in 2003 (often referred to as the Canberra fires) provided an
opportunity to investigate in a longitudinal study the short, medium and long term actions
undertaken by the government and tourism industry to assist destination recovery and then
compare them with Ritchie's prescriptive CDMF. Being longer term research this study is able
to consider almost the entire recovery stage whereas other research has focused on short or
medium term recovery (for example Faulkner &amp; Vikulov, 2001).
This research centred on a case study which is defined by Yin (1989 quoted in Wimmer &amp;
Dominick, 1997, p. 102) as an 'empirical inquiry that uses multiple sources of evidence to
investigate a contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context'. This case study used
interviewing, the documentary method and participant observation as the key methods.
Representatives of government and the tourism industry were interviewed in-depth about the
actions taken by their organisations or businesses. The interviews were semi-structured with
mostly open-ended questions and some participants undertook multiple interviews over a three
year period. Extensive secondary data and documentation about the bushfire and subsequent
response and recovery was generated by the ACT government, industry and community and
publicly available sources included reports and reviews, media releases, newspaper articles,
newsletters, brochures, websites and legal and coronial enquiries. These were critical for
gaining a comprehensive understanding of recovery. Participant observation was also important
and, as a resident of the ACT, the author participated in relevant events and observed the public
face of community recovery.
The three methods resulted in a large data set that was distilled into a 'response and recovery
story' structured according to Ritchie's CDMF. Upon comparing the findings with the
framework, it was found that many elements were evident in the 'real life' case study including
crisis communication, resource management, stakeholder communication, destination
restoration and disasters as agents for change. There were also new findings that could be
integrated into a redeveloped framework including the establishment of a recovery team,
training for crisis and disaster management, tourist/visitor management, recovery planning,
human resource management issues, business recovery tools, partnerships and memorialisation
and commemoration. The resulting Tourism Industry Crisis and Disaster Management
Framework (TICDMF) is a practical and comprehensive tool for Destination Management
Organisations (DMOs) that both describes what occurred in a real life case study but also
prescribes recommended management actions.
In addition to specific recommendations for the ACT tourism industry, this research also
resulted in general recommendations to the tourism industry, government and educators. These
focused on (i) the importance of crisis and disaster management planning, (ii) the need to
evaluate and document response and recovery and devote adequate resources to organisational
learning, (iii) potential use of tools like the TICDMF and the plethora of resources to manage
crises and disasters, (iv) educating staff, academics and tertiary tourism and hospitality students
about crisis and disaster management and (v) accepting the chaos of recovery and devoting
adequate resources to address the resulting complexity.
The tourism industry is vulnerable to external shocks whether they be local crises or national
disasters. The preparedness of the industry and its ability to effectively respond and recover is of
critical importance for destinations and the community in which they function. Case studies of
crises and disaster and development of a body of theoretical and practical knowledge will ensure
that government and industry continue to play an important role in caring for the safety and
security of tourists while maintaining a viable and sustainable industry for all stakeholders.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Canberra</field><field name="subject">bushfires</field><field name="subject">tourism recovery</field><field name="subject">2003</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081218.091856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Partial rootzone drying and deficit irrigation in cotton for use under large mobile irrigation machines</field><field name="creator">White, Simon Charles</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: There is currently a shortage of irrigation water available for cotton production in Australia due to recent climatic and legislative conditions. Some growers have responded to this water shortage by changing from traditional furrow irrigation to alternative irrigation systems such as centre pivots and lateral move irrigations(collectively known as large mobile irrigation machines &#8211; LMIMs). Improved efficiency of irrigation application, as well as labour savings, have been the main reasons for the increased adoption of LMIMs. The use of LMIMs also enables a higher level of control in water application in terms of irrigation volume, timing and placement. As a result, growers now have much greater control over soil moistureconditions which enables the implementation of improved irrigation management strategies that have the potential for improved crop water use productivity (yield/ML).Two irrigation strategies which have been demonstrated to achieve benefits in terms of crop water use are partial rootzone drying (PRD) and deficit irrigation (DI). PRDand DI involve manipulating the placement of irrigation water and the moisture deficit maintained in the root zone, respectively. Neither PRD nor DI is able to beapplied easily under furrow irrigation. However, both PRD and DI may be able to be implemented under LMIMs within the Australian cotton industry. Deficit irrigation has been shown to be effective at improving water use productivity in cotton, although it is not widely used within the Australian cotton industry.Similarly, there has been little research conducted to identify whether cotton responds to partial rootzone drying and there is currently little understanding of theway in which DI and PRD strategies could be implemented commercially using LMIMs.This research carried out from 2002 to 2005 investigated the response of cotton to a range of PRD and deficit irrigation strategies for use under LMIMs. Assessment ofthe biochemical and physiological response of cotton to PRD and regulated deficit irrigation strategies was conducted under glasshouse conditions in Toowoomba, Qld.Field trials conducted under a commercial centre pivot and lateral move situated on the Darling Downs assessed the crop response, soil moisture movement, yield andgross production water use associated with the implementation of a range of PRD and deficit treatments. Modelling of rainfall probability and soil moisture movement were also undertaken to quantify constraints to the successful commercial implementation of irrigation management strategies such as PRD within theAustralian cotton industry.PRD applied to cotton grown in split-pot containers under glasshouse conditions was found to produce a biochemical response in the form of a four fold increase in xylemAbscisic Acid concentration. The application of alternated PRD strategies was generally found to reduce both vegetative (i.e. height, leaf area) and reproductive(i.e. fruiting sites) plant growth compared to Control treatments irrigated on both sides of the plant. Increasing the period between PRD alternations from 5 to 15days when the soil moisture potential in the wet root zone was maintained between 30 and 60 kPa also reduced the plant height and the number of fruiting sites.However, where the soil moisture in the wetted root zone was maintained at &lt;3 kPa and alternation was based on the dry root zone moisture levels 16% (~350 kPa) and10% (&gt;1500 kPa) there was no difference in the major plant growth indicators (i.e. height, fruiting branches, fruiting sites, leaf area) between the various alternatedPRD treatments. This suggests that the level of moisture availability in the wet root zone area is a key factor influencing water uptake and crop stress under alternatedPRD conditions.No significant difference in crop growth or yield was found as a result of the PRD treatments implemented under commercial field conditions. However, this may havebeen attributed to the inability to apply and maintain a sufficient soil moisture gradient across the root zone to successfully induce biochemical signalling from PRD. Practical limitations in the successful application of PRD in cotton production are attributed to the soil hydraulic properties, current irrigation practices (i.e. volumeand frequency of water applied) and the occurrence of in-season rainfall events. Rainfall probability and soil moisture modelling were used to evaluate the practical application of PRD within the Australian cotton industry. This work suggested thatthe creation of a soil moisture gradient across the plant root zone large enough to trigger a PRD response is most likely to be achieved on light textured soils located insemi-arid regions which experience minimal in-season rainfall events. However, the conditions are only met for a relatively small proportion of the current Australiancotton industry. Hence, it would seem that further research into the benefits of implementing PRD in cotton under LMIMs is not warranted.Regulated deficit irrigation applied under glasshouse conditions was found to have a controlling influence over partitioning between vegetative and reproductive growth.Improved physiological and gross production to water use benefits were measured as a result of deficit irrigation under field conditions and regulated deficit irrigationunder glasshouse conditions. Deficit irrigation (79% of predicted ET) under field conditions produced a 31.5% improvement in gross production water use index(GPWUI = Yield / Total water applied (rainfall, irrigation and stored soil moisture)) over commercial practice (i.e. applying 100% of predicted ET). However, thelargest benefits derived from deficit irrigation were associated with the management of crop agronomics (i.e. vegetative growth, retention rate and crop earliness) and the increased ability for capture of in-crop rainfall. Hence, deficit irrigation may provide substantial benefits for the cotton industry in terms of productivity of irrigation water applied as well as total water applied (irrigation, rainfall and soil moisture reserves).The ability to implement a suitable deficit irrigation strategy is regionally and seasonally dependent as the uncertainty over the timing of rainfall events andirrigation allocation both within and between seasons makes the optimal use of water resources difficult. Hence, future research should aim to enhance current cropproduction models to predict crop growth and response to a range of deficit irrigation treatments. Greater knowledge and adoption in the use of climatic predictors (suchas SOI) are required to improve the volume and timing of deficit irrigations applied. An economics framework should be developed which encompasses resource costs and constraints on a farm basis to enable the identification of optimal management practices based on the risk profiles of the various deficit irrigation strategies.Irrigation scheduling under LMIMs is also currently limited by the use of point scale soil moisture measurements (especially under low energy precision applicator LEPA) socks) and this may be improved by the use of plant based sensors.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia;</field><field name="subject">cotton;</field><field name="subject">cotton</field><field name="subject">production;</field><field name="subject">irrigation;</field><field name="subject">large</field><field name="subject">mobile</field><field name="subject">irrigation</field><field name="subject">machines</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004778/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stories of stress: feeling, thinking and the flourishing of life</field><field name="creator">Burke, Dominic Francis</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: This research responded to calls in the literature for more studies into subjective components of student stress as well as for innovative studies of appropriate counselling interventions. An innovative, individualised, body-mind intervention was offered to university students experiencing emotional stress overwhelm. Integral to the intervention was an extensive list of feelings, representing the approach-avoidance structure of the motivational system. Feelings qualitatively differentiate emotional experiences, and the list was found to be useful for identifying the feelings around emotional experiences. It was proposed that how one thinks about feelings is a key to resolving emotional stress and would facilitate the flourishing of life.There have been recent calls for development of first-person methodologies for investigating experiences, and, since the intervention was individualised, analysis of the unique data set took a narrative interpretive approach. Narrative data, evoked by the feelings list, were interpreted to formulate students&#8217; &#8220;stories of stress&#8221; then analysed to study their stressful emotional experiences.This study demonstrates an innovative method for resolving emotional stress. Feelings were identified clearly, prompting students to think differently about emotional experiences. The study also demonstrates a method for researching those experiences of emotion. Analyses of consultants&#8217; notes highlighted inter-connections and relationships between feelings and experiences throughout clients&#8217; life-stories. Analyses of the data demonstrated a way of making sense of &#8220;emotional stress&#8221; and how the use of the feelings list could facilitate an individual&#8217;s thinking differently about experiences and resolving personal issues. For the participants of this study, feelings of grief and guilt were identified more than feelings of fear of loss for the issues discussed, suggesting that student's behaviours were motivated more by guilt than by fear.

Water security is an important national issue. The ultimate water supply, rainfall, however, is one of the most variable ones in theworld and is complicated by the fact that it is affected by several remote oceanatmospheric teleconnection systems simultaneously, including the El Ni&#241;o-SouthernOscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole and Southern Hemisphere oceanic and atmospheric variability. These three systems sometimes conspire to produce a severe impact, whereas sometimes they offset each other to produce a mild influence. The recent severe watershortage has generated a surge of investments with strong regional applications. The present study focuses on areas and issues outside the scope of these regional studies,aiming to provide an Australia-wide assessment of future Australian rainfall under climate change. Firstly, we unravel a process of the Indo-Pacific oceanic teleconnection and examine its role in influencing variability of the Indian Ocean, and hence Australianrainfall variations. An examination of their contribution to the warming structure of the Indian Ocean is carried out. Secondly, we explore dynamics of North West Australianrainfall variability and mechanisms of a rainfall increase over the past decades, and benchmark climate models in terms of their ability to reproduce the observed variability and trends, focusing on the role of increasing northern hemispheric aerosols in the rainfallincrease. Thirdly, we provide a dynamical explanation to the common future of a fast Tasman Sea warming rate under climate change, and identify the impacts of suchwarming on Australian rainfall. Finally, we examine the relative importance of the three systems, in addition to Tasman Sea warming, in driving rainfall changes undergreenhouse conditions.

The many nuances associated with adult learners, combined with the challenges associated with exploring technically complex topics, make effective technical education difficult to achieve. An understanding of adult learners and teaching, coupled with a robustdevelopment framework can help produce effective teaching strategies and technical texts for diverse groups of adult learners.A literature review focusing on current research regarding adult learners was conducted to investigate some of the nuances of the adult learner. Specifically, thedifferences between adult learning and child learning were explored which lead to research on the role of experience in learning, the different approaches adult students typically take to learning, and the likely diversity in preferred learning styles within groups of adult learners.The literature review also investigated the role of the teacher in adult education, focusing on the need for learning facilitation in adult education. The desirable characteristics of teachers of adults were also investigated leading to an appreciation of the attitudes, attributes and approaches that teachers can take to enhance the learning experience for adults.A conceptual framework for the development and delivery of adult education courses was proposed and explained. The framework was based on established complexproblem solving principles and covered the entire lifecycle of an adult education course fromthe identification of a need for a course through to its delivery (and revision). The framework was based on a top-down approach to educational design. This was articulatedusing a VEE diagram that explained how the lifecycle stages (decision, design, development,and delivery) could build upon one another through concepts such as traceability, ongoingverification and feedback. The principles of adult learning and teaching were integrated intothe framework via the activities associated with the design, development and delivery of courses.The framework, and the information contained in the literature review, has been applied to the development of three different technical courses for three different groups of adult learners. As a result of the application of the framework and the development of thesecourses, a number of technical texts has been written and published to support the courses.The adaptability and success of the framework are evidenced by the ongoing and expanded adoption of the courses to support adult education, the publication record being established by the texts, and the positive student and peer review of the adult teaching strategiesemployed in those courses.It is concluded that the framework and the analyses arising from the literaturereview have the potential to be of value and interest to other teachers responsible for thedesign, development and/or delivery of adult education in technical fields.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adult</field><field name="subject">learners;</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">strategies;</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">strategies;</field><field name="subject">texts</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004785/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterisation of the potential immunomodulatory principles from Astragalus membranaceus</field><field name="creator">Watson, Robert James</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: This thesis describes an in-vivo evaluation of ethanolic extracts of Astragalus membranaceus and fractions derived from this extract administered either orally by gavage or by intraperitoneal injection to Balb/c mice.

This firm has succeeded in entering this market despite entrenched competition from traditional suppliers in the USA and Canada and in the face of rigorous food safety and quality standards as required in this particular market. The research in this dissertation focuses on outlining the critical &#8216;enabling competencies&#8217; that the firm and its suppliers developed in order to enter the Japanese market. A single case methodology involving multiple in-depth interviews with key stakeholders was used to provide triangulated evidence concerning the necessary and sufficient conditionsfor SME exporters to compete successfully in such mature markets, particularly in the face of entrenched competition from large scale suppliers of similar productsfrom the United States and Canada. From the data collected in this research, a model of SME internationalisation was proposed highlighting the driving forces whichstimulated the development of a set of &#8216;enabling competencies&#8217; enabling successful entry into the Japanese market for food grains. This model has both practical andtheoretical implications for the development of trade between Australia and Japan in the food grain sector.

The topic arises from a deep personal interest in processes of societal change and the need for such processes to be in the professional practices ofacademics. The research problem that guides the study is: In what way(s) and to what extent can University instructors be assisted to incorporate change-basedconcepts in their pedagogical practices through application of a conceptual framework for change infusion?In response to the problem, a change infusion model (CIM) arises from an analysis of authoritative literature on change. Change infusion is an educational process that utilises key concepts from theories of change to provide ameaningful context for pedagogical practice in times where pervasive societal transformation is the norm. Gay&#8217;s (1995) multiple stages of infusion are of particular importance in the CIM. The generation of the theoretical definition of infusion in the CIM provides practising academics with an explanatory system that enables them to infuse significant elements of change into pedagogicalpractices. In essence, the CIM purports to guide instructors to move beyond teaching about change to teaching for change.The research design includes the cognitive-constructivist theoretical foundations, with particular reference to Dewey (1933), Piaget (1951), Lewin (1951), Sch&#246;n (1983, 1987), Calderhead (1988), and Patton (2002). Ofparticular importance is the analysis of opinions concerning pedagogical practice of a small number of University practitioners after engaging with theCIM during each of the three stages of trials. The trials utilize the cognitiveconstructivist quality of reflection as a means to link theory to practice.The conclusions from the research support a conceptual model, such as the CIM, for use to teach for change. As a result of the Stage 3 trial research in particular, the conceptual model from the beginning point of the study isrefined, thereby hopefully providing a useful tool for academics in a wide range of contexts and disciplines to respond in meaningful ways to the process ofmajor change that impinge upon them and their work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pedagogy;</field><field name="subject">change;</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="subject">infusion;</field><field name="subject">university;</field><field name="subject">universities</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004789/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GHOST STORIES WITHOUT GHOSTS:
A STUDY OF AUTHORSHIP IN THE FILM SCRIPT ?THE SEABORNE?</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Matt</field><field name="description">In 'The Crypt, the Haunted House of Cinema', Cholodenko argues that film is,
metaphorically speaking, a haunted house: an instance of the uncanny. This raises the
possibility the film script is also uncanny, from the Freudian notion of das Unheimliche,
the strangely familiar and familiarly strange - and thus also a haunted house. This
proposition engenders a search as self-reflexive practice for that which haunts the script'
an uncanny process to explore the uncanny. The search requires drawing on Barthes,
acting 'as dead' with that process' attendant contradictions and problematics' the most
likely ghost in the script being the writing self.
Establishing the characteristics of the writing self involves distinguishing that figure from
the author. This requires outlining the development of theories of the author from the
concept of authorial will, as per the argument of Hirsch, to the abnegation of the author as
a philosophical certainty. Barthes and Foucault call this abnegation the death of the
author. Rather than that marking the end of a particular branch of analysis, the death of
the author can be considered an opening to the writing practice. From this perspective,
the death of the author becomes a strategy in Foucault's game of writing, effecting the
obfuscation of the writing self, by placing a figure as dead, the author figure, within the
metaphorical topography of the text. Indeed, the author as dead is akin to a character in
the narrative but at a substratum level of the text. What places this dead figure within the
text is an uncanny writing self, a figure of transgression, brought into being in the
experience of Blanchot's essential solitude.
'The Seaborne' written by Matt Marshall, provides an example of a film script that
constitutes a haunted house, a site of the uncanny. In terms of the generic characteristics
of the film script as text type, its relative unimportance in relation to any subsequent film
based on the script becomes of itself a feature of the film script. This makes the film
script a site of negotiation and contestation between the implied author as hidden director
on the one hand and the implied reader as implied director on the other. This confirms
the film script as, using Sternberg's terminology, a blueprint text type. Examples of the
negotiation and relationship between hidden director and implied director are found in
analysis of 'The Seaborne' as are the tensions in the relationship between the
individualistic impulses of the hidden director and the mechanistic, formal requirements
of the text type as blueprint. These tensions are ameliorated by the hidden director who
is then effaced within the constructed layers of the film script text to allow interpretive
space for the implied director.
'The Seaborne' as representative of the film script text becomes the after-image of a
written text and the foreshadowing of a future filmic one. It therefore never finds
completion within its own construction process and its formation begins in templates that
accord with the Bakhtin's description of the epic, as is shown by comparing the
construction notes for 'The Seaborne' with Aristotlean dramatic requirements. But at the
same time there is present in 'The Seaborne' a Bakhtinian dialogism that points towards
the individual markers of a writing self. This writing self, referring to Kristeva, is a
figure of abjection. It transgresses itself and transgresses its own transgressions. It is a
ghost in a ghost story without ghosts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Film script</field><field name="subject">authorship</field><field name="subject">text</field><field name="subject">author</field><field name="subject">authorship studies</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20090106.150522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Usefulness of Macroinvertebrates for
In Situ Testing of Water Quality</field><field name="creator">Oswald, Louisa Jane</field><field name="description">For various reasons, existing methods for the assessment of aquatic pollution do not always
adequately address the way in which contaminants affect receiving environments and their
component ecosystems. The main advantage of biological assessment over the measurements
of physical and chemical aspects of water quality is that biota provide an integrated response
to all prevailing influences in their environment. Biological assessment protocols have been
developed for a range of test organisms, from bacteria to mammals using measurement from
molecular biomarkers to indicators at the population or community level of organisation.
Macroinvertebrates in particular have been popular for ecological assessment of habitat and
water quality because they are small and straight forward to sample and identify using
relatively simple and inexpensive equipment and readily available taxonomic keys.
However, various biological assessment techniques also have their limitations. Field-based
assessment of biological communities does not provide direct evidence to determine
underlying causal relationships, while laboratory or mesocosm toxicity tests are criticised for
their limited ability to extrapolate to natural field conditions. To help bridge the gap, this
thesis aims to investigate the efficacy of using caged macroinvertebrates in situ to assess the
ecological condition of aquatic environments, and whether a causal relationship can be
established when macroinvertebrates are deployed in situ at sites known to have impaired
water quality. Endpoints employed in this thesis include survival, measurements of
morphology (as a surrogate for growth) and condition and, for trials assessing sites that
receive mine drainage, the tissue concentration of certain trace metals.
Development of an in situ approach to water quality monitoring and assessment will
potentially provide methods for use by resource managers, community groups and aquatic
researchers that are less expensive and faster to run than existing methods and will
complement other approaches employed in the assessment of water quality.
In situ testing of water quality using macroinvertebrates requires the collection, handling,
caging, deployment and retrieval of test organisms at sites of suspected pollutant impact. As
such procedural factors may affect test organisms and potentially confound their responses, it
is important to consider and understand as many of these factors as possible. Aquatic
macroinvertebrates held in finer mesh cages had larger heads than in coarser mesh cages. This
was likely due to increased substrate available for growth of epilithon and periphyton on
which the caged organisms could graze. Caging density had no effect on amphipod mortality
over the trial period, however, individuals held at higher densities increased in size (as
indicated by longer dorsal lengths) more than those held at lower or intermediate densities.
Temporary storage of test organisms in laboratory aquaria may facilitate the collection of
abundances required for in situ trials, however, tanked individuals were smaller and had lower
biomasses than individuals collected and deployed immediately. While this is likely to result
from differences in feeding during the storage period, it is also possible that tank storage and
the ?double handling? deleteriously affected them, or reduced their tolerance.
The effects of transplanting macroinvertebrates between sites varied considerably depending
on the characteristics of "source" and "transplant" sites. Certain taxa suffered marked
mortality within 24 hours even at their source site, indicating an adverse effect of the caging
itself, or perhaps via the change in food, shelter or microclimate which could potentially
render them unsuitable as test organisms in caging studies. Other taxa did not differ in
survival or body size when relocated between sites, with some evidence of increased growth
at sites dissimilar from their source site. In general, organisms relocated to sites that are
"similar" to their source environment performed less well at the transplant site. However,
organisms transplanted to "dissimilar" sites were found to be bigger than those caged and
deployed back to the source site.
When employed to assess known pollution scenarios in and around Canberra,
macroinvertebrate responses were, in some instances, able to be linked to specific
environmental parameters or combinations thereof. In Case Study 1, findings varied in
relation to the response endpoint being examined, and between test species, although
concentrations of metals were significantly higher in tissue of macroinvertebrates deployed at
the impact site downstream of the abandoned Captains Flat mine and increased with time
exposed. In Case Study 2, freshwater shrimp suffered significant mortality within 24 hours of
deployment at the impact sites, with larger individuals more susceptible at sites receiving
urban stormwater runoff. While various biological effects were most closely correlated with
ammonia concentrations at the site, different body size endpoints were affected in opposite
ways. In Case Study 3, body size endpoints for one test organism varied consistently with
respect to site and time factors, but none of the changes could be linked to any of the
environmental data collected. Response variables for a different test species also indicated
significant effects arising from both deployment site and time, however, each endpoint
responded in a different way to the treatment factors, and aligned with different
combinations of environmental data.
In general, linking of macroinvertebrate responses with environmental data was difficult
because of the high variability in the environmental data. However, it was further complicated
by the mismatch in the level of replication between the two datasets. As a consequence of
this, the macroinvertebrate data had to be collapsed to a lower level for comparison with the
environmental data, resulting in a loss of natural variability and analytical power. Since only
the strongest treatment effects, which could be detected above the background "noise", were
detected and modelled against the environmental data, it is possible that other "cause" and
"effect" relationships may have been overlooked.
From these results, it is clear that many macroinvertebrate taxa are suitable for use as
bioindicators in in situ trials, but that criteria used for selection of test species should
definitely include more than just impact-sensitivity and abundance. However, there are
several aspects associated with the experimental set up of field-based protocols involving
caged macroinvertebrates that may limit their usefulness as a rapid and reliable bioassessment
tool, and need to be considered when designing and undertaking these kinds of trials. It is also
apparent that choice of endpoint can greatly influence conclusions, with detection of treatment
effects reported in this thesis varying greatly depending on which morphological endpoint
was examined.
This study clearly demonstrated that there may be significant difficulties in establishing
causal relationships between environmental data and biotic responses of macroinvertebrates
deployed under field conditions. However, it has also shown that deployment of caged
macroinvertebrates in situ may assist in the determination of biological effects arising from
impaired water quality, which can then serve as the basis for more focussed laboratory or
mesocosm studies in which environmental conditions can be more readily controlled or
monitored.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Canberra</field><field name="subject">aquatic pollution</field><field name="subject">organisms</field><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="subject">assessment</field><field name="subject">in situ</field><field name="subject">macroinvertebrates</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20090107.130047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contextual information retrieval from the WWW</field><field name="creator">Limbu, Dilip Kumar</field><field name="description">Contextual information retrieval (CIR) is a critical technique for today&#8217;s search engines in terms of facilitating queries and returning relevant information. Despite its importance, little progress has been made in its application, due to the difficulty of capturing and representing contextual information about users. This thesis details the development and evaluation of the contextual SERL search, designed to tackle some of the challenges associated with CIR from the World Wide Web. The contextual SERL search utilises a rich contextual model that exploits implicit and explicit data to modify queries to more accurately reflect the user&#8217;s interests as well as to continually build the user&#8217;s contextual profile and a shared contextual knowledge base. These profiles are used to filter results from a standard search engine to improve the relevance of the pages displayed to the user. The contextual SERL search has been tested in an observational study that has captured both qualitative and quantitative data about the ability of the framework to improve the user&#8217;s web search experience. A total of 30 subjects, with different levels of search experience, participated in the observational study experiment. The results demonstrate that when the contextual profile and the shared contextual knowledge base are used, the contextual SERL search improves search effectiveness, efficiency and subjective satisfaction. The effectiveness improves as subjects have actually entered fewer queries to reach the target information in comparison to the contemporary search engine. In the case of a particularly complex search task, the efficiency improves as subjects have browsed fewer hits, visited fewer URLs, made fewer clicks and have taken less time to reach the target information when compared to the contemporary search engine. Finally, subjects have expressed a higher degree of satisfaction on the quality of contextual support when using the shared contextual knowledge base in comparison to using their contextual profile. These results suggest that integration of a user&#8217;s contextual factors and information seeking behaviours are very important for successful development of the CIR framework. It is believed that this framework and other similar projects will help provide the basis for the next generation of contextual information retrieval from the Web.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Retrieval models</field><field name="subject">Personalized Web search</field><field name="subject">Contextual search</field><field name="subject">User profile</field><field name="subject">Relevance feedback</field><field name="subject">Query formulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Why do Asian immigrants become entrepreneurs? The case of Korean self-employed immigrants in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lee, Joo-Seok</field><field name="description">With the number of Asian immigrants continually increasing in New Zealand society, Asian immigrant businesses have been appearing more rapidly in New Zealand, particularly in Auckland. The primary purpose of this study is to enquire into why a certain Asian immigrant group become business people after migrating to Auckland, New Zealand. In addition, it investigates the level of their business activity and the level of happiness with their new life in New Zealand. This study examines the growing phenomenon of Asian immigrants, and the entrepreneurship rate of ethnic groups through existing statistics. The study focuses on Korean immigrants. Twenty self-employed Koreans who are running a business in Auckland participated in the study. They were invited to talk about why they became self-employed business people and related matters about their business activity. The study found that Korean immigrants chose self-employment as a means of getting a job. They gave up seeking mainstream employment opportunities due to the language barrier and their inability to cope with a new society and new system. Other fundamental factors in their decision to become entrepreneurs were that firstly, they were willing to invest a considerable amount of their own money and secondly, they preferred to participate in the workforce rather than to depend on the New Zealand welfare system. Based on the information acquired through the research, the study reported that the recently increased numbers of Asian businesses are partly attributable to New Zealand business immigration policy which introduced a new business category &#8211; Long Term Business Visa (LTBV). The findings from this research pointed to commitment that immigrant businesses contribute to the New Zealand economy and New Zealand society as taxpayers and potential employers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asian immigrants</field><field name="subject">Qualitative Methodology</field><field name="subject">Korean self-employed business people</field><field name="subject">Semi-structured and structured in-depth interviews</field><field name="subject">Quality of life</field><field name="subject">English language proficiency</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A qualitative analysis of radio news in Australia</field><field name="creator">Fulcher, Helen Margaret.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 537-555.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">5DN (Radio station : Adelaide, S.

Most notably, concern has focused upon the fundamental changes in economic and social organisation brought about by the increasing leverage of consumption-based activity as a path to rural development. By drawing on the relevant literature, however, I suggest in this thesis that the use of &#8216;rural restructuring&#8217; as a conceptual framework has been inconsistent. The issue of scale is a case in point with scholars positioning their studies of rural change at varying levels of analysis. In response, I adopt Massey&#8217;s (2004) arguments about space and place to present an alternative model which considers &#8216;rural restructuring&#8217; as a multi-scalar and mutually constitutive process.  To explore the feasibility of approaching &#8216;rural restructuring&#8217; in this way, the thesis focuses, in particular, upon the development of rural tourism at five different scales. These comprise the national scale (New Zealand), the regional scale (Central Otago), the sub-regional scale (the Otago Central Rail Trail), the business scale (five business case studies) and the individual scale (five entrepreneurial case studies). Reflecting the exploratory nature of the study and its multi-scalar approach, I use a number of qualitative research methods. These include interrogating the promotion of New Zealand and Central Otago as tourist destinations, cycling along the Otago Central Rail Trail, staying at accommodation businesses along the Rail Trail, and interviewing individual entrepreneurs about their experiences of business development.  The analytical chapters of the thesis comprise an in-depth look at the promotion or experience of rural tourism development at each scale of analysis. Through identifying inter-scale consistencies and emphasising the reciprocal basis of such consistency, I present &#8216;rural restructuring&#8217; as a multi-scalar and mutually constitutive process. Thus, I connect the national-scale targeting of the &#8216;interactive traveller&#8217; to the promotion of Central Otago as a &#8216;World of Discovery&#8217;, before linking the development of the Otago Central Rail Trail to its regional context. I then investigate the nature of business development as intimately bound to the evolution of the Rail Trail, before finally tying these entrepreneurial creations to individual accounts of exhaustion and enjoyment that emerge from the operation of tourism businesses. The thesis ends by concluding that &#8216;rural restructuring&#8217; can indeed be considered a multi-scalar and mutually constitutive process, worked out simultaneously at wide-ranging but interconnected levels of change.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rural restructuring</field><field name="subject">tourism development</field><field name="subject">rural entrepreneurialism</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Otago Central Rail Trail</field><field name="subject">multi-scalar</field><field name="subject">mutual constitution</field><field name="subject">Central Otago</field><field name="subject">rural lifestyles</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/669</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of different harvest start times on leafy vegetables (Lettuce, Pak Choi and Rocket) in a reaping and regrowth system</field><field name="creator">Fu, J.</field><field name="description">Leafy vegetables, lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Green Oakleaf), pak choi (Brassica sinensis L. cv. Oriental Taisai) and rocket (Eruca sativa L.), were planted in an open field at Lincoln University on January 2005. Plants were harvested at 5 cm cutting height above the growing point with three different harvest start times, early start (ES), mid start (MS) and late start (LS) of harvest respectively. There were three harvests during the growing season with a 4-week interval between harvests.  Generally, lettuce produced significantly higher total FW/plant (208 g) than pak choi or rocket (123 and 102 g total FW/plant, respectively). Lettuce also produced significantly higher total FW/plant than pak choi or rocket in each treatment.  Lettuce produced significantly more total saleable leaf FW/plant in the ES, MS and LS treatment (137.5, 120.9 and 169.3 g FW/plant), compared with pak choi (52.9, 100 and 92 g FW/plant) or rocket (31.5, 92.2 and 56.4 g FW/plant). Pak choi produced higher total saleable leaf FW/plant than rocket in the ES and LS treatments, but a similar total saleable leaf FW/plant in the MS treatment.  The best time to start harvesting was the LS treatment for lettuce, while pak choi and rocket produced better yields in the MS and LS treatments.  Results for total DW/plant showed that different harvest start times did not affect the total DW/plant in lettuce. However, pak choi and rocket produced less total DW/plant in the ES treatment compared to the MS or LS treatments. This was due to a faster recovery by lettuce. In addition, lettuce produced significantly higher DW/plant during regrowth at the second and third harvests than pak choi or rocket, even though it was significantly lower at the first harvest. It is likely that after harvesting greater carbohydrate reserves and greater remaining leaf area produced greater regrowth potential in lettuce. These results suggest that lettuce has the most regrowth potential, while rocket has more than pak choi in this reaping and regrowth system.  When plants were harvested at the same cutting level, lettuce had the most remaining leaf area of the three species. This remaining leaf area for lettuce could be another reason for faster recovery and more regrowth potential. More reserves and remaining leaf area may also be the reason for more regrowth potential in rocket compared to pak choi.  Another important reason for the better performance of lettuce was that temperatures during the growing season were in the range of optimum temperatures (12-21 &#186;&#1057;), except for the regrowth between the second and third harvests in the LS. This relates to higher photosynthetic rates and in turn leads to faster recovery and regrwoth.  Lettuce was the most suitable crop in the reaping and regrowth system in this experiment. However, rocket might also be appropriate for this system, particularly if the price is high enough to make it economically viable.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">leafy vegetable</field><field name="subject">reaping and regrowth</field><field name="subject">reserve</field><field name="subject">carbohydrate</field><field name="subject">remaining leaf area</field><field name="subject">thermal time</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of drying and rewetting cycles on carbon and nitrogen dynamics in soils of differing textures and organic matter contents</field><field name="creator">Harrison-Kirk, T.</field><field name="description">Many researchers have reported differences in soil C and N dynamics between soils of different textures and/or soil organic matter contents. However, it has proven difficult to determine the exact relationships and mechanisms between C and N dynamics and soil texture/SOM. There are few studies that consider how these soil physical and chemical conditions influence the effects of drying and rewetting on the mineralisation of C and N and the microbial transformations that follow. The objectives of this study were: 1) To determine the effects of repeated drying and rewetting cycles on C and N dynamics in soils of differing textural class and organic matter levels. 2) To use C &amp; N mineralised at constant moisture contents to calculate mineralisation during dry/wet cycles for comparison with actual mineralisation. Two soil types with contrasting textures were chosen and 6 paddocks on each soil type were selected to produce an OM gradient for each soil. Three moisture treatments were chosen to simulate moist (field capacity at -0.01 MPa), moderately dry (120% of wilting point at -1.5 MPa) and very dry (80% of wilting point at - 1.5 MPa) field conditions. The dry moisture treatments were then combined with a rewet treatment where they were either rewet or maintained dry (+ or &#8211; rewet), resulting in a total of five dry/rewet treatments. Soils were packed into funnel tops to a BD of 1.1 g/cm&#179; and sealed in glass jars fitted with septa to allow gas sampling. Drying was achieved using silica gel which allowed continued gas measurement during drying periods. Gas samples were collected throughout the experiment and analysed for CO&#8322; by IRGA and N&#8322;O by GC. At the start and end of the study, soils were analysed for Min N, MBC, MBN, HWC, DOC, POM, total C and total N. The correlation between calculated and actual C mineralisation data indicates that the intercept is not consistent with the origin and that the slope is not consistent with the 1:1 line. While those paddocks with high %C had high cumulative C mineralisation, there didn&#8217;t appear to be any strong relationship between soil texture or OM content and the difference between actual and calculated C mineralisation. A plot of calculated C mineralisation rates against the actual C mineralisation rates shows that much of the error in the calculated cumulative data arises from an underestimation of the mineralisation flush when the dry soil is rewetted, especially during the first dry-rewet cycle, and an over estimation of the rate at which respiration decreases as the soil dries. In order to use C mineralisation data from soils held at constant moisture contents to accurately predict C mineralisation in soils exposed to dry-rewet cycles, knowledge of the stress history for the soil would be required e.g. size, duration and frequency of rainfall events, dry rates etc. The N&#8322;O-N emission data is inherently more variable than the C mineralisation data. The fine-textured soils tend to have much higher N&#8322;O-N emissions than the coarser soils, probably due to the creation of anoxic sites upon rewetting in the fine-textured soils. The data indicates that prediction of N&#8322;O-N emissions in soils exposed to dry-rewet cycles using emission data from soils held at constant moisture contents would be very inaccurate, primarily due to the inherent variability of N&#8322;O-N emissions in soils.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil</field><field name="subject">drying</field><field name="subject">rewetting</field><field name="subject">carbon</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">cycles</field><field name="subject">mineralisation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breeding success of adult female kakapo (Strigops habroptilus) on Codfish Island (Whenua Hou) : correlations with foraging home ranges and habitat selection</field><field name="creator">Whitehead, Joanna K.</field><field name="description">Kakapo (Strigops habroptilus) are a flightless, nocturnal parrot endemic to New Zealand.  Thought to be extinct within their natural range, kakapo are currently listed as nationally critical.  The current population of 86 individuals is managed by the Department of Conservation&#8217;s National Kakapo Team on two offshore islands in southern New Zealand, with all females of breeding age on Codfish Island (Whenua Hou).  Kakapo only breed once every two to five years, coinciding with the mast fruiting of specific plant species.  On Codfish Island, the proportion of adult female kakapo that breed in rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) fruiting years is dependent on the quantity of fruit produced, with fewer females attempting to breed during low mast years.  The purpose of this research is to investigate why only some adult female kakapo breed in low rimu fruiting years on Codfish Island, specifically assessing if foraging home range size and/or habitat selection influence breeding.  A total of 506 location points were collected at night for 18 adult female kakapo between March and May 2006.  These were used to estimate foraging home ranges and to assess if kakapo select for particular types of vegetation.  Ecological Niche Factor Analysis was used to determine the relative importance of habitat variables in the distribution of female kakapo and to predict areas of suitable breeding habitat when rimu fruit is limited.  The breeding success of individuals in 2005, a low rimu mast year, was used to identify if differences in home ranges or habitat selection occurred between breeding and non-breeding females.  The large variation in foraging home range sizes recorded in this research was consistent with previous studies.  Foraging home range sizes were on average twice the size for breeders than for non-breeders, suggesting that adult female kakapo may be limited in their ability to breed by the size of the area they occupy.  Adult female kakapo did not randomly use vegetation on Codfish Island as some vegetation types were not used, while others were common inside foraging home ranges.  Adult female kakapo utilise a broad niche and are capable of surviving in a wide range of habitats.  However, breeding females were more specialised in their niche requirements than non-breeders, with breeders utilising areas with higher abundances of mature rimu trees.  Females occurred in high elevation, flat areas of the island but this may have been because this is where appropriate vegetation types occurred.  During low rimu mast years, breeding adult females were predicted to occupy habitat in high elevation, plateau areas with a high abundance of rimu.  Areas identified as sub-optimal habitat for breeding included the coastal areas, the lower elevation area of the main valley and some ridgelines.  The home ranges of all 10 breeding females contained some optimal habitat, while females who did not breed were more likely to be located in sub-optimal habitat.  Although there were significant areas of optimal breeding habitat not occupied by adult female kakapo, other kakapo may have been present in these areas.  To increase the proportion of females that breed in low rimu mast years, it may be necessary to remove sub-adult females or surplus adult males living in optimal breeding habitat from the island.  Alternatively, females in sub-optimal breeding habitat could be fed supplementary foods or transferred to other islands where there is unoccupied suitable breeding habitat available.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kakapo</field><field name="subject">Strigops habroptilus</field><field name="subject">Codfish Island</field><field name="subject">radio-tracking</field><field name="subject">home range</field><field name="subject">habitat selection</field><field name="subject">Ecological Niche Factor Analysis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/640</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of artificial neural networks for understanding and diagnosing the state of mastitis in dairy cattle</field><field name="creator">Hassan, K. J.</field><field name="description">Bovine mastitis adversely affects the dairy industry around the world.  This disease is caused by a diverse range of bacteria, broadly categorised as minor and major pathogens.  In-line tools that help identify these bacterial groupings in the early stages of the disease are advantageous as timely decisions could be made before the cow develops any clinical symptoms.  The first objective of this research was to identify the most informative milk parameters for the detection of minor and major bacterial pathogens.  The second objective of this research was to evaluate the potential of supervised and unsupervised neural network learning paradigms for the detection of minor infected and major infected quarters in the early stages of the disease.  The third objective was to evaluate the effects of different proportions of infected to non-infected cases in the training data set on the correct classification rate of the supervised neural network models as there are proportionately more non-infected cases in a herd than infected cases. A database developed at Lincoln University was used to achieve the research objectives.  Starting at calving, quarter milk samples were collected weekly from 112 cows for a period of fourteen weeks, resulting in 4852 samples with complete records for somatic cell count (SCC), electrical resistance, protein percentage, fat percentage, and bacteriological status.  To account for the effects of the stage of lactation on milk parameters with respect to days in milking, data was divided into three days in milk ranges.  In addition, cow variation was accounted for by the sire family from which the cow originated and the lactation number of each cow. Data was pre-processed before the application of advanced analytical techniques.  Somatic cell score (SCS) and electrical resistance index were derived from somatic cell count and electrical resistance, respectively.  After pre-processing, the data was divided into training and validation sets for the unsupervised neural network modelling experiment and, for the supervised neural network modelling experiments, the data was divided into training, calibration and validation sets. Prior to any modelling experiments, the data was analysed using statistical and multivariate visualisation techniques.  Correlations (p&lt;0.05) were found between the infection status of a quarter and its somatic cell score (SCS, 0.86), electrical resistance index (ERI, -0.59) and protein percentage (PP, 0.33).  The multivariate parallel visualisation analysis validated the correlation analysis.  Due to significant multicolinearity [Correlations: SCS and ERI (-0.65: p&lt;0.05); SCS and PP (0.32: p&lt;0.05); ERI and PP (-0.35: p&lt;0.05)], the original variables were decorrelated using principle component analysis. SCS and ERI were found to be the most informative variables for discriminating between non-infected, minor infected and major infected cases.  Unsupervised neural network (USNN) model was trained using the training data set which was extracted from the database, containing approximately equal number of randomly selected records for each bacteriological status [not infected (NI), infected with a major pathogen (MJI) and infected with a minor pathogen (MNI)].  The USNN model was validated with the remaining data using the four principle components, days in milk (DIM), lactation number (LN), sire number, and bacteriological status (BS).  The specificity of the USNN model in correctly identifying non infected cases was 97%. Sensitivities for correctly detecting minor and major infections were 89% and 80%, respectively. The supervised neural network (SNN) models were trained, calibrated and validated with several sets of training, calibration and validation data, which were randomly extracted from the database in such a way that each set has a different proportion of infected to non-infected cases ranging from 1:1 to 1:10.  The overall accuracy of these models based on validation data sets gradually increased with increase in the number of non-infected cases in the data sets (80% for the 1:1, 84% for 1:2, 86% for 1:4 and 93% for 1:10).  Specificities of the best models for correctly recognising non-infected cases for the four data sets were 82% for 1:1, 91% for 1:2, 94% for 1:4 and 98% for 1:10. Sensitivities for correctly recognising minor infected cases for the four data sets were 86% for 1:1, 76% for 1:2, 71% for 1:4 and 44% for 1:10. Sensitivities for correctly recognising major infected cases for the four data sets were 20% for 1:1, 20% for 1:2, 30% for 1:4 and 40% for 1:10. Overall, sensitivity for the minor infected cases decreased while that of major infected cases increased with increase in the number non-infected cases in the training data set. Due to the very low prevalence of MJI category in this particular herd, results for this category may be inconclusive. This research suggests that somatic cell score and electrical resistance index of milk were the most effective variables for detecting the infection status of a quarter followed by milk protein and fat percentage.  The neural network models were able to differentiate milk containing minor and major bacterial pathogens based on milk parameters associated with mastitis.  It is concluded that the neural network models can be developed and incorporated into milking machines to provide an efficient and effective method for the diagnosis of mastitis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mastitis</field><field name="subject">minor and major bacterial pathogens</field><field name="subject">somatic cell count</field><field name="subject">electrical resistance</field><field name="subject">principle component analysis</field><field name="subject">unsupervised neural networks</field><field name="subject">supervised neural networks</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The provision of recreation opportunities for people with disabilities : a tale of two cities</field><field name="creator">Dowsing, V. A.</field><field name="description">Disabled people comprise seventeen per cent of all New Zealanders and face barriers to participation in community life. This research examines the ways in which two local authorities - Manukau City Council and Christchurch City Council - provide recreation opportunities for people with disabilities and how these local authorities implement national legislation, policies and strategies which bear upon the provision of recreation services for the disabled. To achieve these aims, a comparative method which uses primary (interview) and secondary (documentary) data, is adopted.  Central government plays an important role in the provision of recreation to communities, including the disabled community. It develops legislation, strategies and policies that guide the provision of recreation services for people with disabilities at a local level. Local authorities provide &#8216;spaces&#8217; for recreation including parks, waterways and facilities, as part of their wider services and programmes. Their services respond to broader, including national, concerns, but also reflect local priorities and needs, including those of other &#8216;special&#8217; populations. The results of this research indicate that Manukau and Christchurch Cities consult the disabled community and its representatives and address the specific needs of this community. Both local authorities have policies which outline how disability issues will be addressed; a disability-specific position which acts as an &#8220;internal advocate&#8221; for the disabled community; and a reference group made up of members of the disabled community. In the case of Christchurch City Council, the &#8220;KiwiAble&#8221; programme, &#8220;KiwiAble Recreation Network&#8221;, &#8220;KiwiAble Leisure Card&#8221; and Inclusive Communities Coordinator are all disability-specific mechanisms that focus on the recreational needs of the disabled community. However, only one policy in these two cities - the Manukau City Council Disability Policy and Action Plan &#8211; draws explicit links to a national strategy.  On the basis of these results, a number of recommendations are made for future research and local authority action. It is hoped that the current study will provide practical advice and examples which local authorities can adopt, to further enhance recreational provisions for people with disabilities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="subject">recreation</field><field name="subject">local government</field><field name="subject">central government</field><field name="subject">disability theory</field><field name="subject">Manukau City</field><field name="subject">Christchurch City</field><field name="subject">qualitative research</field><field name="subject">case study research</field><field name="subject">comparative methods</field><field name="subject">leisure policy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370403 Recreation and leisure studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/672</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rootstock and canopy density effects on grape berry composition : organic acid composition, potassium content and pH</field><field name="creator">Thomson, C. C.</field><field name="description">The influence of rootstock and canopy density on grape berry composition was investigated over the summer of 2003-2004 on a commercial vineyard at Waipara, North Canterbury. This experiment was designed to investigate the influence of rootstock and canopy density on the acid composition, potassium (K) content and final pH of harvested fruit (Pinot Noir AM 10/5 Lincoln Selection). The trial block consisted of eight rootstocks laid out to an 8 x 8 latin square, each plot consisting of five vines of the same rootstock. Two canopy treatments were overlaid the block (down whole rows, assigned randomly, four rows to each treatment); one treatment allowed to grow naturally, in the other treatment the canopy was thinned removing double burst shoots and laterals. The bunch numbers were adjusted in the Unthinned canopy treatment (UCT) to match the Thinned canopy treatment (TCT). Information was gathered to assess: the canopy size and density (Pinot Quadrat Leaf Layer and Percent Gaps and canopy porosity), the plant yield (and berry size, berries per cluster, cluster weight, clusters per plant), plant K levels at flowering and veraison (from petioles and leaf blades) and berry composition at harvest (soluble solids (as brix), K, titratable acidity (TA), tartaric acid concentration, malic acid concentration and pH). The trial area was non-irrigated on clay loam soils and viticultural management was to best commercial practice. It was found that although rootstock influenced the levels of  K in the plant and in the juice at harvest, the level of K in the juice did not influence pH in this experiment (range of rootstock juice K: 808 ppm to 928 ppm, l.s.d. = 75 ppm). The level of tartaric acid concentration in the juice was found to be the dominant influence on the level of pH in this experiment (rootstock pH range: 3.21 to 3.39, l.s.d. = 0.05). The juice concentration of tartaric acid was influenced by both rootstock (rootstock range 4.0 to 4.7 g/L, l.s.d = 0.4) and canopy density (UCT = 4.1, TCT = 4.7, l.s.d. = 0.4), decreased shading positively increasing the level of tartaric acid. The malic acid concentration in the juice was positively influenced by increasing canopy density (UCT = 4.7 g/L, TCT = 4.1 g/L, l.s.d = 0.4) and this played a minor role in the determination of pH in this experiment; an influence of rootstock on the level of malic acid concentration was found. The malic acid concentration strongly influenced the determination of TA (UCT = 11.0 g/L, TCT = 10.2 g/L, l.s.d = 0.5); tartaric acid concentration had a minor influence on the recorded TA. Attempts to characterise the influence of rootstock on malic acid, tartaric acid and pH were inconclusive. Rootstock was found to influence the canopy variables measured in this experiment and the recorded average plant yield. Crosses of Vitis rupestris were found to exhibit the most canopy vigour and those derived from Vitis berlandieri and Vitis riparia the least. The Canopy treatment did not show an influence over yield but the rootstock was found to influence plant yield, through the numbers of berries set in a cluster and the final harvest cluster weight. The influence of rootstock on pH may be described by the influence it exerts on canopy growth and yield but this was thought unlikely. Further research is required to describe the nature of the rootstock influence on K, malic acid, tartaric acid and pH.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rootstock</field><field name="subject">grape vine</field><field name="subject">canopy density</field><field name="subject">leaf area</field><field name="subject">yield</field><field name="subject">fruit composition</field><field name="subject">malic acid</field><field name="subject">tartaric acid</field><field name="subject">potassium</field><field name="subject">pH</field><field name="subject">Pinot Noir</field><field name="subject">juice</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300305 Oenology and viticulture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/772</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ovine lens cytoskeleton</field><field name="creator">McDermott, Joshua D.</field><field name="description">The lens of the eye is a vital tissue in the visual system, responsible for the collection and focusing of light on to the retina. Comprised of epithelial cells at differing stages of differentiation, the transparency of the lens is dependent on the highly ordered crystalline structure of lens proteins. The lens consists of several proteins including crystallins (&#945;, &#946;, &#947;) that make up 90% of the soluble protein, and the lens cytoskeletal proteins. Cytoskeletal proteins contribute only a fraction of the total lens protein, but are thought to play an important role in the establishment and maintenance of transparency. Calpain-induced degradation of these proteins may be involved in the development of cataracts. This has been an area of research at Lincoln University where a flock of sheep genetically predisposed to cataract maintained as a cataract development model. The aim of this research was to investigate the distribution of cytoskeletal proteins in the lens, and to examine the effects of calpain proteolysis on these proteins, with the goal of establishing the role of the lens cytoskeletal proteins in the ovine cataract model. A combination of techniques was used including immunohistochemistry, which required the development of a specific protocol for ovine lenses. Cytoskeletal proteins were identified using immunohistochemistry in lens tissue sections and exhibited characteristic distributions. Actin displayed preferential distribution in the short sides of the fibre cells in the cortex of the lens but was absent in the lens nucleus, while spectrin in the cortex and nucleus was associated with the fibre cell membrane. Filensin was observed in the outer cortex of lens sections associated with the fibre cell membrane and cytoplasm, although the pattern of localisation was indistinct due to the abundance of filensin breakdown products. Vimentin displayed membrane and cytoplasmic association in the outer cortex that diminished toward the lens nucleus, with membrane associated vimentin only persisting in the deeper regions of the cortex and nucleus. Additionally, the effect of novel calpain inhibitors (Cat0059 and Cat811) in preventing proteolysis of lens cytoskeletal protein was investigated and compared with calpain inhibitors developed elsewhere (SJA6017). The inhibitors were tested at between 10 and 0.1 &#956;M (100 nM). All inhibitors were effective at 10 &#956;M. SJA6017 provided significant protection to vimentin at 1 &#956;M. Cat0059 was found to protect spectrin and filensin at 1 &#956;M, but not vimentin, while inhibitor Cat811 was found to protect spectrin only. SJA6017 added to assays at 100 nM offered significant protection to spectrin, and Cat0059 was found to protect filensin and spectrin to a significant degree at 100 nM, indicating the novel inhibitors were comparable to those developed elsewhere in terms of their effectiveness. Taken together, the evidence presented in this thesis shows the cytoskeletal proteins as crucial elements in the lens. Their pervasive presence coupled with evidence that lens cytoskeletal proteins are sensitive to calpain-induced proteolysis that is inhibited with novel calpain inhibitors suggests that the lens cytoskeletal proteins may be useful targets in cataract prevention for future research.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lens</field><field name="subject">immunohistochemistry</field><field name="subject">cytoskeleton</field><field name="subject">actin</field><field name="subject">spectrin</field><field name="subject">vimentin</field><field name="subject">filensin</field><field name="subject">fluorescence</field><field name="subject">microscopy</field><field name="subject">calpain</field><field name="subject">proteolysis</field><field name="subject">inhibitor</field><field name="subject">cataract</field><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300505 Anatomy and physiology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of a legume green manure crop on barley straw/stubble decomposition, and soil nitrogen retention and availability</field><field name="creator">Kapal, Debbie B.</field><field name="description">The incorporation of cereal straw/stubble often immobilises nitrogen (N). This can help conserve N in soil in organic forms, thus reducing loss through leaching over dormant winter periods. However, N-depressions that arise during decomposition can reduce crop yield. The inclusion of a legume green manure can supply fixed-N, thus alleviating the low N availability to crops. In this study, the effect of lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) green manure incorporation on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) straw/stubble decomposition, and N availability was investigated. A field experiment was used to determine the effects of the green manure on decomposition. Decomposition of straw/stubble was monitored using the litterbag technique. Following green manure incorporation, soil cores were incubated in a glasshouse to determine mineral-N availability. Though not significant, the inclusion of lupin green manure seemed to increase the decomposition of straw/stubble during the growth period, then slowing it after its incorporation at 110 d. This was described by a logarithmic pattern of loss of - 4.97 g AFDW residue day&#8315;&#185;, with 60% remaining after 140 d. Treatments without lupin had a linear decomposition of - 0.12 g AFDW residue day&#8315;&#185;, with 49% remaining after 140 d. The loss of cellulose confirmed the differences in decomposition with the inclusion of lupin resulting in 2.79% less cellulose remaining in straw/stubble after 140 d compared to its exclusion. Lupin significantly increased pot oat N uptake and DM yield by 55 % and 46 %, respectively, compared to its exclusion. However, this effect was not observed in field sown wheat yields and the soil mineral-N measurements made. This study showed that the potential of lupin to increase straw/stubble decomposition by improving the retention and availability of N, leading to long-term yield benefits, needed further investigation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nutrient cycling</field><field name="subject">arable cropping</field><field name="subject">Avena sativa L.</field><field name="subject">burning</field><field name="subject">crop residue</field><field name="subject">Hordeum vulgare L.</field><field name="subject">leaching</field><field name="subject">Lupinus angustifolius L.</field><field name="subject">nitrate</field><field name="subject">organic matter</field><field name="subject">Triticum aestivum L.</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of forest to pasture conversion on soil biological diversity and function</field><field name="creator">Lloyd, Davidson A.</field><field name="description">Recent declines in returns from primary forest products in New Zealand and projected increases in world food prices have led to the land-use conversion from plantation forest to pastoral farming in many lowland areas. After decades of forest cover the soils are in many cases less than adequate for pastoral farming, as they are acidic, with toxic levels of exchangeable aluminum, and contain low levels of available nitrogen (N), very high carbon (C):N ratio, and are devoid of earthworms and structural integrity. Overcoming the major site limitations of low soil pH and available N was a major priority and a field experiment was established in April 2005 to determine the impact of various rates of lime and N in relation to pasture establishment and production. Concerns about the short and long-term effects of these inputs on biological soil quality gave rise to the present study. The effects of land-use change and establishment inputs were assessed by comparison of selected treatment plots with two adjacent reference sites (long-term pasture and a 60&#8211;year Pinus radiata forest) on the same soil type. The effects of lime and N on soil biological quality were investigated under field and controlled environment conditions by determination of: microbial community structure (phospholipid fatty acids - PLFA), microbial biomass (total PLFA), and microbial activity (dehydrogenase activity). Soil physical (percentage water-stable aggregates) and chemical (pH, and total C and N) properties were also determined. Similarly, the effects of earthworm addition on soil biological properties were explored in a short-term glasshouse pot experiment. The role of earthworms as indicators of soil biological quality in the field was assumed by nematodes and these were assessed in field trial plots and the reference sites mentioned above. Land-use change and applications of lime and N contributed to changing the microbial community structure determined by principal component analysis of transformed PLFA data. However, the effect of lime was more pronounced in the field, while N contributed most to changing microbial community structure in the glasshouse. Mean microbial activity in the field increased from 4 &#181;g dwt/hr without lime to 16 and 21 &#181;g dwt/hr where lime was applied at 5 and 10 tons/hectare (t/ha), respectively. Mean microbial activity in the field was markedly higher (7-fold) than in the glasshouse at similar rates of lime. Lime application also increased soil moisture retention in the field, mean gravimetric soil moisture increased from 0.33 in control plots to 0.38 and 0.39 in plots treated with 5 and 10 t/ha lime, respectively. Lime application was associated with greater soil aggregate stability. Soils from test plots treated with 5 and 10 tons/ha lime had 45-50% water-stable aggregates compared to 34% in treatments without lime. After 16 weeks in pots, earthworm treatments increased mean plant dry matter (DM)/pot by at least 19% above the control. The increase was attributed primarily to greater N mineralization in the presence of earthworms. For the duration of the trial the earthworm species tested (Apporectodea caliginosa and Lumbricus rubellus, individually or combined) did not affect any of the measured soil microbial properties. However, the survival rate of A. caliginosa was 83% compared to 25% for L. rubellus. The control not receiving any lime or N and plots treated with 10t/ha lime and 200 kgN/ha had similar nematodes species composition, comprising 40% each of bacterial and fungal feeding nematodes. They differed markedly from the reference sites as the forest soil was dominated by plant associated species (38%) and the long-term pasture had 44% plant parasitic nematodes. Accordingly, the soil food web condition inferred from nematode faunal analysis characterized all test plots as basal, stressed and depleted, while the forest soil was categorized as highly structured and fungal dominated. The findings of this thesis demonstrated that land-use change from forest to pasture can have significant impacts on soil biological properties, earthworms can contribute to pasture productivity even in the short term, and nematode faunal analysis is a robust and reliable indicator of soil biological quality.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">forest</field><field name="subject">pasture</field><field name="subject">land-use change</field><field name="subject">microbial diversity</field><field name="subject">phospholipid fatty acid</field><field name="subject">earthworms</field><field name="subject">nematodes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300102 Soil biology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics of macroeconomic variables in Fiji : a cointegrated VAR analysis</field><field name="creator">Singh, Shiu Raj</field><field name="description">Abstract of thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Commerce and Management  Dynamics of macroeconomic variables in Fiji : a cointegrated VAR analysis  By Shiu Raj Singh  The objective of this study is to examine how macroeconomic variables of Fiji inter-relate with aggregate demand and co-determine one another using a vector autoregression (VAR) approach.  This study did not use a prior theoretical framework but instead used economic justification for selection of variables.    It was found that fiscal policy, which is generally used as a stabilisation tool, did not have a positive effect on real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the short term.  Effects on GDP growth were positive over the long term but not statistically significant.  Furthermore, expansionary fiscal policy caused inflationary pressures.  Fiji has a fixed exchange rate regime, therefore, it was expected that the focus of monetary policy would be the maintenance of foreign reserves.  It was, however, found that monetary expansion in the short term resulted in positive effects on real GDP growth and resulted in inflation.  The long term effects of monetary policy on real GDP growth were negative, which are explained by the fixed exchange rate regime, endogenous determination of money supply by the central bank, an unsophisticated financial market and, perhaps, an incomplete transmission of the policy.  Both merchandise trade and visitor arrivals growth were found to positively contribute to short term and long term economic growth.  Political instability was found not to have significant direct effects on real GDP growth but caused a significant decline in visitor arrivals which then negatively affected economic growth in the short term.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiji</field><field name="subject">forecast error variance decomposition</field><field name="subject">impulse response functions</field><field name="subject">cointegration</field><field name="subject">lag order selection</field><field name="subject">stationarity</field><field name="subject">export price index</field><field name="subject">government expenditure</field><field name="subject">visitor arrivals</field><field name="subject">merchandise trade</field><field name="subject">fiscal policy</field><field name="subject">monetary policy</field><field name="subject">real GDP</field><field name="subject">VECM</field><field name="subject">cointegrated VAR</field><field name="subject">VAR</field><field name="subject">macroeconomics</field><field name="subject">vector autoregression</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340208 Macroeconomics (incl. monetary and fiscal theory)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is the Chinese stock market overvalued?</field><field name="creator">Tan, Zhenhua</field><field name="description">The Chinese stock market has experienced tremendous growth and development over the past years. It is now the second largest stock market in Asia (after Japan). The increasing numbers of stock investors and the generally upward trend of the local stock indexes transform the Chinese stock market into one of the most actively traded stock market.  This study examined the &#8220;pricing errors&#8221; of the Chinese stock market. The intrinsic values of equities, which can be compared to actual index prices, were estimated using the dividend discount model. Using a database of daily dividend based index prices of Shanghai composite index 180 and Shenzhen composite index 100 from July 2002 to June 2005, our study shows the stocks were undervalued during the sample period, on average, by approximately 0.09% and 1% for Shanghai and Shenzhen composite indexes respectively. The result reveals during July 2002- June 2005, the Chinese stock markets were close to the real value. Another objective of this study is to examine the impact of the economic conditions on the &#8220;pricing errors&#8221; of Chinese stock market. We find that the Chinese stock markets are much price momentum driven. The relationships of the economic factors and the deviation between the estimated cost of equity (based on CAPM) and the implied cost of equity (based on the actual index prices) showed similar results. We conclude that the Chinese stock markets do not sufficiently reveal local economic conditions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stock valuation</field><field name="subject">stock markets</field><field name="subject">capitalisation</field><field name="subject">risks</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350300 Banking, Finance and Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/773</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-dispersal seed predation in a conifer-broadleaf forest remnant : the importance of exotic mammals</field><field name="creator">Berry, Christopher J.J.</field><field name="description">Despite extensive international acceptance of the critical role of mammalian post-dispersal seed predation in many plant communities, in New Zealand we have limited knowledge of these predators&#8217; influence on plant recruitment in our forests. The principle objective of my thesis was to determine the importance of exotic mammals as post-dispersal seed predators in a New Zealand conifer-broadleaf forest remnant. To address this goal, I used a series of field-based experiments where the actions of different post-dispersal seed predators were separated by wire-mesh exclosures.  My study was conducted at Mount Peel Forest Park Scenic Reserve, South Canterbury, New Zealand. Being a human modified conifer forest currently dominated by broadleaf species, it is typical of forest remnants in New Zealand. This presented an opportunity to study a wide range of both potential post-dispersal seed predators and broadleaf tree species.  My findings indicate that exotic mammals are not only post-dispersal seed predators at Peel Forest, but are responsible for the majority of post-dispersal predation events observed. Ship rats (Rattus rattus) were the dominant post-dispersal seed predators, while brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), house mice (Mus musculus) and native invertebrates were also important post-dispersal seed predators for several tree species. Through use of time-lapse video and cafeteria experiments I found that exotic mammalian seed predators, when compared to native invertebrate seed predators, preyed upon larger-seeded plant species and were responsible for considerable seed losses of several tree species. However, exotic mammalian seed predators do share several foraging characteristics with native invertebrate seed predators, as predators foraged in similar habitats and responded in a similar way to changes in seed density.  In investigating if post-dispersal seed predation by mammals had a flow-on effect to plant recruitment, I observed natural seedling densities at Peel Forest were significantly higher in the absence of mammalian seed predators, but I found no evidence that the presence of mammals significantly altered the overall species richness. At the community level, I did not find an interaction between habitat and exotic mammals, however I present evidence that for individual plant species a significant mammal : habitat interaction occurred. Consequently, even though my cafeteria experiment implied there was no significant difference in the overall amount of seed preyed upon within different habitats, the less favourable microsite conditions for germination under an intact continuous canopy allows mammals to exacerbate habitat-related patterns of seed mortality and have a noticeable effect on seedling establishment.  In an effort to validate the use of manipulative experiments to predict the long-term effect of post-dispersal seed predation on plant dynamics, I attempted to link results of my cafeteria experiment with observed seedling abundance at Peel Forest. Seven tree species were used in this comparison and a strong correlation was observed. This result shows that the level of post-dispersal seed predation determined in the cafeteria experiment provided a good predictor of the effect of mammalian post-dispersal seed predation on seedling establishment.  To fully gauge the impact of mammalian post-dispersal seed predators on seedling establishment, the relationship between these seed predators and the type of recruitment limitation experienced by a plant species was also investigated. By using a combination of seed addition, plot manipulations and seed predator exclusion I was able to investigate this relationship. I found evidence that seed limitation at Peel Forest is positively correlated with seed size, and that while mammalian post-dispersal seed predators can further reduce plant recruitment of plant species experiencing seed limitation, the influence of mammals in determining plant recruitment was limited for plant species experiencing microsite limitation.  My study has proven that exotic mammals are now the dominant post-dispersal seed predators at Peel Forest, the amount of seed preyed upon varies among plant species, and post-dispersal seed predation by mammalian species can lead to differences in seedling richness and abundance. I proved that the influence of exotic mammals on seedling establishment is also linked to habitat structure and recruitment limitations. When combined these observations suggest that exotic mammalian post-dispersal seed predators may play an important role in determining landscape abundance and distribution of plants at Peel Forest.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">post-dispersal seed predation</field><field name="subject">seedling establishment</field><field name="subject">recruitment limitation</field><field name="subject">cafeteria experiment</field><field name="subject">seed addition</field><field name="subject">time-lapse video analysis</field><field name="subject">exotic mammals</field><field name="subject">seed traits</field><field name="subject">conifer-broadleaf forest</field><field name="subject">Rattus rattus</field><field name="subject">Mus musculus</field><field name="subject">Trichosurus vulpecula</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270703 Terrestrial ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bacterial leaching from dairy shed effluent applied to a fine sandy loam under flood and spray irrigations</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Shuang</field><field name="description">Land application of wastes has become increasingly popular, to promote nutrient recycling and environmental protection, with soil functioning as a partial barrier between wastes and groundwater. Dairy shed effluent (DSE), may contain a wide variety of pathogenic micro-organisms, including bacteria (e.g. Salmonella paratyphyi, Escherichia coli. and Campylobacter), protozoa and viruses. Groundwater pathogen contamination resulting from land-applied DSE is drawing more attention with the intensified development of the dairy farm industry in New Zealand. The purpose of this research was to investigate the fate and transport of bacterial indicator-faecal coliform (FC) from land-applied DSE under different irrigation practices via field lysimeter studies, using two water irrigation methods (flood and sprinkler) with contrasting application rates, through the 2005-2006 irrigation season. It was aimed at better understanding, quantifying and modelling of the processes that govern the removal of microbes in intact soil columns, bridging the gap between previous theoretical research and general farm practices, specifically for Templeton soil. This study involved different approaches (leaching experiments, infiltrometer measurements and a dye infiltration study) to understand the processes of transient water flow and bacterial transport; and to extrapolate the relationships between bacterial transport and soil properties (like soil structure, texture), and soil physical status (soil water potential &#968; and volumetric water content &#952;). Factors controlling FC transport are discussed. A contaminant transport model, HYDRUS-1D, was applied to simulate microbial transport through soil on the basis of measured datasets. This study was carried out at Lincoln University&#8217;s Centre for Soil and Environmental Quality (CSEQ) lysimeter site. Six lysimeters were employed in two trials. Each trial involved application of DSE, followed by a water irrigation sequence applied in a flux-controlled method. The soil columns were taken from the site of the new Lincoln University Dairy Farm, Lincoln, Canterbury. The soil type is Templeton fine sandy loam (Udic-Ustochrept, coarse loamy, mixed, mesic). Vertical profiles (at four depths) of &#952; and &#968; were measured during leaching experiments. The leaching experiments directly measured concentrations of chemical tracer (Br&#8315; or Cl&#8315;) and FC in drainage. Results showed that bacteria could readily penetrate through 700 mm deep soil columns, when facilitated by water flow. In the first (summer) trial, FC in leachate as high as 1.4&#215;10&#8310; cfu 100 mL&#8315;&#185; (similar to the DSE concentration), was detected in one lysimeter that had a higher clay content in the topsoil, immediately after DSE application, and before any water irrigation. This indicates that DSE flowed through preferential flow paths without significant treatment or reduction in concentrations. The highest post-irrigation concentration was 3.4&#215;10&#179; cfu 100 mL&#8315;&#185; under flood irrigation. Flood irrigation resulted in more bacteria and Br&#8315; leaching than spray irrigation. In both trials (summer and autumn) results showed significant differences between irrigation treatments in lysimeters sharing similar drainage class (moderate or moderately rapid). Leaching bacterial concentration was positively correlated with both &#952; and &#968;, and sometimes drainage rate. Greater bacterial leaching was found in the one lysimeter with rapid whole-column effective hydraulic conductivity, Keff, for both flood and spray treatments. Occasionally, the effect of Keff on water movement and bacterial transport overrode the effect of irrigation. The &#8216;seasonal condition&#8217; of the soil (including variation in initial water content) also influenced bacterial leaching, with less risk of leaching in autumn than in summer. A tension infiltrometer experiment measured hydraulic conductivity of the lysimeters at zero and 40 mm suction. The results showed in most cases a significant correlation between the proportion of bacteria leached and the flow contribution of the macropores. The higher the Ksat, the greater the amount of drainage and bacterial leaching obtained. This research also found that this technique may exclude the activity of some continuous macropores (e.g., cracks) due to the difference of initial wetness  which could substantially change the conductivity and result in more serious bacterial leaching in this Templeton soil. A dye infiltration study showed there was great variability in water flow patterns, and most of the flow reaching deeper than 50 cm resulted from macropores, mainly visible cracks. The transient water flow and transport of tracer (Br&#8315;) and FC were modelled using the HYDRUS-1D software package. The uniform flow van Genuchten model, and the dual-porosity model were used for water flow and the mobile-immobile (MIM) model was used for tracer and FC transport. The hydraulic and solute parameters were optimized during simulation, on the basis of measured datasets from the leaching experiments. There was evidence supporting the presence of macropores, based on the water flow in the post-DSE application stage. The optimised saturated water content (&#952;s) decreased during the post-application process, which could be explained in terms of macropore flow enhanced by irrigation. Moreover, bacterial simulation showed discrepancies in all cases of uniform flow simulations at the very initial stage, indicating that non-equilibrium processes were dominant during those short periods, and suggesting that there were strong dynamic processes involving structure change and subsequently flow paths. It is recommended that management strategies to reduce FC contamination following application of DSE in these soils must aim to decrease preferential flow by adjusting irrigation schemes. Attention needs to be given to a) decreasing irrigation rates at the beginning of each irrigation; b) increasing the number of irrigations, by reducing at the same time the amount of water applied and the irrigation rate at each irrigation; c) applying spray irrigation rather than flood irrigation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bacterial leaching</field><field name="subject">lysimeter</field><field name="subject">soil structure</field><field name="subject">flood irrigation</field><field name="subject">spray irrigation</field><field name="subject">macropore flow</field><field name="subject">drainage rate</field><field name="subject">pressure head</field><field name="subject">volumetric water content</field><field name="subject">tension infiltrometer</field><field name="subject">dye study</field><field name="subject">HYDRUS-1D</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">parameter optimization</field><field name="subject">Templeton soil</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300101 Soil physics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300102 Soil biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/668</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ectomycorrhizal communities associated with a Pinus radiata plantation in the North Island, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Walbert, Katrin</field><field name="description">Aboveground and belowground ectomycorrhizal (ECM) communities associated with different age classes of the exotic plantation species Pinus radiata were investigated over the course of two years in the North Island of New Zealand. ECM species were identified with a combined approach of morphological and molecular (restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequencing) analysis. ECM species richness and diversity of a nursery in Rotorua, and stands of different ages (1, 2, 8, 15 and 26 yrs of age at time of final assessment) in Kaingaroa Forest, were assessed above- and belowground; furthermore, the correlation between the above- and belowground ECM communities was assessed. It was found that the overall and stand specific species richness and diversity of ECM fungi associated with the exotic host tree in New Zealand were low compared to similar forests in the Northern Hemisphere but similar to other exotic plantations in the Southern Hemisphere. Over the course of this study, 18 ECM species were observed aboveground and 19 ECM species belowground. With the aid of molecular analysis the identities of Laccaria proxima and Inocybe sindonia were clarified. In the aboveground study, five species were found associated with P. radiata that were previously not reported with this host in New Zealand (Inocybe sindonia, Lactarius rufus, Lycoperdon gunii, Rhizopogon pseudoroseolus and Wilcoxina mikolae). Belowground, the species Psudotomentella sp., P. tristis, R. luteorubescens, Tomentella sp., Wilcoxina mikolae were found as new associates of P. radiata in New Zealand, additionally nine ECM types were found that could not be identified with molecular analysis. There was little correlation between the species fruiting and the species colonising root tips. Only seven species were found in common between the above- and belowground communities, furthermore the dominant species aboveground were not observed in the belowground ECM communities. The influence of host age on the above- and belowground ECM communities of different age classes of P. radiata plantations was investigated. The aboveground species richness increased from the nursery to the oldest age group investigated (26 yrs), while diversity increased to the 15 yr old age group and decreased slightly to the oldest stand. A clear sequence of ECM species changes was observed to be related to stand age with a growing complexity over the chronosequence. The belowground ECM communities showed a different picture and richness and diversity initially decreased from the nursery to the outplanting but increased thereafter. Belowground no change in ECM composition that was directly related to the age of the host was observed, but two distinct groups of ECM species were found &#8211; a 'young' and a 'plantation forest' group, with the respective discriminating species being Rhizopogon rubescens  and Type unknown Basidiomycete/Amanita muscaria. Another aspect of the study was the fate of the nursery ECM species in the outplanting and the arrival of non-nursery species. The ECM communities of seedlings in the nursery were investigated in 2006 and these seedlings were followed up over eight assessments in the field for one year, furthermore data from the 1-, 2 and 8 yr old plantation stands was analysed. It was found that the nursery species do survive the first year of outplanting and are dominant in the first year. The first non-nursery species occurred six months after outplanting but was only in minor abundance. Nursery ECM were dominant for two years after the seedlings were planted, and were completely replaced after seven years. Rhizopogon rubescens was found to be the most persistent and dominant species in the outplanting, facilitating the successful establishment of the seedlings in the plantation forest.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ectomycorrhiza</field><field name="subject">Pinus radiata</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">exotic plantation</field><field name="subject">diversity</field><field name="subject">succession</field><field name="subject">ITS-RFLP</field><field name="subject">direct sequencing</field><field name="subject">above- and belowground</field><field name="subject">outplanting</field><field name="subject">species displacement</field><field name="subject">nursery</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology::270305 Mycology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300600 Forestry Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The phenomenon of risk and its management in natural resource recreation and tourism settings : a case study of Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers, Westland National Park, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Espiner, Stephen</field><field name="description">The significance of risk is growing in many Western societies, a phenomenon linked to increasing individualism, personal choice, and outcome uncertainty in multiple spheres of life. Despite being healthier and more physically protected from harm than any previous society, a serious concern for safety and risk control is emerging as a defining characteristic of modern social life. Within the context of a risk-averse society, this thesis investigates the nature and relevance of risk in natural resource recreation and tourism settings. Millions of people every day visit national parks and other protected areas around the world in which natural hazards inhere. Many visitors fail to recognise these hazards, creating moral, legal, and ethical issues for natural resource managers. People travel to national parks anticipating a degree of adventure, to escape routines, and to witness the grandeur of nature. Ironically, the very qualities that attract people to natural areas may also put them at risk. Managers of natural resource tourism and recreation areas in New Zealand are confronted with a paradox born out of visitor demand for nature experiences, a legal obligation to facilitate free access, and a growing social emphasis on health and safety. In particular, this study assesses the risk perceptions of visitors to the Fox and Franz Josef glaciers, popular tourist attractions on the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island, and explores the risk perceptions and beliefs of resource management agency staff. The study also investigates the issue of risk communication at these two sites, and the degree to which existing hazard messages are successful at encouraging appropriate visitor behaviour. Pictorial hazard warning signs are introduced to the sites and their effectiveness evaluated. The findings show that many visitors (especially international visitors) have relatively poor awareness of natural hazards, and behave in ways which potentially compromise physical safety. It is argued that perceptions and behaviour are a consequence of diverse individual and situational factors including limited knowledge of the sites, beliefs about management, poor comprehension of hazard warning signs, and freedom from the normative constraints of everyday life. In contrast to visitors, managers at the glacier sites consider the risks to be significant, and, potentially, severe. It is argued that managers' perceptions of risk are influenced by several important social and site-specific factors, including their own experiences of hazards at the glaciers, perceived legal and moral obligations, the organisational culture, and impressions of high societal expectation concerning safety. The situation is further complicated by the freedom of access principle in national parks, and increasing tourist demand for nature-based experiences. These factors governed beliefs about the subject of risk. This study identifies several dimensions of risk in nature-based recreation and tourism settings. Visitors are at risk of personal accident or injury at certain tourism attractions. Awareness of hazards is limited, visitor behaviour compromises safety, and existing communication strategies are only partially effective. Risk is also apparent in the agency responsible for management of outdoor recreation areas. Site managers perceive a risk in their failure to prevent visitors from harm, whereas senior managers identify risk as primarily financial, legal, and political. Collectively, these factors demonstrate that the phenomenon of risk is increasingly important in the tourism and recreation context, and has the potential to influence significantly both management and experience of protected natural areas in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">perception</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">warning signs</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">natural hazards</field><field name="subject">safety</field><field name="subject">national parks</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">recreation</field><field name="subject">Fox Glacier</field><field name="subject">Franz Josef Glacier</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370403 Recreation and leisure studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321201 Environmental and occupational health and safety</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology and diversity of indigenous Trichoderma species in vegetable cropping systems</field><field name="creator">Bourguignon, Emmanuel</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this research was to improve the understanding of the ecology and diversity of Trichoderma species within the soil and rhizosphere of onion (Allium cepa L.) and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) under intensive management in New Zealand. The indigenous Trichoderma population was measured in a field trial at Pukekohe over a three year period under six different crop rotation treatments. The treatments included two continuous onion and potato rotations (intensive), two onion/potato mixed rotation (conventional), and two green manure rotations (sustainable). Results showed that Trichoderma populations were stable in both the rhizosphere and bulk soil (1.5 x 10&#178; to 8.5 x 10&#179; CFU g&#8315;&#185; ODS). The planting and incorporation of an oat (Avena sativa L.) green manure in the sustainable rotations positively increased Trichoderma colony forming unit (CFU) numbers in the rhizosphere soil from 3.4 x 10&#178; to 2.5 x 10&#179; g&#8315;&#185; ODS. A Trichoderma species identification method was developed based on colony morphology. Representative isolates were verified using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequencing. The method allowed for rapid and reliable identification of isolated Trichoderma species. Five species were identified in the Pukekohe soil: T. asperellum, T. atroviride, T. hamatum, T. harzianum and T. koningii. Results showed identical species diversity between the rhizosphere, rhizoplane and bulk soil. The species did not strongly compete between each other for the rhizosphere ecological niche and differences in species proportions seemed to be caused by environmental factors rather than the rotation treatments. The incorporation of oat green manure in pots did not significantly promote the indigenous Trichoderma population size and diversity in the rhizosphere of onion plants up to 4 months old. The identified species were the same as in the field trial. The incorporation of onion scale residues was shown to result in low Trichoderma and high Penicillium CFU numbers and a reduction in plant size. Additionally, the presence of high levels (6.0 x 10&#8309; CFU g&#8315;&#185; ODS) of Penicillium CFU was negatively correlated with the presence of Trichoderma CFU. The effect of oat incorporation on Trichoderma saprophytic growth was also investigated in a soil sandwich assay and revealed no significant differences. A series of experiments indicated that onion extract obtained from dry onion scale residues had no antifungal activity against either Trichoderma or Penicillium and instead tended to promote their hyphal growth and sporulation. It also showed that competition between Penicillium and Trichoderma isolates was limited despite the ability of Penicillium to produce a wide range of inhibitory substances. Four indigenous Trichoderma species (T. atroviride, T. hamatum, T. harzianum and T. koningii) were shown to be rhizosphere competent in a split tube experiment over a 6 week period. The results of this experiment revealed that, the Trichoderma species clearly displayed differences in their ability to colonise the rhizosphere of young onion seedlings. Species such as T. koningii had the greatest rhizosphere colonising ability regardless of soil depth while T. harzianum displayed the weakest ability. Results also indicated that when inoculated as a mixture the four species competed with one another to colonise the rhizosphere. Overall, this research indicated that the studied crop rotation treatments and the use of oat as a green manure did not strongly promote indigenous Trichoderma populations. Species diversity was constant throughout the research with T. hamatum and T. koningii being the most frequently isolated species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trichoderma</field><field name="subject">rhizosphere</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">indigenous</field><field name="subject">population</field><field name="subject">crop rotation</field><field name="subject">Allium cepa L.</field><field name="subject">Solanum tuberosum L.</field><field name="subject">Avena sativa L.</field><field name="subject">green manure</field><field name="subject">amendments</field><field name="subject">species diversity</field><field name="subject">identification</field><field name="subject">RFLP</field><field name="subject">Penicillium</field><field name="subject">rhizosphere competence</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300102 Soil biology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology::270305 Mycology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Institutionalising the picturesque: the discourse of the New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects</field><field name="creator">Bowring, Jacky</field><field name="description">Despite its origins in England two hundred years ago, the picturesque continues to influence landscape architectural practice in late twentieth-century New Zealand. The evidence for this is derived from a close reading of the published discourse of the New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects, particularly the now defunct professional journal, The Landscape. Through conceptualising the picturesque as a language, a model is developed which provides a framework for recording the survey results.

The researcher substantiates this argument by exploring the 'participatory tourism planning' concept in detail. Based on this approach, the community is identified as a primary customer for whom tourism marketers have ignored involving in their marketing attention, messages and programmes. The fundamental concept - marketing orientation and customer orientation - combined with emerging marketing theories were reviewed in order to help examine how destination marketing, a community-driven approach, should be implemented within a destination area. This examination of marketing and community based tourism planning set a platform for this research. This analysis examines relevance, applicability and potential for an integration of these two pervasive approaches for tourism planning. Guided by the theoretical examination, an integrated community-based tourism planning and marketing model was proposed. In order to explore gaps between the proposed model and its practicality, three destination areas (Phuket, Samui and Songkla-Hatyai) in Thailand were studied and evaluated. At this pragmatic level, this thesis identified impediments confronting national and local tourism organisations. The findings of this study draw a particular attention to institutional challenges which require clear identification of responsibilities and coordination of all actors involved in the planning and marketing process. These selected case studies have not only provided critical commentaries to assist tourism planners improve strategically their marketing approaches within community tourism planning, but they also have helped provide avenues for future research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">tourism planning</field><field name="subject">tourism marketing</field><field name="subject">community participation</field><field name="subject">societal marketing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/671</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling germination and early seedling growth of radiata pine</field><field name="creator">Bloomberg, Mark</field><field name="description">Background: This study seeks to model aspects of the regeneration of radiata pine (Pinus radiata D.Don) seedlings under a range of environmental conditions.   This study investigated whether &#8220;hybrid&#8221; mechanistic models, which predict plant growth and development using empirical representations of plant physiological responses to the environment, could provide a realistic alternative to conventional empirical regeneration models.    Objectives: The objectives of this study were to 1) identify the functional relationships between the environmental conditions controlling germination, establishment and growth of radiata pine seedlings, under a range of those environmental conditions as specified by temperature and available light and soil water; and 2) specify those functional relationships in hybrid mechanistic (&#8220;hybrid&#8221;) models.  Methods: Radiata pine seedling germination and growth were measured under controlled environmental conditions (incubators for seed germination, growth cabinets for seedlings), and results used to adapt, parameterise and test two published hybrid models; one for germination (the hydrothermal time model); and one for seedling growth in the first six months after germination, based on plant radiation use efficiency (RUE).  The hydrothermal model was tested by incubating  commercial radiata pine seeds under factorial combinations of temperature and water potentials where germination was likely to occur (12.5 &#186;C to 32.5 &#186;C and 0 MPa to &#8211;1.2 MPa.).  100 seeds were germinated for each factorial combination. The hydrothermal germination model was fitted to the germination data  using non-linear regression modles, will allowed simultaneous estimation of all modle parameters.  Seedlings were grown in controlled growth cabinets, and their RUE was calculated as the ratio of net primary production (NPP, specified in terms of an increase in oven dry biomass), to PAR intercepted or absorbed by a seedling. Estimation of seedling RUE required development of novel techniques for non-destructive estimation of seedling oven dry weight, and measurement of PAR interception by seedlings. The effect of varying PAR flux density on RUE was tested by measuring RUE of seedlings grown at 125, 250 and 500 &#181;mol m&#8315;&#178; s&#8315;&#185;.  In a second experiment, the effect of deficits in available soil water on RUE was tested by measuring RUE of seedlings grown under 250 &#181;mol m&#8315;&#178; s&#8315;&#185; PAR flux, and at different levels of available soil water.  Available soil water was specified by a soil moisture modifier factor (&#402;&#952;) which ranges between 1 for moist soils and 0 for soils where there is insufficient water for seedling growth. This soil moisture modifier had not previously been applied in studies of tree seedling growth. Temperatures for both seedling experiments were a constant 17.5 &#186;C (day) and 12.5 &#186;C (night). Results: Hydrothermal time models accurately described radiata pine seed germination. Model predictions were closely correlated with actual seed germination over the full range of temperature and water potentials where germination was likely to occur (12.5 &#186;C to 32.5 &#186;C and 0 MPa to &#8211;1.2 MPa. The minimum temperature for germination (base temperature)  was 9.0 &#186;C. Optimum temperatures for germination ranged from ~20&#186;C for slow-germinating seeds to ~27 &#186;C for the fastest germinating seeds.  The minimum water potential for seed germination varied within the seed population, with an approximately normal distribution (base water potential = &#8211;1.38 MPa, standard deviation of 0.48 MPa). In the process of developing the model, a novel explanation for the decline in germination rates at supra-optimal temperatures was developed (Section 3.4.6), based on earlier models proposed by Alvarado &amp; Bradford (2002) and  Rowse &amp; Finch-Savage (2003). This explanation was that the decline in germination rate was not driven just by temperature, but by accumulated hydrothermal time above the base temperature for germination (T&#8320;). This in turn raised the base soil water potential (&#936;b) towards 0, so that the reduction in germination rate arose from a reduced accumulation of hydro-time, rather than from thermal denaturation of enzymes facilitating germination &#8211; the conventional explanation for non-linear accumulation of thermal time at supra-optimal temperatures for plant development.  Upwards adjustment (towards 0 MPa) of base water potentials of germinating seeds occurred also at very cold temperatures in combination with high water potentials. In both cases (very cold or else supra-optimal temperatures) this upwards adjustment in base water potentials prevented germination of part of the seed population, and is proposed as a mechanism which enables seed populations to &#8220;hedge their bets&#8221; when germinating under less than ideal germination conditions. RUE of young germinated radiata pine seedlings growing in a controlled growth cabinet was not significantly different over a range of constant PAR flux densities. Mean RUE&#8217;s were 3.22, 2.82 and 2.58 g MJ&#8315;&#185; at 125, 250 and 500 &#181;mol m&#8315;&#178; s&#8315;&#185; respectively. In the second experiment, the novel use of a soil moisture modifier (&#402;&#952;) to predict RUE of seedlings subjected to water stress proved  successful within a limited range of soil water stress conditions. Measured seedling transpiration and stomatal conductance were closely correlated but seedling photosynthesis was less correlated with available soil water. This result suggests that photosynthesis was not coupled with stomatal conductance when PAR flux was 250 &#181;mol m&#8315;&#178; s&#8315;&#185;, which is well below saturating irradiance for C&#8323; plants. Conclusions: The use of hybrid, quasi-mechanistic models to describe tree seedling growth has been seldom explored, which necessitated the development of novel experimental and analytical techniques for this study. These included a predictive model of germination decline at sub- and supra-optimal temperatures; a method for accurately estimating seedling dry weights under a range of  PAR flux densities; and a novel method for estimating light interception by small seedlings. The work reported in this thesis showed that existing hybrid models (the hydrothermal time germination model and the RUE model) can be adapted to model germination and growth of radiata pine seedlings under controlled environmental conditions.  Nonetheless, further research is needed before the models can be confidently used as an alternative to conventional empirical models to model regeneration in &#8220;real-world&#8221; forests. Research priorities are the performance of hydrothermal germination models under variable field conditions, and the use of the soil moisture modifier for seedlings growing on a range of soil textures and under a range of PAR fluxes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mechanistic model</field><field name="subject">Pinus radiata</field><field name="subject">hydrothermal time models</field><field name="subject">RUE</field><field name="subject">hybrid model</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial complexity and microclimatic responses of epiphyte communities and their invertebrate fauna in the canopy of northern rata (Metrosideros robusta A. Cunn.: Myrtaceae) on the West Coast of the South Island, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Affeld, Kathrin</field><field name="description">Rain forest canopies are renowned for their very high biodiversity and the critical role they play in key ecological processes and their influence on global climate. Despite that New Zealand supports one of the most diverse and extensive epiphyte flora of any temperate forest system, few studies have investigated epiphyte communities and their invertebrate fauna along with factors that influence their distribution and composition. This thesis represents the first comprehensive study of entire epiphyte communities and their resident invertebrate fauna in the canopy of New Zealand&#8217;s indigenous forests. The aim of this study was to determine spatial patterns of epiphyte and invertebrate species richness, abundance and community composition in relation to abiotic variables, and in particular, the responses of these communities to elevated temperature and rainfall. This study was carried out in coastal lowland podocarp-broadleaved forests at two sites on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. Samples from 120 mat-forming epiphyte assemblages located on inner canopy branches of 40 northern rata (Metrosideros robusta) trees were studied to characterise the component flora and fauna. Additionally, biomass, branch and tree characteristics and community responses to treatments designed to elevate temperature and rainfall to simulate predicted climate change were measured.  This investigation revealed astonishing diversity and functional complexity of epiphyte and invertebrate life in this ecosystem. The 30.6 kg (dry weight) of epiphyte material collected contained a total of 567 species, 170 epiphyte and 397 invertebrate (excluding immature specimens and mites) species, including at least 10 species new to science and many undescribed species Epiphyte communities were found to be dominated by non-vascular plants (80 % of the total species richness), particularly liverworts and invertebrate communities were dominated with respect to abundance (~ 80 % of the total individuals) by Acari, Collembola and Hymenoptera (primarily ants) and functionally by scavengers and ants.  Epiphyte and invertebrate communities were highly variable with respect to spatial patterning of species richness, abundance and composition across sites, among trees within sites and among branches within trees. Overall, a highly significant proportion, &gt; 75 %, of the variance could be attributed to differences at the branch level, but these differences could not be explained by the environmental factors measured. There were no consistent relationships between the spatial pattern of epiphytes and invertebrates, or between vascular and non-vascular plants. However, there were significant positive correlations between epiphyte biomass and invertebrate species richness (r = 0.472; p &lt; 0.0001) and abundance (r = -0.395; p &lt; 0.0001), as well as non-living epiphyte biomass and scavenger species richness (r = 0.4; p &lt; 0.0001). Microclimatic measurements taken on epiphyte mats were also highly variable with respect to temperature and relative humidity at similar physical locations within the same tree as well as across trees within sites. There was also considerable variation in the intensity and frequency of climatic extremes, although potentially harmful climatic conditions were experienced by all the epiphyte mats for which weather variables were measured. Negative correlations existed between both epiphyte and invertebrate community composition and increased temperatures expressed as cumulative degree days above 5&#730;C. However, variability was such that there was no direct evidence that increased temperature and rainfall treatments had an effect on invertebrate species richness, abundance or diversity.  Northern rata host trees harbour an astonishingly diverse and complex canopy flora and fauna that is characterised by high spatial variability. Such variability highlights that to determine species distribution and community dynamics in canopy habitats in response to disturbance caused either by climate change or invasive species the structure of entire communities at different taxonomic and spatial scales, along with their responses to microclimatic factors, need to be studied. If such complexities are not taken into account, inappropriate interpretation may result in poor decisions concerning the conservation status, vulnerability and subsequent management of such unique ecosystems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">abundance</field><field name="subject">biomass</field><field name="subject">bryophytes</field><field name="subject">canopy</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">colonisation</field><field name="subject">community composition</field><field name="subject">epiphytes</field><field name="subject">guild composition</field><field name="subject">invertebrates</field><field name="subject">lichens</field><field name="subject">microclimate</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">non-vascular plants</field><field name="subject">relative humidity</field><field name="subject">species richness</field><field name="subject">temperate rain forest</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="subject">vapour pressure deficit</field><field name="subject">vascular plants</field><field name="subject">060208 - Terrestrial Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/771</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Loan contracting and the credit cycle</field><field name="creator">Jericevic, Sandra Lynne</field><field name="description">The performance of financial institutions is significantly influenced by the actions of loan officers.

The thesis demonstrates that the magic lantern was popular as entertainment on both a private, domestic and a public scale. It traces its widespread adoption in two broad institutional contexts, the educational and the religious, and shows how this wide-ranging practice and consumption was supported by developing social and commercial infrastructure in the colonies and a network of touring lanternists. It argues that the magic lantern located the Australasian colonial culture within a global one centred around the consumption of visual technology and an international exchange of images. Colonial audiences were not, however, merely the passive recipients of a globalised imagery or culture. They were active contributors to it, constructing their own meanings in response to imported images. The thesis argues that, while the magic lantern functioned to affirm a sense of imperial identity in both colonisers and the colonised, it was adapted locally to the creation of colonial, intercolonial and regional identities, as an alternative to a dominant Eurocentric mass-mediated world view. Colonial practitioners applied this powerful medium to the generation of images at a local level that reveal an enthusiasm for colonial events and stories, a sense of place, and a celebration of local identity on the big screen.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lantern projection, projectors, Australia-history, New Zealand-history, lantern slides, pictorial works</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative methods for hydrological spatial field comparison</field><field name="creator">Wealands, Stephen Russell</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the current lack of comprehensive, quantitative methods for comparing hydrological spatial fields. Comparison of spatial fields is needed for assessing hydrological models and for data assimilation. The methods that are currently used for quantitative comparison generally fail to consider the spatial arrangement of element values within spatial fields. Instead, there is a dependence on qualitative methods (e.g. visual comparison) to undertake comparison of many aspects (e.g. intermediate scale features), but such methods are non-repeatable, often biased and difficult to report on. This thesis advances the comparison methods available for use with hydrological spatial fields.

Vocal pedagogy in Australia is largely derived from European models, yet many vocal teachers in Australia of the present day have little or no idea of the origins of their technique. After mapping pedagogical lineages of vocal teachers throughout Australia from 1850 to 1950, an attempt has been made to document and analyse the history of vocal pedagogy in Australia, particularly the influence of the vocal technique originating from the teaching of Manuel Garcia and his pupil Mathilde Marchesi, and other teachers trained in traditional Italian vocal technique.

However, in 1976, two groups of scientists, one in New Zealand, the other in India, independently published essentially the same radical alternative to the double helix. The alternative, Side-By-Side (SBS) or &#8216;warped zipper&#8217; conformation for DNA is not helical. Rather than intertwine, as do Watson and Crick&#8217;s helices, its two exoskeletal strands are topologically independent. Thus, unlike the double helix, they may separated during replication without unwinding. This dissertation presents, but does not arbitrate among scientific arguments. Its concerns are meta-scientific; in particular, why and how the individuals who invented the &amp; &#8216;warped zipper&#8217; came to do so. Against Popper and most recent philosophers of science, it is taken to be &#8220;the business of epistemology to produce what has been called a &#8216;rational reconstruction&#8217; of the steps that have led the scientist to a discovery [Popper (1972), p.31, emphasis in the original].&#8221; On the received view, the invention of the &#8216;warped zipper&#8217; must be irrational or, at best, non-rational  thereby excluding from philosophical investigation. I establish that this philosophical dogma is not true a priori, as is usually supposed, and, in the case of the SBS structure of DNA, false a posteriori.

This study traces the progress of a science project on spiders in an Australian early childhood centre which purports to have an emergent curriculum. In particular, this study sought to answer the question: What form does a science learning project take in an early childhood class that purports to have an emergent curriculum philosophy? What are the processes involved? What are the roles of the main players? Was this curriculum truly an emergent one? How did it fit with the different perspectives being taken to emergent curriculum in the literature? Did science learning take place? How did this learning fit with current views on science learning in the literature? Using a participant observation approach, this study looks at factors that characterise the processes and the players in this project and considers these in the context of current views on emergent curriculum and early childhood science. Results indicate that while the curriculum in this centre was clearly &#8216;emergent&#8217;, it differed in some minor aspects from both the Reggio Emilia model and the American model of emergent curriculum. The approach used was consistent with the social constructivist approach to science teaching and was clearly conductive to the children's science learning.

The Cartesian culture/nature binary is seen to be one reason for the mistreatment of animals in society. The thesis investigates to what extent the binary is challenged or reinforced through the act of visiting animals within an ecotourism context. To this end the thesis looks at the ways in which marine animals are produced for and consumed by the tourism industry in Australia.

In this study, such a data set has been prepared for Australia by adjusting raw mean annual temperature data for inhomogeneities associated with station relocations, changes in exposure, and other problems. Temperature records from long-term stations were collaborated from the set of all raw data held by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. These long-term records were extended by combining stations and manually entering previously unused archived temperature measurements. An objective procedure was developed to determine the necessary adjustments, in conjunction with complementary statistical methods and station history documentation. The objective procedure involved creating a reference time series for each long-term station, from the median values at surrounding, well-correlated stations. Time series of annual mean maximum and mean minimum temperatures have been produced for 224 stations, and the adjusted dataset has been made available to the research community. The adjusted data are likely to be more representative of real climatic variations than raw data due to the removal of discontinuities. The adjusted data set has been compared with previously used temperature data sets, and data sets of other parameters. The adjusted data set provides adequate spatial coverage of Australia back to 1910. Additional adjusted data are available prior to this date at many stations. Trends in annual mean maximum, minimum, the mean of the maximum and minimum, and the range between the maximum and minimum, have been calculated at each site.

It succeeded early to a pre-eminent position within Victoria, indeed of the entire Australian continent and its position of supremacy went unchallenged until the twentieth century.

In this respect, Melbourne was a classic primate city with a whole-state hinterland and was justly described as "the commercial metropolis of the South". Its favourable geographic location, centrally placed between eastern and western halves of the colony, together with its position at the northern end of Port Phillip Bay provided the logical point of convergance for a railway network spanning the reaches of the interior. This gave a nodal quality to the city which made it the sole effective input-output point for all commerce with the mainland interior.(For complete abstract open document)</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Melbourne, Victoria, urban, growth, settlement, housing, suburbs, history</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Active Metaphysics: Acting as Manual Philosophy or Phenomenological Interpretations of Acting Theory</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Daniel Waycott</field><field name="description">PhD</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Theories of Acting</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Theatre</field><field name="subject">Heidegger</field><field name="subject">Brecht</field><field name="subject">Stanislavski</field><field name="subject">Artaud</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3984</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Such Spiritual Acres': Protestantism, the land and the colonisation of Australia 1788 -

Research into the movement of men out of hierarchy, the dominant structures of work institutions in the western world, is rarer still. Using hermeneutic and phenomenological frameworks, this study tracks the journeys of six men by in-depth interviews and discussions as they move out of hierarchical structures to recreate their work and, in varying degrees, themselves. As a means of looking beyond events, and for their metaphoric and philosophic perspectives, the Hero and Phoenix myths are used to further explore levels of meaning identified within the transition processes. Drawing on the work of Jung, Bridges, Neville, Campbell, O&#8217;Connor and Gareth Hill, the six stages into which I have organised the transitions are compared to the six key phases of the Phoenix myth. A Jungian framework informs the interpretation of the underlying significances demonstrated in the men&#8217;s processes of regeneration. The men&#8217;s individual responses to their transitions are also identified and described, from subjective and proactive perspectives. Changes in the men&#8217;s self perceptions and their changing relationships to authority, brought about by their shifting loci of control, are documented. Analysis of the stages most likely to be suitable for proactive intervention (as conscious or organised responses to the process), are indicated. Primary and secondary preconditions for successful transitions out of hierarchies are postulated. The men&#8217;s self-reflections illuminate experiences of uncertainty and clarity, confidence and exploration, compartmentalisation and synthesis. The role of an &#8216;inner voice&#8217; (an unchanging core identity) and their changing relationship with these aspects of Self, is articulated as critical factors in the men&#8217;s &#8216;successful&#8217; transitions. Integral to this research is the concept that the power of an individual&#8217;s experience can inform those who share a similar experience. Therefore applications of the research, and strategies to manage and facilitate transitions out of hierarchical environments, are suggested. This thesis is written in support of my hypothesis that transitions can be mapped; that they are journeys on several levels of personal and practical transformation; and that to proactively engage with transition processes requires not only an understanding of the stages of the process itself, but also an understanding that changes in self-perception and self-relationship will also occur for those undergoing them.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">men</field><field name="subject">middle-aged men</field><field name="subject">employment</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">career changes</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="subject">self-actualization (psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/32328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Provocative and transformative performance</field><field name="creator">Needham, Tessa</field><field name="description">What tools do performers use to provoke their audiences to change? What is the nature and potential extent of this change? &#8216;Provocative and Transformative Performance&#8217; looks at the potential of performance to provoke attitudinal and behavioural change. Through a combination of theoretical and practical research, the project attempts to locate specific characteristics of performances that may be both provocative and transformative. Although previous research has interrogated the efficacy of performance, this project attempts to interrogate the nature of attitudinal and behavioural change through performance in a new way. The approach is triangulated, shifting perspective from performance maker to audience member to performance theorist. Bodily, a solo performance investigating body image issues, was created both as a response to this research and as a performative tool for generating research data. The Bodily data arises from a personal response to the performance and from focus groups conducted with audience members of the piece. The performance is integrated as a necessary part of this research, as it illuminates the process of a provocative performance maker. Alchemy permeates this thesis, weaving through the analysis as a metaphor for transformation. An alchemist undertakes the quest for philosophical gold through several complex processes. The alchemical moment of &#8216;projection&#8217; is particularly significant; this is the climax, the final operation before gold is achieved. The thesis is written in a multi-vocal style, incorporating the analytical voice, the poetic alchemical metaphor, personal responses to performance and a performance development journal. The research project is a methodological and evaluative engagement with provocative and transformative performance, taking into account the intention of the performer, the instrumentation performers employ in order to provoke and transform their audiences, and the potential illumination of an issue for the audience through performance. Through this theoretical framework, the thesis aims to throw light on the ways in which performance can provoke transformation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">performance art</field><field name="subject">theater</field><field name="subject">alchemy</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/32410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient simulation of space-time coded and turbo coded systems</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Kim Chi</field><field name="description">The two main goals of this research are to study the implementation aspects of space-time turbo trellis codes (ST Turbo TC) and to develop efficient simulation methods for space-time and turbo coded systems using the importance sampling (IS) technique. The design of ST Turbo TC for improving the bandwidth efficiency and the reliability of wireless communication networks, which is based on the turbo structure, has been proposed in the literature. To achieve memory savings and reduce the decoding delay, this thesis proposes a simplified ST Turbo TC decoder using a sliding window (SW) technique. Different window sizes are employed and investigated. Through computer simulation, the optimum window sizes are determined for various system configurations. The effect of finite word length representation on the performance of ST Turbo TC is then studied. Simulation results show that ST Turbo TC is feasible for finite word length representation without significant degradation in the frame error rate performance. The optimum word length configurations are defined for all quantities external and internal to the ST Turbo TC decoder. For complex communication systems such as space-time codes and turbo codes, computer simulation is in fact the useful approach to obtain the estimated performance. To overcome the lengthy run-time requirements of the conventional Monte-Carlo (MC) method, this thesis introduces importance sampling simulation methods that accurately estimate the performances of turbo codes and space-time codes including orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBC) and concatenated OSTBC. It is demonstrated that the proposed methods require much smaller sample sizes to achieve the same accuracy required by a conventional MC estimator.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">signal processing</field><field name="subject">coding theory</field><field name="subject">trellis-coded modulation</field><field name="subject">wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">simulation methods</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/32467</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complementary and alternative medicine use and the menopausal transition : the effect of a Chinese herbal formula on vasomotor symptoms and bone turnover</field><field name="creator">Sluijs, Corinne Patching van der</field><field name="description">Although Hormone Therapy (HT) is the most effective treatment for alleviating menopausal vasomotor symptoms and reducing bone loss, many women are reluctant to take this treatment due to side effects and concerns about safety. Epidemiological studies suggest that a significant proportion of women use Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) therapies to alleviate vasomotor symptoms and improve quality of life. Anecdotal and clinical evidence indicate a number of CAM therapies, such as herbal medicine, may be effective in alleviating symptoms and modulating bone metabolism. Hence, in the context of concerns over the safety of HT and the extensive history of the clinical use of herbal medicine, this thesis investigated issues pertinent to CAM use and the menopausal transition. The aims of this thesis were to: &#8226; Examine the nature and extent of CAM use by women transitioning through menopause &#8226; Evaluate the effectiveness of a herbal formula containing Chinese herbs and Cimicifuga racemosa for alleviating vasomotor symptoms, improving quality of life and modulating bone turnover markers. From July 2003 until July 2004 the Women&#8217;s Health during Midlife Survey recruited 1,296 women aged 45-65 who were symptomatic when transitioning through menopause or asymptomatic but taking menopause specific treatments. A validated 19-item survey instrument assessed the use of CAM modalities and menopause specific products. The instrument was completed voluntarily and anonymously by women recruited from three strata; menopause clinics, clinics of general practice and government agencies. Approximately 54% of respondents had visited a CAM practitioner and/or used a CAM product during the previous 12 months. The most popular practitioners were the naturopath (7.2%) and acupuncturist (4.8%), while soy (25.4%) and evening primrose oil (EPO, 18.4%) were the most popular products. Massage and chiropractic were considered the most effective therapies, while phytoestrogen tablets and EPO were the most efficacious products. Although 26.4% of respondents indicated their doctor asked about CAM use, 71% of CAM users said they informed their physician about using CAM. Of the 60% of women using pharmaceutical medicines, 62.5% reported using a CAM product during the preceding 12 months. The survey results confirm the continued popularity of CAM use amongst women transitioning through menopause. A number of treatments were perceived to be effective in relieving symptoms. However, communication between medical practitioners and patients about CAM use is inadequate, and given the high use of pharmaceutical medicines this oversight may unnecessarily expose women to drugherb interactions. A randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a herbal formula derived from two traditional Chinese herbal formulae with the addition of Cimicifuga in alleviating vasomotor symptoms. The trial recruited 93 healthy women who reported at least six vasomotor symptoms per day. After a four week baseline period, women were randomly allocated to receive either herbal treatment or identical looking placebo tablets for 16 weeks. During the trial women recorded the number and severity of their flushes on a Daily Flush Diary, and at each monthly consultation two quality of life scales were completed. Forty nine eligible trial women were entered into a pilot study to assess the effect of the formula on bone turnover markers; bone specific alkaline phosphatase and deoxypyridinoline (corrected for creatinine). The herbal formula was found to be no more effective than placebo in reducing the frequency of flushing and the composite hot flush score or in improving quality of life. The pilot study found the formula had no effect on bone turnover markers after 16 weeks of treatment. Therefore, this formula cannot be recommended as a treatment for vasomotor symptoms and is unlikely to have any long term effect on bone. The use of CAM during the menopausal transition is very popular. Although this thesis found the current herbal formula to be an ineffective treatment, the scientific evaluation of potential CAM therapies is imperative so that health care professionals and consumers can make informed decisions concerning treatment options for the alleviation of symptoms.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">menopause</field><field name="subject">complications</field><field name="subject">alternative treatment</field><field name="subject">medicine, Chinese</field><field name="subject">herbs</field><field name="subject">therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">bugbane</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/32499</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and evaluation of a health-related lifestyle self-management intervention for patients with acute coronary syndrome</field><field name="creator">Fernandez, Ritin</field><field name="description">Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the acute manifestation of coronary heart disease (CHD), is the leading cardiovascular cause of mortality and morbidity globally, and represents one of the most common causes of acute medical admissions to Australian hospitals. Following medical and/or surgical management of ACS, lifestyle modification to reduce the underlying risk factors that contribute to the progression of the disease remains vital. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been widely accepted as an intervention that can reduce mortality and modify risk factors for subsequent coronary events and cardiovascular disease. While the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation programs have been demonstrated, participation and adherence to these programs remain low for various reasons, particularly among patients whose treatment includes revascularisation with percutaneous coronary intervention. This method of revascularisation has become increasingly common due its immediate success, rapid procedural technique, short hospital stay and early return to work for patients of working age. The aim of this study was to develop and test the feasibility of an evidence-based health-related lifestyle management program for risk factor modification in patients with ACS undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Four distinct yet interrelated studies were undertaken as part of the Development and evaluation of a Health-related Lifestyle self-Management (HeLM) intervention for patients with ACS Project. Three of these studies informed the development of the HeLM intervention, which was based on the principles of chronic disease self-management and evidence-based practice that included best evidence from the literature, clinical expertise and patient preferences. The first study was a systematic review of the literature to identify the best available evidence of the effect of brief interventions for lifestyle modification in patients with CHD. Findings from the 17 trials included in the systematic review, although inconclusive suggest that brief structured interventions can have beneficial effects on risk factor modification and consequently on progression of CHD. The second study was a qualitative interview of CR coordinators to identify from their clinical expertise the influence of the Reducing Risk in Heart Disease guidelines on practice: the Implementation of the Cardiac Evidence-Based Reducing Risk in Heart Disease Guidelines (ICEBRG) study. Findings from this study indicated limited implementation of the guidelines due to various barriers relating to health services, CR programs, professional practice and the patient and their families. Despite these barriers, it was evident that CR coordinators were striving to overcome these odds and provide evidence-based care. The third study undertaken to identify patient preferences for CR was the Follow-up After percutaneous Coronary Treatment (FACT) Study. The findings indicated that although the majority of the participants had two or more risk factors, they lacked knowledge of the link between risk factors and CHD, and less than a third had attended CR. The main reasons for nonattendance included timing, distance to travel, length of program, work commitments and lack of motivation to attend the programs. Their suggestions for improvement included telephone follow-up and flexibility of the CR programs. This study also informed the development of a tool that can be used by clinicians to flag patients who are unlikely to attend traditional CR. Identification of these people will allow alternate strategies to reduce risk factors to be tailored to their needs. The findings from these three studies were used to develop the HeLM intervention. The final study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of the HeLM intervention that was based on evidence compared to standard treatment for promoting lifestyle modification. This study was undertaken in 51 participants who were followed up two weeks following the completion of the intervention. The findings demonstrated that patients found the information beneficial and were pleased to receive it in their homes. The telephone support was also extremely well received. The study enabled the program and the process for implementation to be refined and indicated that a large multicentre trial would be feasible. The HeLM may be a strategy that could reach patients who have thus far eluded traditional CR programs and support them to make the necessary lifestyle changes. It may also be an adjunct to traditional CR and have a synergistic effect in facilitating health-promoting behaviours in CHD patients. Studies of interventions for risk factor modification in participants with CHD require longer term follow-up to assess the effect of the intervention in the sustainability of behaviour modification. Further research is necessary to evaluate the long-term effects as well as the cost effectiveness of the intervention.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coronary heart disease</field><field name="subject">heart disease</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">lifestyle and health</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/32587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting the behaviour of the shear connection of steel-concrete composite beams</field><field name="creator">Ernst, Stefan</field><field name="description">The inclusion of trapezoidal types of steel decking in the shear connection of composite beams has been found to significantly reduce their maximum strength and ductility by causing premature concrete-related failure modes. In order to investigate the complex behaviour and various load-transfer mechanisms that can occur in composite beams incorporating this type of connections, a total of 91 carefully-designed push-out tests were performed. Specific failure modes in conventionally reinforced specimens were initially induced by varying critical parameters. Specimens incorporating specific stud reinforcing devices were subsequently tested to suppress the undesirable failure modes. The concrete reinforcing and stud performance-enhancing devices, which included novel waveform-type reinforcement elements and spiral wire or ring components surrounding individual studs in secondary composite beams and special haunch reinforcement in primary beam applications, significantly delayed the onset and reduced the effect of the premature concrete-related failure modes. Hence, they increased the ultimate strength and ductility of the shear connection. The findings of the small-scale push-out tests were also verified in two full-scale composite beam tests which showed good agreement in shear connection behaviour and failure mode. Most of the design approaches currently used around the world take into account the weakening effect of trapezoidal types of decking by applying a reduction factor to the nominal strength that the same connection would have in a solid slab. From the test results, it is evident that not every shear connection incorporating steel decking, and within the limits of the associated standards, can be classified as ductile. A new and more reliable design approach is proposed which also incorporates the application of the various stud reinforcing devices. The key element of this design approach is to classify the anticipated connection behaviour, in regards to its deformation capacity, into ductile or brittle connections, hence ensuring satisfactory shear connection behaviour where the new types of trapezoidal steel decking are used. A reliability analysis of the new proposal is presented which enables the application of this new approach in accordance with AS 2327.1 (Standards Australia 2003). It is calibrated to provide a reliability index similar to stud applications currently in use. Simple strength reduction factors for the types of trapezoidal steel decking available in Australia are also provided which can be applied to the current solid slab shear connection strength for a fast and simplified design.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">composite construction</field><field name="subject">concrete construction</field><field name="subject">joints</field><field name="subject">concrete beams</field><field name="subject">girders</field><field name="subject">steel, structural</field><field name="subject">testing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/32633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microencapsulation of flavour-enhancing enzymes for acceleration of cheddar cheese ripening</field><field name="creator">Anjani, Kavya</field><field name="description">Commercial flavour-enhancing enzymes were delivered in an encapsulated form to accelerate Cheddar cheese ripening. Polymers such as alginate, chitosan and k- Carrageenan were screened to be used as encapsulant material for microencapsulation of the commercial protease enzyme, Flavourzyme&#174;. Alginate was found to be a suitable polymer for Flavourzyme encapsulation using the Inotech&#174; encapsulator while _-Carrageenan and chitosan were too viscous for extrusion through the encapsulator nozzle. Gelling of alginate-Flavourzyme microcapsules in 0.1M CaCl2 resulted in poor encapsulation efficiency (ranging 17- 18% depending on the alginate concentration). Incorporation of Hi-Maize&#8482; starch or pectin as filler materials into the alginate-Flavourzyme encapsulation matrix to increase encapsulation efficiency by minimising porosity also resulted in poor encapsulation efficiency. An alternative approach to the modification of the cationic gelling solution, by adding chitosan, significantly increased the encapsulation efficiency to 70-88% and produced mostly spherical capsules with an average diameter of 500_m. Encapsulation efficiency increased with an increase in chitosan concentration from 0.1 to 0.3% (w/v) in the cationic gelling solution of 0.1M CaCl2. Though gelling of alginate-Flavourzyme microcapsules in gelling solution of 0.1M CaCl2 containing 0.3% (w/v) chitosan resulted in higher encapsulation efficiency, a chitosan concentration of 0.1% (w/v) was chosen for further work as higher concentrations of chitosan in the gelling solution resulted in aggregation of capsules during formation. Gelling time of 10 min and alginate concentrations in the range 1.6 to 2.0% (w/v) were found to be optimal encapsulation parameters for Flavourzyme encapsulation while 2.0% (w/v) solution of trisodium citrate was found to be optimal for in vitro release of encapsulated enzymes for measurement of enzyme activity. Flavourzyme capsules stored frozen or freeze-dried were shelf stable for at least 10 weeks retaining about 80% of the initial enzyme activity as opposed to retention of 25-34% activity in air-dried capsules. Leakage of encapsulated Flavourzyme prepared from 1.6% (w/v) alginate was slightly higher than those prepared from 1.8 and 2.0% (w/v) alginate in cheese milk. Flavourzyme-alginate capsules prepared from 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0% (w/v) alginate retained over 70% of the initial enzyme activity under simulated cheese-press pressure. Concentration of alginate had no significant effect (p &gt; 0.05) on the retention of encapsulated Flavourzyme when the capsules were pressed for 4h; however when the simulated cheese press duration increased to 8 and 16h the retention of encapsulated Flavourzyme was significantly higher (p [less than] 0.01) in capsules produced from 2.0% (w/v) alginate. Incorporation of encapsulated enzymes into the milk prior to rennetting resulted in an even distribution of capsules in the cheese matrix compared to aggregation of capsules, when added to milled curd prior to salting. All cheeses; control with no added enzymes and experimental cheeses with free and encapsulated Flavourzyme and/or Palatase showed higher levels of moisture and lower levels of fat compared to standard Cheddar cheese due to the variation in the manufacturing protocol. There was no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) in fat and final pH between control and experimental cheeses and there was no difference in the numbers of coliforms, E.coli, Salmonella, Listeria, coagulase positive staphylococci, Bacillus cereus, yeast and moulds in control or experimental cheeses. Increased and prolonged proteolysis was observed in cheeses with encapsulated Flavourzyme showing increased release of several peptides, also with the formation of new peptides absent in the control cheese with no added enzymes. Accumulation of high molecular weight/hydrophobic peptides was higher in cheeses with free Flavourzyme followed by cheeses with encapsulated Flavourzyme. Concentration of water-soluble peptides increased with the increase in the concentration of encapsulated Flavourzyme in the cheese. Concentration of water-insoluble peptides was higher in control cheese compared to cheeses with encapsulated Flavourzyme even after 180 days ripening. After 30 days of ripening, concentration of most free amino acids was about 3 times greater in cheeses with encapsulated Flavourzyme than in control and about 7 times higher after 90 days ripening. Concentration of total amino acids was consistently higher in cheeses with encapsulated Flavourzyme compared to control. Cheese grading scores for body, texture and appearance of all cheeses with encapsulated enzymes were lower than control and free enzyme treated cheeses during the entire grading period of about 100 days due to crumbly and pasty texture. Control and cheeses with added Flavourzyme received high overall score for flavour. Flavour score of cheese with encapsulated Flavourzyme at a concentration of 0.75 LAPU/g milk protein was higher than all cheeses around 50 days with better overall flavour score until about 94 days ripening with improved flavour and elimination of bitterness. However the flavour of enzyme treated cheeses deteriorated with time and the control cheese scored the highest for flavour. Though increased concentration of free fatty acids was detected in cheeses treated with encapsulated lipase; Palatase, these cheeses developed rancid, unpleasant, strong lipolytic flavours as early as 55 days ripening.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cheddar cheese</field><field name="subject">cheese</field><field name="subject">dairy processing</field><field name="subject">microencapsulation</field><field name="subject">fermentation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/32686</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Change impact analysis to manage process evolution in web workflows</field><field name="creator">Ginige, Jeewani A.</field><field name="description">Organisations have processes to manage their business activities, often referred to as business processes. In today&#8217;s competitive global economy, automation of processes with appropriate technology is advantageous. However, the paradox of processes automation is the continuous evolution and change that occurs in business processes. As the business processes evolve and change, the underpinning automated systems need to reflect those changes. Even after a decade of research in the areas of business process automation (BPA) and business process evolution management (BPEM), organisations still find it challenging to manage evolution of automated processes. Therefore, this thesis finds answers to the question of &#8220;How can business process evolutions be accurately and effectively reflected in already implemented web-based workflow systems?&#8221; In order to provide a holistic solution to the above research question, this research introduces a framework named paradigm of process automation &#8211; PoPA framework and discusses its role in managing process evolution. This framework embodies a business process at four levels as pragmatic, semantic, syntactic, and implementation. Each of these levels deals with a distinctive representation of a business process. For example, the pragmatic level represents the contextual artefact elements such as Acts, policies, organisational structures, rules, and guidelines; that define a process, and the syntactic level denotes the models created for the purposes of automation. When a change takes place in any one of the levels of the PoPA framework, it creates a propagating impact on elements in the above-mentioned four levels. This propagation of impact takes place due to constraints, associations, dependencies (CAD) among elements within and across the levels (intra and inter-level CAD). When analysing intra and inter-level CAD most correlations are found to be hierarchical; therefore, a relational database structure is appropriate to capture these hierarchical associations. However, operational processes at the semantic level have complex associations, which are not hierarchical. Therefore, this research proposes to use Kleene Algebra with Test (KAT) for representing CAD at the semantic level. Propagating impact does not exclusively depend on inter and intra-level CAD, but is also closely associated with the nature of evolution. Depending on the nature of evolution, the propagating impact can be categorised as direct, indirect, secondary, and non-cautionary (DISN) impact. These DISN impacts suggest the severity of the propagating impact. The core contribution of this research is the Process Evolution and Change Impact Analysis (PECIA) Model, which enables the management of process evolution accurately and effectively in automated systems. In this research, a process automation project named Online Courses Approval System (OCAS) is used as an exploratory case study. The practical utility of the PECIA Model is validated using evolution scenarios of OCAS and epistemic utility is analysed based on a study of the literature. Amidst a plethora of literature on BPA and BPEM, this research is significant due to the following theoretical contributions that facilitate in managing automated processes in tandem with organisational process evolution: &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; PECIA Model holistically captures inter and intra-level CAD of process elements facilitating the propagating impact analysis within and across the four levels of the PoPA framework. &#8226; A novel use of KAT to capture CAD among process elements cohesively and completely into linear expressions, in order to analyse the impact propagation. &#8226; An algorithm that analyses KAT expressions of a process, to locate DISN impacts so that evolutions can be carried out accurately and effectively. The future works that arise from this work are manifold. These may include improving the use of the PECIA Model as a corporate process knowledge repository, and exploring possible other uses of the PECIA Model and KAT based process expressions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">management information systems</field><field name="subject">reengineering (management)</field><field name="subject">organizational change</field><field name="subject">workflow</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/32727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Platinum(II) complexes : studied by diffusion NMR</field><field name="creator">Miyoshi, Emi</field><field name="description">Six novel platinum(II) intercalators of the form [Pt(AL)(IL)]Cl2, where AL = ethylenediamine (en), 1R,2R-diaminocyclohexane (R,R-dach), or 1S,2S-diaminocyclohexane (S,S-dach) and IL = 4,7-dihydroxy-1,10-phenanthroline (4,7-dhp) or 4,7-dicarboxy-1,10-phenanthroline (4,7-dcp), were synthesised. All complexes were prepared by the addition of the intercalating ligand followed by the addition of the diamine ancillary ligand. The complexes with 4,7-dhp were soluble in DMSO and were characterised by 1H, 13C, and 195Pt NMR, elemental analysis, UV-vis, ESI-MS, and CD. The complexes with 4,7-dcp were only soluble in a highly acidic solution and, therefore, were characterised only by 1H NMR and elemental analysis. The cytotoxicity of the 4,7-dhp complexes was tested in the L1210 murine leukaemia cell line. [Pt(S,S-dach)(4,7-dhp)]Cl2 showed an IC50 value of &gt; 80 &#956;M. The antitumour and antibacterial activities of all six complexes were tested in vitro using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method with Staphylococcus aureus and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The 4,7-dhp complexes showed no activity to these bacteria strains. The activities of the 4,7-dcp complexes were not able to be tested due to their solubility only in acidic solutions, which itself inhibits cell growth. The diffusion coefficients of the Pt(II) intercalators of the form [Pt(AL)(IL)]Cl2, where AL = en, R,R-dach, or S,S-dach and IL = phen, 4-mp, 4,7-dmp, 4,7-dhp, 4,7-dcp or 3,4,7,8-tmp and various starting materials used during the synthesis of these complexes were measured using pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) NMR. The diffusion coefficients of both 4,7-dcp and [Pt(4,7-dcp)Cl2] were observed to be lower than other compounds with similar molecular weights indicating dimerisation of the compounds. The binding studies of the systems, [Pt(en)(phen)]Cl2 to (i) BSA, (ii) delipidated BSA, and (iii) d(GTCGAC)2 were studied using a simple two-site binding model with diffusion NMR. The binding of [Pt(en)(phen)]Cl2 &#8211; BSA was well described by the model giving the values Kd = 0.0021 &#177; 0.0002 M and n = 5.85 &#177; 0.31. On the contrary, the binding of [Pt(en)(phen)]Cl2 &#8211; delipidated BSA showed a poor fit to the model. From the poor fit of the data, it was speculated that the transverse relaxation of BSA largely affected the system. The binding of [Pt(en)(phen)]Cl2 &#8211; d(GTCGAC)2 showed results where the diffusion coefficient decreases as the concentration of the drug increases but an opposite effect was observed from the point where the drug reached equimolar concentrations to d(GTCGAC)2. It was speculated that the drug undergoes allosteric binding to the biomolecule or that a conformational change occurred as the drug concentration increases in the system. A further study of [Pt(en)(phen)]Cl2 and K2PtCl4 using 195Pt diffusion NMR was conducted giving a diffusion coefficient of 3.08 &#177; 0.04 &#215; 10-10 m2 s-1 for K2PtCl4. The diffusion coefficient of [Pt(en)(phen)]Cl2, however, were unobtainable due to the short transverse relaxation of the Pt complex.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">platinum compounds</field><field name="subject">nuclear magnetic resonance</field><field name="subject">DNA-ligand interactions</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/33587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paucity management models in community welfare service delivery</field><field name="creator">Mlcek, Susan Huhana Elaine</field><field name="description">The juxtaposition of doing &#8216;more with less&#8217;, and &#8216;being privileged to be a community welfare worker&#8217; gives some indication of the anomalies present in how community welfare work is conceived and manifested. The original contribution of this thesis is to provide further knowledge and understanding of the nature, level and extent of paucity management models to inform the way that community welfare services are delivered in rural communities. Paucity management relates to the way that managers identify and utilise strategies to counter the anomaly of possessing a deep philosophical underpinning in the value of community work, with the lack of means to meet all the needs and expectations of community members. Fifteen managers from the Central West Region of New South Wales in Australia were asked to share work narratives about the way their activities contributed to sustaining their communities. The research confirms yet again that community services are delivered strategically in spite of, or because of, a resource poor environment that is mainly punctuated by the non-availability of ever-decreasing funds. New ways of seeking resources has resulted in managers and workers navigating competing priorities at ground level, with trying to balance the tensions implicit in a directive provider-purchaser work dynamic that has seen the evolvement of the hybrid government organisation. This qualitative research used a phenomenographic approach to collect the managers&#8217; stories. Data collection methods included individual interviews, focus group discussions, as well as further consultative communication. A complex theoretical framework, incorporating ideas from paucity management, aspects of structuration, and chaos/ complexity, was used to analyse the data through a structure of awareness of variation in the managers&#8217; experiences. The findings show that community welfare managers do work in a resource poor environment, do acknowledge the presence of paucity management, and do address the limit-situations of service delivery through different, but complimentary, paucity management models that are creative, pragmatic, communicatively competent, and &#8216;auto-managed&#8217;. Their combined narrative gives a clearer understanding of the style of management that the managers used, as well as some of the strategies that contributed to &#8216;chameleon qualities&#8217; of management.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community health services</field><field name="subject">medical care</field><field name="subject">public welfare administration</field><field name="subject">rural health services</field><field name="subject">social service, rural</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/33647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of learning on pitch and speech perception : influencing perception of Shepard tones and McGurk syllables using classical and operant conditioning principles</field><field name="creator">Stevanovic, Bettina</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with describing and experimentally investigating the nature of perceptual learning. Ecological psychology defines perceptual learning as a process of educating attention to structural properties of stimuli (i.e., invariants) that specify meaning (i.e., affordances) to the perceiver. Although such definition comprehensively describes the questions of what humans learn to perceive, it does not address the question of how learning occurs. It is proposed in this thesis that the principles of classical and operant conditioning can be used to strengthen and expand the ecological account of perceptual learning. The perceptual learning of affordances is described in terms of learning that a stimulus is associated with another stimulus (classical conditioning), and in terms of learning that interacting with a stimulus is associated with certain consequences (operant conditioning). Empirical work in this thesis investigated the effect of conditioning on pitch and speech perception. Experiments 1, 2, and 3 were designed to modify pitch perception in Shepard tones via tone-colour associative training. During training, Shepard tones were paired with coloured circles in a way that the colour of the circles could be predicted by either the F0 (pitch) or by an F0-irrelevant auditory invariant. Participants were required to identify the colour of the circles that was associated with the tones and they received corrective feedback. Hypotheses were based on the assumption that F0-relevant/F0- irrelevant conditioning would increase/decrease the accuracy of pitch perception in Shepard tones. Experiment 1 investigated the difference between F0-relevant and F0- irrelevant conditioning in a between-subjects design, and found that pitch perception in the two conditions did not differ. Experiments 2 and 3 investigated the effect of F0- relevant and F0-irrelevant conditioning (respectively) on pitch perception using a within subjects (pre-test vs. post-test) design. It was found that the accuracy of pitch perception increased after F0-relevant conditioning, and was unaffected by F0-irrelevant conditioning. The differential trends observed in Experiments 2 and 3 suggest that conditioning played some role in influencing pitch perception. However, the question whether the observed trends were due to the facilitatory effect of F0-relevant conditioning or the inhibitory effect of F0-irrelevant conditioning warrants future investigation. Experiments 4, 5, and 6 were designed to modify the perception of McGurk syllables (i.e., auditory /b/ paired with visual /g/) via consonant-pitch associative training. During training, participants were repeatedly presented with /b/, /d/, and /g/ consonants in falling, flat, and rising pitch contours, respectively. Pitch contour was paired with either the auditory signal (Experiments 4 and 5) or the visual signal (Experiment 6) of the consonant. Participants were required to identify the stop consonants and they received corrective feedback. The perception of McGurk stimuli was tested before and after training by asking participants to identify the stop consonant in each stimulus as /b/ or /d/ or /g/. It was hypothesized that conditioning would increase (1) /b/ responses more in the falling than in the flat/ rising contour conditions, (2) /d/ responses more in the flat than in the falling/ rising contour conditions, and (3) /g/ responses more in the rising than in the falling/flat contour conditions. Support for the hypotheses was obtained in Experiments 5 and 6, but only in one response category (i.e., /b/ and /g/ response categories, respectively). It is suggested that the subtlety of the observed conditioning effect could be enhanced by increasing the salience of pitch contour and by reducing the clarity of auditory/visual invariants that specify consonants.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">perceptual learning</field><field name="subject">speech perception</field><field name="subject">auditory perception</field><field name="subject">visual perception</field><field name="subject">sensory receptors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/33694</field></doc><doc><field name="title">S&#769;akti Ya&#772;tra&#772; : locating power, questioning desire : a women's pilgrimage to the temple of Ka&#772;ma&#772;khya&#772;</field><field name="creator">Dobia, Brenda</field><field name="description">The temple of the Goddess Kamakhya in Assam is the pre-eminent site of Hindu Goddess worship. It is revered as the yoni p&#299;tha, the place where the generative organ of the Goddess is worshipped. This thesis, centred on Kamakhya, explores the Hindu tradition of Goddess worship, Saktism, and both the possibilities and contradictions it presents for women. The research was undertaken from a feminist standpoint and employed a framework that was collaborative, cross-cultural and inter-disciplinary. Six women co-researchers from India, the U.S. and Australia took part in a pilgrimage that simultaneously explored the Kamakhya site, its history, symbols, myths and customs, alongside our own personal understandings of Saktism and its role in women&#8217;s spiritual empowerment. Our aim, in the face of contradictory evidence about the impact of Goddess traditions on the status of Hindu women, was to try to bridge cultural differences of interpretation and develop feminist readings of what may be enabling for women. The thesis establishes the basis of our collective fascination with Sakti, which denotes both the Goddess and the cosmic power she personifies. Through a combination of narrative, exposition of Indian sources and critical cultural analysis, I present our deliberations on the rich tapestry of themes we encountered. From the outset the thesis problematises the cross-cultural encounter and continues this frame throughout. The voices of the principal co-researchers emerge as they co-constitute the research, its methods and its implementation. Their central role is confirmed as the inquiry proceeds. Following the path of my preliminary encounters with the Goddess and with the co-researchers, pilgrimage is established as a traditional means of encountering the Goddess and, in the form we constructed, as a key experiential dimension of the research. In the encounter with Kamakhya, her dual persona as Mother Goddess and Goddess of Love is elaborated. The meanings and origins of both these aspects, their integration through the concept of srsti cosmic creation, and the implications for women of their associated practices of worship are explored at length. Finally, in light of the pilgrimage, I re-consider conjunctions between Saktism, feminist perspectives on women&#8217;s empowerment and theological horizons.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shaktism</field><field name="subject">Ka&#772;ma&#772;khya (Hindu deity)</field><field name="subject">cult</field><field name="subject">goddesses, Hindu</field><field name="subject">women and religion</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">religious aspects</field><field name="subject">Hinduism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/32785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The question concerning commercial television and the more-than-human world</field><field name="creator">Fell, Bruce G.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relationship between commercial television and the more than-human world at a time when global ecological degradation challenges human well-being and the survival of other species. In the latter half of the twentieth century, television became the means by which most people got to know about society and publicly important events or issues. As billions of people the world over regularly view television the planet&#8217;s ice caps, rainforests, soil and oceans continue to be depleted. The research considers three questions aimed at a fuller understanding of the role of commercial television in Western society&#8217;s approach to global ecological degradation. What arises from being immersed in the more-than-human world? What arises from encountering the broadcast of commercial television? What arises from being immersed in the world of producing commercial television? The literature on global ecological degradation is substantial; the reasons why Western society is having difficulty coming to terms with the issue is less understood. While quantitative studies of the environmental content of television output have been undertaken, there has not been research into understanding the relationship between ecological awareness, television viewing and commercial television production. This research takes a hermeneutic phenomenological approach to the questions above. Firstly, the researcher immerses himself in the native woodlands and creeks of his immediate vicinity and gradually peels back layers of his perception. He then immerses himself in the world of watching contemporary commercial television and reflecting on his memories of Australian television since 1956. He juxtaposes the content of twenty-four hours of commercial television with personal recollections that reflect both the invisible and sedimented experiences of commercial television. Thirdly, the researcher observes a range of commercial television production environments (News, Advertising and Drama). In doing so he reflects on conversations with and between television executives, directors and scriptwriters who occupy this world. The main findings are that commercial television scriptwriters and personalities hold the most available tools for delivering an Australian-based ecological message through the plot and actions of characters, via a &#8216;green mise-en-sc&#232;ne&#8217;. However, there are severe constraints on this process because of the over-riding importance of ratings. Commercial television is a ratings hungry &#8216;third parent&#8217; that has increasingly occupied the everydayness of Australian homes since 1956. The invisible technological nature of television has created a particular distance between the production of commercial television and how its mise-en-sc&#232;ne is perceived in domestic Australia, by a population that is technologically and procedurally removed from the more-than-human world.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mass media and the environment</field><field name="subject">television broadcasting</field><field name="subject">environmental degradation</field><field name="subject">global environmental change</field><field name="subject">influence</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/32790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An action research approach to supporting change management and associated governance strategies in a community services organisation</field><field name="creator">Clifton, Ross G.</field><field name="description">An Action Research approach to supporting change management and associated governance strategies in a community services organisation. Following a report on the Civil Society in the New Millennium Project, which was based upon the responses of citizens from forty-seven Commonwealth countries, a Compact Approach involving the state, intermediary organisations and citizens was developed in 1999, as a framework to enhance civil society. A literature review indicated that there was no research in Australia, as well as internationally, that had investigated the efficacy of this formalised agreement or Compact, particularly in a practical setting. The researcher had been working in the community services sector and had an interest in supporting community services organisations to meet the impact of change, particularly in response to government policy reform agendas. The Compact Approach was identified as a model to navigate change and develop partnerships with a civil society organisation operating in environments characterised by certainty as well as uncertainty. The researcher made himself available to a case study organisation to support change and to investigate the Compact Approach by undertaking Action Research as a participant observer. This exploratory research involved two main reference groups, board and staff, in planning, acting, observing and reflecting. A large amount of data was generated and a need was identified for it to be collated and simplified for further analysis. A new methodology was developed drawing upon the traditions of case study method and story-telling to represent the research themes of: the Compact Approach; change management; and, governance. With the Compact Approach what was found was evidence of some degree of civil society enhancement, particularly at the individual organisation level. As the study was undertaken from an organisation&#8217;s perspective the other dimensions of civil society and government had been underrepresented. It was found that government policy of promoting the market meant that competition was overshadowing co2 operation in the case study organisation. For community services organisations the main partner is government and policy frameworks need to support partnerships and civil society beyond current contractual agreements. Carver&#8217;s (1997) Policy Governance framework was partially implemented to assist with infrastructure development. However there was a lack of time and a commitment from the board and senior staff. Not all governance responsibilities can be met through such a framework and community organisations need to be mindful of its limitations, particularly for those connected to civil society. There were mixed results with Action Research being used as a change management tool. The dominance of power by those in &#8216;control&#8217; highlighted management styles, but they also overshadowed group processes. Action Research methodology was also complemented by Stacey&#8217;s (1996) ordinary and extraordinary management framework. It was found that when applied to the Action Research cycle of planning, acting, observing and reflecting; that the process of reflecting was particularly supported by such conceptual mapping. What was also highlighted was the need for professionals to undertake &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;in the field&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; Action Research but also to draw upon their professional or technical expertise, using participant-observer-consultant modes. The capacity for a small community services organisation to change can be based upon levels of infrastructure, governance skills, available resources and level of development to operate at an associative level with other stakeholders. The viability of these smaller organisations is being challenged by the &#8216;managerialist&#8217; business paradigms of government policy where the fabric of civil society has not been incorporated within accountability frameworks. Here there is a challenge for new frameworks such as the Compact Approach, to lead the way as formalised agreements with government, to enhance the role of civil society in the delivery of community services in countries such as Australia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-governmental organizations</field><field name="subject">community organization</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">social service</field><field name="subject">government policy</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">organizational change</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/32874</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of authenticity : Aboriginal cultural tourism in the Northern Territory</field><field name="creator">Hodgson, Renata</field><field name="description">Since the 1970s there has been a growing interest in Indigenous cultures globally. In Australia, the recognition that Aboriginal art and culture represents a distinct component of Australian identity has resulted in increased promotion of Aboriginal cultures and heritage sites as unique tourist attractions, mainly since the 1990s. Research indicates that there is a significant international interest in Australian Indigenous cultures. In particular, it has been suggested that tourists want to experience &#8216;real&#8217; Aboriginal culture and that they desire &#8216;authentic and genuine&#8217; Aboriginal cultural experiences. Despite the fact that the concept of authenticity remains important to the different stakeholder groups of Aboriginal tourism, including tourists, tour operators and promoters as well as State/Territorial Governments, limited understanding exists as to what &#8216;authentic&#8217; Aboriginal culture and, in particular, &#8216;authentic&#8217; Aboriginal tourism experiences constitute in the minds of these stakeholders. Whilst an abundance of research exists that has addressed the issue of authenticity in different tourism settings, the majority of studies have treated the concept of authenticity as something given and have used quantitative tools to analyse the authentic-inauthentic binary. However, research utilising such methods has failed to uncover the different perspectives and meanings respondents may hold of the notion of authenticity. Notably, the perceptions of authenticity in Indigenous tourism have received little attention. The few existing studies on authenticity in Indigenous tourism settings have given emphasis to differing agendas, and have therefore provided only a piecemeal understanding of how authenticity is perceived and interpreted by the different stakeholders of Indigenous tourism. More importantly, research on Aboriginal hosts&#8217; perceptions of authenticity is virtually non-existent. Yet, clarification of how tourists and hosts perceive authenticity in Aboriginal tourism is essential when addressing issues of accreditation and branding as well as key marketing objectives that aim to promote &#8216;authentic&#8217; Aboriginal tourism experiences. This study seeks to address the gaps within the tourism literature surrounding authenticity in Aboriginal tourism. The aim is to understand the concept of authenticity in Aboriginal tourism from a stakeholder perspective. The study is guided by two main research questions: What are the perceptions of authenticity of tourists as well as tour providers and their employees? and Are theoretical perspectives of the notion of authenticity shared by those stakeholders? More specifically, this study investigated five important issues: 1) tourists&#8217; perceptions of authenticity at three different Aboriginal cultural tours; 2) the perceptions of three Aboriginal cultural tour operators and their employees in regard to authenticity; 3) whether there were any discrepancies and/or similarities between the perceptions of tour operators/employees and tourists about what constitutes an authentic Aboriginal tourism experience; 4) whether any of the different theoretical perspectives of authenticity were shared by tourists and tour operators/employees; and 5) whether a conceptual framework could be developed that provides an overview of salient elements explaining the formation of perceptions of authenticity within Aboriginal cultural tourism experiences. In order to examine the research questions a qualitative research methodology grounded in the constructivist paradigm was adopted. This paradigm was chosen as it reflects the exploratory nature of the research and allows for flexibility throughout the research process. This study utilised qualitative in-depth semi-structured interviews as the primary data collection method together with participant observation. Data was collected from 92 interviews, consisting of 72 tourists and 20 employees, within three Aboriginal cultural tour companies in the Northern Territory. The three different Aboriginal cultural tours chosen for the purpose of this study were: Tiwi Tours at Bathurst Island, Manyallaluk Aboriginal Cultural Tours near Katherine and Anangu Tours at the Uluru-Kata-Tjuta National Park. The results of this research revealed that respondents hold multiple constructions of the notion of authenticity. In general, however, most respondents associated an authentic Aboriginal cultural tour experience with a genuine experience which does not feel contrived, staged or &#8216;plastic&#8217;. In particular, the study found that respondents&#8217; perceptions of authenticity can be grouped into four elements. The first element consisted of the background and role of the Aboriginal tour guide, which was found to be a major factor influencing respondents&#8217; perceptions on whether the tour was offering an authentic experience. The second element is characterised by the tourists&#8217; search for &#8216;real&#8217; and &#8216;genuine&#8217; Aboriginal people. Here, respondents equated authenticity with the opportunity to visit a &#8216;real&#8217; Aboriginal working community and to be able to experience Aboriginal people in an everyday setting. Respondents were found to hold preconceived notions and images in their minds as to who &#8216;real&#8217; Aboriginal people are and what their &#8216;authentic&#8217; lifestyle should involve. In addition, the majority of respondents defined authentic Aboriginal culture as the contemporary culture of Aboriginal people. Consequently, an authentic Aboriginal cultural tour experience was conceived in terms of gaining an insight into the contemporary lifestyle of Aboriginal people. The third element that contributed to the experience of authenticity is associated with having the opportunity to see and/or purchase authentic Aboriginal arts and crafts. Respondents perceived a product as authentic if it conformed to specific criteria, such as reflecting uniqueness and originality and being handmade by a local artist. Verification of authenticity was also generated by the shopping experience itself, for example meeting the artist and watching how the craft is produced. Finally, the fourth element in the construction of authenticity is related to tourists&#8217; perceptions of the dance performance. Some respondents recognised this as a contrived experience that lacked &#8216;traditional&#8217; authenticity, while some respondents wanted to see an authentically contrived or staged cultural performance as this was regarded as an occasion for entertainment and enjoyment. Furthermore, the findings of this study suggested that respondents generally referred to the authenticity of toured objects (object authenticity) when describing their perceptions of an authentic experience. The majority of tourists and employees employed a constructivist approach within their conceptualisation of the notion of authenticity. Only a small number of tourists appeared to hold attitudes similar to the objectivist and postmodern perspectives.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">Northern Territory</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">industries</field><field name="subject">culture and tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/32902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of explicit spelling lesson programs on performance outcomes of upper primary students</field><field name="creator">Leonard, Thelma M.</field><field name="description">The study is concerned with improving the spelling performance of below average spellers in an upper primary mainstream classroom setting. The main target group is children who do not qualify for learning support resources yet have difficulty thriving in the literacy area of spelling. It was expected that lessons designed to expand students&#8217; knowledge about words and the English language system would generate a greater student facility with learning spellings. A quasi-experimental methodological approach was taken which also has features of a controlled trials study. Four spelling intervention lesson programs were designed and each has a different pedagogic emphasis: 1) Metacognitive and multisensory learning strategies 2) Teacher-Best-Practice 3) Teacher designed inquiry-based group work 4) Learning with a computer-based Team Learning System. The study design is both practical and pragmatic in that only resources already available to the schools were utilised; lesson formats and teaching practices can be easily replicated; and the spelling programs are compatible with NSW curriculum directives. The intervention lesson program took place for one hour per week over a two-term period and involved four schools situated in the outer areas of Sydney, Australia. Students and teachers in nine upper primary classrooms took part in the study, five of which were intervention classes and four were non-intervention classes. The classroom teachers were an important factor in the program presentation and lessons with an explicit focus on words were conducted from a constructivist perspective. Results indicate that when spelling becomes an instructional focus, substantial progress in performance levels can be made in both intervention and non-intervention classrooms. Discussion of the findings examines how pedagogic factors influenced learning outcomes for all ability groups in the literacy area of spelling. Particular attention is given to the progress in spelling age made by below average performers, as determined on pre-testing, and students with lower than normal cognitive ability. It is considered that the more interactive approach to teaching spelling, plus a high level of congruence with the Quality Teaching model (NSW DET, 2003) elements of Engagement, High-order Thinking, and Substantive Communication, assisted these target groups of students in the intervention classes. The principal conclusion that can be drawn from the findings of the study is that minimal modifications to teaching practices can bring about improvement in students&#8217; spelling performance levels. It illustrates the capacity of children to advance their learning outcomes when lessons are designed and delivered in a manner that encourages engagement and interactive support. Such a conclusion directs the responsibility for students&#8217; learning outcomes to their classroom teachers. The study identifies that there are implications for the providers of in-service and pre-service professional development of teachers situated in upper primary mainstream classrooms, and the pedagogic aspirations of the primary school community.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">orthography and spelling</field><field name="subject">study and teaching (primary)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/32923</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an evidence-based Chinese herbal medicine for the management of vascular dementia</field><field name="creator">Liu, Junguang</field><field name="description">Vascular dementia (VaD), the second most common cause of dementia, causes substantial distress to patients and represents a significant burden to their families and communities. Currently, there is no effective treatment to reverse the brain damage associated with VaD. In general the drugs available for the management of cognitive problems in VaD are expensive and outcomes are uncertain. It is, therefore, important to seek out alternative approaches, which may prove effective, cheaper and safer. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been used for the treatment of dementia-like disorders for centuries. Data from many preclinical studies and some clinical studies have suggested the potential effectiveness of CHM for the treatment of VaD. Based on the literature review conducted as part of this thesis, however, most of the studies were published in Chinese literature and failed to demonstrate methodological rigour or to report sufficient methodological detail. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using scientific methods of diagnosis and outcome measures are urgently needed. Wei Nao Kang (WNK) is a three-herb formula developed by Xi Yuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. Preclinical experiments of WNK have demonstrated significant improvement in learning and memory function in VaD animal models in rats and mice. Human case studies have also signalled the potential value of WNK in VaD. Although the results of these studies were encouraging, strong scientific evidence from a well-designed RCT is still required. A rigorous clinical trial methodology, including scientific diagnostic criteria and outcome measures, was designed and applied to the evaluation of WNK for VaD. The trial was successfully conducted over a two-year period. Cognitive functions, as evidenced by the ADAS-cog, were significantly improved in the study group taking WNK herbal medication compared with the placebo group. The ADAS-cog was simultaneously validated as a measure of cognitive function in VaD. Blinding was verified and no major adverse effects were found related to WNK treatment. However, neither group demonstrated long-lasting effect on a 16 weeks follow-up after completion of treatment. WNK demonstrated a significant effect on quality of life (measured by SF-36) and some effect on activities of daily living (measured by ADCS-ADL) in VaD patients. The SF-36 was validated as a measure of general health status and the ADCS-ADL as a measure of activities of daily living in patients with VaD. Both scales were proven sensitive to the presence of VaD, and provided useful supplementary outcome measures for VaD. A cerebral perfusion study was conducted to identify changes in cerebral blood flow and its relationship with clinical symptoms. The study showed that WNK had marked increases in blood flow in the inferior frontal and anterior temporal regions, both of which are closely related to cognitive function in human brains. This study has provided scientific evidence in support of the clinical effect of WNK on VaD. In addition, it validated several outcome measures in assessing improvements in cognitive functions, activities of daily living and quality of life in VaD patients. One of the highlights of this study is the application of SPECT scans as an outcome measure. This provided an excellent objective parameter for assessing the effects of WNK. To the best of our knowledge, SPECT scanning has never been used in VaD trials of herbal medicines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dementia, vascular</field><field name="subject">dementia</field><field name="subject">cerebrovascular disease</field><field name="subject">alternative treatment</field><field name="subject">medicine, Chinese</field><field name="subject">herbs</field><field name="subject">therapeutic use</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/33046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Music, movement and marimba : solo marimbists' bodily gesture in the perception and production of expressive performance</field><field name="creator">Broughton, Mary C.</field><field name="description">A combination of experimental and empirical studies investigate the assumption that musical expression is communicated in marimba performance through at least two channels &#8211; sound and action. A parallel is drawn between the bodily movements and gestures occurring with expressive musical sound, and gestures produced in concurrence with speech. Experiment 1 investigated the assumption that bodily movements and gestures can enhance or diminish the perception of expression and interest in solo marimba performance when presented audio-visually compared to presentation in audio-only form. Body movement is of particular relevance here as the expressive capabilities of the marimba are relatively restricted, and the movements required to play it are visible. Twenty-four musically-trained and 24 musically-untrained observers rated auditory-only and auditory-visual presentations of 20th Century solo marimba excerpts for perceived expressiveness and interest. Performances were given by a male and a female professional musician in projected (public performance expression) and deadpan (minimised expressive features) performance manners. As hypothesised, significantly higher ratings were recorded in response to projected performances than to deadpan. The hypothesised interaction between modality and performance manner was observed. Higher expressiveness ratings were observed for projected performances, and lower ratings were observed for deadpan performances when the presentation was audio-visual compared to audio-only. Higher interest ratings were observed for projected performances when the presentation was audio-visual. Musically-trained participants recorded higher ratings than musically-untrained observers upholding the final hypothesis. The results suggest that expressive functional bodily movements and bodily gestures play an important role in marimba performer-audience communication. Findings are relevant for both performers and educators. The aim of Experiment 2 was to investigate whether the results of Experiment 1, conducted in laboratory conditions, would generalise to an ecologically valid setting &#8211; a real concert. Experiment 2 investigated audience continuous self-report engagement responses from 21 participants collected using the portable Audience Response Facility (pARF). The stimulus material was a solo marimba piece performed in a live concert. A female musician performed two musically similar sections within the piece in two different performance manners (deadpan and projected). The second order standard deviation threshold method was used to analyse signal reliability. As hypothesised, mean engagement responses were greater in the projected sample than the deadpan sample. Reliable signal was only observed in the projected sample. Differences between deadpan and projected sample mean engagement responses may be due to expressive bodily movement from the performance manner manipulation; alternatively, serial order effect, necessitated by the concert setting, may be responsible. Such experimentation in ecologically valid settings enables understanding of audience perception of live music performance as it unfolds in time. Expressive qualities of marimba players&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; bodily gestures, witnessed in several projected and deadpan marimba performances in the stimulus material from Experiment 1 were analysed in Study 1. Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) observation techniques, involving embodied thinking and kinaesthetic mirroring, enabled analysis of force. Force is the third element of motion additional to temporal and spatial aspects for which technology measuring only kinematics can not account. Effort-shape analysis and notation described and recorded expressive qualities of marimba players&#8217; bodily gestures at specific locations on the musical score. With basic training, professional percussionist performers were able to understand and apply effort-shape analysis and notation. This inspired confidence that effort-shape analysis and notation has potential as an analytical tool for performers, teachers and students. The results of Experiments 1 and 2 and Study 1 lead to the formation of a theory of bodily gestures in marimba performance. This theory accounted for functional bodily movements and bodily gestures in marimba performance based on an embodied interpretation of the musical score. Combined experimental and empirical results indicate that bodily movements and gestures can enhance perception of expressive marimba performance and therefore warrant focussed attention in pedagogy and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marimba</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">music audiences</field><field name="subject">musical perception</field><field name="subject">visual perception</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/33189</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing women's lives : women's autobiographies (exegesis): mourning and memorialisation (creative work)</field><field name="creator">Luckie, Patsy Rae</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of two parts &#8211; a creative work, Memory and Memorialisation, and an exegesis, Writing Women&#8217;s Lives: Women&#8217;s Autobiographies,that documents the writing process and the theoretical perspectives informing it at various stages.

For first-time mothers as primary caregivers, the early post-partum months of the transition to parenthood can be a stressful period, affecting communicative interactions with their infants and the early development of the dyadic relationship. Furthermore, if mothers are lacking a repertoire of activities that promote communicative interactions via the use of vocal, gestural and rhythmical movement activities the development of the mother-infant relationship may be inhibited.Considering factors that affect the early development of the mother in her role as primary caregiver and the developing relationship with her infant, the investigation of two studies are reported. Study 1 was aimed at investigating the effects music and movement and face-to-face social contact on the frequency of mothers&#8217; interactions with their infants and maternal well-being. Face-to-face social contact was investigated as a factor (both independent of music and movement, and its interaction effect with music and movement) that could influence mothers&#8217; communicative interactions with their infants and maternal well-being. Study 2 investigated behavioural outcomes within the mother-infant relationship in response to the communicative effects of music and movement as measured by change in the characteristics of mothers&#8217; Infant-Directed Speech and dyadic reciprocity Results indicated that up-tempo play songs and rhymes which incorporated rhythmical movement were preferred by the mothers to engage with their infants. As an effect of the their use of the music and movement activities, mothers&#8217; interactions with their infants increased together with their perceived mother-to-infant attachment, characteristics associated with their Infant-Directed Speech and the dyadic reciprocity. Without music and movement, mothers decreased their music and movement interactions with their infants together with their perceived mother-to infant attachment, characteristics associated with their Infant-Directed Speech and the dyadic reciprocity. It was concluded that mothers&#8217; use of the music and movement program with their infants in the early post-partum months was a valuable stimulus that can enhance the mother-infant relationship.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mother and infant</field><field name="subject">play</field><field name="subject">music and children</field><field name="subject">creative activities and seat work</field><field name="subject">attachment behavior</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/31918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fruit-tree borer (Maroga melanostigma) : investigations on its biological control in prune trees</field><field name="creator">Marte, Susan Plantier</field><field name="description">Fruit-tree borer, Maroga melanostigma (Wallengren), is a native Australian pest in many species of trees. It is of particular economic importance in prune (Prunus domestica) trees because the presence of this wood boring insect can reduce productivity by an average of 5% per tree. Large areas of orchards can be affected. There are currently no chemicals registered for control of this pest. Young, New South Wales is the second largest prune-growing district in Australia and the area most seriously affected by M. melanostigma. Prune growers in the district utilise integrated pest management and were supportive of a project to investigate biological control options for this economically damaging pest. The two main objectives of the project were 1) to understand the life cycle of M. melanostigma, so biological controls could be timed appropriately; and 2) to investigate biological control options for this pest. Life cycle studies were commenced in the first season (2003/04) using field cages and light trapping. These investigations continued throughout the project. In Young, moths were found to emerge from wood over a two month period (December and January). Oviposition was assumed to be during this period however, even after extensive searches of trees, no eggs were observed. Historical data were collated to determine locations and timings of moth emergence elsewhere in Australia. The data showed that M. melanostigma has been found in every state and territory Australia, with moths observed from October through to March. The biological control options reviewed were egg parasitoids (Trichogramma species only), entomopathogenic nematodes and entomopathogenic fungi. Trichogramma were favoured because of previous research undertaken against the same pest in pecans in Moree, NSW. Entomopathogenic nematodes were also investigated due to research indicating their effectiveness in cryptic situations, such as borer tunnels in trees. Fungi were considered but dismissed due to lack of literature supporting their effectiveness in reducing lepidopteran pest damage in trees. A major field trial was designed with the assistance of a biometrician and the trial blocks laid out based on this advice. There were three trial sites, each containing four blocks of approximately 200 trees (~800 trees/site). Two blocks were designated as release blocks and two as non-release blocks to correspond with the trial&#8217;s two treatments. In the first season (2003/04) an initial visual assessment of borer damage was undertaken after leaf fall on each of the trees in the trial. This information was used as baseline data, to compare against damage levels following biological control releases in the second and third years of the project. Natural parasitism in the field was assessed using cultured eggs of Helicoverpa armigera (H&#252;bner) before and between Trichogramma carverae (Oatman and Pinto) releases. Temperature and relative humidity were recorded in each of the trial sites, for the duration of the trial, using commercially available data loggers. In the second season (2004/05), Trichogramma releases were made during the period of moth activity and H. armigera eggs were used to monitor parasitism in the trial orchards. Parasitised eggs were reared through and all parasitoids were identified as T. carverae. Damage assessments were again carried out after leaf fall to compare release versus non-release blocks, as well as to determine if there was any change in borer activity. Early instar larvae were collected from non-trial blocks and exposed to the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae in a laboratory investigation. Results from this limited bioassay were inconclusive. In the third season (2005/06), Trichogramma releases were again made during the period of moth activity and H. armigera eggs were used to monitor parasitism in the trial orchards. Parasitised eggs were reared through to emergence. The emerged parasites were identified as T. carverae, T. pretiosum and T. nr brassicae. Damage assessments were again made of all the trees in the trial. Results were statistically analysed to detect any differences between treatments. There was no statistically significant evidence that the releases of T. carverae reduced damage from M. melanostigma over the duration of the trial. Although damage increased across both release and non-release treatments in most blocks during the trial investigations, the increase was slightly lower in trees in which Trichogramma had been released. It should be noted that the experiments were affected by serious drought conditions which prevailed during the three seasons of the trial.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oecophoridae</field><field name="subject">prune</field><field name="subject">fruit</field><field name="subject">diseases and pests</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/31976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A phenomenological study of the dream-ego in Jungian practice</field><field name="creator">Hunt, John V.</field><field name="description">This study is textual in its resource rather than empirical, and is applied to the experiential nature of the dream-ego. It is conceptual in its application, and its domain of inquiry is focussed on redescribing and reinterpreting the Jungian literature in order to further inform the understanding of the role of the dream-ego in analytical psychological practice. The major underlying assumption which forms the primary foundation for this study is that &#8216;mind is the subjective experience of brain&#8217; and this statement serves the purpose of positioning the study as being anchored in biological science but not biological in scope. The statement also implies there is no conflict in the conclusions of neurobiological studies and phenomenological studies and positions these realms as correlates of each other. The subjective experience of brain is the realm in which our lives are lived and in which all our perceptions, ideas and feelings are experienced and so the phenomenological approach of the study is a consequence of that fact. The focus is on the dream-ego itself, using a selection of Jung&#8217;s own recorded dreams as vehicles to support, describe and reinterpret concepts from the literature in order to elucidate the dream-ego&#8217;s function in psychological health. If the dreaming state were exclusively an innocuous epiphenomenon of neurological processes with no experiential function, then it would be expected that the images generated would be quarantined from consciousness entirely, for reasons of psychic stability and hence then cease to be images, but the commonality and regularity of the dream-ego experience indicates an evolved psychic phenomenon with a definite relationship to the waking-ego. The remarkable images and associations experienced in dreams are expressions of the psyche&#8217;s uncompromising experiential authenticity and although these dream experiences may be profoundly complex, the dream-ego is seen to have an underlying naivety whose nature is captured by the title of Charles Rycroft&#8217;s (1981) book &#8220;The Innocence of Dreams&#8221;. When the dream-ego is contrasted to the waking-ego it becomes clear that the major difference is in this &#8216;innocence&#8217; which is a consequence of the attenuation of rationality and volition for the dream-ego. This weaker rationality and volition prevents the dream-ego from talking or walking its way out of confrontation with unconscious content which manifests before it. The dream-ego experience is based on feelings and emotions which were the original reasons and criteria driving the censorship of the &#8216;feeling toned complexes&#8217;, as Jung describes them. The experience of unconscious material by the vulnerable dream-ego and the subsequent transfer to the waking-ego provides the option for the waking-ego to &#8216;reconsider&#8217; or to make decisions based on the authentic feelings of the psyche. The fact that mammals exhibit REM sleep, and the strong case for mammals dreaming during that period, complicates the understanding of human dream function. In non dreaming sleep the ego is annihilated but is underwritten by the neural networks which constitute the ego when &#8216;active&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;. Since neural networks are known to atrophy with disuse, the sequestered ego is at risk of loss of fidelity on manifestation, and therefore may mismatch the environmental context. The study presents the dreaming state as the periodic partial activation of the &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;neural ego&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; to prevent atrophy and to maintain ego retrieval fidelity. This concept has applicability also to the animal case, since they must maintain their behavioural fluency and environmental congruence. Once the evolved dreaming state is established in mammals it may be subject to further evolutionary possibilities and subtleties in the human case. A consequence of this study is the presentation of the dream-ego as the partial arousal of the waking-ego, rather than the normal wording of the dream-ego as the half asleep waking-ego, since the dream-ego is seen as the psyche rehearsing its ego. The defining phenomenology of the dream-ego is found in its vulnerability to the feelings and emotions of the psyche, but paradoxically this vulnerability is its strength in its role as the feeling nexus between the unconscious and conscious mind. The waking-ego which may misconstrue its role in the psyche&#8217;s scheme of things and become aloof in its mentations believing all problems are intellectual, has the innocence of the dream-ego experience as its lifeline to the psyche&#8217;s authenticity. It is the intent of this study to contribute to the understanding of the role of the dream-ego  experience in therapeutic practice, and placing the dream-ego as the protagonist of the study, to be attentive to the power of its innocence.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jung, C.

The cell cytoskeleton is made up of three types of protein filaments: the microtubules, the intermediate filaments and the actin cytoskeleton. These components interact with each other to allow the cell to function correctly. When functioning incorrectly, disruptions to many cellular pathway have been observed with mutations in various cytoskeletal proteins causing an assortment of human disease phenotypes. Characterization of these filament systems in different cell types is essential to the understanding of basic cellular processes and disease causation. The studies in this thesis are concerned with examining specific cytoskeletal tropomyosin-defined actin filament systems in skeletal muscle. The diversity of the actin filament system relies, in part, on the family of actin binding proteins, the tropomyosins (Tms). There are in excess of forty Tm isoforms found in mammals which are derived from four genes: &#945;, &#946;, &#947; and &#948;Tm. The role of the musclespecific Tms in striated muscle is well understood, with sarcomeric Tm isoforms functioning as part of the thin filament where it regulates actin-myosin interactions and hence muscle contraction. However, relatively little known about the roles of the many cytoskeletal Tm isoforms. Cytoskeletal Tms have been shown to compartmentalise to form functionally distinct filaments in a range of cell types including neurons (Bryce et al., 2003), fibroblasts (Percival et al., 2000) and epithelial cells (Dalby-Payne et al., 2003). Recently it has been shown that cytoskeletal Tm, Tm5NM1 defines a cytoskeletal structure in skeletal muscle called the Z-line associated cytoskeleton (Z-LAC) (Kee et al., 2004).The disruption of this structure by over-expression of an exogenous Tm in transgenic mice results in a muscular dystrophy phenotype, indicating that the Z-LAC plays an important role in maintenance of muscle structure (Kee et al., 2004). In this study, specific cytoskeletal Tms are further investigated in the context of skeletal muscle. Here, we examine the expression, localisation and potential function of cytoskeletal Tm isoforms, focussing on Tm4 (derived from the &#948;- gene) and Tm5NM1 (derived from the &#947;-gene). By western blotting and immuno-staining mouse skeletal muscle, we show that cytoskeletal Tms are expressed in a range of muscles and define separate populations of filaments. These filaments are found in association with a number of muscle structures including the myotendinous junction, neuromuscular junction, the sarcolemma, the t-tubules and the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Of particular interest, Tm4 and Tm5NM1 define cytoskeletal elements in association with the saroplasmic reticulum and T-tubules, respectively, with a separation of less than 90 nm between distinct filamentous populations. The segregation of Tm isoforms indicates a role for Tms in the specification of actin filament function at these cellular regions. Examination of muscle during development, regeneration and disease revealed that Tm4 defines a novel cytoskeletal filament system that is orientated perpendicular to the sarcomeric apparatus. Tm4 is up-regulated in both muscular dystrophy and nemaline myopathy and also during induced regeneration and focal repair in mouse muscle. Transition of the Tm4-defined filaments from a predominsnatly longitudinal to a predominantly Z-LAC orientation is observed during the course of muscle regeneration. This study shows that Tm4 is a marker of regeneration and repair, in response to disease, injury and stress in skeletal muscle. Analysis of Tm5NM1 over-expressing (Tm5/52) and null (9d89) mice revealed that compensation between Tm genes does not occur in skeletal muscle. We found that the levels of cytoskeletal Tms derived from the &#948;-gene are not altered to compensate for the loss or gain of Tm5NM1 and that the localisation of Tm4 is unchanged in skeletal muscle of these mice. Also, excess Tm5NM1 is sorted correctly, localising to the ZLAC. This data correlates with evidence from previous investigations which indicates that Tm isoforms are not redundant and are functionally distinct (Gunning et al., 2005). Transgenic and null mice have also allowed the further elucidation of cytoskeletal Tm function in skeletal muscle. Analyses of these mice suggest a role for Tm5NM1 in glucose regulation in both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Tm5NM1 is found to colocalise with members of the glucose transport p fibres and analysis of both transgenic and null mice has shown an alteration to glucose uptake in adipose tissue. Taken together these data indicate that Tm5NM1 may play a role in the translocation of the glucose transport molecule GLUT4. In addition to this Tm5NM1 may play a role in adipose tissue regulation, since over-expressing mice found to have increased white adipose tissue and an up-regulation of a transcriptional regulator of fat-cell formation, PPAR-&#947;.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tropomyosins</field><field name="subject">cytoskeletal proteins</field><field name="subject">muscle proteins</field><field name="subject">muscles</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">actin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/32176</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moment beyond moment</field><field name="creator">Xie , Jiahua</field><field name="description">This practice-based project explores the photographic phenomenon of &#8216;moment beyond moment&#8217;, which refers to the combined representations of an existing image in an environment, together with the real-life situation at the moment the photograph is taken.

Once these monkeys are introduced into captive environments their diets are selective, seasonal and presented to them by their keepers. The captive environment often leads to various behavioural abnormalities and compensatory behaviours or stereotypies. To address this issue, environmental enrichment can be employed to reduce, cure or prevent such an occurrence. Enrichment can reduce stress, while increasing animal well-being and health in captivity. Despite previous work a better understanding of enrichment, for most neo-tropical primate species, is necessary, in order to improve their captive lifestyles.  Feeding of captive primates is more complex than providing a balanced nutritional diet as it must also meet their ethological needs. The manipulation of the presentation of the diet has been shown to significantly decrease the incidence of resting, while significantly increasing the incidence of playing, grooming, foraging and manual manipulation of dietary items. Eleven capuchin monkeys were presented with four different feeding treatments (i.e. cut food presented in bowls, cut food presented around the enclosure, uncut food presented around the enclosure and novel feeding devices presented around the enclosure) from December 2007 until May 2008. At the start of every month one of three feeding treatments was introduced with the cut food in bowls feeding treatment interleaved between the treatments.  The different feeding treatments required the monkeys to search for their food, break-up their food into manageable sizes, and obtain food in touch-, tool- and manipulative-dependent methods in order to allow the monkeys an opportunity to display increased activity more in line with their wild conspecifics. The capuchins displayed a period of intense foraging directly following feeding. This period significantly increased (from 44 to 121 min.), along with foraging events and the proportion of time spent foraging, which was more in line with their wild conspecifics. In addition, the frequency of occurrence and the proportion of time spent on locomotion and resting was shown to decrease. Also, abnormal behaviours ceased to occur during the study.  Environmental enrichment is a useful tool for providing stimulation, redistributing activity levels more in line with wild conspecifics and to combat abnormal and compensatory behaviours.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">capuchin</field><field name="subject">Cebus apella</field><field name="subject">enrichment</field><field name="subject">undesirable behaviours</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270707 Sociobiology and behavioural ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380300 Cognitive Science::380306 Planning and problem solving</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/779</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management of stock effluent spillage from trucks in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Thull, Jean-Paul</field><field name="description">The key objective of this multi-disciplinary research was to seek for feasible solutions to avoid effluent from livestock trucks spilling onto roads. Stock effluent spillage mainly poses road safety hazards and environmental damage, and also causes offence to road users and tourists. This task required reviewing previous institutional actions, assessing the power of the existing legislation, and evaluating the interests and attitudes of the stakeholder groups involved in the overall livestock supply chain. It was also necessary to consider politics, administration, public policy and economics, gaining the willing cooperation and confidence of the stakeholder groups through application of 'Soft Systems Methodology' (SSM). A key component was the creation of a 13 minute video and its associated brochure as a primary tool for a stakeholder educational awareness programme. It was necessary to analyse the complex relationships between livestock preparation prior to transport; effluent produced in-transit; and end product quality factors. Detailed information pertaining to the nature of livestock shipments by truck in the South Island of New Zealand had to be collected and verified. All the above information were fed into the calculation of an ideal network of in-transit effluent discharge sites on State Highways in the South Island of New Zealand. Assuming the adoption of best practice throughout the supply chain, it was possible to recommend sustainable solutions. The problem is amenable to solution. Adoption of a strong Industry Code of Practice, coupled with the construction of a strategic network of dump sites will enable the industry to avoid the heavy-handed legal consequences of allowing the status quo to continue.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">livestock effluent production during transport</field><field name="subject">waste management</field><field name="subject">meat quality</field><field name="subject">supply chain management</field><field name="subject">soft systems methodology</field><field name="subject">educational programme (video)</field><field name="subject">network modelling</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350400 Transportation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/778</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ReFashion reDunn : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dunn, Janet</field><field name="description">This study arises out of the researcher&#8217;s experience in the fields of costume and fashion.

Differences in design process between conventional fashion and ReFashion are detailed to highlight the significance of provenance of materials in the light of a perceived need to slow down clothing production and consumption. This perception is informed by scientific predictions that failure to engage with urgently needed changes to the prevalent economic paradigm will result in planet earth reaching a tipping point with potentially disastrous results for its inhabitants. Fundamental to the ReFashion ethos is preparedness for a speculative post-apocalyptic future that might render the fashion system unable to operate as it currently does, necessitating a more self-sufficient approach to clothing needs, with an accompanying shift in perceptions of what is deemed fashionable. The theme Survivalist Fantasy provides a lens to bring conceptual and material aspects of the work into focus. Informed by sustainability, Survivalist Fantasy recontextualises a failure of sustainable initiatives on a global scale and their adaptation on a local scale specifically in the arena of clothing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fashion</field><field name="subject">costume</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">recycled materials</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motivating contribution within a networked community environment : this thesis is presented in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Design, Massey University, College of Creative Arts, Toi Ruawharangi, Institute of Communicative Design, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Brown, Chris</field><field name="description">To be successful, social network sites need continual activity to flourish and grow. One of the most important challenges faced by designers of social network sites, is to encourage contribution from community members. &#8216;Self-sustainability&#8217; is critical to the survival of networked communities and is dependent on community members adding content in a sustained way over time. Motivating community members to take it upon themselves to freely contribute information is the key to the success of any social network environment (Powazek, 2002; Ling et al., 2005). This thesis aims to investigate whether persuasion techniques can be used to inform the design process in order to motivate members of a social network community to contribute content. While persuasion theories have been effective in influencing target behaviour outside of the online environment, traditionally they have not been utilised by digital media designers. With the advent of social media, the application of social psychology is becoming more valuable in the development of features and strategies for the online environment. Recently the field of Captology has begun to systematically investigate computers as persuasive technology. Within this field, this thesis has investigated using the &#8216;Elaboration Likelihood Model&#8217; (ELM) as a strategic framework and &#8216;Social Proof&#8217; as a motivating influence to develop peripheral elements designed to encourage user online contribution, and to design a site that is visually appealing and functional. This is essential in establishing the credibility of the site without which the influences of persuasion are unable to function. This Masters &#8216;research through design&#8217; project engages an existing community group of water sports enthusiasts in a trial of a live prototype website. The website was designed to utilise the internet as a medium and social networking as a tool, in order to gather individual knowledge, give it a context, and to create a self-sustaining collective knowledge base of locations, optimum conditions and user experiences. Users were divided randomly into two groups &#8211; the test and the control. Using ELM, the peripheral and central routes of processing communication were identified, and used to build the framework on which to develop the test environment. Both groups were exposed to the same fundamental design and functionality, however the test group was presented with additional peripheral elements designed using the principles of Social Proof. The research charted user contributions over the course of 82 days, with a survey undertaken with both groups at the completion of the test period. Results indicated a significant difference between the two test groups with users exposed to the influences of Social Proof more motivated to contribute content and visit the website more often than users from the control group. The findings of this study show that motivating contribution can be achieved using ELM and Social Proof to design persuasive elements in a social networking environment. The synthesis of graphic design, interface design and the theories of social science can guide designers in the creative process of developing networked environments for social media, and lead to a more engaging user experience.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social networks</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">persuasion</field><field name="subject">motivation</field><field name="subject">elaboration liklihood model</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380105 Social and community psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visually representative web history browser : a thesis submitted to the College of Creative Arts, Massey University, New Zealand, as fulfilment for the degree Master of Design</field><field name="creator">Hodgkinson, Gray</field><field name="description">The familiar computer graphic user interface (GUI) makes extensive use of visually representative devices such as folders and files. These symbols help the user deal with computer data and operations that otherwise have little or no physical form. The computer&#8217;s underlying complexity is symbolised for the user, who is then able to manipulate the computer by interacting directly with the interface. The early development of computer interface design was largely the domain of software and hardware developers. Many sound principles of user interaction and testing were established and provided essential guidance for new generations of interface designers. As computer technology and its tools became more widely available, a broader range of designers began contributing, including those from product design and visual communication. This study is written from the point of view of a &#8220;visual designer&#8221; &#8211; a designer who began his career in graphic design and who has moved towards interface design out of curiosity and a desire to proffer a different attitude and approach to interface issues. The study therefore will demonstrate a design process that many visual designers will be able to identify with. The process includes research, analysis, methodical progression and artistic inspiration. The artistic inspiration in this case comes from the Constructivist artist El Lissitzky, and will illustrate the significant contribution that art can make to interface design. This art-influenced design process was presented at the 2005 Ed-Media World Conference on Educational Multimedia, (Montreal, 2005). The enthusiastic response and discussion provided encouragement to continue in this direction. In the following year another presentation, which included the working prototype, was presented as part of a keynote speaker presentation at the 2006 Siggraph Taipei Conference, National Chiao Tung University, Taipei. The specific task chosen to work with in this study is that of Web browser history. As a user browses the Web the computer records a list of visited websites. The first few generations of browsers presented this information as a simple list, but this approach incorporated many flaws and caused problems for users. More recent browsers provide more options, but significant issues remain. This study offers solutions to several of these problems. The resulting design prototype is named &#8220;isoBrowser&#8221;. It is the result of the alternative design process outlined above and offers alternative methods of visualising, organising and manipulating data. The prototype is not intended to be fully functional nor &#8220;live&#8221;. However, it is sufficiently operable so as to test interface interaction and user response. A fully functional version, operably and aesthetically complete, would be the subject of further development.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">World Wide Web</field><field name="subject">web browser</field><field name="subject">graphical user interface</field><field name="subject">web history</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paganini's 24 Caprices opus 1 : a transcription for electric guitar, and analysis and development of the techniques required to perform them : a thesis submitted in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of PhD, Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Davenport, Andrew Russell</field><field name="description">Since the late 1970s much interest has been shown in the development of electric guitar technique. Advances have been considerable, enabling players to explore new genres and repertoires but development methodologies have remained woefully fragmented. A new approach that sets out to promote electric guitar technique with development methodology is the purpose of this study. To this end, a process of transcription combined with an advanced technical analysis has been undertaken including a full categorization of the technical subgroups extant within each Caprice. The hypothesis behind this task has been to ascertain whether a &#8216;technical essence&#8217; could be discovered in the Caprices and how that could be imparted in the process of transcription. Transcribing the 24 Caprices for the electric guitar disclosed the technical components required for development which were then reduced to their constitute elements. The virtuosity and variation within the Caprices ensured that the each identified technique was developed to a high degree. The subjective nature of transcription ensured that multiple solutions were explored when a single solution to a technical problem was not obvious. The analysis section of the study demonstrated that three fundamental techniques were required to play all 24 Caprices: alternate-picking, sweep-picking, and hammer-ons and pull-offs. The analyses also provided trends showing how each technique needed to be developed to comprehensively cover all twenty-four pieces. In conclusion, the hypothesis was found to be correct.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electric guitar</field><field name="subject">transcription</field><field name="subject">development methodology</field><field name="subject">technical analysis</field><field name="subject">Paganini, Nicol&#242;, 1782-1840</field><field name="subject">Caprices</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impacts of urbanisation and metal pollution on freshwater turtles</field><field name="creator">Browne, Carol</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">turtle</field><field name="subject">pollution</field><field name="subject">urban wildlife</field><field name="subject">heavy metal</field><field name="subject">haematology</field><field name="subject">freshwater</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">reproduction</field><field name="subject">leeches</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of concern: The ethical dilemma of using Nazi medical research data in contemporary medical and scientific research</field><field name="creator">Halpin, Ross William</field><field name="description">MA (Research)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">National Socialism And Medicine</field><field name="subject">Ethics</field><field name="subject">Medical Research</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Becoming deafblind: Negotiating a place in a hostile world</field><field name="creator">Schneider, Julie</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disability, deafblind, adults, qualitative research, social experiences, sensory impairment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamical Subgrid-scale Parameterizations for Quasigeostrophic Flows using Direct Numerical Simulations</field><field name="creator">Zidikheri, Meelis Juma</field><field name="description">In this thesis, parameterizations of non-linear interactions in quasigeostrophic (QG) flows for severely truncated models (STM) and Large Eddy Simulations (LES) are studied.
Firstly, using Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS), atmospheric barotropic flows over topography
are examined, and it is established that such flows exhibit multiple equilibrium states for a wide range of parameters. A STM is then constructed, consisting of the large
scale zonal flow and a topographic mode. It is shown that, qualitatively, this system behaves similarly to the DNS as far as the interaction between the zonal flow and topography
is concerned, and, in particular, exhibits multiple equilibrium states. By fitting the analytical form of the topographic stationary wave amplitude, obtained from the STM,
to the results obtained from DNS, renormalized dissipation and rotation parameters are obtained. The usage of renormalized parameters in the STM results in better quantitative
agreement with the DNS.&#182;
In the second type of problem, subgrid-scale parameterizations in LES are investigated with both atmospheric and oceanic parameters. This is in the context of two-level QG flows on the sphere, mostly, but not exclusively, employing a spherical harmonic triangular truncation at wavenumber 63 (T63) or higher. The methodology that is used is spectral, and is motivated by the stochastic representation of statistical closure theory, with the &#145;damping&#146; and forcing covariance, representing backscatter, determined from the statistics
of DNS. The damping and forcing covariance are formulated as 2 &#215; 2 matrices for each wavenumber. As well as the transient subgrid tendency, the mean subgrid tendency is needed in the LES when the energy injection region is unresolved; this is also calculated from the statistics of the DNS. For comparison, a deterministic parameterization scheme consisting of 2&#215;2 &#145;damping&#146; parameters, which are calculated from the statistics of DNS,
has been constructed. The main difference between atmospheric and oceanic flows, in this thesis, is that the atmospheric LES completely resolves the deformation scale, the energy and enstrophy injection region, and the truncation scale is spectrally distant from it, being well in the enstrophy cascade inertial range. In oceanic flows, however, the truncation scale is in the vicinity of the injection scale, at least for the parameters chosen, and is therefore not in an inertial range. A lower resolution oceanic LES at T15 is also examined, in which case the injection region is not resolved at all.&#182;
For atmospheric flows, it is found that, at T63, the matrix parameters are practically diagonal so that stratified atmospheric flows at these resolutions may be treated as uncoupled
layers as far as subgrid-scale parameterizations are concerned. It is also found that the damping parameters are relatively independent of the (vertical) level, but the
backscatter parameters are proportional to the subgrid flux in a given level. The stochastic
and deterministic parameterization schemes give comparably good results relative to the DNS. For oceanic flows, it is found that the full matrix structure of the parameters must be used. Furthermore, it is found that there is a strong injection of barotropic energy
from the subgrid scales, due to the unresolved, or partially resolved, baroclinic instability injection scales. It is found that the deterministic parameterization is too numerically unstable to be of use in the LES, and instead the stochastic parameterization must be used to obtain good agreement with the DNS. The subgrid tendency of the ensemble mean flow is also needed in some problems, and is found to reduce the available potential energy of
the flow.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dynamical</field><field name="subject">subgrid</field><field name="subject">parameterizations</field><field name="subject">quasigeostrophic</field><field name="subject">direct</field><field name="subject">numerical</field><field name="subject">simulations</field><field name="subject">atmosphere</field><field name="subject">ocean</field><field name="subject">mesoscale</field><field name="subject">eddies</field><field name="subject">baroclinic</field><field name="subject">instability</field><field name="subject">multiple</field><field name="subject">equilibria</field><field name="subject">topography</field><field name="subject">geophysical</field><field name="subject">fluid</field><field name="subject">dynamics</field><field name="subject">stochastic</field><field name="subject">closure</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090108.112027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intellectual disability co-occurring with schizophrenia and other psychiatric illness : epidemiology, risk factors and outcome</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Vera Anne</field><field name="description">(Truncated abstract) The aims of this thesis are: (i) To estimate the prevalence of psychiatric illness among persons with intellectual disability and, conversely, the prevalence of intellectual disability among persons with a psychiatric illness; (ii) To describe the disability and service utilisation profile of persons with conjoint disorder; (iii) To examine, in particular, intellectual disability co-occurring with schizophrenia; and (iv) To explore the role of hereditary and environmental (specifically obstetric) risk factors in the aetiology of (i) intellectual disability and (ii) intellectual disability co-occurring with psychiatric illness. This thesis has a special interest in the relationship between intellectual disability and schizophrenia. Where data and sample sizes permit, it explores that relationship at some depth and has included sections on the putative nature of the link between intellectual disability and schizophrenia in the introductory and discussion chapters. To realise its objectives, the thesis comprises a core study focusing on aims (i) &#150; (iii) and a supplementary study whose focus is aim (iv). It also draws on work from an ancillary study completed prior to the period of candidacy...This thesis found that, overall, 31.7% of persons with an intellectual disability had a psychiatric illness; 1.8% of persons with a psychiatric illness had an intellectual disability. The rate of schizophrenia, but not bipolar disorder or unipolar major depression, was greatly increased among cases of conjoint disorder: depending on birth cohort, 3.7-5.2% of individuals with intellectual disability had co-occurring schizophrenia. Down syndrome was much less prevalent among conjoint disorder cases despite being the most predominant cause of intellectual disability while pervasive developmental disorder was over-represented. Persons with conjoint disorder had a more severe clinical profile including higher mortality rates than those with a single disability. The supplementary study confirmed the findings in the core body of work with respect to the extent of conjoint disorder, its severity, and its relationship with pervasive development disorder and Down syndrome. Moreover, the supplementary study and the ancillary influenza study indicated a role for neurodevelopmental insults including obstetric complications in the adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes, with timing of the insult a potentially critical element in defining the specific outcome. The supplementary study also added new information on familiality in intellectual disability. It found that, in addition to parental intellectual disability status and exposure to labour and delivery complications at birth, parental psychiatric status was an independent predictor of intellectual disability in offspring as well as a predictor of conjoint disorder. In conclusion, the facility to collect and integrate records held by separate State administrative health jurisdictions, and to analyse them within the one database has had a marked impact on the capacity for this thesis to estimate the prevalence of conjoint disorder among intellectually disabled and psychiatric populations, and to understand more about its clinical manifestations and aetiological underpinnings.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Developmental disabilities</field><field name="subject">Mental illness -- Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Mental illness -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Mental illness -- Risk factors</field><field name="subject">Schizophrenia -- Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Schizophrenia -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Schizophrenia -- Risk factors</field><field name="subject">Schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">Intellectual disability</field><field name="subject">Environmental risk factors</field><field name="subject">Psychiatric illness</field><field name="subject">Genetic risk factors</field><field name="subject">Obstetric complications</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discovering the lost race story : writing science fiction, writing temporality</field><field name="creator">Hall, Karen Peta</field><field name="description">Genres are constituted, implicitly and explicitly, through their construction of the past. Genres continually reconstitute themselves, as authors, producers and, most importantly, readers situate texts in relation to one another; each text implies a reader who will locate the text on a spectrum of previously developed generic characteristics. Though science fiction appears to be a genre concerned with the future, I argue that the persistent presence of lost race stories &#150; where the contemporary world and groups of people thought to exist only in the past intersect &#150; in science fiction demonstrates that the past is crucial in the operation of the genre. By tracing the origins and evolution of the lost race story from late nineteenth-century novels through the early twentieth-century American pulp science fiction magazines to novel-length narratives, and narrative series, at the end of the twentieth century, this thesis shows how the consistent presence, and varied uses, of lost race stories in science fiction complicates previous critical narratives of the history and definitions of science fiction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History in literature</field><field name="subject">Science fiction -- Authorship</field><field name="subject">Science fiction -- Women authors -- History and criticism</field><field name="subject">Science fiction, English -- History and criticism</field><field name="subject">Time in literature</field><field name="subject">Science fiction</field><field name="subject">Genre</field><field name="subject">Temporality</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological adjustments to aestivation and activity in the cocoon-forming frogs Cyclorana platycephala and Cyclorana maini</field><field name="creator">Word, James Mabry</field><field name="description">The desert-adapted frogs Cyclorana platycephala and Cyclorana maini survive long periods of inhospitably hot and dry conditions by retreating underground and aestivating.

How these frogs function during this exceptional state is largely unknown. This work characterized a number of physiological parameters in three metabolic states spanning their natural metabolic range: during aestivation (depressed metabolism), at rest (normal metabolism), and where possible, during exercise (elevated metabolism). The primary objective was to identify by comparison, physiological adjustments in these parameters to metabolic depression, as well as the scope of these parameters in frogs capable of aestivation. The parameters measured for C. maini were (a) the glucose transport kinetics and (b) the fluid balance of an extensive number of their individual organs.

Despite the efforts of the SEC, financial reporting scandals continue with record numbers of financial restatements documented by the General Accounting Office. A financial restatement is a correction of a previously misstated financial statement.  There is a small volume of literature examining the effects of corporate governance mechanisms on financial restatements. The results of these studies however, are mixed and possibly explained by their narrow focus and omitted variables that could influence the effectiveness of audit committees. Consequently, this study examines the effects of independent audit committee member characteristics and auditor independence on financial restatements.  Specifically, this study investigates the relationship between the likelihood of financial restatements and: (1) the expertise of the independent audit committee members, (2) the expertise and diligence of the independent audit committee members, (3) the reputation of the independent audit committee members, (4) the interaction effect of expertise, diligence and reputation, (5) the tenure of the independent audit committee members, and (6) the cash compensation paid to independent audit committee members. Prior studies have not investigated some of these variables or the interaction effects of independent audit committee member characteristics on financial restatements. This study also investigates the association between auditor independence and financial restatements. The SEC alleges that an increasing number of audit failures are due to the lack of auditor independence. One of the major sources of the lack of auditor independence is the auditor&#146;s economic dependency on the client. The provision of non-audit services increases the financial reliance of the auditor on the client. As a result, the auditor may become reluctant to raise issues with the preparation of the financial statements at the risk of foregoing the lucrative non-audit services fees. The SEC believes that longer audit firm tenure can also impair auditor independence and Section 203 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act suggests periodic audit firm rotation.  Therefore, auditor independence was measured as: (1) fees paid to the auditor, and (2) audit firm tenure.  Finally, this study extends the prior literature by studying the interaction effects of independent audit committee member characteristics and auditor independence on financial restatements. This interaction effect is important because the external auditor and the audit committee are regarded vital governance mechanisms that interact and exchange dialogue in the performance of their respective oversight of the financial reporting process. Prior research has not investigated this important interaction effect.  The sample of the study comprises 69 U.S. publicly listed companies that announced their restatement from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2002. These companies were matched with 69 non-restatement companies based on industry and size. The data for the study is derived from SEC filings such as Form 10-K and DEF 14A, and Compustat. The univariate results show that compared to restatement firms, non-restatement firms generally have effective audit committee characteristics. The audit committees of non-restatement firms have members who are experts, diligent, reputable and appropriately compensated. They also pay lower non-audit services and total fees, and have audit firms with longer tenure.  The multivariate results show that after controlling for other governance structures and firm specific non-governance variables, the likelihood of financial restatements is related to independent audit committee member characteristics and auditor independence. Specifically, the likelihood of financial restatements decreases when independent audit committee members are: (1) experts, (2) experts and diligent, (3) reputable, (4) experts, diligent and reputable, and (5) appropriately compensated. The audit committee member tenure variable is insignificant. In relation to the auditor independence variables, the multivariate results show that the likelihood of financial restatements increases when the non-audit services and total fees generated by the client are higher. On the other hand, the likelihood of financial restatements decreases when audit firm tenure is longer. The empirical results of this study suggest that independent audit committees are more effective overseers of the corporate financial reporting and auditing processes when: they comprise majority experts, they meet regularly, their members are reputable, and audit committee members are appropriately compensated. On the other hand, external auditors are not deemed to be effective overseers of the corporate financial reporting process when the non-audit services and total fees generated by the client are higher but are effective when audit firm tenure is long.  The results support the SEC&#146;s concerns regarding the provision of non-audit services impairing auditor independence. The results also support the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which under Section 201 prohibits external auditors from providing certain non-audit services to its audit client. Overall, these results support the regulatory efforts to increase the quality of financial reporting by enhancing the corporate governance process related to audit committees and auditor independence. However, the results do not support calls to limit the tenure of the auditor.  The results of the multivariate interaction effects suggest that, after controlling for other governance structures and firm specific non-governance variables, when the non-audit services and total fees generated by the client are higher, the likelihood of financial restatements increases under conditions when the audit committee is not effective (a non expert audit committee, an audit committee that does not meet regularly, an audit committee whose members are not reputable or an audit committee that is not appropriately compensated). The implication of this result is that it provides evidence of conditions under which restatements take place. Knowledge of such conditions could aid regulators further improve the financial reporting process and corporate governance. This knowledge will support regulators in revising policies that ensure audit committee members are not only independent but also comprise other critical qualities.  These improvements to the audit committee coupled with the existing regulations on the provision of non-audit services suggest a company&#146;s governance will be more effective.  Overall, the results extend current knowledge in the sparse but growing literature related to financial restatements and corporate governance, and extend our understanding of the effectiveness and interaction of governance mechanisms in reducing financial restatements.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Independent Audit</field><field name="subject">Committee Member Characteristics</field><field name="subject">Financial Restatements</field><field name="subject">U.S.</field><field name="subject">Securities and Exchange Commission</field><field name="subject">SEC</field><field name="subject">financial reporting</field><field name="subject">stock market</field><field name="subject">accounting profession</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20071108.143642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What a photograph can and cannot do: a visual investigation into the social phenomena of photographs as a memory device</field><field name="creator">Shirley, Anne</field><field name="description">As members of extended families and genealogical lines we collect and view photographs to remember. By situating the present investigation within the context of archival family photographic collections, this research seeks to understand the assumptions surrounding the interplay between the practice of viewing photographs and notions of remembering. Historically, photography has been connected to concepts of stability and truth with photographic images acting as a metaphor for &#8216;real lived experiences&#8217;. When a photograph is viewed, whatever was present before the camera is verified. In his seminal text Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography (1980), French theorist Roland Barthes describes this as &#8216;a truth to presence&#8217; (Barthes 1980: 84). Barthes links this position to Poststructuralist theory, by determining that photographic signifiers, denotative data, are stable where as the signified, the idea or meaning, is contingent on what a viewer brings to that particular &#8216;text&#8217;. Therefore the viewer relies on denotative data to process meaning. This research explores the ways photographers play with photographic processes to disrupt ideas of stability of meaning surrounding this medium. The visual component of this research explores the expectations that socio-cultural groups, specifically extended families, have when viewing photographs. The subsequent work will endeavour to lay bare the interplay between such expectations and the supposed reliability of the photograph in respect to both meaning and perception. Using an archive of my own extended family&#8217;s collection of photographs, this thesis seeks to disrupt the story-telling qualities of photographs. This interruption strategy points to poststructuralist discourses surrounding the stability of the photographic image and the context in which photography is grounded. The work will challenge viewers to re-assess what the photograph can or cannot do. The final work will be comprised of 80% practice and 20% exegesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Photograph</field><field name="subject">Memory device</field><field name="subject">Family photographs</field><field name="subject">Viewing photographs</field><field name="subject">Contemporary art</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/455</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Benthic-invertebrate diversity of Tucetona laticostata (Mollusca: Bivalvia) biogenic substrata in Hauraki Gulf</field><field name="creator">Dewas, Severine Emmanuelle Alexandra</field><field name="description">Marine ecosystems are increasingly being subject to human impact from diverse recreational and commercial activities, not necessarily restricted to those of a marine nature.

Tucetona laticostata still occurs in a few isolated pockets of sea bed throughout Hauraki Gulf, particularly off Otata Island, part of the Noises complex of islands, where it resides partially buried in shell and rock gravels in shallow water (to 15 metres depth). The shells of T. laticostata collect in large post-mortem deposits in an area ramping from the sea bed off southwestern Otata Island.  These mounds differ significantly in structural complexity from those of adjacent, extensively fragmented shell and rock gravels. Using the mounds of T. laticostata shell as a proxy for structural complexity, in order to appraise the effect of complexity on benthic-invertebrate diversity, the sea bed off southwestern Otata Island was sampled quarterly at two depths and in both T. laticostata shell mounds and adjacent extensively fragmented shell and rock gravels.  These data were complemented with those from additional surveys around Otata Island, and off eastern Motutapu Island to determine the distribution and composition of benthic-invertebrate community assemblages throughout the region, and from concurrent surveys throughout the Waitemata Harbour and inner Hauraki Gulf to determine the current distribution of T. laticostata in this region. The number of benthic invertebrate species and individuals within T. laticostata habitat almost always was higher than that occurring within extensively fragmented shell- and rock gravel habitat, with densities to 142,385 individuals m-2 encountered. Temporal and spatial variations in benthic community structure also are reported for the two habitats, T. laticostata-based shells and extensively fragmented shell- and rock gravels. The numbers of species were higher amongst samples collected off the southwestern and eastern sides of Otata Island than elsewhere around this island, or of eastern Motutapu Island. Of the 351 species reported from all Otata and Motutapu Island samples combined, 73% of them occurred off southwestern Otata Island, 30% of which were found exclusively within T. laticostata shell habitat, and 10.5% within extensively fragmented shell and rock gravel habitat. The sea bed off southwestern Otata Island is regularly, seasonally dredged by recreational scallop fishers, in addition to being a popular small-vessel anchorage site.  Both of these activities, dredging and anchorage, stand to reduce substratum complexity by fragmentation and dispersal of the valves of T. laticostata.  Given the unique benthic invertebrates reported from T. laticostata shell deposits reported from southwestern Otata Island, any activity that damages the shells of this species, regardless of whether they are live or dead, is likely to result in loss of biodiversity. Admittedly, many of species identified as major contributors to differences in benthic invertebrate assemblages between T. laticostata shell-based habitats and those of extensively fragmented shell and rock gravels are not particularly charismatic or large, but each likely plays a role in local food webs and/or sediment and water column chemistry. It was not the intention of this research to determine the effects of anthropogenic disturbances like dredging or vessel anchorage on benthic-invertebrate communities off southwestern Otata Island. However, given the reported differences in species diversity within the structurally complex substratum provided by T. laticostata, conservation of biogenic reef-forming species like it might be a prudent, precautionary measure to take.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tucetona laticostata</field><field name="subject">Ecosystem engineer</field><field name="subject">Benthic invertebrate community</field><field name="subject">Hauraki Gulf</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The invisible view: Betwixt and between</field><field name="creator">Latimer, Christine</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the idea of a liminal space, as being dreamlike, suspended in time and physically unlocatable.

The study in particular investigates the possibility of establishing a link between relevant traditional youth upbringing methods and the positive youth development approaches emerging from the Western world. Positive youth development approaches are those strength-based approaches that promote young people&#8217;s capabilities to learn and strive in the diverse settings they live, in contrast to the conventional youth development approaches which addresses immediate youth problems. The National Youth Policy of PNG focuses on involving young men and women in meaningful activities in social, spiritual, political, and cultural development through participation in the affairs of their families and communities. The results of the research indicated that the Youth Policy&#8217;s objectives were never fully implemented in Goroka. This may have contributed to the numerous problems encountered by young people that include: confusion between traditional and modern cultures, poverty and hardship, drug and alcohol abuse, prostitution, theft, and unemployment. The enormous efforts by schools, churches, government departments, donors, and youth-oriented organisations to deal with youth issues seemed inadequate in relation to the contemporary youth population. It is evident that conventional youth development approaches have failed to educate young people that it is a viable option to return home and become productive citizens. Thus alternative youth development approaches have to be found to assist these youth. This finding points to a need to establish a link between traditional culture, whereby the whole community takes responsibility for guiding young men and women through the transition to adulthood, and positive youth development. It suggests further research should be conducted to determine how this might be achieved by building upon the existing youth development approaches and strategies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">youth development</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420301 Cultural policy studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding Attitudes towards Performance in Knowledge-intensive Work: The Influence of Social Networks and ICT Use</field><field name="creator">Chung, Kon Shing Kenneth</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social network, individual performance, ICT use, technology acceptance, knowledge-intensive work, rural doctors, general practitioners</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychosemiotics : communication as psychological action</field><field name="creator">Milic&#769;, Marko</field><field name="description">The investigation of semiosis calls for an interdisciplinary approach. A realist logical framework emphasising the triadic nature of semiosis is the optimal foundation for critically examining and integrating aspects of quantitative psychology, the interpretative-qualitative tradition in the social sciences, structuralist semiotics, and functional-contextual semiotics. While several aspects of each of these fields can be successfully integrated into a psychosemiotic model, each also suffers from key conceptual flaws which need to be addressed as a prerequisite to an interdisciplinary approach. The structuralist school of semiotics&#8212;and the functionalist approaches that have evolved from it&#8212;show problematic tendencies to reduce the triadic relationship of semiosis to relationships within systems of signifiers. On the other hand, mainstream schools of psychology, with their narrow commitment to the operationalisation and quantification of variables, leave little room for the qualitative concept of semiosis. Moreover, the phenomenon of intentional action, which is crucial in understanding semiosis, is ignored or marginalised in both mainstream psychology and the qualitative-interpretative traditions of the social sciences. Mainstream psychology marginalises intentional action in favour of observable behaviour. The qualitative-interpretative tradition marginalises intentional action in favour of situational conventions governing action. In the psychosemiotic model that emerges from an engagement with these problems, semiosis is an intentional action that can be investigated in a scientific framework where the contextual factors of culture, social structure and social situation are taken into account. The descriptive and explanatory powers of the psychosemiotic model can be illustrated with analyses of specific cases of semiotic action in social and cultural contexts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">semiotics</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/35214</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A CPI approach using radiation awareness and evidence based medicine to achieve appropriate use of medical imaging examinations</field><field name="creator">Nol, James E.</field><field name="description">A prospective intervention study, using clinical practice improvement (CPI) methodology, was undertaken to reduce unnecessary x-ray examinations in the early management of patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED). This was achieved through raising the awareness of medical and allied health staff to medical radiation by means of clinical education and implementing evidence based diagnostic imaging requisition. The main study was conducted in the ED of a public hospital located in the western Sydney, Australia. A second hospital within the area health service, with similar bed size, activity levels and demographics, was used as the control site. The first phase intervention raised the awareness of the health professionals to medical radiation. The second phase intervention used CPI methodology to attain efficient clinical practices so as to eliminate unnecessary examinations and requests. A multi-disciplinary CPI Project Team involved in the process of imaging examination requisition was empowered to improve the appropriateness of the requested examination utilisation. This it achieved mainly through the implementation of evidence based clinical decision rules and imaging guidelines. An additional method of validating the outcomes was provided through the simultaneous rollout of the interventions at another hospital within the same area health service. At the completion of the study, unnecessary examinations such as Skull, Ribs, Nasal Bone and Kidney Ureter Bladder (KUB) requests at the intervention Hospital site were significantly reduced by 92.6% (p (less than) 0.0001), whereas at the control site Hospital  there was minimal reduction which was found to be not statistically significant (p=0.2110). Other frequently requested examinations such as Ankle, Knee and Spine requests were marginally though significantly reduced at the intervention Hospital by 22.7% (p (less than) 0.001), whereas at the control site Hospital the reduction was similarly found to be not significant (p=0.1055). Most importantly, the overall x-ray requisition for every 100 ED presentations at Hospital &#8216;B&#8217; was reduced by 27%. The results of this study, demonstrated that Radiation Awareness educational programs, targeting medical and allied health staff, will reduce the unnecessary requisition of examinations found not to contribute to the process of the patient&#8217;s clinical management. The use of a CPI project approach was found to be important in the process of establishing, implementing and sustaining the achieved improvements, and in particular, the rules and guidelines of evidence based imaging requisition. Importantly, the study also confirmed that the CPI methodology that had been used for the main intervention was adaptable to other organisations when it was found to have been successfully rolled out at another hospital. This confirmed that the main outcomes of the investigation could be generalised to other health facilities. There was an immediate reduction in the requisition of unnecessary examination similar to the results at the main intervention hospital. The implementation and adoption of the CPI intervention across the health care system in general could significantly reduce unnecessary x-ray examinations, saving significant health care resources, and sparing patients from potential cancer risks associated with avoidable exposure to ionising medical radiation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diagnostic imaging</field><field name="subject">radiology</field><field name="subject">evidence-based medicine</field><field name="subject">medical personnel</field><field name="subject">education (continuing education)</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/35251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching programming strategies explicitly to novice
programmers</field><field name="creator">de Raadt, Michael</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: The traditional approach to training novice programmers has been to provide explicit programming knowledge instruction but to rely on implicit instruction of programming strategies. Studies, reported in literature, have discovered universally poor results on standardised tests for novices studying under this traditional approach.This dissertation describes the explicit integration of programming strategies into instruction and assessment of novice programmers, and the impact of this change ontheir learning outcomes.An initial experiment was used to measure the performance of students studying under a traditional curriculum with implicitly taught programming strategies. Thisexperiment uncovered common flaws in the strategy skills of novices and revealed weaknesses in the curriculum. Incorporation of explicit strategy instruction wasproposed.To validate a model of strategies as being authentic and appropriate for novice instruction, an experiment with experts was conducted. Experts were asked to solvethree problems that a novice would typically be expected to solve at the end of an introductory programming course. Experts&#8223; solutions were analysed using Goal/PlanAnalysis and it was discovered that experts consistently applied plans, the subalgorithmic strategies suggested by Soloway (1986). It was proposed that plans could be adapted for explicit inclusion in an introductory programming curriculum.Initially a curriculum incorporating explicit strategy instruction was tested in an artificial setting with a small number of volunteers, divided into control andexperimental groups. The control group was taught using a simplified traditional curriculum and the experimental group were exposed to a curriculum which explicitly included programming strategies. Testing revealed that experimental group participants applied plans more than control group participants, who had been expected to learn these strategies implicitly. In interviews, experimental participants used strategy-related terminology and were more confident in the solutions they had created. These results justified a trial of the curriculum in an actual introductory programming course.When explicit instruction of programming strategies was incorporated into an actual introductory programming curriculum, novices achieved superior results whencompared to results from the initial experiment. Novices used strategies significantly more when these strategies were incorporated explicitly into instructional materialsand assessment items.This series of experiments focussed on explicitly teaching specific programming strategies rather than teaching problem-solving more generally. These experimentalresults demonstrate that explicit incorporation of programming strategies may improve outcomes for novices and potentially improve the potential of expertprogrammers in future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">programmers;</field><field name="subject">novice;</field><field name="subject">inexperienced;</field><field name="subject">training;</field><field name="subject">teaching;</field><field name="subject">instruction;</field><field name="subject">programming</field><field name="subject">strategies</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004827/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ontological evaluation of the requirements
model when shifting from a traditional to a component-based paradigm in information systems re-engineering</field><field name="creator">Valverde, Raul</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: The vast majority of present legacy information systems were implemented using the traditional paradigm. The traditional paradigm consists of modeling techniques used by system analysts such as System Flow Charts and Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) to capture, during the analysis phase, the activities within a system.However, with recent developments, particularly trends towards e-Commerce applications, platform independence, reusability of pre-built components, capacity for reconfiguration and higher reliability, many organizations are realizing they will need to re-engineer their systems into new component based systems that meet thesetrends given the limitations of legacy systems to adapt to these new technical requirements.There is a high degree of interest and concern in establishing whether or not a full migration to a more portable and scalable component-based architecture will be able to represent the legacy business requirements in the underlying requirements model of the re-engineered information systems.As a result, this study poses the question: Is the resulting component-based requirements model ontological equivalent to the legacy requirements model whenshifting paradigms in the re-engineering process?After a literature review, the research study is justified given the differences in requirements modeling between component-based and traditional paradigms, whichgive an indication that the resulting component model might not represent the same business requirements represented in the legacy system requirements model.The study evaluated the requirements models generated by the component-based and traditional approaches when shifting paradigms in the re-engineering process inorder to verify that the re-engineered component-based requirements model was capable of representing the same business requirements of the legacy system. Design science and an ontological evaluation using the Bunge-Wand-Weber(BWW) model were the central research methodologies for this study.A legacy system was selected as part of the case study and re-engineered by using the component-based paradigm with the help of UML diagrams. The requirements model of the legacy system was recovered using reverse engineering and compared to the component-based requirements model using normalized reference models generated with the help of BWW transformation maps. These maps revealed that there-engineered requirements models were capable of representing the same business requirements of the legacy system. A set of rules was suggested when reengineeringlegacy into component-based information systems to ensure the same representation of legacy system&#8217;s requirements in the re-engineered requirements model.Finally, this research included directions of future research that put emphasis on the development of automated software tools for systems re-engineering that couldimplement the rules suggested in this study and the ontological methodology approach used.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information</field><field name="subject">systems;</field><field name="subject">component-based</field><field name="subject">paradigms;</field><field name="subject">re-engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004830/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The association between auditors' fees and earnings management in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ananthanarayanan, Umapathy</field><field name="description">This study provides evidence between auditors' fees and earnings management in New Zealand. The fee measures used in this study are audit fees, non-audit fees and total fees paid by a client to the audit firm. For each of the three fee measures, I derive client importance fee measures that reflect a client&#8217;s economic importance to the auditor relative to other clients of the auditor at the city office and national levels. This study employs both performance adjusted discretionary accruals and current accruals as proxies for earnings management. Using a sample of 224 firm-years comprising firms listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) in fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the results of multivariate tests indicate an adverse association between non-audit fees and earnings management. In other words, non-audit fees paid by a client relative to fees paid by other clients, at the office and national levels, appear to impair the auditor&#8217;s independence because clients generating relatively more non-audit fees report greater discretionary and current accruals. Such evidence is more pronounced for income increasing accrual proxies for earnings management. The results also show that audit fee is not related to earnings management. As the results in this study are consistent across both discretionary and current accruals, the validity of the results is strengthened. This study contributes to the literature by providing insight into how auditors&#8217; fee metrics indicating client importance affect earnings management in a legal and institutional environment of a small economy, and where the audit market is largely saturated with little room for growth. This study raises implications for relevant regulatory bodies in New Zealand pertaining to future developments of auditor independence and financial reporting regulations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Audit independence</field><field name="subject">Non-audit fees</field><field name="subject">Client importance</field><field name="subject">Discretionary and current accruals</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/460</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Institutional factors that influence access of the poor to forest benefits : case studies of community and leasehold forestry regimes in Nepal : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Rural Development, Massey University, Institute of Natural Resources, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bajracharya, Bijaya</field><field name="description">The community and leasehold forestry regimes (CF and LF regimes) are high priority programmes that are designed by the Nepalese government to conserve forests and reduce poverty through the introduction of formal institutions in terms of legal property rights and governance structures and processes. However, little is known about the mechanisms through which informal and formal institutions influence resource access of the poor under these regimes. By employing a collective case study approach, this research provides some understanding of the mechanisms through which formal and informal institutional factors influence access of the poor to forest resources governed under the CF and LF regimes in Nepal. This study found that informal institutional factors significantly influence the impact of formal institutions irrespective of the regime that was imposed on the Nepalese hill communities. It was revealed that where more than one social group co-exist in a community, discriminatory sociocultural norms (for example patriarchal and caste-based norms), and customary property rights favour one social group over others. As a result, certain social groups have greater access to resources and benefits from the resources than do other social groups. Of particular significance, and not previously reported, the lack of prior experience in collective action of the low castes along with their weak social networks and poor leadership ability is highlighted as being directly linked to their relatively limited access to forest resources. When the Bista system, a specific type of a traditional bridging social network is eroded, the low castes end up with less access due to removal of support from the high castes. This study shows that a more inclusive regime (for example CF regime) is likely to lead to more effective outcomes for the livelihood of the poor as compared to a more exclusive regime (e.g. LF regime). When the powerful are included in the forest user group (FUG), along with the poor, there is less resistance to the shift in property rights and the improved access of the poor to forest benefits that the regimes are intended to achieve. However, it was found that active participation is more determinant of resource access than is a specified set of property rights granted by right of membership in a FUG. Although some FUG governance structures provide a forum where the disadvantaged members of the FUGs have the right to participate in decision making, their participation is constrained by discriminatory sociocultural norms. Further, this study revealed that the decision-making processes dominated by the elites tend to address the needs of the disadvantaged members to only a very limited extent. However, improving capacities has the potential to enhance participation of disadvantaged members in the processes. The research findings suggest that informal institutions must explicitly be considered in the design and implementation of CBNRM regimes in order for them to be successful in improving livelihoods of the poor. The implementing staff need support mechanisms for changing their own attitudes and behaviours to those that are more favourable to the social shift that the regimes are intended to bring about. CBNRM regimes have the potential to improve the livelihoods of the poor, but research must continue on how this can be achieved.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">forestry</field><field name="subject">Nepal</field><field name="subject">rural development</field><field name="subject">access</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340202 Environment and resource economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pattern formation in a neural field model : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Elvin, Amanda Jane</field><field name="description">In this thesis I study the effects of gap junctions on pattern formation in a neural field model for working memory. I review known results for the base model (the &#8220;Amari model&#8221;), then see how the results change for the &#8220;gap junction model&#8221;. I find steady states of both models analytically and numerically, using lateral inhibition with a step firing rate function, and a decaying oscillatory coupling function with a smooth firing rate function. Steady states are homoclinic orbits to the fixed point at the origin. I also use a method of piecewise construction of solutions by deriving an ordinary differential equation from the partial integro-differential formulation of the model. Solutions are found numerically using AUTO and my own continuation code in MATLAB. Given an appropriate level of threshold, as the firing rate function steepens, the solution curve becomes discontinuous and stable homoclinic orbits no longer exist in a region of parameter space. These results have not been described previously in the literature. Taking a phase space approach, the Amari model is written as a four-dimensional, reversible Hamiltonian system. I develop a numerical technique for finding both symmetric and asymmetric homoclinic orbits. I discover a small separate solution curve that causes the main curve to break as the firing rate function steepens and show there is a global bifurcation. The small curve and the global bifurcation have not been reported previously in the literature. Through the use of travelling fronts and construction of an Evans function, I show the existence of stable heteroclinic orbits. I also find asymmetric steady state solutions using other numerical techniques. Various methods of determining the stability of solutions are presented, including a method of eigenvalue analysis that I develop. I then find both stable and transient Turing structures in one and two spatial dimensions, as well as a Type-I intermittency. To my knowledge, this is the first time transient Turing structures have been found in a neural field model. In the Appendix, I outline numerical integration schemes, the pseudo-arclength continuation method, and introduce the software package AUTO used throughout the thesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neural fields</field><field name="subject">dynamical systems</field><field name="subject">computational neuroscience</field><field name="subject">neural networks</field><field name="subject">pattern formation</field><field name="subject">gap junctions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics::230113 Dynamical systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attachment and conflict in close relationships : the association of attachment with conflict resolution styles, conflict beliefs, communication accuracy and relationship satisfaction : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">du Plessis, Karin</field><field name="description">The present research aims to obtain a more complete view of couple relationships. In particular, it investigated the manner in which attachment styles (and more specifically the combination of attachment styles to one&#8217;s partner and one&#8217;s primary caregiver, such as the mother) are related to conflict beliefs, conflict resolution styles, relationship satisfaction and communication accuracy. Two studies were conducted to explore these relationships. In Study 1 individuals in couples relationships (N = 83) were asked to participate in an online questionnaire regarding primary caregiver and partner attachment, conflict resolution, and conflict beliefs. Study 2 saw the recruitment of twenty-two couples from public advertisements. Couples were asked to participate in a ten minute videotaped discussion around a major disagreement. The discussion exercise and accompanying self-report questionnaires indicated each couple&#8217;s communication accuracy. Trained post-graduate raters also coded the observable conflict styles of the couples on a scale developed for the purpose of this research. These were compared with self-reported conflict resolution styles. Couples were also asked to complete questionnaires individually to identify their parent and partner attachment styles, relationship satisfaction, conflict resolution styles and conflict beliefs. Qualitative questions around attachment and conflict resolution provided a more in-depth perspective of more and less securely attached individuals&#8217; relationships. Results from both studies indicated that there is some difference between ongoing influence from current models of primary caregiver attachment and the influence from current models of partner attachment on relationship variables. Relationship satisfaction and conflict beliefs were influenced by specific attachment to the partner. Conversely, conflict resolution styles, in particular positive problem solving, withdrawal and compliance, were heavily influenced by more general current conceptualizations of primary caregiver attachment. Additional results regarding quantitative and qualitative findings, including gender differences are discussed in the thesis. Finally, limitations regarding both studies are noted, and suggestions for future research are made.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interpersonal conflict</field><field name="subject">interpersonal communication</field><field name="subject">attachment</field><field name="subject">interpersonal relations</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380105 Social and community psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Double-dipping : crafting nostalgic resonance : an exegesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Packer, Genevieve</field><field name="description">This project contemplates where New Zealanders will turn to in the future for resonating, identity-based design, and explores two potential scenarios.

The resulting body of work, and its successful public dissemination, proves that it is possible to craft nostalgic resonance through conceptual recycling, and that this approach could be extended to both a wider range of original artefacts and experiences, and a wider range of souvenir products in the future.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fashion</field><field name="subject">nostalgia</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">resonance</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autonomy in Modern Japanese Literature</field><field name="creator">Takayashiki, Masahito</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">autonomy, language and body, Nakagami Kenji, freedom and responsibility</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Client needs and satisfaction in an HIV facility</field><field name="creator">Chow, Maria Yui Kwan</field><field name="description">Master of Philosophy (Medicine)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS</field><field name="subject">Satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Unmet needs</field><field name="subject">Healthcare service</field><field name="subject">Mixed methods</field><field name="subject">Quantitative survey</field><field name="subject">Qualitative interviews</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of amylose in structure-function relationship in starches from Australian wheat varieties.</field><field name="creator">Blazek, Jaroslav</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wheat, starch, triticum aestivum, amylose, lipid</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4023</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards consumer-centred health care and health research in nephrology: understanding patient and family caregiver experiences and perspectives in chronic kidney disease</field><field name="creator">Tong, Allison</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumer involvment</field><field name="subject">kidney disease</field><field name="subject">qualitative research</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What colours them green? An enquiry into the drivers of corporate environmentalism in business organizations in developing and developed countries</field><field name="creator">Sandhu, Sukhbir Kaur</field><field name="description">Drawing on perspectives from stakeholder, resource dependence, institutional and the resource based theories and using a multiple-case inductive study, this research reframes the drivers of corporate environmentalism in the context of developing and developed countries. Based on case analysis of 23 environmentally responsive organizations in India and New Zealand, corporate environmentalism in this research has been operationalized as a two level construct. Organizations were categorized as being at first order responsiveness when they were observed to recognize the importance of the natural environment and exhibited attempts to decrease their impact on the natural environment through the adoption of programmes aimed at pollution reduction and prevention, decreased resource consumption and recycling of wastes. Organizations at second order responsiveness were observed to exhibit a higher order commitment in integrating environmental issues into their strategic decision making. This involved strategies such as green product development and initiating projects aimed at industrial ecology.  Detailed within and cross case analysis revealed fundamental differences in the drivers that propel business organizations in developing and developed countries to be environmentally responsive at each level. The findings of this study reveal that lax enforcement of environmental regulations in developing countries implied that domestic regulations were not a driving factor for corporate environmentalism. Neither was pressure from consumers or communities reported to be a driving factor. Instead first order environmental responsiveness in organizations in developing countries was observed to be driven by pressure arising out of internationalization. Thus pressure from multinational organizational customers in developed countries and the institutional pressures imposed by the liability of foreignness (that arises when these firms set up subsidiaries in developed countries) drives first order responsiveness in the organizations in developing countries. However higher order environmental responsiveness in organizations in developing countries was observed to be associated with deep rooted identities and capabilities based in social responsiveness. In the context of business organizations in developed countries, the necessity to comply with stringently enforced domestic environmental regulations emerged as the primary driver for first order responsiveness. Societal expectations to comply with environmental regulations reinforce the regulatory drivers. Internationalization drives first order responsiveness in organizations in developed countries to the extent that the requirements of the host country are additional to and exceed current regulatory requirements in the parent country. Higher order corporate environmentalism in organizations in developed countries was observed to be associated with environmentally high impact organizations. Such organizations are considered environmental liabilities and are forced by stakeholders (with access to resource needed for continuity of operations) to exhibit higher order responsiveness or face a cancellation of the license to operate. The major contribution of this research lies in extending and reframing the existing theory about the drivers of corporate environmentalism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">developing countries</field><field name="subject">developed countries</field><field name="subject">corporate environmentalism</field><field name="subject">green</field><field name="subject">India</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">green business</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental influences on the sustainable production of the Sydney rock oyster Saccostrea glomerata : a study in two southeastern Australian estuaries</field><field name="creator">Rubio Zuazo, Ana Maria</field><field name="description">There has been a continuous decline in both the production and general performance of the
SRO in NSW estuaries over the past three decades. The relationship of this decline to both
environmental and oyster-density related factors are assessed in this thesis. This question has
been examined at different scales: a large scale that compares two different estuaries (Clyde and
Shoalhaven Rivers, southern NSW); a regional scale that encompasses variations within an
estuary and, at a lease scale that examines processes pertaining to individual or small groups of
oysters. Levels of inorganic nutrients were in general very low potentially limiting primary
production. The limiting nutrient was nitrogen or phosphorus depending on whether long term
conditions were dry or wet, respectively. Only during rain events, through the input of terrestrial
material, were conditions favourable for fast rates of primary production. Carbon and nitrogen
isotope analysis has demonstrated that both external material and local resuspension of the
benthos constitute a major proportion of the SRO diet. The uptake of the various food sources
also varied considerably depending on local environmental conditions. Increases in SRO growth
were strongly correlated to increases in temperature with a low temperature cut-off at ~13&#176;C.
Growth also appeared to reduce considerably when salinities lower than ~15ppt persisted for the
order of a month. These factors may alter growth through changes in filtration rates. These
processes were modelled in a coupled hydrodynamic-NPO (Nitrogen-Phytoplankton-Oyster)
model of the Clyde River. This demonstrated that primary production was more affected by
estuarine dynamics and nutrient concentrations than oyster uptake. At the current levels of
oyster densities, primary production by itself could not account for the observed oyster growth,
however growth became realistic with observed levels of POC added to the model. A set of
environmental indices were used to complement the model and to assess the sustainability of the
culture system. The combined indices indicated that while the ecological carrying capacity of
the Clyde was exceeded the production capacity at an estuarine scale was not. On the lease
scale, density experiments showed that while growth was not reduced as a result of current
stocking densities, the condition index was significantly affected.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">carrying capacity</field><field name="subject">Sydney rock oyster</field><field name="subject">estuarine processes</field><field name="subject">environmental indices</field><field name="subject">stocking density</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080618.091057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fisheries biology and management of pink snapper, Pagrus auratus, in the inner gulfs of Shark Bay, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">gjackson@fish.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">This study explored an important aspect of the basis for the highly complex population structure of pink snapper (Pagrus auratus) within the inner gulfs of Shark Bay, investigated how growth and reproduction differ among these closely-adjacent but separate stocks, and obtained biomass estimates for each stock that are essential for the sustainable management of the regionally-important recreational pink snapper fishery.  Using ichthyoplankton data in combination with hydrodynamic modelling, P. auratus eggs and larvae were shown to be retained within localized meso-scale eddies that were coincident with the main inner gulf spawning areas.  Such hydrodynamic retention, in conjunction with tagging and otolith chemistry data that indicates very limited movement of juvenile and adult fish, explains how separate pink snapper populations can exist in the adjacent waters of the Eastern Gulf, Denham Sound and Freycinet Estuary.  The study found significant variation in maximum age, growth, maturity and spawning time at fine spatial scales.  Such variation, unusual for a large, potentially mobile fish inhabiting a marine environment with no obvious physical barriers, is linked to the inner gulfs&#146; marked environmental heterogeneity, the low levels of mixing and historic differences in fishing pressure among the three areas.  The daily egg production method (DEPM) was used, for the first time with this species in Western Australia, to provide estimates of spawning biomass of the three separate inner gulf P. auratus stocks.  While relatively imprecise, mostly due to imprecision in estimation of daily egg production, these estimates demonstrated that these stocks are very small (measured in tens of tonnes) compared with P. auratus stocks elsewhere in Australia and New Zealand.  Biological data and DEPM estimates obtained from this study were incorporated in age-based stock assessment models that have been used to determine the status of inner gulf pink snapper stocks since 2002.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081222.105104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Trade Practices Act (Cth) 1974 and its Impact on Maritime Law in Australia.</field><field name="creator">k.lewins@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The trade of shipping is necessarily international in nature. Courts and international bodies often
express the need to ensure international consistency in matters of maritime law. However, it has
been an extremely difficult goal to achieve. Many countries have refused to be party to international
conventions that seek to ensure comity. Some have enacted laws that reflect part but not all of those
conventions, or seek to improve the protection offered by the conventions. The domestic law of each
country also adds its own flavour to shipping law as recognised and applied by the courts in that
jurisdiction.

In 1974 Australia enacted the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (TPA), heralding a new era in
corporate and commercial law. However, its impact on maritime law on Australia has only been felt
over the last 10 &#150; 15 years. It is potentially relevant to many areas of maritime law, including
carriage of goods by sea, cruise ships, and towage. This thesis explores the encroachment of the
TPA on a number of different areas of shipping law, using the few case examples on offer and
extrapolating the impact that the TPA may have. It also considers the extent to which the TPA is
stymied by simple contractual agreements to litigate or arbitrate in a non Australian forum, despite
the TPA&#146;s status as a mandatory statute within Australia.

Raised at various points in the thesis is the possibility of law reform, which is a complex compendium
of issues overlaid with a moral dimension &#150; does shipping, as an industry, deserve to be exempted
from the operation of the Act which sets a high standard of corporate behaviour? If so, how could
that reform be shaped? In the meantime, what steps can the shipping industry take to work within
the legal framework of the TPA?</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">shipping law</field><field name="subject">Australian maritime law</field><field name="subject">trade practices act</field><field name="subject">mandatory law of forum</field><field name="subject">conflict of laws</field><field name="subject">carriage</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081223.135713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living on the Edge: transport sustainability in Perth&#146;s Liveable Neighbourhoods</field><field name="creator">ryno.sar@bigpond.com</field><field name="description">Following World War Two, land use and transport policy and practice in most major Australian cities was modelled on the US experience. As such, these cities have become characterised by urban sprawl (indicated by segregated zoning and low development densities) and car dependence. In Perth, Western Australia, these characteristics are particularly evident despite, or perhaps because, the city has a strong regional planning system unlike most American cities.

Car dependence and sprawl are in turn linked to dependence on fossil fuels for transport energy. Increasingly, too, links are being found between conventional planning outcomes and public health. For example, research has linked car dependence with a variety of health conditions including respiratory illness, overweight and obesity. Moreover, research is increasingly linking sprawl and car dependence with social justice issues because people on limited income and with decreased mobility struggle to undertake their life&#146;s work.

In response to these concerns the Western Australian planning system introduced Liveable Neighbourhoods, a new design code, which was meant to reduce car dependence and sprawl. This code has its roots in New Urbanism and appears to have been taken up more rapidly in Perth than elsewhere. No large-scale evaluation of New Urbanism has previously been conducted anywhere. This thesis reports on an extensive literature review, travel survey (n=211), perceptual study (n=992) and environmental study, which together sought to evaluate whether the Liveable Neighbourhoods (LN) design code is contributing to a sustainable transport agenda. In total, 46 neighbourhoods (11 LNs and 35 CNs) were compared. The research found that despite residents of Liveable Neighbourhoods driving less and walking more than residents of conventional neighbourhoods (CNs) (a switch of 9% with some associated health advantages), there was little else to indicate that LN is achieving its goals as transport VKT and fuel use was identical due to regional transport requirements diminishing any local walkability advantages.

There was strong supportive evidence that LNs were not significantly different to CNs. For example, there were few differences in perception of opportunity for more sustainable travel and residents of CNs actually had better access, on average, to key destinations, including shops (i.e. the average distance to key destinations was 2.2 kilometres compared with 2.5 kilometres in LNs). Also, residential lot densities were well below what were intended by LN and in both LNs and CNs the time for public transport to get people to work was over 90 minutes compared with around 30 minutes by car.

The results reveal that there must be significant revisions to the LN code and how it is applied, because there is no evidence that new neighbourhoods are improving regional transport sustainability. In particular, residential densities and land use mix appear to be too low to encourage community self-sufficiency, indicated by few neighbourhoods being anchored by key destinations. These matters are not mandated in the LN guidelines making them powerless to bring significant change. More generally, the thesis questions the extent to which New Urbanism can promote a sustainable transport agenda wherever it is applied unless it mandates real changes in land use and transit not just local walkability.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">car dependence</field><field name="subject">sprawl</field><field name="subject">liveable neighbourhoods</field><field name="subject">Perth</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090121.154046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fighting for the Forests: A History of The Western Australian Forest Protest Movement 1895-2001</field><field name="creator">ronaldchapman1@bigpond.com</field><field name="description">As the first comprehensive study of Western Australian forest protest the thesis analyses the protest movement's organisation, campaigns and strategies. Its central argument is that the contemporary Western Australian forest protest movement established a network of urban and south-west activist groups which encouraged broad public support, and that a diversity of protest strategies focused public attention on forest issues and pressured the state government to change its forest policies.   The forest protest movement was characterised by its ability to continually adapt its organisation and strategies to changing social and political conditions.  This flexible approach to protest not only led to victories in the Shannon River Basin, Lane-Poole Reserve and old growth forest campaigns, but also transformed forest protest into an influential social movement which contributed to the downfall of the Court Liberal Government in 2001.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">activism</field><field name="subject">forest mining</field><field name="subject">wood chipping</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090121.162055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Wigan Pier to Airstrip One: A Critical Evaluation of George Orwell&#146;s Writing and Politics post-September 11</field><field name="creator">dlurry@gmail.com</field><field name="description">This thesis summons a contemporary reading of George Orwell, evaluating his current role and function as novelist, essayist, and twentieth century cultural icon. The year 2003 marked the centenary of Eric Blair&#146;s birth and proved a productive year for Blair (and Orwell) enthusiasts. After nearly three years of research, my journey through Orwell&#146;s words and world(s) has undergone significant re-evaluation, taking me far beyond such an appropriate commemoration. In the tragic aftermath of 9/11 &#175; through Afghanistan and Iraq, Bali, Madrid, and London &#175; Orwell&#146;s grimly dystopian vision acquires renewed significance for a new generation. Few writers (living or dead) are as enduringly newsworthy and malleable as George Orwell. The scope and diversity of his work &#175; the sheer volume of his letters, essays, and assorted journalism &#175; elicits a response from academics, journalists, critics and readers. My research, tempered by a &#145;War&#146; on terror and a televisual Big Brother, shapes these responses at a time when 24-hour surveillance is viewed as the path to instant celebrity.

Orwell&#146;s Nineteen Eighty-Four provides unique insights into a highly pervasive and secretive regime, which in light of post 9/11 political trajectories is highly admonitory. These pathways and connections are produced in my research. I do not make easy links between past and present &#175; Eric and Tony Blair &#175; at the level of metaphor or simile. Indeed, the pages that follow traverse the digital archives and probe the rationale for mobilising Orwell in this time and place. I am focussed on writing a history and establishing a context calibrated to the fictional Oceania.  

This doctorate commenced as an investigation of George Orwell&#146;s journalism and fiction one hundred years after his birth. At the outset of the candidature, the Twin Towers fell and new implications and interpretations of Orwell arose. My research demonstrates that the Oceania of Orwell&#146;s imagining presents an evocative insight into the contemporary alliance forged by the Bush, Blair, and Howard triumvirate in its quest for world peace. Using Orwell as a guide, I move through theories of writing and politics, in the process uncovering capitalism&#146;s inherently hostile and negligent attitude towards those who are materially less fortunate. I began my work convinced of Orwell&#146;s relevance to cultural studies, particularly in understanding popular cultural writing and the need for social intervention. I concluded this process even more persuaded of my original intent, but shaped, sharpened and compensated by new events, insights, tragedies and Big Brothers.

It is imperative for the future directives of cultural studies that critical, political, pedagogic and intellectual links with Orwell are (re-)formed, (re-)established and maintained. My text works in the spaces between cultural studies and cultural journalism, pondering the role and significance of the critical &#175; and dissenting &#175; intellectual. Memory, History, and Identity all circulate in Orwell&#146;s prose. These concerns and questions have provided impetus and direction for this thesis. They have also shaped the research.

Few expect Orwell&#146;s totalitarian dystopia to materialise unchallenged from the pages of a book. The wielders of power are more capable and more subtle. Yet it is impossible to deny that the litany of lies and contempt central to Big Brother&#146;s Oceania is reproducible by any administration assisted by a complicit media and a malleable citizenry. The emergence of such a phenomenon has been well documented in the post 9/11 United States. This thesis has arisen out of the miasma of hubris, lies and contempt framing and surrounding Mr. Bush&#146;s war on terror. My purpose &#175; not unlike Orwell&#146;s in Nineteen Eighty-Four &#175; is to warn, not judge or berate. Orwell understood political rhetoric. He was not a prophet but a journalist who interpreted the nuances and temptations of excessive power. He had witnessed the extraordinary &#145;death&#146; of history in Spain, and thereafter he raised his pen to combat intellectual hypocrisy and dishonesty wherever he found it. Under Orwell&#146;s tutelage, plain words pierce, probe and unsettle. They are sharp cutting instruments, fully capable of transcending time. How else are we to explain his enduring popularity as a writer? This thesis offers a critical and interpretative homage to George Orwell, a man who recognised the beauty of well chosen words, who loved and appreciated their enduring complexity and power.

A framing structure has been chosen that places Orwell in close relation to poverty, class and politics, war and journalism. Individual chapter headings (and their contents) exploit Orwell&#146;s unique response to the significant talking points of his era. After resolving to write professionally, Orwell starved and struggled in Paris, and frequented &#145;doss houses&#146; in and around London. I track these wanderings in chapter one. He studied the effects of the Depression and unemployment in Yorkshire and Lancashire (chapter two), and fought and was wounded in Spain (chapter three). Thereafter he turned to political writing and journalism (chapter four). What he failed to anticipate was a post war Britain overwhelmed by despondency and dissolved by internal devolution (chapter five). His concluding apocalyptic discharge, the dystopian Nineteen Eighty-Four, was directed at the higher echelons of institutional power and corporate corruption in Britain, America, and Europe, which I explore in chapter six.

The world has changed significantly since Orwell (and J. B. Priestley) went in search of England&#146;s faltering &#145;pulse&#146; in the 1930s. Englishness and traditional working class values have distorted and shifted in unexpected ways. These transformations are partly the result of war and the loss of empire. They are also a response to American cultural and economic hegemony, the privatisation of industry, offshore investments, the emergence of the European Economic Community, and the burgeoning global economy. 
George Orwell matters, even after this scale of change because he faced his own prejudices on the page and developed a writing style that enabled him to challenge the accepted orthodoxies and hypocrisies of his era. This is evident when returning to his essays and journalism, fifty-five years after his death. He possessed the ability to make readers feel uncomfortable, raising topics and concerns that we would rather not discuss. Denounced as a traitor by the pre-1956 unreconstructed left and feted as a hero by the self-congratulatory right, Orwell resists labelling and easy categorization. We owe him a considerable debt for exposing the likely directions of unchecked political ambition, and this insight should not be treated lightly. As I read him, Orwell was the last man in Europe, &#145;the canary in the mine.&#146; He is a literary world heritage site of considerable iconic appeal and international significance. He is an outsider&#146;s &#145;outsider&#146; perpetually facing inwards, and we need him now.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">surveillance</field><field name="subject">objectivity</field><field name="subject">truth</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090122.114436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kampung / landscape : rural-urban migrants&#8217; interpretations of their home landscape. The case of Alor Star and Kuala Lumpur</field><field name="creator">Maliki, Nor Zarifah</field><field name="description">Kampung is a pervasive concept in Malay Culture and considered counter urban in contemporary discourse. Rural to urban migration of the Malays from kampung to cities occur at an accelerated pace in urbanizing Malaysia. Rural migrants are said to remain attached to their rural kampung lifestyles and find the socio-spatial character of urban environment difficult to adapt to. Previous studies on rural kampung by anthropologists and social scientists have unpacked the socio-economic and cultural aspects of kampung Malays in rural area.  My study of migrants in Alor Star and Kuala Lumpur is focused on the landscape meanings of kampung and explores how these ideas have been brought across to a city environment. I investigated the meanings and symbolic values that kampung holds to the rural-urban migrants through a &#8216;landscape lens&#8217;. I recorded the experiences of the rural-urban migrants in adapting to an urban landscape, identified kampung elements to which people have strong attachment with and highlighted the kampung characteristics that could be maintained or replicated in order to address the maladaptation of the migrants and enhance their urban living experience.  Study participants were rural-urban migrant respondents from rural kampung in Yan, Kedah who have either moved to Kuala Lumpur or Alor Star. The case studies in the two cities were carried out using qualitative methods including photo elicitation, in-depth interviews, model mapping techniques and participant observation. Respondents provided narratives of their journey from kampung, moving to the city, and their process of adapting and settling in cities. Challenges in adaptation to city living spaces included spatial use, privacy, social relationships, safety and surveillance. My findings demonstrated that the memory of kampung plays a significant part in guiding the life of respondents in the city, and that the image of kampung is pervasive in the daily social and spatial practice of rural-urban migrants, guiding respondents&#8217; level of adaptation and place-making in the city landscape. The use of landscape as lens was helpful in interpreting the complex and multivalent kampung meanings.  Addressing a dynamic kampung idea through a landscape framework highlights the strong parallels between kampung and the early landscape concepts. The process of unweaving the meanings of kampung have illustrated that kampung ideas have the potential to inspire a landscape design language that could mitigate the harsh contrast between rural and urban Malaysia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kampung</field><field name="subject">landscape architecture</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">landschaft</field><field name="subject">social landscape</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building::310100 Architecture and Urban Environment::310104 Landscape planning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building::319900 Other Architecture and Urban Environment and Building::319999 Other architecture, urban environment and building</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/791</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proteomics of the ovine cataract</field><field name="creator">Muir, Matthew Stewart</field><field name="description">The lens of the eye needs to be completely transparent in order to allow all light entering the eye to reach the retina. This transparency is maintained by the highly ordered structure of the lens proteins the crystallins. Any disruption to the lens proteins can cause an opacity to develop which is known as cataract. During cortical cataract formation there is increased truncation of the lens crystallins. It is believed that overactivation of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases, the calpains, is responsible for the increased proteolysis of the crystallins seen during cataractogenesis. Within the ovine lens there are three calpains, calpain 1, 2 and the lens specific calpain Lp82. The aim of this thesis was to determine the changes in the lens proteins during ageing and cataractogenesis, and to establish the role of the calpains in these processes.  Calpain 1 and 2 were purified from ovine lung and Lp82 was purified from lamb lenses using chromatography. Activity and presence of the calpains was determined by using the BODIPY-FL casein assay, gel electrophoresis, Western blot and casein zymography. Changes in the lens proteins, specifically the crystallins, were visualised using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). Lenses from fetal, 6 month old and 8 year old sheep were collected, as well as stage 0, 1, 3 and 6 cataractous ovine lenses. The proteins from the lenses were separated into the water soluble and urea soluble fractions and analysed by 2DE. Mass spectrometry was used to determine the masses and therefore modifications of the crystallins. Finally, the individual crystallins were separated using gel filtration chromatography and incubated with the purified calpains in the presence of calcium. The extent of the proteolysis was visualised using 2DE and truncation sites determined by mass spectrometry.  Purification of the calpains resulted in samples that were specific for each calpain and could be used in further experiments. 2DE analysis showed that there were changes to the crystallins during maturation of the lens. The &#945;-crystallins become increasingly phosphorylated as the lens ages and a small amount becomes truncated. The &#946;-crystallins were also modified during ageing by truncation and deamidation. When crystallins from cataractous lenses were compared using 2DE there were changes to both the &#945;- and &#946;-crystallins. The &#945;-crystallins were found to be extensively truncated at their C-terminal tail. Four of the seven &#946;-crystallins, &#946;B1, &#946;B3, &#946;B2 and &#946;A3, showed increased truncation of their N-terminal extensions during cataract formation. All three calpains truncated &#945;A and &#945;B-crystallin at their C-terminal ends after incubation. Calpain 2 and Lp82 each produced unique &#945;A-crystallin truncations. All three calpains truncated &#946;B1 and &#946;A3 and calpain 2 also truncated &#946;B3. When the truncations from the calpain incubations were compared to those seen during cataract formation, many of the truncations were found to be similar. Both the unique truncations from calpain 2 and Lp82 were found in cataractous lenses, with the Lp82 more obvious in the 2DE. The &#946;-crystallin truncations found after incubation with the calpains were similar to those found during cataractogenesis.  In conclusion this study documents the changes to the ovine lens during maturation and cataractogenesis and indicates a role for the calpain family in the increased proteolysis observed in the ovine cataract.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cataract</field><field name="subject">calpain 1</field><field name="subject">calpain 2</field><field name="subject">Lp82</field><field name="subject">&#945;-crystallin</field><field name="subject">&#946;-crystallin</field><field name="subject">lens</field><field name="subject">ageing</field><field name="subject">2DE</field><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">Fast protein liquid chromatography</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology::270108 Enzymes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology::270199 Biochemistry and cell biology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/792</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactive electroacoustics</field><field name="creator">Drummond, Jon R.</field><field name="description">Creating and performing electroacoustic music utilising interactive systems is now a well-established paradigm. Sensing technology can map gestures to sound generating processes, capturing the nuances of a gesture and sculpting the sound accordingly. Interactive installations enable audiences to become part of the process of realising a creative work. Yet many of the models and frameworks for interactive systems, specifically music focused systems, are strongly oriented around a MIDI event based framework, with little or no provision to accommodate the potentials of more dynamic approaches to creative practice. This research seeks to address the lack of appropriate models currently available and come to a more contemporary understanding of interactive music making. My approach follows two trajectories. Firstly, I undertake a comprehensive review of interactive creative works, encompassing the live electronic music of the 1950s and 1960s, interactive installation, digital musical instruments and computer networked ensembles. Secondly, I explore and draw together proposed definitions, models and classifications of interactive systems, clarifying concepts such as mapping, processing, gesture and response. The concepts are tested in a folio of creative works that form the creative research.

There are barriers to assessment and diagnosis, and limited access to specialist clinicians who might assist in these complex assessments and who could provide options for treatment.
The three studies presented, using different research methodologies, and using both qualitative and quantitative analysis, seek to clarify these issues and to provide some solutions. A questionnaire was sent to all Palliative Care Services (PCS) in Australia. Questions included what part specialist psychological clinicians played in multi-disciplinary team meetings and in the treatment or coordination of patient care. Very few PCS used a valid screening instrument for psychological distress and very few had regular support from a psychiatrist or psychologist. Many did not have access to social work support.
There are two competing issues with regard to recognising and assessing depression in palliative populations. A rapid reliable screen that points to a likely problem would be useful, but also there is a need to understand something of the patient experience of depression.
In the second study, the one- and two-item screening instruments widely used in palliative care are examined and limitations that have been found in other settings are confirmed. A new novel screening tool is developed from this data and tested empirically. This algorithm is short, has good psychometric properties and is validated for an Australian palliative care population. Depending on the response pattern it is possible to identify that a particular patient has significant symptoms of depression by asking between one and four questions. Professional carer and patient acceptability of the questions is high.
The understanding of the experience and symptom profile of depression in Australian palliative care patients is addressed in the third study. Patients and family carers were recruited prospectively from palliative care and oncology ambulatory clinics of two teaching hospitals in an Australian capital city. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was administered to the patient and the Collateral Source version of this instrument was asked of the carer. A subset of this sample completed the measures twice. The results using this 30-item scale were then compared with all the known previously published short versions of this scale. Two short forms met as many psychometric criteria as the longer forms. None of the versions of the GDS showed sufficiently high correlations between carer-completed and patient-completed forms. The frequency of symptoms was also assessed. Patients more frequently reported fatigue and anhedonia than depressed affect.
Despite many screening instruments being available for depression, their use is limited in Palliative Care Services. Although these studies have validated several options for Australian palliative care patients, the issues behind the low uptake rates for screening have not been resolved. The final chapter of this thesis constructs known and potential barriers into a logical structure and then offers some solutions to improve access to mental health professionals by considering service models and applying this theory to the problem of depression and its assessment in palliative care populations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">palliative care</field><field name="subject">identification</field><field name="subject">screening instruments</field><field name="subject">Geriatric Depression Scale</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090127.133003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lentivirus-mediated gene expression in corneal endothelium</field><field name="creator">Parker, Douglas George Anthony</field><field name="description">Modulation of corneal transplant rejection using gene therapy shows promise in experimental models but the most appropriate vector for gene transfer is yet to be determined. The overarching aim of the thesis was to evaluate the potential of a lentiviral vector for use in human corneal transplantation. Specific aims were: (i) to assess the ability of an HIV-1-based lentiviral vector to mediate expression of the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP), and a model secreted protein interleukin-10 (IL10), in ovine and human corneal endothelium; and (ii) to examine the influence of lentivirus-mediated IL10 expression on the survival of ovine corneal allografts.
  Four lentiviral vectors expressing eYFP under the control of different promoters, were tested: the simian virus type-40 (SV40) early promoter, the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter, the elongation factor-1alpha (EF) promoter, and the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Two lentiviral vectors expressing IL10 were tested: one containing the SV40 promoter and another containing a steroid-inducible promoter (GRE5). Lentivirus-mediated expression in transduced ovine and human corneal endothelium was assessed by fluorescence microscopy, real-time quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA, following alterations of transduction period duration (2&#150;24 hr) and vector dose, as well as in the presence or absence of polybrene or dexamethasone (GRE5 vector). It was also compared to expression mediated by adenoviral vectors. Orthotopic transplantation of ex vivo transduced donor corneas was performed in outbred sheep. Allografts were reviewed daily for vascularisation and signs of immunological rejection.
  Lentivirus-mediated eYFP expression was delayed in ovine corneal endothelium compared to human. However, in both species the final transduction rate was greater than 80% and expression was stable for at least 14 d in vitro. Lentivirus-mediated expression in ovine and human corneal endothelium was higher with the viral promoters in comparison to the mammalian promoters. A 24 h transduction of ovine corneal endothelium with the lentiviral vector encoding IL10 resulted in expression levels which were increasing after 15 d of organ culture but logarithmically lower than those achieved by adenovirus. Shortening the lentiviral transduction period to 2 h led to a reduction in expression, but the addition of polybrene (40 micrograms / ml) to the transduction mixture restored expression to levels comparable to those attained after a 24 h transduction period. Lentivirus-mediated IL10 expression was higher and more rapid in human corneal endothelium compared to ovine corneas. Dexamethasone-responsive transgene expression was observed in both ovine and human corneal endothelium using the lentiviral vector containing the GRE5 promoter. Lentivirus-mediated expression in ovine corneal endothelium was stable for 28 d in vivo. A modest prolongation of ovine corneal allograft survival (median of 7 d) was achieved by transduction of donor corneas for 2&#150;3 h with the lentivirus expressing IL10. Attempts to increase the expression of IL10 by the addition of polybrene (40 micrograms / ml) to the transduction mixture, resulted in a toxic effect on corneal allografts which abrogated the beneficial effect of IL10.
  The lentiviral vector shows potential for the stable expression of therapeutic transgenes in human corneal transplantation. However, the mechanisms underlying the species-specific differences in HIV-1-mediated transgene expression will need to be elucidated and overcome if the ovine preclinical model is to provide justification for a clinical trial.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corneal transplantation</field><field name="subject">corneal endothelium</field><field name="subject">lentiviral vector</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20081204.094431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Landscape Pattern, Countryside Heterogeneity and Bird Conservation in Agricultural Environments</field><field name="creator">Haslem, Angie</field><field name="description">Agricultural environments are critical to the conservation of biota throughout the world. This is due both to the limited extent of current reserve systems and the large, and still expanding, proportion of terrestrial environments already dominated by agricultural land-uses. Consequently, there is a growing call from scientists around the world for the need to maximise the conservation value of agricultural environments. Efforts to identify key influences on the conservation status of fauna in agricultural landscapes have taken complementary approaches. Many studies have focussed on the role of remnant or semi-natural vegetation, and emphasised the influence on biota of spatial patterns in the landscape. Others have recognised that many species use diverse &#145;countryside&#146; elements (matrix habitats) within farmland, and emphasise the benefits of landscape heterogeneity for conservation. Here, these research themes have been combined. This study takes a whole-of-landscape approach to investigating how landscape pattern and countryside heterogeneity influence the occurrence of birds in agricultural environments. Birds were sampled in 27 agricultural mosaics, each 1 km x 1 km in size (100 ha), in Gippsland, south-eastern Australia. Mosaics were selected to incorporate variation in two landscape properties: the cover of native vegetation, and richness of different types of element (i.e. land-uses/vegetation types). In each mosaic, 15 fixed sampling locations were stratified among seven different elements in proportion to their cover in the mosaic: native vegetation, linear vegetation, tree plantation, scattered paddock trees, pasture, wetlands and farm dams. Six point counts of birds were undertaken at all sample points in each mosaic: three each in the breeding and non-breeding months of a one-year period (October 2004 &#150; August 2005). Independent measures of the composition, configuration, and heterogeneity of elements in the mosaic had differing effects on the richness of bird species recorded in these same mosaics. Sub-groups of birds based on habitat requirements responded most strongly to the extent of preferred element types in mosaics. Woodland birds (those of greatest conservation concern in farmland environments in Australia) were richer in mosaics with higher cover of native vegetation while open-tolerant species responded to the extent of scattered trees. In contrast, for total species richness, mosaic heterogeneity (richness of element types) and landscape context (cover of native vegetation in surrounding area) had the greatest influence. Mosaic structural properties also influenced the composition of entire bird assemblages in study mosaics. Avifaunal composition showed systematic variation along two main gradients which were readily interpreted in relation to landscape properties: 1) a gradient in the cover of wooded vegetation and, 2) the proportional composition of vegetation types in the mosaic. These gradients represent common trajectories of landscape modification associated with agricultural development: namely, the removal of wooded vegetation and the replacement of native species with exotic vegetation (e.g. crops and plantations). Species possessing different characteristics in relation to three avian life-history traits (nest type, feeding guild and clutch size) varied significantly in their position along these gradients of landscape modification. Species with different nesting requirements showed a strong relationship with the gradient in wooded vegetation cover while species belonging to different feeding guilds were influenced by the gradient defined by the replacement of native vegetation with exotic species. More bird species were recorded in native vegetation than in any other type of element sampled in this study. Nevertheless, most countryside elements had value for many species; particularly structurally complex elements such as scattered trees and tree plantation. Further, each type of landscape element contained different bird assemblages. Species that were recorded in a greater number of different types of landscape element were also recorded in more mosaics. This was true for all species and for woodland birds, and indicates that species that can use a greater range of countryside elements may have an increased tolerance of future landscape modification. The richness of woodland species at survey sites in different elements was influenced by features of the mosaic in which they occurred. Notably, the richness of woodland bird species recorded at sites in scattered trees and pasture increased with a greater cover of native vegetation in the overall mosaic. Of the overall pool of woodland bird species documented in the broader study region, 35% of species were not recorded in the agricultural mosaics sampled here. While many of these species were uncommon in the study area, or were associated with vegetation communities infrequently sampled in mosaics, this shows that conservation efforts in agricultural landscapes will not be appropriate for all species. For those woodland species that were recorded, measures of the extent of wooded vegetation cover had a strong, positive influence on the frequency of occurrence of individual species in mosaics. Thus, individual species of woodland bird occurred more frequently in mosaics with a greater cover of wooded vegetation. Nine woodland species showed a stronger response to measures of vegetation cover that included tree plantation and/or scattered trees than to the cover of native vegetation alone. For these species, structurally complex countryside elements provide valuable supplementary habitat at the landscape scale. Results of this study show that landscape properties influence the occurrence of birds in agricultural mosaics. The extent of cover of element types, particularly native vegetation, had the strongest influence on all measures of bird occurrence in mosaics. Thus, native vegetation is vital for the persistence of birds in farmland landscapes and is the primary element on which conservation efforts in these environments depend. Nevertheless, with careful management, countryside elements may provide additional conservation benefits for many bird species. Countryside elements made an important contribution to landscape heterogeneity, the landscape property with greatest influence on overall bird richness in mosaics. Countryside elements also increased the structural complexity of cleared agricultural land, and so have the capacity to enhance connectivity in fragmented landscapes. A focus on these factors (landscape heterogeneity and structural complexity) will provide the greatest opportunities for using countryside elements to increase the conservation value of farmland environments for native fauna. The relatively small scale of this study indicates that the cumulative effect of even small elements in farm mosaics contributes to the structural properties of entire landscapes. Critically, this emphasises the important contribution that individual landholders can make to nature conservation in agricultural environments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agricultural landscapes</field><field name="subject">farmland mosaic</field><field name="subject">countryside</field><field name="subject">matrix</field><field name="subject">landscape structure</field><field name="subject">landscape properties</field><field name="subject">woodland birds</field><field name="subject">farmland birds</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20090114.101341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The comorbidity between eating disorders and anxiety disorders</field><field name="creator">Swinbourne, Jessica M</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology, Pathological</field><field name="subject">Eating disorders</field><field name="subject">Anxiety disorders</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A novice primary school teacher's attempt to teach mathematics for understanding : a self-study</field><field name="creator">Forrester, Patricia A.</field><field name="description">The emergence of constructivist epistemology, as the dominant educational philosophy, has been very influential on the current movement to improve the quality of education. NSW has seen the establishment of the NSW Institute of Teachers (NSW Government, 2004a), the development and publication of a generic set of standards for teaching (NSW Institute of Teachers, 2005a) and the implementation of the NSW Quality Teaching model of pedagogy since 2003. In mathematics education, philosophies of mathematics and mathematics teaching that are consistent with constructivism, are reflected in current and previous NSW syllabus documents as well as the standards document published by the Australian Association for Mathematics Teachers in 2002.  Within the context of these documents this research project investigated my efforts, as a novice teacher of primary school mathematics, to implement quality mathematics teaching. This research evolved from a Bachelor of Education honours project, which found that despite recently graduating from university preservice teaching courses which advocate teaching pedagogy based on constructivist learning theories, beginning teachers, along with their more experienced colleagues, use largely traditional methodologies in their mathematics teaching. From the narrative and analysis of my experience, it is my aim to demonstrate ways in which support might be implemented for beginning teachers in the subject area of mathematics. While the research literature has investigated beginning teachers, it has not done so in this unique and evolving context. In this thesis the components of effective mathematics teaching were identified from the mathematics education literature, with a particular focus on the work of Doug and Barbara Clarke (Clarke and Clarke, 2004; Clarke, 1997) and linked to the more generic elements of the NSW model of pedagogy (NSW Department of Education and Training, 2003e). The resulting picture of the quality teaching of mathematics was then used to analyse the data collected in video-taped lessons as well as the issues that emerged from my teaching diaries, daybook and programs, utilising the NVivo 2 (QSR, 2002) computer program.  The first year of teaching was undertaken on a part-time basis teaching only mathematics to a Year 2 class. The second year involved teaching a Year 4 class on a full-time basis. The impact of teaching full-time had an immediate impact on the time available to focus on mathematics teaching. Efforts to implement elements of best practice were subjugated by my need to survive the crushing workload associated with undertaking the programming, planning, teaching, assessing and reporting of all KLAs, each involving significant content. In considering the implications of the findings of this self-study project it is important to consider the implications, not only for the support of novice teachers but also for the students they teach. Despite the positive experience of having taught part-time, improving on the skills developed in previous professional placement and casual teaching experiences including classroom organisation, behaviour management and programming, taking on a full-time teaching load with a new grade was overwhelming. Implications regarding the types of support that would have been of benefit in assisting my efforts to do more than survive the early experiences of full-time teaching, and improve the quality of mathematics education experienced by my students are drawn. These include suggestions of how university courses might assist in bridging the gap between the vision of quality and the realities of teaching; reduced workload to allow significant opportunities for lesson preparation; formal mentoring, from someone other than a supervisor, and structures to support the establishment of collegial partnerships; preservice and inservice courses that move the teacher from an image of reform to identifying and developing a specific component in their own teaching; and the provision of innovative mathematics programs to support both beginning and experienced teachers in improving the quality of their mathematics teaching.

This is especially the case where centrally managed security is not possible. Trust issues arise not only in business functions, but also in technologies used to support these functions. There are a vast number of services and applications that must accommodate appropriate notions of trust. Trust and trust management have become a hot research area. The motivation of this dissertation is to build up a comprehensive trust management approach that covers the analysis/modelling of trust relationships and the development of trust management systems in a consistent manner. A formal model of trust relationship is proposed with a strict mathematical structure that can not only reflect many of the commonly used notions of trust, but also provide a solid basis for a unified taxonomy framework of trust where a range of useful properties of trust relationships can be expressed and compared. A classification of trust relationships is presented. A set of definitions, propositions, and operations are proposed for the properties about scope and diversity of trust relationships, direction and symmetry of trust relationships, and relations of trust relationships. A general methodology for analysis and modelling of trust relationships in distributed information system is presented. The general methodology includes a range of major concerns in the whole lifecycle of trust relationships, and provides practical guidelines for analysis and modelling of trust relationships in the real world. A unified framework for trust management is proposed. Trust request, trust evaluation, and trust consuming are handled in a comprehensive and consistent manner. A variety of trust mechanisms including reputation, credentials, local data, and environment parameters are covered under the same framework. A trust management architecture is devised for facilitating the development of trust management systems. A trust management system for federated medical services is developed as an implementation example of the proposed trust management architecture. An online booking system is developed to show how a trust management system is employed by applications. A trust management architecture for web services is devised. It can be viewed as an extension of WS-Trust with the ability to integrate the message building blocks supported by web services protocol stack and other trust mechanisms. It provides high level architecture and guidelines for the development and deployment of a trust management layer in web services. Trust management extension of CardSpace identity system is introduced. Major concerns are listed for the analysis and modelling of trust relationships, and development of trust management systems for digital identities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">trust</field><field name="subject">computer networks</field><field name="subject">electronic commerce</field><field name="subject">security measures</field><field name="subject">data protection</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/35454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shapeshifting: prostitution and the problem of harm: a discourse analysis of media reportage of prostitution law reform in New Zealand in 2003</field><field name="creator">Barrington, Jane</field><field name="description">Interpersonal violence and abuse in New Zealand is so widespread it is considered a normative experience. Mental health nurses witnessing the inscribed effects of abuse on service users are lead to consider whether we are dealing with a breakdown of the mind or a breakdown in social or cultural connection (Stuhlmiller, 2003). The purpose of this research is to examine the cultural context which makes violence and abuse against women and children possible. In 2003, the public debate on prostitution law reform promised to open a space in which discourses on sexuality and violence, practices usually private or hidden, would publicly emerge. Everyday discourses relating to prostitution law reform reported in the New Zealand Herald newspaper in the year 2003 were analysed using Foucauldian and feminist post-structural methodological approaches. Foucauldian discourse analysis emphasises the ways in which power is enmeshed in discourse, enabling power relations and hegemonic practices to be made visible. The research aims were to develop a complex, comprehensive analysis of the media discourses, to examine the construction of harm in the media debate, to examine the ways in which the cultural hegemony of dominant groups was secured and contested and to consider the role of mental health nurses as agents of emancipatory political change. Mental health promotion is mainly a socio-political practice and the findings suggest that mental health nurses could reconsider their professional role, to participate politically as social activists, challenging the social order thereby reducing the human suffering which interpersonal violence and abuse carries in its wake.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foucauldian discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Feminist post-structuralism</field><field name="subject">Prostitution</field><field name="subject">Mental health nursing</field><field name="subject">Violent behaviour</field><field name="subject">Sex workers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/471</field></doc><doc><field name="title">10 Bowen St.</field><field name="creator">Leitch, Fran</field><field name="description">This project is a site specific based exploration into the boundaries between the domestic home and the navigation of the anxious corporeal body which dwells in the space.

There has been considerable interest in exploiting ICT to develop high technology clusters and support innovative networks (Lawson &amp; Lorenz 1999). However, these initiatives have met with mixed success. It is clear that such development depends on more than providing appropriate technology Attention to social and organisational factors is crucial if regional areas are to realise the potential of ICT as a tool for regional development (Gengatharen &amp; Standing 2005). It is important to understand the nature of business networking as well as the perspective of those participating in such networks if successful initiatives are to be established. The aim of this research is to identify how ICT can be used for knowledge sharing among businesses in regional areas and how the online networks through which knowledge is shared can contribute to the development of the region. 
This research investigates the question of what value small businesses in those regions derive from knowledge sharing networks using ICT. It also seeks to identify the value creation potential of those networks for their region. Previous research has shown that large organisations have achieved significant value from virtual communities of practice (VCoPs) as a structure for sharing knowledge and supporting innovation (Wenger 2004). The concept of Communities of Practice and Virtual Communities of Practice provided a useful point of departure for this research.
The investigation comprised interpretive case studies of two Australian regional areas and their local business networks which incorporated SMEs in a variety of industries. Each case study was conducted in three stages. First, semi-structured interviews were conducted with regional economic development leaders. Second, 192 small and medium business owners were surveyed about their business activities and their participation in local business networks. Third, in-depth interviews were conducted with 23 small business owners to gain a richer understanding of their participation in knowledge-sharing networks and the value they realised or anticipated from various knowledge-sharing activities. A combined analysis of the two cases was conducted as well as the individual analyses. The research adopted a modified Structured Case method (Carroll &amp; Swatman 2000). 
The analysis of the two case studies revealed: 
a.)	There was a significant difference between the majority of SMEs who traded within the region and those trading largely beyond the region. The latter&#146;s more proactive online sharing knowledge and seeking of business opportunities would enable them to access most value from VCoEs. 
b.)	The participating SMEs operated in a number of industries and what they had in common was an interest in improving their enterprises. Consequently they used their regional networks which were not aligned to any one industry to make connections and share knowledge. They did not necessarily seek to access specific information.
c.)	A necessary prerequisite of VCoEs is having vibrant CoEs where face-to-face interaction enhances the development of trust and social capital. This appeared as an important factor facilitating the move to incorporate online knowledge sharing. 
d.)	Younger businesses appeared to gain the most value from knowledge sharing in CoEs as they were using their networks to determine how to grow their firm.
e.)	The value of VCoEs to the SME participants is primarily in their general connection to other businesses in the region. Since the participants operate in a number of industries, what they have in common is an interest in their enterprises. The main value appears to come from the potential of the VCoEs to add to this connection and to social capital. 
This study found that successful management of VCoEs must: 
i)	Ensure the network website is actively used by members before attempting to incorporate online knowledge sharing. 
ii)	Monitor and stimulate online forum interaction rather than rely on interaction to occur naturally.
iii)	Not rely on email as a mechanism for stimulating knowledge sharing. Email is seen as more appropriate for formal documentation than for candid exchange of views.
The concept of virtual communities of practice was found to be somewhat inappropriate for the diverse SMEs in the regional networks. Because of their diversity, they do not necessarily see value in sharing knowledge about practice but they do see value in sharing more general information and in providing support, connection and ideas that facilitate the strategic direction of their business. To address this issue, the concept of virtual communities of enterprise (VCoEs) is proposed as recognition of what the participating SMEs had in common: an interest in their individual businesses as part of the region. 
The original contribution of this research consists of its identification of the issues in linking SMEs across industries. It provides new insights on the business practices of regional SMEs and developed the concepts of Community of Enterprise (CoE) and Virtual Community of Enterprise (VCoE) to capture the special nature of knowledge sharing in regional multi-industry business networks. New perspectives are revealed on the ways that value could be derived from knowledge sharing by these regionally networked SMEs, as such it adds to the body of knowledge in an area where there has been little systematic investigation. This research reinforces the importance of social capital as an essential pre-requisite for accessing the value of intellectual capital in regions. Social capital emerges as vital when establishing and maintaining face-to-face knowledge sharing in regional networks and a necessary pre-condition for successfully establishing online knowledge sharing. Trust is a key factor and this research extends understanding of the role of social capital and the importance of trust in regional networks and online interaction. Its findings have significant implications for the development and management of CoEs and VCoEs as it outlines the key elements that need to be addressed when establishing and maintaining them, the appropriate applications for this context and the issues involved in management of the networking and online contexts. These findings not only increase our understanding of the management dynamics of online networks, they can also provide guidance to those seeking to establish successful VCoEs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information and Communications Technology (ICT)</field><field name="subject">small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs)</field><field name="subject">knowledge sharing</field><field name="subject">value creation</field><field name="subject">regional development</field><field name="subject">regional clusters</field><field name="subject">networking</field><field name="subject">Communities of Practice (CoPs)</field><field name="subject">Virtual Communities of Practice (VCoPs)</field><field name="subject">Communities of Enterprise (CoEs)</field><field name="subject">Virtual Communities of Enterprise (VCoEs)</field><field name="subject">social capital</field><field name="subject">intellectual capital</field><field name="subject">interpretive multiple case study</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20090129.152913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fractionations and analysis of trunk exudates from pistacia genus in relation to antimicrobial activity</field><field name="creator">Sharifi, Mohammad S.</field><field name="description">H. pylori is one of the most significant discoveries in gastroenterology in the past century. It is associated with a wide range of gastroduodenal pathologies and gastric cancer. Antibiotic resistance in H. pylori has emerged as a significant clinical problem. The body of work contained within this dissertation was carried out to investigate an alternative therapy based on observations of the traditional therapy for gastric disease in the Middle East. One of these traditional therapies centres on plants belonging to the Pistacia genus. This study represents the first reported investigation into the composition and biological activity of the trunk bark exudates of Pistacia atlantica Kurdic (P. a. Kurdica), Pistacia atlantica Mutica (P. a. Mutica) and Pistacia atlantica Cabolica (P. a. Cabolica), resinous gums that have been termed here &#8216;Kurdica Gum&#8217;, &#8216;Mutica Gum &#8217; and &#8216;Cabolica Gum &#8217; respectively. The antimicrobial screening of the trunk exudates of the genus Pistacia led to the characterization of the most active fraction of the Kurdica gum. This fraction was subsequently subjected to sub-fractionation leading to the discovery of fundamentally new information that went beyond H. pylori, expanding the original parameters of the project. The extent of these findings suggests that new classes of antibiotics might have been discovered. Primary studies on their structure and potential mechanism of action has been undertaken. Thirteen novel antimicrobial agents were identified. Based on the characteristics of these isolated fractions, 50 new compounds were modelled; of which 30 hypothetically have an MIC consistent with contemporary antibiotics and could represent viable lead compounds for commercial development.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pistacia</field><field name="subject">gums and resins</field><field name="subject">therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">antibiotics</field><field name="subject">Helicobacter pylori infections</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal system</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/35517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The management of dyspnoea in advanced heart failure</field><field name="creator">Newton, Phillip J.</field><field name="description">Heart failure is a cause of significant burden to both individuals and society. Individuals live with a disease where there is a decline in physical functioning, the experience of a range of symptoms including breathlessness and pain, frequent hospitalisations and death. The frequent hospital admissions that are usually precipitated by shortness of breath places an economic burden on the current health system. This burden of heart failure is expected to increase in the coming years due to factors such as the ageing population and improved survival from acute cardiac events. This current and predicted continuing burden has been recognised by the health system and has resulted in significant improvement in the pharmacotherapy and nonpharmacotherapy treatment of heart failure. Despite this improvement and with the exception of those few who receive cardiac transplantation, there is no cure for heart failure. Whist the advances in therapy have promoted significant improvements in heart failure management, symptoms including breathlessness (dyspnoea) remain a major issue. The Management of Dyspnoea in Advanced Heart Failure project explored and assessed the current therapeutic management of dyspnoea in advanced heart failure and examined two potential therapeutic options namely nebulised frusemide and long-term oxygen therapy. Following a comprehensive review of the nebulised frusemide literature, The Haemodynamic Effects of Nebulised Frusemide in Heart Failure study showed that nebulised frusemide did have an impact on the haemodynamic parameters of participants. Whilst many consider oxygen therapy as a common sense approach for breathlessness, the lack of scientific evidence for its use in chronic breathlessness with people who have normal or mildly low oxygen levels has prevented funding to supply oxygen therapy to this group of patients. The O2 Breathe Study is a palliative care study that is testing long-term home oxygen therapy versus medical air in patients who do meet the current funding arrangements. The analysis of the screening data showed that the symptom burden as a result of dyspnoea is similar to that seen in cancer and respiratory patients, and heart failure patients had lower levels of physical functioning than the respiratory group. Whilst the design of the studies in this thesis will not allow conclusions to be made regarding their efficacy for dyspnoea management in heart failure, they have provided preliminary data and hypotheses to be tested in the future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dyspnea</field><field name="subject">palliative treatment</field><field name="subject">oxygen therapy</field><field name="subject">heart failure</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">heart</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/35551</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utilising airborne scanning laser (LiDAR) to improve the assessment of Australian native forest structure</field><field name="creator">Lee, Alex C.</field><field name="description">Enhanced understanding of forest stocks and dynamics can be gained through improved forest measurement, which is required to assist with sustainable forest management decisions, meet Australian and international reporting needs, and improve research efforts to better respond to a changing climate.  Integrated sampling schemes that utilise a multi-scale approach, with a range of data sourced from both field and remote sensing, have been identified as a way to generate the required forest information.  Given the multi-scale approach proposed by these schemes, it is important to understand how scale potentially affects the interpretation and reporting of forest from a range of data.  
&#182;
To provide improved forest assessment at a range of scales, this research has developed a strategy for facilitating tree and stand level retrieval of structural attributes within an integrated multi-scale analysis framework.  The research investigated the use of fine-scale (~1m) airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data (1,125 ha in central Queensland, and 60,000 ha in NE Victoria) to calibrate other remotely sensed data at the two study sites.  The strategy refines forest structure mapping through three-dimensional (3D) modelling combined with empirical relationships, allowing improved estimation of maximum and predominant height, as well as foliage and crown cover at multiple scales.  Tree stems (including those in the sub-canopy) were located using a height scaled crown openness index (HSCOI), which integrated the 3D density of canopy elements within the vertical profile into a two-dimensional spatial layer.  The HSCOI modelling also facilitated the reconstruction of the 3D distribution of foliage and branches (of varying size and orientation) within the forest volume.  
&#182;  
Comparisons between forests at the Queensland and NE Victorian study sites indicated that accurate and consistent retrieval of cover and height metrics could be achieved at multiple scales, with the algorithms applicable for semi-automated use in other forests with similar structure.  This information has facilitated interpretation and evaluation of Landsat imagery and ICESat satellite laser data for forest height and canopy cover retrieval.  The development of a forest cover translation matrix allows a range of data and metrics to be compared at the plot scale, and has initiated the development of continuous transfer functions between the metrics and datasets.  These data have been used subsequently to support interpretation of SAR data, by providing valuable input to 2D and 3D radar simulation models.  Scale effects have been identified as being significant enough to influence national forest class reporting in more heterogeneous forests, thus allowing the most appropriate use and integration of remote sensed data at a range of scales.  An empirically based forest minimum mapping area of 1 ha for reporting is suggested.  The research has concluded that LiDAR can provide calibration information just as detailed and possibly more accurately than field measurements for many required forest attributes.  Therefore the use of LiDAR data offers a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between accurate field plot structural information and stand to landscape scale sampling, to provide enhanced forest assessment in Australia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LiDAR</field><field name="subject">Forests</field><field name="subject">Structure</field><field name="subject">Height</field><field name="subject">Canopy density</field><field name="subject">Canopy cover</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090127.222600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A search for transiting extrasolar planets from the southern hemisphere</field><field name="creator">Hamacher, Duane Willis, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">To date, more than 300 planets orbiting stars other than our sun have been discovered using a range of observing techniques, with new discoveries occuring monthly. The work in this thesis focused on the detection of exoplanets using the transit method. Planets orbiting close to their host stars have a roughly 10 per cent chance of eclipsing (transiting) the star, with Jupiter?sized planets causing a one per cent dip in the flux of the star over a few hours. A wealth of orbital and physical information on the system can be extracted from these systems, including the planet density which is essential in constraining models of planetary formation. To detect these types of planets requires monitoring tens of thousands of stars over a period of months. To accomplish this, we conduct a wide-field survey using the 0.5-meter Automated Patrol Telescope (APT) at Siding Spring Observatory (SSO) in NSW, Australia. Once candidates were selected from the data?set, selection criteria were applied to separate the likely planet candidates from the false?positives. For this thesis, the methods and instrumentation used in attaining data and selecting planet candidates are discussed, as well as the results and analysis of the planet candidates selected from star fields observed from 2004?2007. Of the 65 planet candidates initially selected from the 25 target fields observed, only two were consistent with a planet transit. These candidates were later determined to be eclipsing binary stars based on follow up observations using the 40-inch telescope, 2.3-m telescope, and the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope, all located at SSO. Additionally, two planet candidates from the SuperWASP-North consortium were observed on the 40-inch telescope. Both proved to be eclipsing binary stars. While no planets were found, our search methods and results are consistent with successful transit surveys targeting similar fields with stars in a similar magnitude range and using similar methods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transit method</field><field name="subject">extrasolar planets</field><field name="subject">exoplanets</field><field name="subject">observational astronomy</field><field name="subject">automated patrol telescope</field><field name="subject">Extrasolar planets</field><field name="subject">Southern Hemisphere</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Peacock pilgrimage: an ode to India</field><field name="creator">Fowler-Smith, Penelope Jane, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The project entitled PEACOCK PILGRIMAGE comprises two components: the screenplay for a feature film, entitled Peacock Angel, and an exegesis, which explores the underlying influences on the screenplay. Peacock Angel is the story of a young girl, Deva, who grew up in India with a fascination for peacocks, especially the fictional peacock angel. After a time of isolation as a teenager in the West, she returns to India to reconcile with a tragic past and reconnect with her true longings. India is the place that mends her wounded heart. Within the symbolic realms of the screenplay Deva, as the central character, becomes the peacock &#145;goddess&#146;. Her journey allows us to explore layers within the themes of identity, memory and fantasy. The project holds an East/West theme, of disillusionment with Western material values and appreciation of the depth of Indian culture, of &#147;the land where the heart is king&#148;. Field research on the peacock, the key motif of the project, has led me on a journey through India that has been full of synchronicity and given me a particularly rich taste of her timeless culture. The exegesis elaborates on aspects of my journey, on the concepts of synchronicity and pilgrimage, and on the motif of peacock &#150; highlighting its symbolic and mythical meanings. It also situates Peacock Angel within the field of world cinema, in the category of Western films made in India and the genre of magic realism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Peacocks in art</field><field name="subject">India</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The city that never sleeps</field><field name="creator">Furgang, Lynne Eva, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research documentation explores representations of the Holocaust in the visual arts in relation to the post-Holocaust ??ripple effect????the impact of the Holocaust on the world today, in both the wider arena of global political conflicts and in the lives of individuals. In the following chapters, I address the complex ethical and political aspects of representations of the Holocaust in the context of the evolution of Holocaust awareness and memorialisation. I also investigate recent developments in art and theory that challenge prevailing conventions governing Holocaust representation, especially how the relationship between the perceived political exploitation of the Holocaust and the intergenerational effects of Holocaust trauma is addressed.   Given these are sensitive and contentious issues I discuss my studio work in terms of how trauma affects the political rather than as an overt polemically/politically motivated art. I examine my attempts to bypass controversy (maintaining respect for victims and survivors), yet maintain engagement with these issues in my art. In doing this I aim to liberate both my art and the viewer from habits of perception in regard to the subject.  From this principle I propose a ??strategic?? form of self-censorship that paradoxically gives me the freedom to do this. This strategy enables me to create an art of ambiguity, which exists in an amoral zone. The art evokes reflective thought, uncertainty and ambivalence, where references to the Holocaust or political content are often not explicit, leaving room for lateral and open readings.   My work, which incorporates interdisciplinary methods, is often based on photographs from a variety of sources. I also create three dimensional constructions. The sourced images and the constructions are disguised, decontextualised, cropped, erased or digitally altered, and also experiment with optical illusion. Through transformative processes these images are changed into drawings, paintings, photographs.   This research documentation acknowledges the gap between the gravitas of the subject with its ethical and geo-political complexities and my idiosyncratic, subjective, introverted approach to making art. I conclude that there is potential in the exploration of an ??anxiety of representation?? in relation to the Holocaust in the contemporary context.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Contemporary art</field><field name="subject">Holocaust representation</field><field name="subject">Ambiguity</field><field name="subject">Politics</field><field name="subject">Holocaust (Christian theology)</field><field name="subject">Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945), and art</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance evaluation of ETX on  grid based wireless mesh networks</field><field name="creator">Ni, Xian, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the past few years Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) have developed as a promising technology to provide flexible and low-cost broadband network services. The Expected Transmission Count (ETX) routing metric has been put forward recently as an advanced routing metric to provide high QoS for static WMNs. Most previous research in this area suggests that ETX outperforms other routing metrics in throughput and efficiency. However, it has been determined that ETX is not immune to load sensitivity and route oscillations in a single radio environment. Route oscillations refer to the situation where packet transmission switches between two or more routes due to congestion. This has the effect of degrading performance of the network, as the routing protocol may select a non optimal path. In this thesis we avoided the route oscillation problem by forcing data transmission on fixed routes. This can be implemented in the AODV (Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector) protocol by disabling both error messages and periodic updating messages (the HELLO scheme). However, a critical factor for our approach is that ETX must determine a high quality initial route in AODV. This thesis investigates whether the ETX metric improves initial route selection in AODV compared to the HOPS metric in two representative client-server applications: the Traffic Control Network (TCN) and the Video Stream (VS) network. We evaluate the ETX and HOPS metrics in a range of scenarios which possess different link qualities and different traffic loads. We find the ETX metric greatly improves initial route selection in AODV compared to the HOPS in the network in which only single flow exists. For networks in which there are multiple simultaneous flows, ETX behaves similar to HOPS in initial route selection. Based on these results, we find the solution of route stabilization to route oscillations in the context of ETX is only useful in the single flow case. To address this problem, we propose a modified solution of repeatedly broadcasting RREQ (Route Request) packets. Simulation results show that our modified solution allows ETX to be useful in the initial route selection in both single flow and multiple simultaneous flows cases.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Routing, WMNs, ETX</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Computer networks</field><field name="subject">Routers (Computer networks)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transmission power control in body-wearable sensor devices for healthcare monitoring</field><field name="creator">Xiao, Shuo, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Emerging body-wearable sensor devices for continuous health monitoring are severely energy constrained and yet required to offer high communication reliability under fluctuating channel conditions. This thesis aims at investigating the opportunities and challenges in the use of dynamic radio transmit power control for prolonging the lifetime of such devices. We first present extensive empirical evidence that the wireless link quality can change rapidly in body area networks, and a fixed transmit power results in either wasted energy (when the link is good) or low reliability (when the link is bad). We then propose a class of schemes feasible for practical implementation that adapt transmit power in real-time based on feedback information from the receiver. We show conservative, balanced, and aggressive adaptations of our scheme that progressively achieve higher energy savings of 14%-30% in exchange for higher potential packet losses (up to 10%). We also provide guidelines on how the parameters can be tuned to achieve the desired trade-off between energy savings and reliability within the chosen operating environment. Finally, we implement and profile our scheme on a MicaZ mote based platform, demonstrating that energy savings are achievable even with imperfect feedback information, and report preliminary results on the ultra-low-power integrated healthcare monitoring platform from our collaborating partner Toumaz Technology. In conclusion, our work shows adaptive radio transmit power control as a low-cost way of extending the battery-life of severely energy constrained body wearable devices, and opens the door to further optimizations customized for specific deployment scenarios.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transmission Power Control</field><field name="subject">Body Sensor Network</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of fuzzy logic, GIS and remote sensing to the assessment of environmental factors for extensive brackishwater aquaculture in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">-, Tarunamulia, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Extensive brackishwater aquaculture, which is a dominant land-based aquaculture system in Indonesia, has experienced variable success in most farming locations in the country due to poor understanding of spatial assessment of environmental factors and rudimentary site selection criteria. Despite tremendous potential, the application of GIS and remote sensing in spatial assessment has tended to focus on Boolean (Crisp) logic that is often unable to effectively handle the complexity and spatial variability of key environmental factors for the development of aquaculture.  This study explored the possibility of integrating fuzzy logic techniques into GIS and remote sensing technology to generate more robust mapping protocols in aquaculture, compensating for the disadvantages of the Crisp method.  Two models were developed in two different provinces in Indonesia to spatially assess soil and hydrological constraints on extensive brackishwater aquaculture. The soil assessment focussed on acid sulfate soils (ASS) and sandy-textured sediments in Aceh, and the hydrological study focused on investigating important wave parameters that influence the suitability of coastal areas for siting extensive pond units in South Sulawesi.  The study showed that fuzzy-based classification methods, integrated into the image analysis, was highly effective in identifying existing and potential pond areas for extensive brackishwater aquaculture compared to the best result of the commonly used Crisp method. By addition of one or more key environmental variables of ASS into the fuzzy-classified existing and potential ponds areas, a very robust predictive tool to identify potential ponds areas affected by ASS in Kembang Tanjung, Aceh was developed.  A more detailed assessment of ASS developed in this study also successfully highlighted the severity of sandy-soils and identified them as another key soil variable that has and will severely impact on pond productivity.  The second model developed by the study enables fuzzy logic to be integrated into GIS to predict the possible areas impacted by moderate to high energy wave conditions and possible ways of minimising their direct and indirect impacts. The models developed in this study were shown to work well in both study sites and can be applied elsewhere. The mapping outputs are easy to interpret even by stakeholders with no prior training in map reading. Overall, the models have the potential to reduce planning errors and to improve decision making in aquaculture provided that quality data sources are used.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquaculture -- Indonesia</field><field name="subject">GIS and Remote Sensing</field><field name="subject">Fuzzy logic -- Industrial applications -- Congresses</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gold and silver nanoparticles: synthesis, characterization and functional properties</field><field name="creator">Kemal, Lydia, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on the shape-controlled metal nanoparticles for functional applications, covering the synthesis, characterization and optical properties. Three parts are mainly involved in this work, including, gold worm-like nanoparticles, silver nanoplates, and silver induced selenium nanowires. The first part focuses on a facile synthesis method for shape control of gold nanoparticles by treating an aqueous solution of chloroauric acid with sodium citrate and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), in which those worm-like nanoparticles were investigated by various advanced experimental characterizations combining density function theory (DFT) calculation. These nanoparticles can be used for optical sensing detection of ions in aqueous system. The second part involves the synthesis, growth, and optical properties of silver nanoplates (triangles and circular discs). Such nanoplates could be synthesized by a self-seeding co-reduction method at ambient conditions. In particular, molecular dynamics simulation is used to quantify the interaction energies between surfactant molecules and different facets of silver crystal. Such molecular information, together with measurements using x-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ultraviolet??visible (UV??vis) spectroscopy, has proven to be useful for understanding the growth mechanisms of silver nanoplates. The third part focuses on the template of silver nanoparticles for generating trigonal selenium (t-Se) nanowires. This technique exhibits some advantages in fabricating t-Se nanostructures, including no need to use stabilizers and sonichemical process and all operations being proceeded in aqueous media and at room temperature. Particularly it can successfully achieve the transformation from amorphous &#945;-Se to crystalline t-Se in aqueous solution and this method would be useful for generating one-dimensional nanostructures with similar lattice parameter(s).

These drainage studies were designed to simulate real operational aspects such as: continuous casting, variable tapping rate and inflow liquid distribution. During the analysis of these drainage experiments it was demonstrated that the residual-flowout correlation in use since the 1970??s may possibly be incomplete or inaccurate. The removal of slag from the blast furnace hearth is the greater concern of the two liquids produced in the iron making process. In the 1970??s operational difficulties arose when large volumes of residual slag remained in the furnace after casting. This prompted research related to the flow of viscous liquids through uniformly packed beds providing fundamental insight on the most effective means of removal of slag from the blast furnace hearth. The core subject of this study, the residual-flowout correlation developed by Fukutake and Okabe that is used to predict cast duration and liquid accumulation in the blast furnace hearth is discussed in detail. The residual-flowout correlation is examined for four different sets of conditions based on constant or increasing slag drainage, with and without liquid dripping. The outcome of this study will improve our understanding of the residual-flowout relationship and develop it further, so that drainage conditions whether for constant or increasing drainage rates, with or without dripping, will hold using the one general Fl equation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">residual ratio</field><field name="subject">hearth</field><field name="subject">flowout</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41490</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self organization in nature</field><field name="creator">McCrea, Genevieve Rosalind, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sand is an appropriate material to embody and make visible the impulses which may pass through the moving hand and also permeate the universe. Its ability to absorb impressions means it can take on the full range of material states, solid, liquid or vapour, and allows it to speak with the rhythmic language the whole of nature itself uses. Developing a language of forms which more closely speaks this rhythmic language of nature requires an intimate knowledge of the processes of nature.  Sand experiments undertaken show the formation a rich array of dazzling patterns.  Chaos theory explains this self organizing capacity, and reveals the depth of interdependence of systems within nature.  The aspect of self-similarity is also of central significance in appreciating how nature looks and function, and thus how it might be imaged. Drawings from nature were developed using sand as a parameter, starting with the single grain and translating the dynamism of moving sand into mark.  Field trips involved looking for waves and repeated lines in nature, and observing how marks form in nature. Chaos theory provides a ground to bring together different spheres of knowledge ?? science, theology and art.  It reveals the peculiarities of a material??s behaviour as being of critical importance in the mechanism of evolution.  It also provides fresh insight into an incarnational Christian theological perspective, and the relational dynamic within the Trinity.  The unity of far and near is also reflected in chaos theory in the self similarity of images. Romantic artists Turner and Van Gogh both engage in the search for a visual language of transcendence through nature using the use of the themes of chaos and order, with an emphasis on physicality and movement.  Contemporary artists Goldsworthy, Blanchflower and Kirkeby ground their work in knowledge of material. Changes from solid and rigid to shifting and open show in the development of my work. The immediacy and dynamism of mark making in drawing and staining, ripping and sanding in painting gives process and materiality greater weight.

Yet, although the eminent Liszt-scholar Michael Saffle has stated that 'Pedagogy is one of the most thoroughly-mined veins of Liszt material ever uncovered', academic discussions on Liszt's Technical Studies (Walker, 2005), his definitive pedagogical work for piano, are scarce. What it was that Liszt set out as being fundamental to the acquisition of pianistic virtuosity in the Technical Studies and the nature of its trajectory is generally unknown. Through an examination of the didactic instruction Liszt supplied in the Preface of the autograph manuscript to the Technical Studies and specific technical commentaries written by Mme. Auguste Boissier in her Liszt pedagogue, I will argue that the Technical Studies are built on six artistic and mechanical principles, exemplified by Liszt in the exercises, written to help the pianist acquire technical virtuosity.

The programs provide the optimum number of servers required at the airport. This will help airport management to select the number of counters at a given time. The results of the execution process of these two programs indicate the variables, such as earliness distribution, service time, queue system, and the check in counter sizes and configurations have strong influence to overall cost. A number of applications have been attempted and distribution has been explored. The results also demonstrated that under the condition imposed the multiple queue system provides less maximum queue length but longer waiting time compared to single queue system.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="subject">airport check-in counter</field><field name="subject">modeling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of vein graft haemodynamics using computational fluid dynamics techniques.</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Mark John, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Atherosclerosis, the leading cause of mortality in Western societies, affects large elastic arteries, causing focal deposition of proliferative inflammatory and lipid-laden cells within the artery. Several risk factors have been causally implicated in the ???reaction to injury??? hypothesis first described by Ross in 1969. The ???injury??? sustained by endothelial cells may be either mechanical or chemical. Environmental factors have a role in the production of chemical agents that are injurious to the endothelium. Mechanical stresses such as wall tensile stress are proportional to systemic blood pressure and pulse pressure. Essentially, these systemic pressures are fairly evenly distributed throughout the circulation. However, atherosclerotic lesions characteristically occur at focal sites within the human vasculature; at or near bifurcations, within the ostia of branch arteries and at regions of marked or complex curvature, where local haemodynamic abnormalities occur. The most discussed haemodynamic factor seems to be low or highly oscillating wall shear stress which exists on the outer wall of bifurcations and on the inner aspect of curving vessels. The magnitude of these haemodynamic forces may not be great but the subtleties of their variable spatial distribution may help to explain the multifocal distribution of atherosclerotic plaques. With the altered haemodynamics there is endothelial injury and phenotypic changes in the endothelium result, which in turn lead to endothelial cell dysfunction. These haemodynamic variables are difficult to measure directly in vivo. In this work a novel model is developed utilising human autologous vein bypass grafts as a surrogate vessel for the observation of pathological structural changes in response to altered haemodynamics. The influence of haemodynamic factors (such as wall shear stress) in the remodeling of the vein graft wall and the pathogenesis of Myointimal Hyperplasia (MIH) and resultant wall thickening in femoral bypass grafts is analysed. The haemodynamic determinants of MIH (which have been established in many animal models) are similar to those implicated in atherosclerosis. The accelerated responses of the vein (Intimal hyperplasia develops much more rapidly than atherosclerotic lesions in native vessels) make it an ideal model to expediently examine the hypothesised relationships prospectively in an in vivo setting.  Furthermore, the utilisation of in vivo data acquired from non-invasive diagnostic methods (such as Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) and Duplex ultrasound) combined with the application of state-of-the-art Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) techniques makes the model essentially non-invasive. The following hypotheses are examined: 1) regions of Low shear and High tensile stress should develop disproportionately greater wall thickening, 2) regions of greater oscillatory blood flow should develop greater wall thickening, and 3) regions of lower wall shear should undergo inward (or negative) remodelling and result in a reduction in vessel calibre. The conclusions reached are that abnormal haemodynamic forces, namely low Time-averaged Wall Shear Stress, are associated with subsequent wall thickening. These positive findings have great relevance to the understanding of vein graft MIH and atherosclerosis. It was also evident that with non-invasive data and CFD techniques, some of the important haemodynamic factors are realistically quantifiable (albeit indirectly). The detection of parameters known to be causal in the development of graft intimal hyperplasia or other vascular pathology may improve ability to predict clinical problems. From a surgical perspective this might be employed to facilitate selection of at-risk grafts for more focused postoperative surveillance and reintervention. On a broader stage the utilisation of such analyses may be useful in predicting individuals at greater risk of developing atherosclerotic deposits, disease progression, and the likelihood of clinical events such as heart attack, stroke and threat of limb loss.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vascular surgery.</field><field name="subject">Haemodynamics.</field><field name="subject">Bypass graft.</field><field name="subject">Intimal hyperplasia.</field><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis.</field><field name="subject">Veins.</field><field name="subject">Fluid dynamics -- Computer simulation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38575</field></doc><doc><field name="title">E-health readiness assessment from EHR perspective</field><field name="creator">Li, Junhua, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Many countries (especially developing countries) are plagued with critical healthcare issues such as chronic, infectious and pandemic diseases, a lack of basic healthcare programmes and facilities and a shortage of skilled healthcare workers. E-Health (healthcare based on the Internet technologies) promises to overcome some problems related to the reach of healthcare in remote communities. Electronic Health Record (EHR) (consisting of all diagnostic information related to a patient) forms the core of any E-Health system. Hence the success of an E-Health system is very much dependent on the success of the EHR systems. Although interest in automating the health record is generally high, the literature informs us that they do not always succeed in terms of adoption rate and/or acceptance, even in developed countries. The success of the adoption tends to be low for resource constrained (e.g. insufficient E-Health infrastructure) developing countries. As part of the effort to enhance EHR acceptance, readiness assessment for the innovation becomes an essential requirement for the successful implementation and use of EHR (and hence E-Health). Based on a thorough literature review, several research gaps have been identified. In order to address these gaps, this thesis (based on design science research methodology) presents E-Health Readiness Assessment Methodology (EHRAM). It involves a new E-Health Readiness Assessment Framework (EHRAF), an assessment process and several techniques for analysing the assessment data to arrive at a readiness score. The EHRAF (Model) integrates the components from healthcare providers?? and organisational perspectives of existing E-Health readiness evaluation frameworks. The process of EHRAM (Method) starts with the development of a set of hierarchical evaluation criteria based on EHRAF. This leads to the questionnaire development for data collection. The data is analysed in EHRAM using a number of statistical and data mining techniques. The instantiation part of the design science research involves an automated tool for the implementation of EHRAM and its application through a case study in a developing country.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">assessment</field><field name="subject">E-health</field><field name="subject">readiness</field><field name="subject">EHR</field><field name="subject">paper health records</field><field name="subject">design science</field><field name="subject">framework</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">Developing Countries</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surrogate endpoints of survival in metastatic carcinoma</field><field name="creator">Nordman, Ina IC, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">In most randomised controlled trials (RCTs), a large number of patients need to be followed over many years, for the clinical benefit of the drug to be accurately quantified (1). Using an early proxy, or a surrogate endpoint, in place of the direct endpoint of overall survival (OS) could theoretically shorten the duration of RCTs and minimise the exposure of patients to ineffective or toxic treatments (2, 3). This thesis examined the relationship between surrogate endpoints and OS in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic breast cancer (MBC). A review of the literature identified 144 RCTs in metastatic CRC, 189 in advanced NSCLC and 133 in MBC. The publications were generally of poor quality with incomplete reporting on many key variables, making comparisons between studies difficult. The introduction of the CONSORT statement was associated with improvements in the quality of reporting. For CRC (337 arms), NSCLC (429 arms) and MBC (290 arms) there were strong relationships between OS and progression free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), disease control rate (DCR), response rate (RR) and partial response (PR). Correlation was also demonstrated between OS and complete response (CR) in CRC and duration of response (DOR) in MBC. However, while strong relationships were found, the proportion of variance explained by the models was small. Prediction bands constructed to determine the surrogate threshold effect size indicated that large improvements in the surrogate endpoints were needed to predict overall survival gains. PFS and TTP showed the most promise as surrogates. The gain in PFS and TTP required to predict a significant gain in overall survival was between 1.2 and 7.0 months and 1.8 and 7.7 months respectively, depending on trial size and tumour type. DCR was a better potential predictor of OS than RR. The results of this study could be used to design future clinical trials with particular reference to the selection of surrogate endpoint and trial size.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">metastatic cancer</field><field name="subject">surrogate endpoints</field><field name="subject">metastatic carcinoma</field><field name="subject">endpoints</field><field name="subject">survival</field><field name="subject">colorectal cancer</field><field name="subject">lung cancer</field><field name="subject">breast cancer</field><field name="subject">surrogate</field><field name="subject">non-small cell lung cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42791</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The hydrodynamics of high-speed transom-stern vessels</field><field name="creator">Robards, Simon William, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the design of all marine craft the prediction of a vessel??s resistance characteristics is a major consideration. The accurate prediction of resistance is particularly important in the design of modern high-speed vessels where the primary contractual obligation placed upon the builder is the vessel??s achievable speed. Investigation was made of the methods of Doctors and Day, whereby the traditional Michell wave-resistance theory, published in 1898, is improved on through a better understanding of the hydrodynamics of transom sterns and the application of statistically determined form factors. One of the difficulties with the Michell theory is how to account for the hollow that forms behind a transom stern, a feature prevalent in high-speed vessels. A common approach in the numerical prediction of wave resistance for transom-stern vessels is to discretize the hollow as a geometrically-smooth addition to the vessel. Therefore, of great importance in accurate prediction of wave resistance is the hydrodynamics of, and in particular, the length and depth of the hollow formed behind the transom stern. Accordingly, a systematic series of transom-stern models were tank tested at various drafts and speeds in order to determine experimentally the length and depth of the hollow as a function of vessel speed, draft and beam. From the experimental data, algorithms for the determination of the length and depth of the transom hollow, have been developed and utilised in the discretization of the transom hollow for prediction of resistance using the Michell wave- resistance theory. Application of the developed hollow algorithms produced significant improvements in correlation of the experimental and theoretical predictions of total resistance, particularly in the lower Froude range. In addition to the transom-hollow investigation, form factors were obtained using least-squares regression of existing experimental data. The form factors were based on the major geometric parameters of the models used. In the research presented here, the method was applied to a large range of published resistance data for high-speed displacement vessels. Considerable improvement in correlation, between theoretical and experimental predictions of total resistance, was obtained by incorporating the calculated form-factors into the total resistance formulation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resistance</field><field name="subject">Hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Transom-stern</field><field name="subject">Form factors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42782</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of social change in Saharawi refugee camps: democracy, education and   women??s rights</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, Karen, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Refugee studies often focus on the devastating effects forced migration can have on a refugee population, both mentally and physically. This research investigates the case of Saharawis living in refugee camps in south-west Algeria and the social change experienced over 30 years. The method was a case study with qualitative interviews supported with secondary data. The Saharawis went through a period of positive social change, to some a revolution, while living in the refugee camps. The empirical study identifies three theme areas; Education, Women??s rights and Democracy.  These circumstances are unlike many other refugee studies, thus providing what may be a unique case of positive social change. The case demonstrates how forced migration of a population may not just be a destructive process, but instead has the potential to reconstruct a society. Theories of social change and unanticipated outcomes are explored. Utilising the theories of Bourdieu and Merton, it is proposed that the Saharawi refugee experience is the unanticipated outcome of forced migration. This thesis explores commonalities and differences between Bourdieu??s study of the Kabyle population, and whether his theory of habitus is applicable. Bourdieu??s theories, heavily criticised for being too structuralist, show their limitations when dealing with positive social change. Bourdieu??s approach can suggest that it is inevitable for refugee populations to spiral into despair. The Saharawi case challenges these presumptions and highlights that neither sociologists nor populations should exclude the possibility of unexpected outcomes. Unanticipated outcomes are an acknowledgement of social change and the fact that at its heart no one can predict the future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Refugee</field><field name="subject">Saharawi</field><field name="subject">Sahrawi</field><field name="subject">Social change</field><field name="subject">Bourdieu</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42152</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Land Mark Architecture - in an age of non-discovery</field><field name="creator">Glover, Richard John, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this MFA Research Documentation is to present the ideas behind the photographs produced during the MFA Degree.

I explore how news journalists do not just have the ability, through the discursive selections they make, to be a catalyst for peace and non-violent solutions, it is their obligation under international human rights. My study links arguments about universal ethics for media based on international human rights with the practical and analytical approach of ??peace journalism??. The main argument rests on the idea that objectivity or impartiality in news journalism does not equal ethical neutrality since there is always a discursive selection made by the news journalists. In order to monitor whether news journalists discursive selections comply with the international human rights obligations, I have explored how the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission (HREOC) report A Last Resort? were covered in three Australian newspapers when it was published in 2004. The HREOC report was a testament of human rights abuses by the Australian Federal Governments towards children in Australian detention centres. I establish that health professionals were a significant group for both HREOC??s main findings and recommendations and a key group for the contextualisation of the human rights violations explored and exposed in the HREOC report. Informed by conflict analysis and peace studies theories I argue HREOC establish how the detention policy equals ??structural violence?? that caused ??direct violence??, which was justified and normalised because ??cultural violence??. I use discourse analysis to explore the discursive selections in the newspapers, and establish that the report received limited coverage and health professionals were omitted in the news while the political conflict was reported. This trivialised the report and health professionals?? role, which led to the naturalisation and normalisation of the violence. I finally reinforce these finding by exploring alternatives to the coverage using a peace journalism framework, which further clarifies the subjective nature of the discursive selection.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human Rights</field><field name="subject">Media Monitoring</field><field name="subject">Peace Journalism</field><field name="subject">Discourse Analysis</field><field name="subject">Detention Centres</field><field name="subject">Australian Newspapers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multidimensional requirements analysis for sustainable product development</field><field name="creator">Lu, Mei, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Product development is an essential component of a successful manufacturing business. As an interdisciplinary activity with several different actors, one of its aspects involves Product Environmental Performance considerations, and this is becoming an area where companies see opportunities for competition. In light of increasing pressures to adopt more sustainable approaches to product design and manufacture, the requirement to develop sustainable products is one of the key challenges facing manufacturing industry in the 21st century. Besides the Product Environmental Performance, there are three key requirements to be considered, which include Product Life Cycle Cost, Product Quality, and Product Lead Time. Product Life Cycle Cost and Product Quality are very traditional facets in decision-making in a design process. A product with low cost and high performance is always the objective in industry. For the last two decades, shortening the Product Lead Time to increase profits is another key requirement that has been adopted. Trade-offs among these four key requirements are necessary when choices have to be made between different alternatives. In this research, an integrated methodology is proposed to balance the environmental performance of a product against traditional design objectives, in the decision making process during the early design stage. Finally, a concept of product performance indicator was introduced to compare product design activities.  In order to achieve this, a weighting system has been developed to assess the total performance of competing design alternatives. Later, this weighting system is integrated into a fuzzy model in order to compensate for the fuzziness in the available data. Additionally, the method is used to rank five important product development features, which are Technology Level of the Product, Speed of Technical Development, Product Life Cycle, Price Competitiveness, and Environmental Awareness, assisted by the weighting system. Finally, a total product performance concept is proposed in order to allow the user to carry out trade-off analysis between different design alternatives. Two case studies, which are a car sunroof and a mobile phone, were used to test the validity of the produce performance methodology proposed in this research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41496</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A laboratory study of the 'shoreline' detected in video imagery</field><field name="creator">Howard, Elizabeth Helen, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A controlled laboratory experiment was undertaken to simulate varying swash zone characteristics and sensor-target geometry found in digital images collected by ARGUS coastal imaging systems.

More specifically, we investigate the performance of location-based spatial reuse built upon the identification of links in the network that form Collision-Free Sets (CFSs). We develop algorithms that efficiently find such CFSs. The main focus of this thesis is the application of our CFS-based algorithms to emerging WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) networks. However, we will also apply our CFS-based algorithms to smaller scale networks, as well as to the issue of QoS routing. This thesis makes several contributions. We first show how CFSs can be found within polynomial time in small scale wireless networks. We then probe how CFSs can be used to enhance network efficiency when location is available. We also explore how CFS determination is affected by location error, determining what level of location error renders the use of CFSs ineffective. In this context, we discuss the density of access points required to ensure CFS-based spatial reuse remains effective. We then focus on the use of CFSs in emerging multihop WiMAX networks, showing in detail how enhanced spatial reuse is delivered. The spatial reuse gains are probed both in the presence of realistic channel conditions and realistic location errors. Within the context of the IEEE 802.16 standard we show how CFSs can enhance, by factors of two, the VoIP capacity of multihop WiMAX networks. We also discuss how our CFS algorithms can be applied to other ongoing efforts aimed at improving VoIP capacity in WiMAX networks. Finally, an application of our CFS algorithms in the context of QoS routing is studied. Specifically, we develop a two-hop QoS routing protocol that guarantees QoS specifications by securing higher bandwidth for the chosen routes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">WiMAX</field><field name="subject">Spatial Reuse</field><field name="subject">STDMA</field><field name="subject">Spatial systems</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of endoplasmic reticulum stress in beta-cell lipoapoptosis</field><field name="creator">Preston, Amanda Miriam, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Beta-cell failure is a key step in the progression from metabolic disorder to overt type 2 diabetes (T2D). This failure is characterised by both secretory defects and loss of beta-cell mass, the latter most likely through increases in the rate of apoptosis. Although the mechanisms underlying these beta-cell defects are unclear, evidence suggests that chronic exposure of beta-cells to elevated fatty acid (FA) plays a role in disease development in genetically susceptible individuals. Furthermore, it has been postulated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signalling pathways (the unfolded protein response; UPR) play a role in FA-induced beta-cell dysfunction. The broad aim of this thesis was to explore the nature of these relationships.  Experiments detailed in this thesis demonstrate that MIN6 beta-cells mount a comprehensive ER stress response with exposure to elevated saturated fatty acid palmitate, but not the unsaturated fatty acid, oleate, within the low elevated physiological range. This response was time-dependent and involved both transcriptional and translational changes in UPR transducers and targets. The differential activation of ER stress in MIN6 beta-cells by saturated, but not unsaturated FA species may represent a mechanism of differential beta-cell death described in many studies with these FA. Furthermore, these experiments describe defects in ER to Golgi trafficking with chronic palmitate treatment, but not oleate or thapsigagin treatment, identifying this as a potential mechanism by which palmitate treatment induces ER stress. Moreover, these studies have shown the relevance to ER stress to a whole body model of T2D by demonstrating UPR activation in the islets of the db/db mouse. In conclusion, studies detailed in this thesis have demonstrated that ER stress occurs in in vitro and in vivo models of beta-cell lipotoxicity and apoptosis. In addition, these studies have identified defects in ER to Golgi trafficking as a mechanism by which palmitate treatment induces ER stress. These studies highlight the importance of ER stress in the development of T2D.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fatty acid</field><field name="subject">Endoplasmic reticulum stress</field><field name="subject">Type 2 diabetes</field><field name="subject">Pancreatic beta-cell</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Opioid dependence: associations with suicidal behaviour and other psychiatric comorbidity</field><field name="creator">Maloney, Elizabeth Ann, National Drug &amp; Alcohol Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Suicide attempts and opioid dependence are important clinical issues, as both are associated with a high degree of psychiatric morbidity and elevated risk of mortality. Research has identified a number of risk factors for suicide attempts among the general population, and to a lesser extent, among heroin users. Due to a lack of case-control studies, however, it is still not known to what extent opioid dependence per se is a risk factor for suicide attempts. This thesis comprised the first study to directly examine whether opioid dependence is a unique risk factor of suicide attempts. This thesis examined suicide attempts, associated risk factors, and related comorbidity among an opioid-dependent case group and a non-opioid-dependent control group. A structured interview was used to collect data from 726 opioid-dependent cases and 399 non-opioid-dependent controls. This thesis identified a number of important findings. Firstly, although opioid-dependent individuals were more likely to report lifetime suicide attempts compared to controls, the risk factors were largely the same for both groups. It appeared that opioid-dependent individuals were characterised by a higher likelihood of the same risk factors for suicide attempts, rather than having different risks. Cases appeared to be at increased risk of suicide attempts because of increased levels of multiple risk factors. Secondly, borderline personality disorder (BPD) and impulsivity were identified as important risk markers for suicidal behaviour, especially among opioid-dependent individuals. The study concluded that the treatment of BPD should be prioritised among this group. Third, self-mutilation was identified as a clinically significant problem in its own right, however, when combined with a history of attempted suicide, the psychological dysfunction observed was found to be very high. Fourth, non-fatal opioid overdose and suicide attempts were found to be distinct behaviours. The risk factors for each were completely different. While drug-related risks were associated with non-fatal overdose, the risk markers for suicide attempts were related to the presence of psychological disorders. This thesis has highlighted important areas of concern for clinical interventions as well as for future research to explore. Considering this is the first study of its kind, future research should focus on its replication.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comorbidity</field><field name="subject">Opioid dependence</field><field name="subject">Suicidal behaviour</field><field name="subject">Personality disorders</field><field name="subject">Opioid habit</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41455</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Screen and stencil print technologies for  industrial N-type silicon solar cells</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Matthew Bruce, ARC Centre of Excellence in Advanced Silicon Photovoltaics &amp; Photonics, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">To ensure that photovoltaics contributes significantly to future world energy production, the cost per watt of producing solar cells needs to be drastically reduced. The use of n-type silicon wafers in conjunction with industrial print technology has the potential to lower the cost per watt of solar cells. The use of n-type silicon is expected to allow the use of cheaper Cz substrates, without a corresponding loss in device efficiency. Printed metallisation is well utilised by the PV industry due to its low cost, yet there are few examples of its application to n-type solar cells. This thesis explores the use of n-type Cz silicon with printed metallisation and diffusion from printed sources in creating industrially applicable solar cell structures. 	The thesis begins with an overview of existing n-type solar cell structures, previous printed thick film metallisation research and previous research into printed dopant sources. A study of printed thick-film metallisation for n-type solar cells is then presented, which details the fabrication of boron doped p-type emitters followed by a survey of thick film Ag, Al, and Ag/Al inks for making contact to a p-emitter layer. Drawbacks of the various inks include high contact resistance, low metal conductivity or both. A cofire regime for front and rear contacts is established and an optimal emitter selected. A study of printed dopant pastes is presented, with an objective to achieve selective, heavily doped regions under metal contacts without significantly compromising minority carrier lifetime in solar cells. It is found that heavily doped regions are achievable with both boron and phosphorus, but that only phosphorus paste was capable of post-processing lifetime compatible with good efficiencies. The effect of belt furnace processing on n-type silicon wafers is explored, with large losses in implied voltage observed due to contamination of Si wafers from transition metals present in the belt furnace. Due to exposure to chromium in the belt furnace, no significant advantage in using n-type wafers instead of p-type is observed during the belt furnace processing step. Finally, working solar cells with efficiencies up to 16.1% are fabricated utilising knowledge acquired in the earlier chapters. The solar cells are characterised using several new photoluminescence techniques, including photoluminescence with current extraction to measure the quality of metal contacts. The work in this thesis indicates that n-type printed silicon solar cell technology shows potential for good performance at low cost.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">screen printing</field><field name="subject">n-type silicon</field><field name="subject">n-type solar cells</field><field name="subject">stencil printing</field><field name="subject">screen print dopant sources</field><field name="subject">photoluminescence</field><field name="subject">Silicon</field><field name="subject">Solar cells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling 802.11 networks for multimedia applications</field><field name="creator">Dao, Trong Nghia, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the development of new mathematical models for the IEEE 802.11??s access mechanisms, with a particular focus on DCF and EDCA. Accurate mathematical models for the DCF and EDCA access mechanisms provide many benefits, such as improved performance analysis, easier network capacity planning, and robust network design. A feature that permeates the work presented in this thesis is the application of our new models to network environments where both saturated and non-saturated traffic sources are present. The scenario in which multiple traffic sources are present is more technically challenging, but provides for a more realistic setting.  Our first contribution is the development of a new Markov model for non-saturated DCF in order to predict the network throughput. This model takes into account several details of the protocol that have been hitherto neglected. In addition, we apply a novel treatment of the packet service time within our model. We show how the inclusion of these effects provides more accurate predictions of network throughput than earlier works.  Our second contribution is the development of a new analytical model for EDCA, again in order to predict network throughput. Our new EDCA model is based on a replacement of the normal AIFS parameter of EDCA with a new parameter more closely associated with DCF. This novel procedure allows EDCA to be viewed as a modified multi-mode version of DCF.  Our third contribution is the simultaneous application of our new Markov models to both the non-saturated and the saturated regime. Hitherto, network throughput predictions for these regimes have required completely separate mathematical models. The convergence property of our model in the two regimes provides a new method to estimate the network capacity of the network.  Our fourth contribution relates to predictions for the multimedia capacity of 802.11 networks. Our multimedia capacity analysis, which is based on modifications to our Markov model, is new in that it can be applied to a broad range of quality of service requirements. Finally, we highlight the use of our analysis in the context of emerging location-enabled networks.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Modelling, Markov chain</field><field name="subject">802.11, CSMA/CA</field><field name="subject">Non-saturated traffic, Multimedia applications</field><field name="subject">IEEE 802.11 (Standard)</field><field name="subject">Multimedia systems</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and evaluation of the managerial benefits derived by small businesses as a result of complying with the Australian tax system</field><field name="creator">Lignier, Philip Andre, Cyberspace Law &amp; Policy Centre, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the managerial benefits derived by small business entities as a result of complying with their tax obligations. This is the first study on managerial benefits that considers all federal taxes in the Australian context.  While the managerial benefits of tax compliance were first identified by Sandford in the 1980s, there is only limited evidence to date about their perception by business taxpayers and no evidence at all about their actual occurrence. The work undertaken by Sandford together with the findings of empirical research on accounting in small businesses, provide the framework for the development of research hypotheses. With the purpose of testing these hypotheses, the research examines concurrently a sample of small businesses located in a regional area of Australia, and a sample of similar entities located in an external territory of Australia exempt from federal taxes and with minimal tax compliance obligations. The thesis adopts a mixed research method which combines a survey and a case study component from which a number of convergent results emerge.  Results show that bookkeeping requirements imposed by tax compliance compel small businesses to upgrade their accounting systems, typically in the form of computerisation. The increased sophistication of the accounting system following this upgrade allows small businesses to derive managerial benefits in the form of a better knowledge of their financial affairs. The study also demonstrates that when small businesses seek the assistance of an accountant to comply with their tax compliance obligations, managerial benefits may be derived in the form of informal business advice and other services that come as a spin-off from tax compliance work. The findings of the research also indicate that a majority of small businesses value positively the accounting information generated as a result of tax imposed record keeping requirements, however further studies are required to establish the extent to which the additional information has a positive effect on decision making.  Finally, the study identifies various possible approaches to quantify managerial benefits including a method based on the costs of alternative resources, and a valuation based on what owner-managers would be prepared to pay for the information.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Small business -- Accounting.</field><field name="subject">Tax compliance costs.</field><field name="subject">Tax compliance benefits.</field><field name="subject">Tax accounting -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Tax accounting -- Law and legislation -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Business enterprises -- Finance.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Algebraic aspects of integrability and reversibility in maps</field><field name="creator">Jogia, Danesh Michael, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">We study the cause of the signature over finite fields of integrability in two dimensional discrete dynamical systems by using theory from algebraic geometry. In particular the theory of elliptic curves is used to prove the major result of the thesis: that all birational maps that preserve an elliptic curve necessarily act on that elliptic curve as addition under the associated group law. Our result generalises special cases previously given in the literature. We apply this theorem to the specific cases when the ground fields are finite fields of prime order and the function field $mathbb{C}(t)$. In the former case, this yields an explanation of the aforementioned signature over finite fields of integrability. In the latter case we arrive at an analogue of the Arnol'd-Liouville theorem. Other results that are related to this approach to integrability are also proven and their consequences considered in examples. Of particular importance are two separate items: (i) we define a generalization of integrability called mixing and examine its relation to integrability; and (ii) we use the concept of rotation number to study differences and similarities between birational integrable maps that preserve the same foliation. The final chapter is given over to considering the existence of the signature of reversibility in higher (three and four) dimensional maps. A conjecture regarding the distribution of periodic orbits generated by such maps when considered over finite fields is given along with numerical evidence to support the conjecture.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">maps over finite fields</field><field name="subject">integrability</field><field name="subject">reversibility</field><field name="subject">algebraic dynamics</field><field name="subject">Geometry, Algebraic</field><field name="subject">Finite fields (Algebra)</field><field name="subject">Maps</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning and curriculum design in community health nurse education: a picture of a journey on the river Gambia</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Angela Jane, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Thirty years after the concept of primary health care (PHC) was declared the path to health for all, a crisis continues in human resources for health in Africa. This involves the low prioritisation of education and training for primary health care personnel (PHCP) which is crucial to effective practice in severely under-resourced settings. The curriculum required for this education, involving pictures and textual materials, must meet the needs and capacities of the learners so that learning transfer can occur and community health needs are met. This research set out to establish the basis upon which text and pictures should be incorporated into curriculum to address the requirements of community health nurses (CHNs) in The Gambia. A pragmatic, three phased, mixed methodological design was selected for this study. Curricula for African PHCP were first collected and examined using content analysis to determine the rationale for pictures and text. The second phase employed psychometric testing and statistical analysis to establish if learning style preferences for pictures and text were important in Gambian CHN learning. In the final phase, interviews with CHN students explored their preferences for pictures and text and how these preferences should be accommodated in curriculum.  The research found that much of the PHCP curriculum analysed was generic, used traditional didactic approaches and focused on written knowledge-based assessment. Learning style preferences were not found to be a consideration and were unidentifiable in this context. Socio-cultural factors significantly impacted upon student CHN learning, but were not adequately addressed in the curriculum materials examined. In addition, CHNs preferred practical learning through primary, multi-sensory experiences.  These findings support the conclusion that the localisation of CHN curriculum is required in order to provide a socio-cultural context for learning that is meaningful, rich, interactive and responsive to learner needs. This demands a reconnection with PHC principles of equity and participation which should underpin this curriculum. The thesis argues that an ecological framework better articulates the link between PHCP education and training, practice, and community needs, and should serve to guide curriculum design. Six strategies are identified that could be extended to African PHCP course design.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Primary health care</field><field name="subject">Nurse education</field><field name="subject">Africa</field><field name="subject">Community health nursing -- Gambia</field><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A vision prosthesis neurostimulator: progress towards the realisation of a neural prosthesis for the blind</field><field name="creator">Dommel, Norbert Brian, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Restoring vision to the blind has been an objective of several research teams for a number of years. It is known that spots of light -- phosphenes -- can be elicited by way of electrical stimulation of surviving retinal neurons. Beyond this, however, our understanding of prosthetic vision remains rudimentary.  To advance the realisation of a clinically viable prosthesis for the blind, a versatile integrated circuit neurostimulator was designed, manufactured, and verified. The neurostimulator provides electrical stimuli to surviving neurons in the visual pathway, affording blind patients some form of patterned vision; besides other benefits (independence), this limited vision would let patients distinguish between day and night (resetting their circadian rhythm).  This thesis presents the development of the neurostimulator, an interdisciplinary work bridging engineering and medicine. Features of the neurostimulator include: high-voltage CMOS transistors in key circuits, to prevent voltage compliance issues due to an unknown or changing combined tissue and electrode/tissue interface impedance; simultaneous stimulation using current sources and sinks, with return electrodes configured to provide maximum charge containment at each stimulation site; stimuli delivered to a two dimensional mosaic of hexagonally packed electrodes, multiplexing current sources and sinks to allow each electrode in the whole mosaic to become a stimulation site; electrode shorting to remove excess charge accumulated during each stimulation phase.  Detailed electrical testing and characterisation verified that the neurostimulator performed as specified, and comparable to, or better than, other vision prostheses neurostimulators. In addition, results from several animal experiments verified that the neurostimulator can elicit electrically evoked visual responses. The features of the neurostimulator enable research into how simultaneous electrical stimulation affects the visual neural pathways; those research results could impact other neural prosthetics research and devices.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neural prosthesis</field><field name="subject">vision prosthesis</field><field name="subject">neurostimulator</field><field name="subject">retinal prosthesis</field><field name="subject">ASIC</field><field name="subject">CMOS</field><field name="subject">Blind</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Because I love playing my instrument : Young musicians' internalised motivation and self-regulated practising behaviour</field><field name="creator">Renwick, James Michael, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Self-regulated learning theory explains how it is not only the amount of time musicians spend practising that affects achievement, but also the nature of the strategies employed. Because practice is self-directed, motivational effects on its efficiency are especially salient. One construct that has received little attention in relation to practising is self-determination theory, which interprets motivation as lying along a continuum of perceived autonomy. This mixed-methods study investigated links between motivational beliefs and self-regulated practising behaviour through a two-phase design. In Phase One, 677 music examination candidates aged 8-19 completed a questionnaire consisting of items addressing practising behaviour and perceived musical competence; in addition, the Self-Regulation Questionnaire (SRQ; Ryan &amp; Connell, 1989) was adapted to explore intrinsic-extrinsic motives for learning an instrument. Factor analysis of the SRQ revealed five dimensions with partial correspondence to earlier research: internal, external, social, shame-related, and exam-related motives. Three practice behaviour factors consistent with self-regulated learning theory emerged: effort management, monitoring, and strategy use. Results of structural equation modelling showed that internal motivation accounted best for variance in these three types of practising behaviour, with a small added effect from competence beliefs and exam-related motivation. Phase Two consisted of observational case studies of four of the questionnaire participants preparing for their subsequent annual examination. Adolescent, intermediate-level musicians were recorded while practising at home; immediately afterwards, they watched the videotape and verbalised any recollected thoughts. The procedure concluded with a semi-structured interview and debriefing. The videotapes were analysed with The Observer Video-Pro and combined with verbal data; emerging themes were then compared with issues arising from the interviews. The observational aspect of the case studies largely confirmed the importance of three cyclical self-regulatory processes emerging from Phase One: (a) effort management and motivational self-regulation, (b) the role of self-monitoring of accuracy, and (c) the use of corrective strategies, such as structured repetition, task simplification, and vocalisation. The mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods used in the study has uncovered a rich body of information that begins to clarify the complex motivational and behavioural nature of young people practising a musical instrument.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Self-regulated learning theory</field><field name="subject">Music education</field><field name="subject">Achievement motivation</field><field name="subject">Self-determination theory</field><field name="subject">Musicians</field><field name="subject">Motivation in education</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations on beta 2-glycoprotein I and antiphospholipid antibodies</field><field name="creator">Giannakopoulos, Bill, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">An outline of the work contained in this thesis is presented. The first chapter is a critical review of the literature pertaining to the pathophysiological mechanisms operational with regards to the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The syndrome is characterised by venous and arterial thrombosis, and recurrent fetal loss, in association with the persistent presence of antibodies targeting the main autoantigen beta 2-glycoprotein I (&#946;2GPI). The second chapter reviews the literature delineating the diverse physiological functions of &#946;2GPI, and then relates them to its role in our current understanding of the pathophysiology of APS. The third chapter presents a critical review of the evidence base for the diagnosis and management of APS. The fourth chapter describes the interaction between &#946;2GPI and the glycoprotein Ib alpha (GPIb&#945;) subunit of the platelet receptor GPIb-IX-V. GPIb&#945; is an important platelet adhesion receptor, which mediates multiple additional functions on the platelet surface, including binding coagulation factor XI (FXI). The implication of the interaction between &#946;2GPI and GPIb&#945; on platelet activation and the release of thromboxane in the presence of anti-&#946;2GPI antibodies is explored, as well as the intracellular pathways via which this activation occurs. The relevance of these findings to understanding APS pathogenesis, in particular thrombosis, is discussed. The fifth chapter delineates the interaction between the fifth domain of &#946;2GPI and FXI and its activated form factor XIa (FXIa). The ability of FXIa to cleave &#946;2GPI between lysine (Lys) 317 and threonine (Thr) 318, and modulate its function is reported.   The sixth chapter describes the ability of &#946;2GPI to inhibit FXIa autoproteolytic hydrolysis at the specific FXIa residues arginine (Arg) 507, Arg532 and Lys539. This interaction with &#946;2GPI stabilizes FXIa activity over time, and leads to enhanced FXIa mediated fibrin formation. This is a novel physiological function of &#946;2GPI with important implications. Recent epidemiological studies by others have emphasized the critical role of FXIa in pathological thrombus propagation. The seventh chapter defines the relevance of the FXIa residues Arg507, Arg532 and Lys539 to FXIa mediated inactivation by the main FXIa inhibitor Protease Nexin 2 (PN2), and by Antithrombin III (ATIII).

This thesis is based upon ethnography and interviews with riders and riders' parents at a Riding for the Disabled Centre in Sydney, Australia. It explores the perceptions and experiences of riders and also analyses the role of parents in influencing their child's experience of the RDA. It examines parents' experiences of the RDA and the impact that it has had on them and their family. This thesis is premised on three research questions. The three questions are; 'how do riders perceive and experience the RDA and how and why do these perceptions differ?', 'how do parents perceive the RDA and its impact on their child with an impairment' and 'how do parents perceive the RDA's impact on their family and themselves?'  The study draws on a feminist framework and utilises the work of feminist theorists working in Disability Studies to 'broaden' the social model of disability. This framework facilitates the exploration of personal experiences of riding as it privileges the voice of the participants and also acknowledges the diversity of RDA experiences that exist amongst them. It also allows room for the physical, bodily experience of riding to be investigated. Furthermore, this research responds to Shakespeare's (2006) call for further research on the 'social relations of disability' - it investigates the relationships between volunteers who do not have an impairment, and the riders who have an impairment. The central argument that emerges is that Riding for the Disabled is a unique individual experience that holds varied meanings for riders. For some Riding for the Disabled is a central feature of their lives and has altered their world. For others, it is one activity among many and its impact is limited. The type of impairment an individual rider had was often a key determinant of how they experienced the RDA. For parents of riders the RDA exposes them to parents with similar experiences and enables practical knowledge and information to be exchanged.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Riding for the disabled.</field><field name="subject">Disability studies.</field><field name="subject">Coaching (Transportation)</field><field name="subject">Horsemanship.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experiential features of intrusive memories in depression and the role of cognitive avoidance in intrusion maintenance</field><field name="creator">Williams, Alishia , Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Although recent research has demonstrated that intrusive memories of negative autobiographical events are an overlapping cognitive feature of depression and PTSD, there is still a general paucity of research investigating the prevalence and maintenance of these memories in depression. Accordingly, the current thesis represented a much-needed program of empirically-driven research that delineated the cognitive processes that underpin the manifestation, experience, and persistence of intrusive memories in depression. Firstly, Study 1 used descriptive and correlational methodologies to outline the content and features of these memories, and explored whether intrusion characteristics linked to intrusive memories in PTSD are also features of intrusive memories in depression. In accord with studies in PTSD samples, sensory features accounted for unique variance in the prediction of depression severity, over and above that accounted for by intrusion frequency. This commonality raised the possibility that cognitive management strategies linked to the persistence of intrusive memories in PTSD may also play a role in depression. Accordingly, Study 2 utilized a cross-sectional and prospective design to investigate whether negative appraisals and cognitive avoidance strategies, which are key to the persistence of intrusive memories in PTSD, similarly play a role in depression. The results demonstrated that assigning negative appraisals to one???s intrusive memory, and attempts to control the memory, were positively associated with intrusion-related distress, level of depression, and cognitive avoidance mechanisms. Additionally, negative appraisals and the use of cognitive mechanisms were predictive of depression concurrently, but not prospectively. Studies 3, 4, and 5 further investigated avoidant intrusion- response strategies by assessing the role of recall vantage perspective in mediating the effects of intrusion-related distress. Study 3 found that although field memories were not experienced as more distressing than observer memories, the results supported an association between an observer vantage perspective and cognitive avoidance mechanisms. As this study employed a correlational design, Study 4 addressed the question of directionality by experimentally manipulating mode of recall to ascertain whether shifting participants into a converse perspective would have differential effects on the reported experience of their intrusive memory. Results indicated that shifting participants from a field to an observer perspective resulted in decreased experiential ratings; specifically, reduced distress and vividness and increased detachment and observation. Also, as anticipated, the converse shift in perspective (from observer to field) did not lead to a corresponding increase in experiential ratings, but resulted in reduced ratings of observation. Study 5 attempted to investigate the stability of this memory orientation phenomenon by investigating mode of recall vantage perspective prospectively. Attrition of participants across the 12-month study limited analyses to the descriptive level, but illustrated that, at least for some individuals, recall vantage perspective remained stable across assessments periods. Collectively, the findings supported the notion that recall perspective has a functional role in the regulation of intrusion-related distress and represents a cognitive avoidance mechanism. Studies 6 and 7 employed experimental methodologies to investigate whether adopting an abstract/analytical mode of processing following a negative event would result in poor emotional processing, or increased distress associated with intrusive memories. Study 6 found no differences in either intrusion frequency or associated levels of distress across the processing conditions, as hypothesized. The results of Study 6 suggested that the predicted effects of ruminative self-focus on intrusion severity may be dependent upon the self-referential nature of the material being processed. Results of Study 7 indicated that inducing an analytical ruminative mode of processing resulted in participants rating their naturally occurring, self-referential intrusive memories as more negative, more distressing, and evoking a more negative emotional response compared to inducing distraction. Taken together, Studies 6 and 7 suggest the possibility that depressed individuals may get caught up in a ruminative cycle that, due to the documented effects of analytical self-focus, may exacerbate the emotional response elicited by the intrusions and perpetuate biased attentional focus towards them. Finally, Studies 8 and 9 explored suppression as a cognitive avoidance mechanism and addressed some methodological concerns regarding the measurement of this construct. Study 8 investigated the effects of repeated suppression using a method to index the frequency, duration, and associated levels of distress of an experimentally-induced intrusive memory, and assessed whether any observed effects were differentially linked to depressive symptomatology. Results supported a secondary rebound effect in those participants who were most successful at suppressing target intrusions. Study 9 was an investigation of the English version of the TCAQ (Luciano, Algarabel, Tom??s, &amp; Mart??nez, 2005), an index of cognitive control. Study 9 evaluated the association between this measure and performance on a thought suppression task. The results indicated that low TCAQ-20 scorers experienced intrusions of a longer duration and rated these intrusions as more distressing than high TCAQ-20 scorers, supporting the validity of the measure. These findings highlight the role of suppression as a maladaptive mental control strategy and the potential for elevated intrusion-distress to perpetuate its use. Together, the findings of this program of research confirm the importance of intrusive memories in depression, and underscore the need for an empirically-supported model to account for the occurrence and maintenance of these memories.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognitive avoidance</field><field name="subject">Intrusive memories</field><field name="subject">Depression</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/36794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Downstream targets of the oestrogen receptor and endocrine resistance</field><field name="creator">McNeil, Catriona Mairi, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The transcription factor c-Myc is an early downstream target of oestrogen action in breast cancer cells in culture and it has been speculated that aberrant c-Myc expression may mediate antioestrogen resistance. However, studies of c-Myc protein expression as either a prognostic or predictive marker in human breast cancer have been limited and contradictory, as have been studies of c-Myc expression during breast cancer evolution. In order to assess the relationship between c-Myc protein expression and outcome from breast cancer, a representative cohort of 292 women with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and linked clinicopathological data was assembled and tissue microarrays (TMA) generated from the archived breast cancer specimens. Detailed assessments of the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, p21WAF1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 were also conducted and analysed in relation to c-Myc expression using immunohistochemistry. Changes in c-Myc protein expression in a TMA model of breast cancer evolution were also conducted. Finally the cell-cycle effects of low-level constitutive c-Myc expression and high-level inducible c-Myc expression were evaluated in MCF-7 cells in vitro. Key novel results obtained were that c-Myc protein expression changed from preferentially nuclear to preferentially cytoplasmic during the evolution of breast cancer. In women with early invasive breast carcinoma, a "high-risk" cytoplasmic predominant c-Myc expression pattern was defined (~13% of cases) that independently predicted for poor outcome generally, among ER positive cases and in ER postive cases treated with endocrine therapy. In vitro studies confirmed that c-Myc overexpression was associated with resistance to the anti-proliferative effects of anti-oestrogens with persistence of both cyclin D1-cdk4 and cyclin E-cdk2 activities in the face of anti-oestrogen treatment. Further novel findings were that high cyclin D1 expression (upper 10% of expressors) was an independent predictor of poor outcome among ER positive breast cancer cases. Amongst ER + PR positive cases, both "high-risk" c-Myc expression and high level cyclin D1 expression were independent predictors of poor outcome. In summary, these data indicate that aberrant expression of the cell cycle proteins c-Myc and cyclin D1 may result in poor breast cancer outcomes in hormone receptor positive breast cancer and reinforces the importance of the cell cycle as a potential site of therapeutic manipulation in endocrine-resistant breast cancer.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer.</field><field name="subject">C-Myc.</field><field name="subject">Endocrine resistance.</field><field name="subject">Cell cycle.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate governance: issues related to executive compensation, corporate boards and institutional investor monitoring</field><field name="creator">Smith, Gavin Stuart, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation contains five research projects within the context of two distinctive issues that concern the effectiveness of executive compensation in aligning executive interests with shareholders and how institutional investors play a role in structuring corporate governance mechanisms. The objective of this dissertation is to first determine how institutions should exert their influence if they are serious about alleviating agency problems and improving firm performance. Second, the thesis seeks to determine whether institutional investors use their influence to shape executive compensation and corporate governance mechanisms in a manner consistent with aligning managerial interests with shareholders and increasing shareholder wealth. The thesis finds that CEOs with option incentives increase the likelihood that a firm will increase risk by undertaking both major real investments and acquisitions. Moreover, CEO option grants are positively related to measures of firm valuation and operating performance suggesting option incentives are an important mechanism to align CEO interests with shareholders. This is robust to alternative measures of firm valuation and operating performance, also various estimation techniques. Using these findings to motivate the direction of institutional influence on executive compensation, it is found that institutional investors, particularly smaller activist traders, significantly increase option grant incentives received by executives. Institutional influence also raises CEO pay which is consistent with preservation of reservation CEO utility levels. Addressing the role of institutional investors in the context of other corporate governance mechanisms, it is found that institutional investor influence is also negatively related to board size and positively related to board independence, which is achieved by removal of inside directors. Such actions are consistent with empirical studies that show smaller boards and increased levels of independent directors improve firm performance and board decision making.  The main conclusion from this dissertation is that option incentives are an effective mechanism to align CEO interests with those of shareholders. Institutional investors appear to recognise this importance, and effectively use their influence to increase options received by executives. Combined with institutional investors putting in place corporate boards that provide better oversight of management, institutional investors appear to be effective monitors of the firms in which they invest.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Institutional Investors</field><field name="subject">Corporate Governance</field><field name="subject">Executive Compensation</field><field name="subject">Compensation management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40820</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Increasing the ability of antibiotics to control S. aureus keratitis</field><field name="creator">Schubert, Tracey Lee, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Microbial keratitis is a major cause of avoidable visual impairment worldwide with S. aureus a leading cause of this disease in humans. Recently S. aureus isolated from eye infections have exhibited resistance to many antibiotics with those isolates from more severe infections exhibiting higher rates of antibiotic resistance. New therapies are therefore needed to ensure adequate treatment for these infections. In microbial keratitis the hosts' immune response is responsible for significant disease pathology so development of a therapy which also targets the immune response would be beneficial. The fimbrolides produced by Delisea pulchra are potential candidates as they are both growth inhibitory and immunomodulatory in vitro. The antibiotic susceptibility of clinical S. aureus isolates from ocular infections was determined using the CDS method and similarity of these isolates determined by PFGE and PCR-ribotyping. In addition the effect of fimbrolides on bacterial growth alone or in combination with antibiotics and the immune response to bacterial stimulation in PMNs and HCE cells was determined. Fimbrolides were then topically applied to S. aureus corneal infections and the effect of these compounds on disease progression determined by assessing corneal pathology, bacterial numbers and PMNs recovered from infected corneas. A larger proportion of keratitis isolates exhibited resistance to antibiotics than conjunctivitis isolates. Keratitis isolates were also related within a geographical region. The fimbrolides inhibited bacterial growth and modulated the immune response to bacterial stimulation in vitro. These compounds also exhibited synergy with conventional antimicrobials. In combination with ciprofloxacin the fimbrolides reduced the clinical score and numbers of bacteria recovered from ciprofloxacin-resistant or ciprofloxacin-sensitive S. aureus corneal infections.  This thesis has identified that S. aureus isolates which produce the worst disease pathology in the eye are related and also exhibit higher rates of resistance to antibiotics indicating novel therapies to treat these infections are needed. This thesis demonstrated that fimbrolides inhibit S. aureus growth, exhibit synergy with antibiotics and modulate the immune response in vitro. In combination with ciprofloxacin the fimbrolides also improved disease pathology in keratitis, illustrating the potential of fimbrolides to be used as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of S. aureus keratitis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antibiotics.</field><field name="subject">Keratitis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quinolinic acid and its effect on the astrocyte with relevance to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer??s disease</field><field name="creator">Ting, Ka Ka, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">There is evidence that the excitotoxin quinolinic acid (QUIN) synthesized through the kynurenine pathway (KP) by activated microglia may play a role in the pathogenesis of several major neuroinflammatory diseases and more particularly in Alzheimer??s disease (AD). The hypothesis of this project is QUIN affects the function and morphology of astrocytes. In this study I used human foetal astrocytes stimulated with AD associated cytokines including IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, TGF-alpha and different concentrations of QUIN ranging from low physiological to high excitotoxic concentrations. I found that QUIN induces IL-1beta expression in human astrocytes and subsequently, contribute to the inflammatory cascade that is present in AD pathology. Glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) and vimentin protein expression were complementary in expression to each other after 24 hr stimulation with different QUIN doses. However, there were marked increases in GFAP levels and reduction in vimentin levels compared to controls with QUIN treatment indicating that QUIN can trigger astrogliosis in human astrocytes. Glutamine synthetase (GS) activity was used as a functional metabolic test for astrocytes and I found a dose-dependent inhibition of GS activity by QUIN. This inhibition was inversely correlated with iNOS expression whereby reduced GS activity is accompanied with an increase expression of iNOS in human astrocytes. These results suggest that reduction in GS activity can lead to accumulation of extracellular glutamate then leading to exacerbated excitotoxicity via NMDA receptor over-activation and ultimately neuronal death. PCR array results showed that at least four different pathways were activated with pathological concentration of QUIN including p38 MAPK that is associated with pro-inflammatory cytokine production, ERK/MAPK growth and differentiation that can modulate structural proteins, mitochondrial-induced apoptotic cascade and cell cycle control pathway. QUIN-induced astrogliosis and excitotoxicity could lead to glial scar formation and prevention of axonal growth thus exacerbation of neurodegeneration via synaptosomal NMDA receptor over-activation. All together, this study showed that, in the context of AD, QUIN is an important factor for astroglial activation, dysregulation and death, which can be mediated by the previously mentioned pathways.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Astrocytes</field><field name="subject">Quinolinic acid</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="subject">Excitotoxicity</field><field name="subject">Inflammation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41288</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of Human Papillomavirus promoters to target Cervical Cancer cells</field><field name="creator">Lung, Mandy Siu Yu, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common causes of sexually transmitted disease worldwide. Infections by high-risk HPVs, such as HPV-18, have been associated etiologically with cervical cancer. The successful development of HPV vaccines may be beneficial to the HPV-na??ve population, but women that have already been exposed to the virus are still at risk of developing HPV-associated malignancies. A need for a systemic cure for HPV-infection therefore still exists. Gene therapies using tissue-specific promoters have been reported to be a promising tool for treating cancers; however, few studies have explored this possibility for cervical cancer.	The aim of this project is to construct a gene expression vector that can specifically target HPV-infected cervical cancer cells, by making use of the activity and selectivity of the P105 promoter which is determined by transcription control elements within the HPV-18 long control region (LCR). The first part of this study involved the construction of LCR deletion plasmids, and examining the subsequent level of gene expression induced within different mammalian cell lines. The results suggest the LCR to be capable in achieving cervical cancer-specific gene expression. The 3&#8242;-end of the viral L1 gene upstream of the LCR appeared to have a repressive effect on the promoter and therefore should be excluded for maximum LCR promoter activity. The second part of the project involved site-directed mutagenesis studies performed on selected transcription factor binding sites with an attempt to further increase the level of LCR promoter activity and specificity towards HPV-infected cervical cancer cells. The results suggest that a GRE/YY1 mutation may significantly enhance promoter activity. In terms of promoter regulation, the E2BSs appeared to be responsible for promoter activation in the absence of viral E2 proteins.  	The findings of this study suggest a possible gene therapy approach towards the treatment of cervical cancer. By making use of the activity and specificity of the HPV-18 P105 promoter to induce cervical carcinoma-specific expression of appropriate therapeutic genes, suicidal phenotypes can be introduced selectively within HPV-positive cervical cancer cells while normal HPV-negative cells are unaffected.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gene therapy</field><field name="subject">Human Papillomavirus</field><field name="subject">HPV-18 LCR</field><field name="subject">Cervical Cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the audience in product placement: development of an audience engrossment scale</field><field name="creator">Scott, Jane Margaret, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Product placement is now a US$7.76 billion industry, flourishing as advertisers attempt to combat audience sophistication, zipping, zapping, muting of commercials, TiVo, media multi-tasking, the Internet and digital television, all of which may signal the death knell of the interruptive commercial model. Yet whilst research on product placement is growing, it has not kept pace with the practice, and many findings do not converge across studies. This is likely the case because parameters remain undefined and there is no operational framework to describe how product placements are processed, and no agreement as to what effects are possible or how they should be examined. Most effects-based research has focussed on executional factors and what the product placement does to the audience member. This assumes that the recipient is a passive participant. However this thesis argues that the audience member is actually an active processor who should be the focus of research.  This research distinguishes product placement from related activities and develops a new conceptual model of product placement processing. It puts a strong focus on the role of the audience member, stating that their level of familiarity of the placed brands, and their level of engrossment with the entertainment story will impact their recognition of product placements in that story. Applying Rasch Measurement Theory, an Audience Engrossment scale is developed and refined over four stages of data collection, with 1360 respondents across seven films, to capture the quality of people??s interaction with a film.  The result is a scale comprising 19 feeling items, 10 arousal items, 6 appraisal items and 7 cognitive effort items. The scale was then tested as part of the conceptual model, with 191 participants watching The Island and completing questionnaires after the film relating to their recognition of brands within the film and their level of engrossment. Brand familiarity information was collected four weeks earlier. Onset prominence, high plot connection, dual modality and use by star were found to have the strongest direct effects on recognition, with brand familiarity and the four audience engrossment dimensions generally found to interact with the product placement characteristics as hypothesised.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brandcasting</field><field name="subject">product placement</field><field name="subject">audience engrossment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of energy flow through coupled plate structures</field><field name="creator">Skeen, Michael Berling, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This PhD thesis presents research aims to improving the dynamic modelling of coupled plate structures across a wide frequency range by using analytical, statistical and experimental methods. The analytical waveguide method is used to model the flexural displacement of coupled plate structures which are simply supported along two parallel edges. A method of quickly predicting the average energy level in a plate from details of the waveguide model is described, and used for comparison with SEA models. The Poynting and Impedance methods of predicting the energy flow in coupled plate structures are investigated. Transmission coefficients for coupled plate structures are evaluated using the analytical waveguide method for both semi-infinite and finite coupled plate structures. Finite transmission coefficients have traditionally been more difficult to evaluate due to the presence of a reverberant field, but in this work a novel method of separating the reverberant field using a scattering matrix method is presented. The transmission coefficients for semi-infinite and finite structures are then compared for L-shaped plates. A modal transmission coefficient is also defined and for the cases considered, and is used to develop an alternative method of deriving the transmission coefficient in a finite structure. Frequency averaged transmission coefficients are also considered, and the transmission coefficients derived for finite and semi-infinite structures are found to be very similar after frequency averaging.  Statistical Energy Analysis models of coupled plates are evaluated using transmission coefficients derived from waveguide models. The results of the SEA models are compared to those predicted by the analytical waveguide method. A modal transmission coefficient based SEA model is also investigated. In an attempt to validate the numerical work presented in this thesis, experiments have been conducted. Using a wave extraction technique, both the wave amplitudes and plate properties have been evaluated from experimental data, and are subsequently used to experimentally measure the transmission coefficient for two plates coupled at different angles.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plates (Engineering)</field><field name="subject">Vibration</field><field name="subject">Transmission</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Finite element method</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living in public space: a human rights wasteland?</field><field name="creator">Goldie, Cassandra Mary-Ellen, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the extent to which human rights law may be used to challenge the forced eviction of people who live in public space under public space laws.  The specific case study is the operation of Darwin City Council By-law 103, which bans camping, or adults sleeping in a public place between sunset and sunrise.  The by-law is used to criminalise or forcibly evict people who live in public space in Darwin in the Northern Territory.  Darwin has the highest proportionate number of homeless people of any capital city in Australia.  Indigenous people are significantly over-represented.  The thesis charts recent legislative changes across Australia to demonstrate that public space laws, such as Darwin City Council By-law 103, continue to be popular public policy responses to law and order concerns.  This legal regulation is being undertaken without ensuring compliance with international human rights standards.  There has been a marked increase in Australia of the use of available domestic and international human rights tools to raise concerns about the enforcement of these laws against people living in public space.  Through a review of secondary sources, the thesis establishes that some 15 human rights have been identified as potentially engaged by such enforcement but Australian jurisprudence has yet to emerge.  The thesis selects the human right to privacy, family and home for detailed analysis.  It interrogates available evidence from Darwin, international and comparative jurisprudence and secondary sources to determine whether the forced eviction of people living in public space under Darwin City Council By-law 103 may be found to violate the right to respect for privacy, family and home in a particular case.  The study aims to make a specific contribution to growing endeavours to promote the human rights of people who are homeless, including people who live in public space. Its detailed analysis is designed to support a human rights litigation strategy at both domestic and international level, in order to challenge the extent to which people living in public space are subjected to criminalisation and forced eviction when they have nowhere else to live.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public space</field><field name="subject">human rights</field><field name="subject">homelessness</field><field name="subject">long grasser</field><field name="subject">right to privacy, family and home</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal</field><field name="subject">Darwin</field><field name="subject">Northern Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formal memory models for verifying C systems code</field><field name="creator">Tuch, Harvey, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Systems code is almost universally written in the C programming language or a variant. C has a very low level of type and memory abstraction and formal reasoning about C systems code requires a memory model that is able to capture the semantics of C pointers and types. At the same time, proof-based verification demands abstraction, in particular from the aliasing and frame problems.  In this thesis, we study the mechanisation of a series of models, from semantic to separation logic, for achieving this abstraction when performing interactive theorem-prover based verification of C systems code in higher- order logic. We do not commit common oversimplifications, but correctly deal with C's model of programming language values and the heap, while developing the ability to reason abstractly and efficiently. We validate our work by demonstrating that the models are applicable to real, security- and safety-critical code by formally verifying the memory allocator of the L4 microkernel.

Key areas of investigation include the impact of regulatory reforms on bank performance, the impact of firm entry and exit on industry productivity and the changing nature of banking and the role of risk in measuring bank value-added. The latter leads to the construction of a new bank production model, emphasising risk management as part of a bank??s value-added. As such, the proposed bank output framework views risk as a productive service, rather than a bad output or externality, which is often assumed in the literature. Aided with this new framework, several refinements are suggested for the treatment and measurement of bank output by researchers and statistical agencies. A unified regulatory framework combined with a greater level of harmonisation in rules in the Australian banking sector, has meant that a pooled analysis of all deposit-taking institutions has become feasible for the first time. With an enlarged dataset new insights are gained into the relative performance of deposit-taking institutions in Australia. The results challenge commonly held views of bank efficiency and the relevance of scale, size and incumbency when measuring bank efficiency. The new definition of bank output is also applied across the sector using econometric and non-parametric techniques to gauge productivity. Problems with balanced data sets and aggregation of firm level productivity are examined. A new approach to decomposing aggregate industry level productivity is introduced based on strong axiomatic grounds and its ability to attribute productivity between continuing, exiting and entering firms. The technique is applied for the first time and uses the newly developed bank output production model. The analysis provides key information on the relative performance of firms in the Australian banking sector.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Productivity</field><field name="subject">Banking</field><field name="subject">Efficiency</field><field name="subject">Risk</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41462</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of Escherichia coli GTPase Der reveals previously unknown regulation by RNA</field><field name="creator">Aung-Htut, May Thandar, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">GTPases are found in all domains of life and are highly conserved. In eukaryotes, they serve as signalling molecules for many cellular processes. However, the prokaryotic GTPases play a very different role and are found to be associated with ribosome function. Among the 11 conserved GTPases, Der is the most interesting in prokaryotes. It possesses a unique structure with two GTPase domains (G-Domains) tethered by a variable length acidic linker and a carboxyl terminal KH-like domain. The exact function of Der is still under investigation and most of the data suggest that it is important for 50S ribosomal assembly or stability. In order to investigate the function of Escherichia coli Der (Ec-Der), expression plasmids for wild-type and mutated proteins were created and the proteins were successfully expressed. The expression of the mutant protein that lacked G-Domain 1 was toxic to the cells and it was found that some large ribosomal proteins were missing from the ribosomes of these cells. In addition, other macromolecular complexes such as the GroEL/GroES chaperonin appeared not to be assembled under these conditions. The activities of both wild-type and mutated proteins were also tested and found to be dependent on potassium ions (K+), which enhanced nucleotide binding. Additionally, intra-molecular control over nucleotide binding and release was also observed for Ec-Der. The in vitro selection of RNA aptamers with nanomolar affinity for Ec-Der produced aptamers that contained short variable sequences. These aptamers affected the growth of the E. coli cells and caused a change in cellular morphology that had been noted previously during Ec-Der over-expression. Ec-Der showed high affinity (nM) to both selected RNA and the unselected RNA library. The activity of Ec-Der and Era was inhibited in the presence of any sequence of RNA that has the length of greater than 16 nucleotides. RNA was also cross-linked to Ec-Der in the presence of GTP, but not GDP, suggesting that RNA was a regulator of the Ec-Der GTPase cycle. Based on these results, it is speculated that Ec-Der might be involved in more than one function. It may be acting at the level of the membrane (based on cellular morphology reported here and by Hwang and Inouye 2001) and may also take part in processes related to ribosome function. Regulation of protein activity by RNA length has not been predicted or described and this may represent a novel mean of regulation of the Era subfamily of GTPases.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">control by RNA</field><field name="subject">GTPase</field><field name="subject">Nucleotides binding/release</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the xanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase of helicobacter pylori as a potential therapeutic target</field><field name="creator">Duckworth, Megan Jane, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Helicobacter pylori infects more than half of the global population and causes gastric disorders. The increasing development of antibiotic resistance by the bacterium continues to limit treatment options. The identification and characterisation of novel therapeutic targets are necessary for successful future treatment of the infection.  One potential target for therapeutic intervention is the gpt gene encoded by hp0735 (jhp0672) in H. pylori strain 26695 (J99). This gene produces a putative xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (XGPRTase), an enzyme of the purine salvage synthesis pathway. This project employed theoretical, molecular and biochemical approaches to investigate features of H. pylori gpt and XGPRTase that will serve to ascertain their therapeutic potential.  The production of a functional XGPRTase by H. pylori was investigated in cell-free extracts, and the kinetic parameters of this activity were compared to those of purified rXGPRTase enzyme. The three 6-oxopurine substrates were recognised by rXGPRTase and allosteric kinetics were observed for some substrates of the enzyme in cell-free extracts and for purified enzyme. These observations indicate complex regulation and an influence of cellular interactions on activity.  Bioinformatics were employed to analyse XGPRTase phylogeny, and threading techniques used to build a structural model of XGPRTase. The enzyme is significantly divergent from the equivalent mammalian enzyme, and modelling identified specific features of the enzyme.  Molecular approaches were utilised to analyse the essential role of gpt in H. pylori survival. These included insertional inactivation of the gpt in wild-type H. pylori strains and in mutants possessing a complementing copy of the gene present at the rdxA locus. No mutants were recovered with inactivated gpt possibly as a result of pleiotropic effects. Plasmid-mediated complementation was attempted employing IPTG-inducible shuttle vectors and did not yield any mutants.  Further characterisation of H. pylori XGPRTase was performed by determining the effects of nucleotide monophosphates and purine analogues on enzyme activity. Inhibition by GMP was observed in all cases, however differences in the inhibition by other nucleotide monophosphates were found between cell-free extracts and the recombinant enzyme. Inhibition of rXGPRTase activity was observed by the purine analogue 6-mercaptopurine ribose, a compound that previously has been shown to inhibit H. pylori growth in culture.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Helicobacter pylori..</field><field name="subject">Xanthines -- therapeutic use.</field><field name="subject">Phosphoribosyltransferase.</field><field name="subject">Xanthines -- therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Phosphoribosyltransferase.</field><field name="subject">Helicobacter pylori.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prosocial reasoning and empathy in gifted children</field><field name="creator">Hay, Peta Kerin, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study aimed to enhance understanding of the moral reasoning of gifted children.  While research has explored the justice moral reasoning of gifted children (Arbuthnot, 1973; Chovan &amp; Freeman, 1993; Gross, 1993; Henderson, Gold, &amp; Clarke, 1984; Howard-Hamilton, 1994), this study explored prosocial moral reasoning, moral reasoning which involves conflict between one??s own needs and desires and the needs and desires of others.  In addition, this study sought to gather empirical evidence for literature claims that gifted children have higher levels of empathy than their age peers (Lovecky, 1997; Piechowski, 2003; Silverman, 1993b).  The study aimed to investigate the possible relationships among giftedness, prosocial reasoning and empathy.  Primary (elementary) school students aged between 9 and 12 years in the Sydney Metropolitan area were administered The Prosocial Reasoning Objective Measure (PROM), The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) and The Index of Empathy for Children and Adolescents (IOE) questionnaires.  The results for gifted students (n = 176) were compared with a control group of students not identified as gifted (n = 128).  The study found that gifted students used more of the highest level of prosocial reasoning in the PROM than their age peers.  Furthermore, gifted students used more empathic concern, fantasy empathy and cognitive empathy than their age peers, although ability was not predictive of the other empathy factors in the instruments.  Small but significant correlations between some types of empathy and some levels of prosocial reasoning were also found, indicating possible relationships between empathy and prosocial reasoning.  Interviews were conducted with selected students (n = 13) from the above sample, along with some of their teachers (n = 5) and parents (n = 2).  Despite the small sample, the interviews seemed to indicate a relationship between experience with bullying and prosocial reasoning.  The study highlights the need for an empathy questionnaire that specifically tests cognitive and affective empathy in children.  A new questionnaire may unravel some of the seemingly contradictory results in the present study.  The study also provides empirical evidence that gifted children use higher levels of prosocial moral reasoning and empathy than their age-peers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Moral Reasoning</field><field name="subject">Gifted</field><field name="subject">Empathy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design variables for steel and aluminium in high-rise rooftops</field><field name="creator">Melhem, George Nadim, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation reports a case study in the design and construction solutions for a major corrosion failure of the aluminium louvres and steel brackets on the roof and fa??ade of levels 26-29 of the Westfield Tower 2, Bondi Junction.

It is hoped that the text provides a documentary basis for future guidance of designers and engineers working in areas related to the subject of the present work. ??	It also is hoped that the work on aerospace technologies will broaden the scope of designers and engineers in the potential that these materials and processes have in building considerations. ??	The manual stress calculations and finite element modelling confirm that the implemented designs are consistently within design specification and that, from the mechanical perspective, no problems are anticipated. ??	Further, since considerable care was taken to ensure that galvanic and other forms of corrosion were avoided through the appropriate use of design, materials, and implementation approaches, no further corrosion has been observed at the site. ??	The development of a generic factorial approach and a specific matrix method, applied to corrosion and welding considerations, was informative but these still are at speculative stages owing to the difficulty of obtaining relevant meaningful data and the problem of assigning weighting factors on what is viewed as a fairly subjective basis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prosthetic vision : Visual modelling, information theory and neural correlates</field><field name="creator">Hallum, Luke Edward, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Electrical stimulation of the retina affected by photoreceptor loss (e.g., cases of retinitis pigmentosa) elicits the perception of luminous spots (so-called phosphenes) in the visual field. This phenomenon, attributed to the relatively high survival rates of neurons comprising the retina's inner layer, serves as the cornerstone of efforts to provide a microelectronic retinal prosthesis -- a device analogous to the cochlear implant. This thesis concerns phosphenes -- their elicitation and modulation, and, in turn, image analysis for use in a prosthesis.  This thesis begins with a comparative review of visual modelling of electrical epiretinal stimulation and analogous acoustic modelling of electrical cochlear stimulation. The latter models involve coloured noise played to normal listeners so as to investigate speech processing and electrode design for use in cochlear implants. Subsequently, four experiments (three psychophysical and one numerical), and two statistical analyses, are presented. Intrinsic signal optical imaging in cerebral cortex is canvassed appendically.  The first experiment describes a visual tracking task administered to 20 normal observers afforded simulated prosthetic vision. Fixation, saccade, and smooth pursuit, and the effect of practice, were assessed. Further, an image analysis scheme is demonstrated that, compared to existing approaches, assisted fixation and pursuit (but not saccade) accuracy (35.8% and 6.8%, respectively), and required less phosphene array scanning. Subsequently, (numerical) information-theoretic reasoning is provided for the scheme's superiority. This reasoning was then employed to further optimise the scheme (resulting in a filter comprising overlapping Gaussian kernels), and may be readily extended to arbitrary arrangements of many phosphenes.  A face recognition study, wherein stimuli comprised either size- or intensity-modulated phosphenes, is then presented. The study involved unpracticed observers (n=85), and showed no 'size' --versus--'intensity' effect. Overall, a 400-phosphene (100-phosphene) image afforded subjects 89.0% (64.0%) correct recognition (two-interval forced-choice paradigm) when five seconds' scanning was allowed. Performance fell (64.5%) when the 400-phosphene image was stabilised on the retina and presented briefly. Scanning was similar in 400- and 100-phosphene tasks.  The final chapter presents the statistical effects of sampling and rendering jitter on the phosphene image. These results may generalise to low-resolution imaging systems involving loosely packed pixels.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">low vision</field><field name="subject">vision prosthesis</field><field name="subject">cochlear implant</field><field name="subject">information theory</field><field name="subject">phosphenes</field><field name="subject">Vision -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">acoustic modelling</field><field name="subject">optical imaging</field><field name="subject">visual tracking</field><field name="subject">signal processing</field><field name="subject">image processing</field><field name="subject">jitter</field><field name="subject">visual modelling</field><field name="subject">face recognition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Run-time energy-driven optimisation of embedded systems: a complete solution</field><field name="creator">Peddersen, Jorgen, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Consumption of power and conservation of energy have become two of the biggest design challenges in construction of embedded systems.  Energy is a resource in limited supply, but demands are increasing. Hence, much research is being performed to reduce power and energy usage or optimise performance under energy constraints.  There are very few solutions that try to cater for the applications where the data input is not easily testable before run-time.  These applications require an optimisation procedure that knows the power consumption of the system and is able to dynamically optimise operation to maximise performance while meeting energy constraints.  This thesis provides a complete solution to the problem of run-time energy-driven optimisation of application performance.  The complete system, from a processor that is able to provide feedback of the power consumption in parallel to execution, to applications that exploit the power feedback to provide dynamic optimisation.  A processor that estimates its own power consumption is designed by the addition of small dedicated counters that tally occurrences of power consuming events which are macro modelled. The methodology is demonstrated on a standard processor achieving an average power estimation error of less than 2% while increasing area of the processor by only 5%.  This enables energy-driven optimisation via application adaptation. Modification techniques and low-overhead algorithms are provided to demonstrate how energy feedback can be effectively used to maximise performance of algorithms within given constraints. Applications?? quality is maximised under given energy constraints using less than 0.02% of the execution time. Finally, the dissertation discusses the systems used to demonstrate the methodologies and techniques created throughout the research project. These implementations of the energy-driven optimisation system verify the soundness of the methods and applicability of the approaches used.  This is the first time a complete solution for energy-driven optimisation has been shown, from creation of the processor to analysis of software utilising the approach.  The methodologies and techniques can be applied to a variety of applications in a range of fields such as multimedia and networking that have never been possible before.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">estimation</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">energy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and analysis of a photocatalytic bubble column reactor</field><field name="creator">Cox, Shane Joseph, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The current work has developed a CFD model to characterise a pseudo-annular photocatalytic bubble column reactor. The model development was divided into three stages. Firstly, hydrodynamic assessment of the multiphase fluid flow in the  vessel, which incorporated residence time distribution analysis both numerically and experimentally for validation purposes. Secondly, the radiation distribution of the UV source was completed. The final stage incorporated the kinetics for the degradation the model pollutant, sodium oxalate. The hydrodynamics were modelled using an Eulerian-Eulerian approach to the multiphase system with the standard k-  turbulence model. This research established that there was significant deviation in the fluid behaviour in the pseudo-annular reactor when compared with traditional cylindrical columns due to the nature of the internal structure. The residence time distribution study showed almost completely mixed flow in the liquid phase, whereas the gas phase more closely represented plug flow behaviour. Whilst there was significant dependence on the superficial gas flow rate the mixing behaviour demonstrated negligible dependence on the liquid superficial velocity or the liquid flow direction, either co- or counter- current with respect to the gas phase. The light distribution was modelled using a conservative variant of the Discrete Ordinate method. The model examined the contribution to the incident radiation within the reactor of both the gas bubbles and titanium dioxide particles. This work has established the importance of the gas phase in evaluating the light distribution and showed that it should be included when examining the light distribution in a gas-liquid-solid three-phase system. An optimal catalyst loading for the vessel was established to be 1g/L. Integration of the kinetics of sodium oxalate degradation was the final step is developing the complete CFD model. Species transport equations were employed to describe the distribution of pollutant concentration within the vessel. Using a response surface methodology it was shown that the reaction rate exhibited a greater dependency on the lamp power that the lamp length, however, the converse was true with the quantum efficiency. This work highlights the complexity of completely modelling a photocatalytic system and has demonstrated the applicability of CFD for this purpose.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Residence time distribution.</field><field name="subject">Photocatalysis.</field><field name="subject">CFD.</field><field name="subject">Computational fluid dynamics.</field><field name="subject">Radiation.</field><field name="subject">Bubbles.</field><field name="subject">Hydrodynamics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of gruesome evidence on juror emotion and decision making</field><field name="creator">Bright, David Anthony, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The programme of research described in this dissertation examines the potential prejudicial impact of gruesome evidence on mock juror decision making.  The dissertation provides a model of the cognitive and emotional processes by which gruesome evidence can influence mock juror judgments.   Five studies will be presented which have examined the influence of gruesome verbal (written) and visual evidence.  Four studies utilised mock trial or simulation methodology utilising written trial transcripts and undergraduate students as mock jurors.   Results suggest that gruesome evidence can cause emotional reactions in mock jurors and that mock jurors who are exposed to gruesome evidence are more likely to find the defendant culpable (in criminal cases) and liable (in civil cases).  The studies evaluated a model which outlines the cognitive and affective processes by which gruesome evidence might influence juror emotion and decision making.  Gruesome evidence presented verbally, such as verbal descriptions of the victim??s injuries, may bias juror decisions toward conviction. Increased estimates of the guilt of the defendant may result when gruesome information is present, especially when the inculpatory evidence is weak overall.  Photographic evidence, irrespective of whether this evidence is neutral or gruesome, can increase the likelihood of conviction.  Admitting gruesome photographic evidence, rather than excluding this evidence, may increase the inculpatory value that jurors ascribe to prosecutorial evidence via the influence of gruesome evidence on the emotional state of jurors. Further, although exposure to any photographs had similar effects on mock juror affect, emotional reactions to gruesome photographic evidence appeared to lead to changes in the assessment of evidence and to an increased likelihood of conviction or liability when compared with neutral and no photographs.  The implications of the results for policy, practice and research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">evidence</field><field name="subject">jury</field><field name="subject">gruesome</field><field name="subject">emotion</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of fracture mechanics to predict the growth of single and multi-level delaminations and disbonds in composite structures</field><field name="creator">Mikulik, Zoltan, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The high stiffness to weight ratio and fatigue resistance make carbon fibre composites suitable for both military and large civil aircraft. The limited ability of current numerical methods to capture the complex growth of damage in laminated composites leads to a conservative design approach applied in today??s composite aircraft structures. The aim of the presented research was to develop an improved methodology for the failure prediction of laminated composites containing delaminations located between arbitrary layers in the laminate, and to extend the investigations to composite structures subjected to barely visible impact damage (BVID).  The advantages of fracture mechanics-based methodologies to predict interlaminar failure in composite structures were identified, from which the crack tip element (CTE) approach and the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) were selected for assessment. Extensive validation of these fracture mechanics methods is presented on a number of composite structures ranging from coupons to large stiffened panels. It was shown that the VCCT was relatively insensitive to the crack front mesh size, whilst predictions using the CTE methodology were significantly influenced by the element size. Based on the obtained results modelling guidelines for the VCCT and CTE were established. Significant contribution of this research to the field of the analysis of composite structures was the development of a novel test method for the evaluation of embedded single and multi-level delaminations. The test procedure of the single delamination specimen was proposed as an analogous test to conventional compression experiments. The transverse test overcame the inherent problems of in-plane compression testing and produced less scatter of experimental measurements. Quantitative analysis of numerical results employing the validated finite element modelling approaches showed that the failure load and location were in agreement with experiments. Furthermore, new modelling techniques for composite structures containing BVID proposed in this research produced good correlation with test data from the compression after impact (CAI) test. The study of BVID provided a significant contribution toward the knowledge of the applicability of implicit FE solvers to predict failure of CAI specimens as well as the criticality of centrally impacted specimens.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">VCCT</field><field name="subject">Composite</field><field name="subject">Fracture mechanics</field><field name="subject">Crack tip element</field><field name="subject">Delamination</field><field name="subject">Finite element analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41560</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic membranes: formation and characterisation studies</field><field name="creator">Ip, Anita Wai Ching, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Dynamic membranes are considered to be an attractive anti-fouling remedy for membrane filtration, because once fouled, they can be removed and reformed in-situ, thereby prolonging the support membrane???s lifetime.  However, large-scale application of dynamic membranes has been limited due to the numerous formation parameters that influence their properties.  This thesis provides better understanding of the mechanisms of the dynamic membrane formation process through fundamental formation and characterisation studies of dynamically formed titanium dioxide membranes in laboratory scale dead-end and crossflow systems.  The dynamic membranes exhibited water fluxes ranging from 30-1147 L/m2h and dextran (500 kDa) rejections as high as 99.9%.  Of the six formation parameters studied, the pH and constant flux conditions had the greatest influence on dynamic membrane properties.  The pH affects dynamic membrane properties by changing particle aggregation prior to dynamic membrane formation, while constant flux conditions affect the drag force on particles during deposition thereby altering cake compressibility.  The advantage of using the novel concept of constant flux formation over traditional constant pressure formation is that it enables greater control of particle deposition during dynamic membrane formation.  Dextran rejection data also suggested the existence of a critical mass loading, above which dynamic membrane flux and rejection properties are reduced.  This thesis also demonstrated the utility of a factorial design experiment for preliminary identification and evaluation of the critical factors affecting dynamic membrane formation, a method which could be invaluable for tailoring dynamic membranes for use in specific applications.  In addition, cake removal data suggested that more than 80% of the dried cake could be removed providing a high potential for membrane regeneration.  For the formation conditions studied, it was concluded that convection was the dominant mechanism governing particle transport during dynamic membrane formation.  The fluxes and cake properties of the dynamic membranes were best described by the resistance-in-series model for simple dead-end microfiltration.  Furthermore, the higher cake void fraction required to fit the experimental data (at low formation pressure or constant flux conditions) with model predictions suggested that the ratio of shear to convection was an important mechanistic parameter determining dynamic membrane properties.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dynamic membranes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Belief driven autonomous manipulator pose selection for less controlled environments</field><field name="creator">Webb, Stephen Scott, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a new approach for selecting a manipulator arm configuration (a pose) in an environment where the positions of the work items are not able to be fully controlled. The approach utilizes a belief formed from a priori knowledge, observations and predictive models to select manipulator poses and motions.  Standard methods for manipulator control provide a fully specified Cartesian pose as the input to a robot controller which is assumed to act as an ideal Cartesian motion device. While this approach simplifies the controller and makes it more portable, it is not well suited for less-controlled environments where the work item position or orientation may not be completely observable and where a measure of the accuracy of the available observations is required. The proposed approach suggests selecting a manipulator configuration using two types of rating function. When uncertainty is high, configurations are rated by combining a belief, represented by a probability density function, and a value function in a decision theoretic manner enabling selection of the sensor??s motion based on its probabilistic contribution to information gain. When uncertainty is low the mean or mode of the environment state probability density function is utilized in task specific linear or angular distances constraints to map a configuration to a cost. The contribution of this thesis is in providing two formulations that allow joint configurations to be found using non-linear optimization algorithms. The first formulation shows how task specific linear and angular distance constraints are combined in a cost function to enable a satisfying pose to be selected. The second formulation is based on the probabilistic belief of the predicted environment state. This belief is formed by utilizing a Bayesian estimation framework to combine the a priori knowledge with the output of sensor data processing, a likelihood function over the state space, thereby handling the uncertainty associated with sensing in a less controlled environment. Forward models are used to transform the belief to a predicted state which is utilized in motion selection to provide the benefits of a feedforward control strategy. Extensive numerical analysis of the proposed approach shows that using the fed-forward belief improves tracking performance by up to 19%. It is also shown that motion selection based on the dynamically maintained belief reduces time to target detection by up to 50% compared to two other control approaches. These and other results show how the proposed approach is effectively able to utilize an uncertain environment state belief to select manipulator arm configurations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Belief driven control</field><field name="subject">Manipulator pose selection</field><field name="subject">Bayesian estimation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43090</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dancing brush: an exploration of Taoist aesthetics</field><field name="creator">Yeh, Yi-Lan, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Dancing Brush video installation is dedicated to legendary Taiwanese dancer Tsai Jui-Yue (1921-2005) in the memory of her suffering, creativity and faith in life. This work reveals the true meaning of Chinese scroll paintings as an infinity of time and space. It draws on the notion of mobility as expounded in the I Ching or Book of Changes. Dancing Brush creates a modern cityscape where the principal of Taoism, ancient Chinese landscape painting, and calligraphy meet new media aesthetics. The focus of this thesis is to reassess media arts practice and aesthetics via the traditions of Chinese Taoist aesthetics. The research was conducted in three dimensions: ??non-linear aesthetics?? in Chinese arts as the new media art form, ??unity of emptiness and fullness?? as the animation principle, and ??subtraction aesthetics?? as the principle of creativity. I propose Dancing Brush video installation as a presentation of ??aesthetics of wandering contemplation??. The work suggests a feature of Chinese moving image aesthetics as a ??spatial montage?? form of media arts. I applied the Taoist ??decreative-creative process?? as the creative method in which the ??decreative?? process leads to the ??creative??. The ??decreative-creative process?? is based on the Taoist teachings of zi-ran (spontaneity) and wu-wei (non-action). I interpret it as ??subtraction aesthetics: less is more??. The process is to eliminate interferences with restricted narrative format and visual effects, then to receive the immediate presentation of things as pure materials. Through the subtracting process, it gains not less but more. Kong Bai (emptiness or formless) in Chinese art is the result of subtraction aesthetics. It reveals the creative principle derived from the Taoist idea of ??usefulness of useless??. The ??subtracting process?? in creating animation is to bring ??unknown?? to life. The ??image beyond image?? is the product of ??unity of emptiness and full?? where Chinese artistic realm yi-jing is created.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-linear aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Taoist Aesthetics</field><field name="subject">subtractions aesthetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IS project evaluation in practice: an actor-network theory account</field><field name="creator">Nagm, Fouad, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The dominant view in the information systems (IS) and software engineering literature is that the application of a rigorous pre-investment evaluation methodology is the key to ensuring the selection of the best IS projects ?? that is those with the highest expected value for the organisation and with the highest probability of success. While the literature is replete with methodologies that take a narrow view of IS evaluation, there is insufficient attention given to the evaluation process itself and to what constitutes successful IS evaluation. Whilst some within IS argue that the development of more elaborate evaluation methodologies, especially calculations of costs and benefits, is necessary for the advancement of the field, many report that it is not methodologies as such that need improvement. What is missing is an understanding of IS evaluation processes in practice and how organisations can adopt and apply evaluation methodologies so as to improve these processes. This thesis aims to provide in-depth knowledge of IS evaluation processes in practice and re-conceptualise the notion of the IS project proposal, the evaluation process and evaluation methodology that reflect the needs and critical issues in practice. These aims are achieved by conducting an in-depth case study of IS project evaluation processes in a company with a history of high success rates of its IS projects ($3 billion worth of successfully delivered IS projects in the past few years). By adopting Actor-Network Theory as a philosophy, approach and theoretical lens to the investigation of IS project evaluation processes in the case company the thesis demonstrates that: a)	IS project proposals are dynamic, evolving and relational entities that become ??focal?? objects around which the actor-networks of aligned interest tend to emerge; b)	that the evaluation process both creates an IS project proposal and its assessment within a core actor-network within which multiple business realities are enacted and continually negotiated; c)	the evaluation methodology plays an important role of an actant (a non-human actor) by acting from a periphery of the core actor-network of an IS project proposal evaluation d)	the evaluation methodology acts on behalf of management to regulate communication within actor-networks, ensure that company strategy is effectively implemented and that different IS Project Proposals are consistently presented in a mutually comparable manner; e)	by defining a series of processes (steps), inscription aids (inscription forms, norms and rules) and mandated checkpoints the evaluation methodology engenders the evaluation process as ??science??; f)	 by allowing a degree of freedom in conducting the evaluation processes the methodology is also enabling the evaluation processes to emerge as ??art?? thus stimulating creativity and innovation, and finally, g)	by balancing the science and the art of IS project proposal evaluation, the methodology is enabling, assisting and inspiring numerous actors in taking on ??journeys?? of IS project proposals and evaluation and thereby making a difference in their business environments. The thesis makes important contributions to knowledge in the IS discipline. Theoretically, the adoption and use of ANT revealed that the IS Project Proposal is not dormant but rather active, and key to the IS evaluation effort. The IS Project Proposal has thus been re-conceptualised as emerging, relational and dynamic. This thesis also makes a contribution to the re-conceptualisation of the evaluation methodology as being multi-purpose and active as it defines the ??science?? and enables the ??art?? in IS evaluation. The thesis also makes a number of contributions to practice, firstly by showing that documents in IS evaluation are not simply ??outputs?? that are archived away, but are active and are used to attract the right stakeholders. Secondly, it reveals that the ultimate success of the IS Proposal relies on finding a balance between the science and the art in IS evaluation and that the evaluation methodology can play a key role in promoting this balance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IS Investment</field><field name="subject">Project Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Actor-Network Theory</field><field name="subject">Information technology</field><field name="subject">Evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41261</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis, characterisation, and activity of novel TiO2-based photocatalysts for organic pollutant  photodestruction under UV and visible-light irradiation</field><field name="creator">Hudaya, Tedi, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Titania-based photocatalysts have been extensively studied for the oxidative photodestruction of organic pollutants in wastewaters, releasing non-toxic substances such as CO2, HCl, and water. However, commercial exploitation of this process is limited by the fact that titania is only active under UV irradiation (wavelength below about 388 nm), which is only less than 5% of solar light energy. Sol-gel synthesised catalyst specimens were characterised to determine the correlation between preparation conditions on morphology (XRD, SEM), optical (bandgap energy level) and physicochemical properties (BET surface area, pore volume, acid site density, acid site strength and type) of the photocatalysts. These spesific properties would then be linked to their photoactivity using aqueous aliphatic and aromatic model pollutants. This study has demonstrated that sol-gel synthesised doped titania photocatalysts, especially Pt/TiO2, may be used to effectively degrade non-volatile acids (DL-malic acid, dichloroacetic acid, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid) under visible light and UV irradiation with significant photoactivity suitable for the solar light application of photocatalytic wastewater treatment. A significant drop in band-gap energy was found for all titania sol-gel catalysts doped with Pt, Co, and Ce with values between 1.41 to 1.78 eV. The BET areas of the photocatalysts were also higher (65-117 m2/g) than that of Degussa P25 (50 m2/g). The visible-light photomineralisation of the three pollutants with Pt-TiO2 specimen were further extended to evaluate the effects of major variables in a bubble-column photoreactor on the photodegradation activities. Those major variables were lamp intensity, oxygen concentration, initial pH, catalyst dosage, and inital pollutant concentration. All the three pollutants seemed to follow the Langmuir-Hinselwood model with dual adsorption sites which implicated a bimolecular surface rate-limiting step probably between the adsorbed organic substrate and a surface hydroxyl (or peroxy) radical. A study of the CeyCoxTi(1-x)O3+d perovskite was conducted to investigate the influence of metal composition and pH on the intrinsic optophysical attributes as well as p-hydroxybenzoic acid degradation under UV irradiation. The perovskite UV photoactivities were lower than that of pure TiO2 likely due to excessive loading (metal content) creating new oxide phases act as electron-hole recombination center, regardless better physicochemical attributes of some of the perovskite samples. The role of aging time and calcination temperature on the sol-gel synthesised TiO2 was also explored. Higher calcination temperature (from 250 to 700 0C) resulted in TiO2 photocatalysts with better crystallinity, which is important for OH group formation as active sites for photodegradation. Despite of some advantages from higher temperature preparation, some detrimental effects such as decreased acidity attributes, surface area, and pore volume were also observed. The significant red-shift of sol-gel synthesized TiO2 into visible light, especially for 250 0C specimen since 600 or 700 0C had extremely low activities, has promising implications that this specimen might be used for solar application to substitute Pt-doped TiO2 in order to produce a more cost effective photocatalyst. Aging period (1 to 14 days) did not have any discernible effect on the band-gap value and acid-site density. Even so, the highest acid site strength was obtained with an aging time of 10 days. From the overall perspective, aging time longer than 3 days did not bring noticeable benefits to both catalyst attributes and photoactivities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sol-gel</field><field name="subject">Photocatalysts</field><field name="subject">TiO2</field><field name="subject">Photodestruction</field><field name="subject">UV</field><field name="subject">Visible-light</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extraction and characterization of major valuable compounds from prawn waste</field><field name="creator">Karuppuswamy, Renuka, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Most prawns are prepared as frozen or canned meat and the remaining waste is used as a feed supplement or directly disposed on to the land, which affects the environment. Fresh prawn bio-waste contains protein, astaxanthin, flavor compounds and chitin. The use of chitin in various applications is limited due to its water insolubility. In this research, a new method is developed to prepare water-soluble colloidal chitin (WSCC) from prawn waste.  WSCC having the percentage of degree of deacetylation same with that of chitin follows non-newtonian shear thinning behaviour. The characteristic study showed that the breakage of polymer chains during processing thus reduced the molecular weight and bulk density of WSCC. Therefore, functional properties of WSCC can be controlled by optimizing the processing conditions.  Astaxanthin complex has attracted considerable interest in relation to its health benefits because of its powerful antioxidant activity. Traditional extraction of astaxanthin complex from prawn waste using organic solvents requires post-purification steps, creates solvent disposal problem and degrades the pigment. This research develops an efficient way of recovering astaxanthin complex from prawn waste that eliminates the problems associated with solvent extraction methods and offers possible recyclability of the solvents used. Post-harvest blackening in prawns adversely affects both quality and consumer acceptability. However, consumer safety over the chemicals, especially sulphites used in inhibiting prawn blackening is of a major concern. This study shows that the antioxidant, astaxanthin complex can inhibit the poly phenol oxidase (PPO) catalyzed blackening reaction in prawns. Although prawns have astaxanthin complex present in their natural state, its concentration in vivo may not be sufficient to act against PPO. Therefore, astaxanthin complex-enriched feed in prawn culture may prevent prawn melanosis and may eliminate the post-harvest handling methods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prawn waste management.</field><field name="subject">Astaxanthin.</field><field name="subject">Biopolymer.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The internationalisation processes of cultural firms: a case of MBC, Korea</field><field name="creator">Choi, Tae Young, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The words ??Globalisation?? and ??Internationalisation?? have received a great deal of interest from global nations, enterprises, citizens and academics especially since the late 20th century. Although the process of globalization began as a social trend for tracking the expansion of human population and the growth of civilization since as early as the 16th century, globalization became a business phenomenon in the 19th century from rapid growth in international trade and investment between the European imperial powers, its colonies and, later, the United States. Scholars of the 20th century vigorously attempted to theorise internationalisation of multinational enterprises (MNEs) based on MNEs?? internationalisation processes. As the vast majority of such theories were developed for the manufacturing industry, the validity of theories for the service industry became ambiguous. Despite the fact that one of the fastest growing sectors of global trade since the late 20th century is the trade in cultural goods and services, scholars haven??t attempted to validate such a phenomenon by reference to existing theories of internationalisation processes. This thesis attempts to dismantle the internationalisation processes of cultural firms and to explore the validity of existing internationalisation theories. Due to the inherent difficulties in analysing all sectors of cultural industries, this thesis has adopted a single in-depth case study method with qualitative data to support the findings of the thesis. Although the internationalisation processes of a firm consist of an abundant series of intermittent and continuous ventures by the firm, the particular focus of this thesis is on the longitudinal processes of a firm??s overall internationalisation processes. As one of the foremost runners of ??Hallyu ?? Korean Wave?? phenomenon, MBC has been selected as a case study object for this thesis. With a history of internationalisation processes over 40 years, involving various internal and external environmental factors/forces interactively, the case of MBC offers an insight into the empirical study of the internationalisation processes of cultural firms. Although this thesis shows strong support for the dynamic capabilities theory??a theory that explains dynamic activities and behaviours of MBC??s internationalisation processes in accordance with, and as a result of, ever-changing both internal and external factors/forces of environments??dynamic capability theory itself is deficient in explaining the underlying sources and drivers of those factors/forces. In order to overcome such a shortfall, this thesis suggests an integrative approach of integrating multidisciplinary theories as a theoretical framework for future studies of internalisation processes theories especially for empirical and industry-specific studies. This thesis provides comprehensive framework for three components??motives, way-stations and performance??of internationalisation processes of cultural firms, thereby contributing to the under-researched field in the discipline of international business.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategy</field><field name="subject">Internationalisation</field><field name="subject">Processes</field><field name="subject">Culture Industry</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42193</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development, evaluation and application of a geographic information retrieval system</field><field name="creator">Hu, You-Heng, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) systems provide users with functionalities of representation, storage, organisation of and access to various types of electronic information resources based on their textual and geographic context. This thesis explores various aspects of the development, evaluation and application of GIR systems.  The first study focuses upon the extraction and grounding of geographic information entities. My approach for this study consists of a hierarchical structure-based geographic relationship model that is used to describe connections between geographic information entities, and a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to resolve ambiguities. The proposed approach has been evaluated on a toponym disambiguation task using a large collection of news articles.  The second study details the development and validation of a GIR ranking mechanism. The proposed approach takes advantage of the power of the Genetic Programming (GP) paradigm with the aim of finding an optimal functional form that integrates both textual and geographic similarities between retrieved documents and a given user query. My approach has been validated by applying it to a large collection of geographic metadata documents. The third study addresses the problem of modelling the GIR retrieval process that takes into account both thematic and geographic criteria. Based on the Spreading Activation Network (SAN), the proposed model consists a two-layer associative network that is used to construct a structured search space; a constrained spreading activation algorithm that is used to retrieve and to rank relevant documents; and a geographic knowledge base that is used to provide necessary domain knowledge for network. The retrieval performance of my model has been evaluated using the GeoCLEF 2006 tasks.  The fourth study discusses the publishing, browsing and navigation of geographic information on the World Wide Web. Key challenges in designing and implementing of a GIR user interface through which online content can be systematically organised based on their geospatial characteristics, and can be efficiently accessed and interrelated, are addressed. The effectiveness and the usefulness of the system are shown by applying it to a large collection of geo-tagged web pages.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information Retrieval</field><field name="subject">Geographic Information Retrieval</field><field name="subject">Geographic Information</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of circumcision and pharyngeal STIs in HIV and STI transmission among homosexual men</field><field name="creator">Templeton, David James, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents data on two separate areas relevant to the prevention of HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) transmission in homosexual men. These data arise from the community-based Health in Men (HIM) cohort of HIV-negative homosexual men in Sydney. First, the association of circumcision status with HIV and STIs was examined. Older age, ethnicity and country of birth were demographic factors independently associated with circumcision status. Self-report was a valid measure of circumcision status in this population. Overall, being circumcised was associated with a non-significant reduced risk of HIV seroconversion in the HIM cohort (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.41-1.41, p=0.381). Among the one-third of participants predominantly practising the insertive role in anal intercourse (AI), being circumcised was associated with a significantly reduced risk of HIV infection (HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03-0.80, p=0.026). Circumcised HIM participants also had a lower risk of incident syphilis (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15-0.84, p=0.019), however circumcision status had no significant effect on the remainder of prevalent and incident STIs examined. Second, risk factors for pharyngeal gonorrhoea and chlamydia were investigated. The BD ProbeTec nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) had a positive predictive value (PPV) for pharyngeal gonorrhoea diagnosis of only 30.4% (95% CI 25.2-36.1%) when compared to a previously validated NAAT targeting the gonococcal porA pseudogene. Pharyngeal gonorrhoea was common in HIM, mostly occurred without concurrent anogenital infection and may frequently spontaneously resolve. Infection was independently associated with younger age (p-trend=0.001), higher number of male partners (p-trend=0.002), contact with gonorrhoea (p&lt;0.001) and insertive oro-anal sex with casual partners (p-trend=0.044). Pharyngeal chlamydia was less common but a high prevalence/incidence ratio suggested that infection may persist in the pharynx for long periods. Pharyngeal chlamydia was independently associated with receptive penile-oral sex with casual partners (p-trend=0.009). In conclusion, circumcision may have a role as an HIV prevention intervention among the subgroup of homosexual men who predominantly practise insertive rather than receptive AI. Regular screening of the pharynx including a validated supplemental NAAT for gonorrhoea diagnosis may prevent much transmission to anogenital sites, whereas chlamydia occurs too infrequently in the pharynx to recommend routine screening in homosexual men.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sexually transmitted infections</field><field name="subject">homosexuality, male</field><field name="subject">circumcision</field><field name="subject">human immunodeficiency virus</field><field name="subject">pharyngeal gonorrhoea</field><field name="subject">pharyngeal chlamydia</field><field name="subject">prospective studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attraction, affiliation and disenchantment in a new religious movement:  a study of individuals?? experiences in a  Siddha Yoga practice</field><field name="creator">Healy, John Paul, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores thirty-two individuals?? experiences of involvement in Siddha Yoga. Such groups have often been labelled as cults and accused of ??brainwashing?? their followers. The conceptualisation of affiliation as brainwashing has been influential within the helping professions, including psychology, counselling and social work. However, this conceptualisation is not supported by empirical research on cults, or what have become known as New Religious Movements (NRMs). The research problem which this thesis addresses therefore is: ??If a brainwashing model of affiliation does not give an adequate explanation for cult/NRM involvement how else might it be understood???  A primary objective of this study was to inform the helping professions, in particular social work. A secondary objective was to add to knowledge about Siddha Yoga Practice in Australia, which no other study had addressed, and thereby to add to the growing understanding of NRMs in Australia. The study applied a qualitative research framework, informed by grounded theory, ethnography and phenomenology and used a purposive sampling technique. Materials were collected by semi-structured in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes, and analysed with the assistance of NVivo data analysis computer software. This study found that the conceptualisation of affiliation as brainwashing fails to account for the variety of individuals?? experiences of involvement in Siddha Yoga. Moreover, the findings highlight that involvement in regard to attraction, affiliation and disenchantment is not helpfully understood by adopting a ??brainwashing?? model and could be better understood through the lens of the sociology of religion, including studies of the experiences of those in mainstream religions.  One implication of the findings for social work and other helping professions is that existing approaches to interpersonal helping could be used with individuals who seek assistance after leaving a NRM. For social work, this thesis also adds to the growing knowledge of the diverse religious orientations in the wider community. Such knowledge can enhance social work education, practice and theory in relation to social work??s diverse client population.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="subject">cults</field><field name="subject">New Religious Movements</field><field name="subject">brainwashing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A fill and flow channel enzyme biosensor</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Min, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electroanalytical Chemistry (RFCD: 250403)</field><field name="subject">Sensor (Chemical and Bio-) Technology (RFCD: 250405)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Validation of quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (QNMR) spectroscopy as a primary ratio analytical method for assessing the purity of organic compounds: a metrological approach.</field><field name="creator">Al-Deen, Tareq, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organic compounds -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Small area market demand prediction in the automobile industry</field><field name="creator">Lu, Hongwei, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The general aim of this research is to investigate approaches to: &#149;improve small area market demand (i.e. SAMD) prediction accuracy for the purchase of automobiles at the level of each Census Collection District (i.e. CCD); and &#149;enhance understanding of meso-level marketing phenomena (i.e. geographically aggregated phenomena) relating to SAMD.  Given the importance of SAMD prediction, and the limitations posed by current methods, four research questions are addressed: &#149;What are the key challenges in meso-level SAMD prediction? &#149;What variables affect SAMD prediction? &#149;What techniques can be used to improve SAMD prediction? &#149;What is the value of integrating these techniques to improve SAMD prediction?  To answer these questions, possible solutions from two broad areas are examined: spatial analysis and data mining.  The research is divided into two main studies. In the first study, a seven-step modelling process is developed for SAMD prediction. Several sets of models are analysed to examine the modelling techniques&#146; effectiveness in improving the accuracy of SAMD prediction. The second study involves two cases to: 1) explore the integration of these techniques and their advantages in SAMD prediction; and 2) gain insights into spatial marketing issues.  The case study of Peugeot in the Sydney metropolitan area shows that urbanisation and geo-marketing factors can have a more important role in SAMD prediction than socio-demographic factors. Furthermore, results show that modelling spatial effects is the most important aspect of this prediction exercise. The value of the integration of techniques is in compensating for the weaknesses of conventional techniques, and in providing complementary and supplementary information for meso-level marketing analyses. Substantively, significant spatial variation and continuous patterns are found with the influence of key studied variables.  The substantive implications of these findings have a bearing on both academic and managerial understanding. Also, the innovative methods (e.g. the SAMD modelling process and the model cube based technique comparison) developed from this research make significant contributions to marketing research methodology.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">data mining</field><field name="subject">small area market demand</field><field name="subject">spatial analysis</field><field name="subject">demand prediction</field><field name="subject">geographic information system</field><field name="subject">meso-level marketing phenomena modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transversal politics and West African security</field><field name="creator">Collett, Moya Elyn, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses conflict dynamics in West Africa and assesses the role of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) as a security organisation in its response to armed conflict. In so doing, it argues that conventional approaches misinterpret key feature of the civil wars in the &#147;Greater Mano River Area&#148; which includes Liberia, Sierra Leone and C??te d&#146;Ivoire. It demonstrates that the progression and spread of conflict is engendered primarily by transversal political structures. The thesis utilises a critical international society approach to consider patterns of security and insecurity across the sub-region of West Africa. However, rather than accepting that West African politics operates within a single, comprehensive international society, it argues instead that it should be understood at two levels. One level is state-centric international society, where West African inter-state relations can largely be explained according to existing constructivist paradigms. At the second level is &#147;transversal&#148; society that cuts across state borders, generating a regional, normative structure that prescribes and constrains behaviour within and between communities outside of the international society framework.  The thesis proceeds in two parts. In the first section it works towards an understanding of the transversal politics of regional conflict in the Greater Mano River Area. Conflict is nominally internal, and centralised state authority is the object of both attack and transformation. However, a close examination of civil violence in Liberia, Sierra Leone and C??te d&#146;Ivoire reveals that it cannot be completely understood without recognising the non-state structures of authority and domination that disrupt the traditional domestic/international divide. The transversal communities generated by conflict create a regional cycle of violence that is resistant to efforts made to resolve it. The second section of the thesis is concerned with the ability of ECOWAS to foster durable peace. As West Africa&#146;s key regional organisation, ECOWAS would seem well-placed to respond to regional conflict. It is well-integrated, has significant normative legitimacy and has developed sophisticated security mechanisms. Critically however, as it was created within inter-state international society, ECOWAS is limited by its assumption that states are and should remain unitary actors. Its failure ultimately lies in its inability to respond to the alternative political contours of transversal communities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">security</field><field name="subject">transversal</field><field name="subject">West Africa</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41557</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterisation of inhibitors of leukaemia with translocatins involving the mixed lineage leukaemia oncogene</field><field name="creator">Kwek, Chin Kiat, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common childhood cancer with cure rates of approximately 80%. This success can be  attributed to the introduction of risk stratification for patients and employment of intensified treatment regimes for patients with high risk disease. However, the identification of prognostically important leukaemia subtypes, unfortunately, is an labour-intensive process. In addition, despite the success in treating childhood ALL, specific subgroups of patients nevertheless still have poor survival rates. This is particularly true for leukaemias characterised by chromosomal translocations involving the MLL oncogene on chromosome 11q23. By using a novel bioinformatics approach, GeneRave, a set of 12 classifier genes (PTPRK, FOS, ENG, Lgal-S1, TCFL5, LRMP, CTGF, IGJ, MX1, PENK, CD3D and HBG1) was selected from a publicly available U95 Affymetrix microarray dataset. Real time PCR carried out on a blinded cohort of 58 primary ALL samples yielded an accuracy of 86%. The absence of PENK gene expression in the majority of ALL samples tested appears to have decreased the overall accuracy. Nevertheless, the results indicate that this method of classification can be easily and quickly performed and therefore may be useful as an adjunct to routinely used methodology in the diagnostic classification of childhood ALL. Parellal screening of a 34,000 chemical small molecules library identified 30 ???hits??? that exhibited specificity toward leukaemia, and many of which shared structural similarity. The cytotoxic effect of these compounds was further investigated in a panel of 19 cell lines that included 3 MLL-translocated (MV411, THP-1 and PER-485), 7 non-MLL-translocated leukaemias (REH, Jurkat, K562, HL60, Hal-01, UOB-B, NB4), 2 immortalized normal blood cell lines, 4 non-leukaemic tumour cell lines (Calu6, MCF7, BE(2)-C, and HeLa) and 3 normal cell lines (HSF, MCF10a and MRC5). In particular, two compounds were identified, SM6 and SM7, that were highly effective at killing MLL-translocated cell lines in the low micromolar range while having little or no effect on the other cell lines. Treatment of PER-485 cells with SM6 and SM7 showed mark down-regulation of the MLL chimaeric fusion protein together with its down-stream targets. One other more broadly acting anti-leukaemia compounds were also identified.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Leukemia.</field><field name="subject">Translocation (Genetics)</field><field name="subject">Oncogenes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimised reduction of the radiated noise from the casing of a constant speed gearbox</field><field name="creator">Shen, Anne, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a comprehensive methodology for predicting and minimising the noise radiated from a constant speed gearbox assembly by means of attaching optimally placed stiffening ribs on the casing. The procedure involves building an FE model of the gearbox, which is updated using modal parameters extracted from a modal test. This is followed by synthesis of the required FRFs with respect to the forcing degrees-of-freedom. The forces, which are assumed to act only at the bearings are identified from these FRFs and the measured operational velocities of the casing. The identified forces are then used to excite the updated FE model to re-calculate the vibration velocities. A boundary element method is used to calculate the final radiated sound power to be compared with that measured. The same forces are used later to excite the modified gearbox casing to determine the improvement given by optimised modification. The optimisation study minimises the vibration energy of the casing in  10% bands around critical frequencies, in this case the first two harmonics of the gearmesh frequency. To allow for errors in the model, the excitation is by white noise, so as to produce wide stop bands, rather than minimising the response at particular frequencies. The vibration energy is weighted for radiation efficiency, A-weighting, and relative source strength in the bands. The final optimal stiffener layout is validated through a final vibration and acoustic calculation on the updated gearbox model using the forces identified in the earlier steps. The study of one particular gearbox concludes that i) the proposed hybrid optimisation scheme produces a theoretical effective noise reduction of 3 dBA for the total sound power. ii) Because the gearmesh harmonics were targeted, a further 5 dB improvement was effectively gained by eliminating the tonal penalty which otherwise applied. iii) From plate studies it was demonstrated that the stiffening ribs could be attached using epoxy cement (to avoid welding) and that the properties of the cemented joint could be determined by model updating after attaching one rib, so as to obtain a better prediction of the final optimised result.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reduction</field><field name="subject">Gearbox</field><field name="subject">Radiated noise</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of compressible cake behaviour in submerged membrane filtration for water treatment</field><field name="creator">Santiwong, Suvinai Rensis, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this study, Smiles?? sorptivity-diffusivity numerical analysis is demonstrated to offer a comprehensive description of dead-end constant-pressure compressible cake filtration for water treatment. In addition to providing an insight on filtration performance and cake behaviour in terms of cake hydraulic permeability and compressibility in good agreement with the results derived using Ruth??s conventional cake filtration theory, the sorptivity-diffusivity model can be used to gain further information on depth-dependent local cake properties and extend our knowledge on the effect of feed suspension conditions (including solution composition, coagulant dosage and mixing) on the characteristics of the particulate assemblages (including size, structure and strength).  Feed suspension conditions and primary particle properties exert significant effect on the characteristics of particles in suspensions and the resultant particulate assemblages. In the non-coagulated latex systems, an increase in ionic strength resulted in a suppression of the electric double layer of latex particles as indicated by a significant drop in the zeta potential of the feed suspension which lead to a dramatic reduction in cake hydraulic permeability. In the non-coagulated montmorillonite systems, feed suspensions with high ionic strength (1 M Na+, 50 mM Ca2+ and 50 mM Fe2+) were associated with larger suspended solids which appeared to form assemblages with nematic structures that are denser yet more permeable when compared to those with low ionic strength (0.1 M Na+, 1 mM Ca2+ and 2 mM Fe2+) which appeared to form highly ??cross-linked?? voluminous honeycomb type gel of very low permeability.  Pre-coagulation of latex and montmorillonite suspensions with Al-based coagulants (alum and ACH) both resulted in formation of very large flocs which subsequently formed highly permeable solid assemblages. In the latex systems, the ratio of optimal alum to ACH dose was approximately 5:1 on a total coagulant mass basis and 1.3:1 as Al while the ratio of optimal alum to ACH dose was as high as 22:1 on a total coagulant mass basis and 6:1 as Al in the montmorillonite systems. Although both alum and ACH resulted in comparable filtration performances, the distinction in Al concentration and results of local cake properties analysis indicated the presence of different cake structures presumably due to the formation of different Al species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cake structure</field><field name="subject">Compressible cake</field><field name="subject">Membrane filtration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of mammalian lipid material by high performance liquid chromatography and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry</field><field name="creator">Proschogo, Nicholas William, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The analysis of the exact compositions of human lipids is of great importance and can lead to a better understanding of the role of lipids in heart diseases and diabetes.

These strategies are specific to certain conditions in a particular region, involving different parties such as Original Equipment Manufacturers, Government or Councils, Recyclers, and the community. Since different collectors in the reverse logistics network will influence its performance, a suitable collection program is required. The objective of this research is to find an optimum collection strategy to suit various environments by considering the costs and the environmental aspects of collection. To design optimum collection strategies, information on the rate of EOL product returns is essential. Therefore, a methodology is proposed to forecast the return of EOL products by considering product life, consumer behavior and historical sales. This forecast model is then integrated into the collection strategy model. The integrated model is dynamically formulated to present the behavior of different sets of strategies. Colored Petri Net (CPN) approach is utilized in the forecasting and modeling of collection strategies. The distinct characteristic of CPN provides the ability to model uncertainties in a system. Some case studies were conducted in Australia to verify and to validate the models. The results indicate that the integrated model will help practitioners in making decisions on implementing a suitable collection strategy for Reverse Logistics.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Logistics technology transfer model</field><field name="creator">Al Hajri, Abdullah Said, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A consecutive number of studies on the adoption trend of logistics technology since 1988 revealed that logistics organizations are not in the frontier when it comes to adopting new technology and this delayed adoption creates an information gap. In the advent of supply chain management and the strategic position of logistics, the need for accurate and timely information to accompany the logistics executives became more important than ever before. Given the integrative nature of logistics technology, failure to implement the technology successfully could result in writing off major investments in developing and implementing the technology or even in abandoning the strategic initiatives underpinned by these innovations. Consequently, the need to employ effective strategies and models to cope with these uncertainties is rather crucial. This thesis addresses the aspect of uncertainty in implementation success by process and factor research models. Process research approach focuses on the sequence of events in the technology transfer process that occurs over time. It explains the story that explains the degree of association between these sequences and implementation success. Through content analysis, this research gathers, extracts, and categorizes process data of actual stories of logistics technology adoption and implementations in organizations that are published in literature. The extracted event sequences are then analyzed using optimal matching from natural science and grouped using cluster analysis. Four patterns were revealed that organizations follow to transfer logistics technology namely, formal minimalist, mutual adaptation, development concerned, and organizational roles dispenser. Factors that contribute to successful implementation in each pattern were defined as the crucial and necessary events that characterized and differentiated each pattern from others. The factor approach identifies the potential predictors of successful technology implementation and tests empirical association between predictors and outcomes. This research develops a logistics technology success model. In developing the model, various streams of research were investigated including logistics, information systems, and organizational psychology. The model is tested using a questionnaire survey study. The data were collected from Australian companies which have recently adopted and implemented logistics technology. The results of a partial least squares structured equation modeling provide strong support for the model constructs and valuable insights to logistics/supply chain managers. The last study reports a convergent triangulation study using multiple case study of three Australian companies which have implemented logistics technology. A within and a cross case analysis of the three cases provide cross validation for the results of the other two studies. The results provided high predictive validity for the two models. Furthermore, the case study approach was so beneficial in explaining and contextualizing the linkages of the factor-based model and in confirming the importance of the crucial events in the process-based model. The thesis concludes with a research and managerial implications chapter which is devoted for logistics/supply chain managers and researchers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Process model</field><field name="subject">Logistics</field><field name="subject">Technology Transfer</field><field name="subject">Variance model</field><field name="subject">Optimal matching</field><field name="subject">Triangulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41469</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microtransfusion and viral exposure in infants born to HIV-infected women</field><field name="creator">Warning, Julia Carolyn, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction: Mechanisms facilitating mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV have not been elucidated. Small quantities of blood pass from mother to infant during childbirth, termed 'microtransfusion'; this is one possible mechanism for HIV entry into the infant's circulation. HIV-specific cellular immune responses have been detected in some uninfected infants born to HIV-infected women, indicating transient virus exposure or replication in these infants. Both microtransfusion and HIV-specific immune responses in infants born to HIV-infected women has not previously been investigated. Methods: 46 uninfected infants born to HIV-infected women were included in this study. Infants were grouped according to interventions utilised by the mother: none or antiretroviral therapy (ART; group A, n = 16), ART with elective caesarean section (elCS; group B, n = 12), highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) only (group C, n = 7), and HAART with elCS (group D, n = 11). HLA-A and -B alleles were typed for all mother-baby pairs to identify the non-inherited maternal allele (NIMA). Microtransfusion was detected using flow cytometry or by qPCR targeting the NIMA. HIV-specific immune responses were detected using 51Cr-release and IFN-?????? ELISpot assays. Results: Microtransfusion was detected in umbilical cord blood of 9 of 11 infants, and in peripheral blood of 4 of 11 infants up to 1 week old. One infant without detectable microtransfusion in umbilical cord blood had detectable maternal cells in peripheral blood. 8/46 infants had HIV-specific T cell responses, 5 were in group A, 2 in group B, and 1 in group C, while no infants in group D had detectable responses (p = 0.04). Blood samples from 2 of these 8 infants were also available for the analysis of microtransfusion. Microtransfused maternal cells were present in the umbilical cord blood of both infants. Conclusion: In this study, the number of infants with HIV-specific immune responses decreased with the use of MTCT interventions, indicating reduced exposure to HIV in these infants. This is the first study to demonstrate both microtransfusion and HIV-specific immune responses in uninfected infants. Microtransfusion may facilitate viral exposure, resulting in the development of potentially protective immune responses in infants born to HIV-infected women.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EUI</field><field name="subject">Microtransfusion</field><field name="subject">HIV</field><field name="subject">Mother-to-child transmission</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pair-Design: an empirical perspective. The effects of Pair-Design on the quality of products and the efficiency and productivity of the process.</field><field name="creator">Al-Kilidar, Hiyam, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">As competition for sophisticated software innovations continues to escalate, so does the need to develop better quality products through efficient and productive processes. Delivering design-products of high quality standards is crucial to improve the quality of the final product and the efficiency of the whole development process. There is empirical evidence to support improving quality of code by utilising pair programming. Nevertheless, mixed findings about the efficiency and productivity of the pair programming process are also reported. Literature asserts that the early detection and fixing of errors and faults will contribute to a more efficient and productive development lifecycle. However, empirical studies of the application of the Pair-Work techniques into earlier phases of the development lifecycle such as the design phase have not been adequately investigated. Conducting empirical research to evaluate the quality of design-products is challenging. The difficulty is not only associated with the precise identification of quality attributes and measures of design products, but also in how to extract such information from the many different design styles. The research reported in this thesis provides details of an empirical study that evaluated quality of design artefacts as well as the efficiency and productivity of the design-process of pair and solo designers. An experimentation program was designed and conducted with 175 student subjects. The experimental program investigated 3 main research questions: (1) Does the Pair-design process have an effect on the quality of designs when compared to solo-design process? (2) Does the pair design process affect the efficiency and productivity of the design process when compared with solo design process? (3) What factors affected the experience and practices of partners in the pair-design process? The findings showed that when compared with solo designing, the Pair-Design process positively affected the quality of the design-products. Other findings showed that the when measured in person-hours, the efficiency of the Pair-Design process was less than that of the solo- design process. However, when measured in hours of elapsed time, the pair design process was largely more efficient than the solo design process. The pair design process positively affected the productivity of the design process compared to the solo design process. It was also shown that pair design improved design performance of partners when they subsequently designed as solos. Partners also reported having a better learning experience, more confidence in their output products, better sense of achievement and a more enjoyable experience.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Invasive alien species and the protection of biodiversity: the role of quarantine laws in resolving inadequacies in the international legal regime</field><field name="creator">Riley, Sophie, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">The problem of invasive alien species (IAS) is recognized as the second most serious threat to loss of biodiversity after habitat destruction. It is a problem largely created by humans as they transport and introduce species, deliberately and accidentally, from one part of the globe to another. The pressures exerted on biodiversity by international trade are one of the most serious aspects of the IAS problem. Although states are under obligations in international environmental law to prevent the entry of, and control, those alien species that threaten biodiversity, to date state practice has often been found wanting. In particular, quarantine regulation, which can be a state??s first line of defence against IAS, is mainly used by states to protect their farming and agricultural product sectors rather than biodiversity at large. The reasons for this include lack of domestic resources and lack of guidance at the international level. However, even if states were to expand the purview of quarantine, the question arises whether they would be able to use quarantine regulation to protect biodiversity from IAS while simultaneously fulfilling their international trade law obligations. This study seeks to answer this question by examining international environmental law and international trade law in their application to quarantine regulation. In doing so, the study identifies many areas of conflict. The different policies that underpin environmental and trade regimes mean that environmental concepts, such as the precautionary principle and the ecosystem approach, are difficult to apply within the international trade law regime. A way of achieving a more harmonized international response to the problem of IAS is suggested by incorporating environmental considerations into the international standards used by states to design and implement domestic quarantine measures. To facilitate the practical implementation of international standards the study further recommends appropriate financial and institutional capacity building mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SPS Agreement</field><field name="subject">Invasive Alien Species</field><field name="subject">Quarantine</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systematic investigation of relevant predictors, moderations and mediations for intention to speed, drink-drive, drive while fatigued, and not wear a seat belt, amongst young NSW drivers</field><field name="creator">Fernandes, Ralston, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Road trauma is recognized as a major public health problem worldwide (particularly for younger drivers), and risky driving has been identified as an important contributor to road crashes. It is often assumed that similar factors influence all risky driving behaviours, although direct and systematic examination of the differences between risky driving behaviours in terms of precipitating factors is lacking. The present thesis sought to undertake a systematic investigation of relevant factors in the prediction of four key risky driving behaviours (speeding, drink-driving, driving while fatigued, and not wearing seat belts).  Four versions of a Risky Driving Questionnaire were developed to assess beliefs, personality factors and behavioural intentions, in relation to each of the four behaviours. Four versions of the Implicit Association Test were developed to assess attitudes toward each of the four behaviours, without reliance on self-report (in terms of the relative strength of pairs of associations). Data were collected from a student sample (N=215: Study 1), as well as urban (N=587) and rural (N=422) general population samples (Study 2), and regression models were examined for each of the four behaviours, with interaction terms to assess moderations involving perceived risk. Mediations involving gender were also assessed.  Results indicate that different risky driving behaviours are predicted by different factors. For example, in the urban sample, speeding was predicted by driver anger and illusory invulnerability, drink driving was predicted by peer influence, driving while fatigued was predicted by the perceived benefits of not driving while fatigued, and not wearing seat belts was predicted by the (sensation seeking x illusory invulnerability) interaction. Results also suggest that different predictors of risky driving behaviours are relevant for different driver populations. For example, speeding was predicted by authority rebellion in the urban sample, and by sensation seeking in the rural sample. Observed moderations of perceived risk suggest that relationships between perceived risk and risky driving may differ for males versus females, and for low versus high sensation seekers. Findings suggest that future road safety interventions should be based on research of the determinants of individual risky driving behaviours, and in specific driver populations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Young Drivers</field><field name="subject">Risky Driving</field><field name="subject">Perceived Risk</field><field name="subject">Motivation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early detection of blood loss using a noninvasive finger photoplethysmographic pulse oximetry waveform</field><field name="creator">Chan, Gregory, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Delayed control of haemorrhage or blood loss has been recognised as a major contributor to preventable trauma deaths, but early detection of internal bleeding is difficult due to unreliability of heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) as markers of volume status. This thesis explores a novel method of early blood loss detection using a noninvasive finger photoplethysmographic (PPG) pulse oximetry waveform that is normally utilised in pulse oximeters for estimating arterial oxygen saturation.  Graded head-up tilt (n = 13) and blood donation (n = 43) in human volunteers were selected as experimental models of mild to moderate blood loss. From the tilt study, a novel method for automatically detecting left ventricular ejection time (LVET) from the finger PPG waveform has been developed and verified by comparison with the LVET measured from aortic flow velocity. PPG waveform derived LVET (LVETp) and pulse transit time (PTT) were strongly correlated with aortic LVET and pre-ejection period respectively (median r = 0.954 and 0.964) and with the decrease in central blood volume indicated by the sine of the tilt angle (median r = -0.985 and 0.938), outperforming R-R interval (RRI) and BP in detecting mild central hypovolaemia. In the blood donation study, progressive blood loss was characterised by falling LVETp and rising PTT (p &lt; 0.01). A new way of identifying haemorrhagic phases by monitoring changes and trends in LVETp, PTT and RRI has been proposed based on the results from the two studies.  The utility of frequency spectrum analysis of PPG waveform variability (PPGV) in characterising blood loss has also been examined. A new technique of PPGV analysis by computing the coherence-weighted cross-spectrum has been proposed. It has been shown that the spectral measures of finger PPGV exhibited significant changes (p &lt; 0.01) with blood donation and were mildly correlated with systemic vascular resistance in intensive care unit patients (r from 0.53 to 0.59, p &lt; 0.0001), therefore may be useful for identification of different haemorrhagic phases.  In conclusion, this thesis has established finger PPG waveform as a potentially useful noninvasive tool for early detection of blood loss.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system</field><field name="subject">Haemorrhage</field><field name="subject">Arterial pulse</field><field name="subject">Photoplethysmography</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Operability analysis of a multiple-stage membrane process</field><field name="creator">Yee, Kevin Wing Kan, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Membrane processes have found increasing industrial applications worldwide.  For membrane processes to deliver their desired performances and mitigate the effect of disturbances, automatic controllers must be installed.  Before the installation of controllers, operability analysis is a crucial step to evaluate how well the processes can be controlled, and to determine how process design can be improved for better control. However, existing applications of operability analysis in membrane processes are limited.  This thesis extends the application of operability analysis to a multiple-stage membrane process, exemplified by a detailed case study of a 12-stage industrial whey ultrafiltration (UF) process.   Process dynamic models are determined to describe the transient behaviour of process performance caused by disturbances and long-term fouling. Steady-state nonlinear operability analysis is conducted to identify inherent limitations of the process. Using the process dynamic models, dynamic operability analysis is performed to determine the effects of dynamic behaviour on process and controller design.  Steady-state operability analysis shows that the whey UF process is not able to mitigate the effects of high concentrations of true protein in the fresh whey feed.  The ability of the process to mitigate the effects of disturbances is also adversely affected by long-term membrane fouling.  Mid-run washing is therefore necessary to restore control performance after long periods of operation.  Besides demonstrating the adverse effects of long-term membrane fouling on operability, dynamic operability analysis identifies the manipulated variables that can deliver the best control performance. It also indicates that control performance can be improved by installing equipment (e.g. buffer tanks) upstream of the process.  Dynamic operability analysis shows that recycling of the retentate stream has a profound effect on the plant-wide dynamics and reduces significantly the achievable speed of process response under automatic control.  However, retentate recycling is essential during operation to minimize membrane fouling. Although reducing the number of stages in the whey UF process can improve the achievable speed of process response under automatic control, process performance will fluctuate significantly from its desired level. A trade-off therefore exists between process performance and control performance that should be addressed during process and controller design.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operability</field><field name="subject">Multiple-stage processes</field><field name="subject">Whey ultrafiltration</field><field name="subject">Automatic control</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification, elimination and reduction of barriers to the effective use of respiratory personal protective equipment</field><field name="creator">Wallaart, Johannes Christiaan, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the identification, elimination and reduction of barriers to the use of personal respiratory protective equipment (RPE) in the workplace to reduce and prevent occupational inhalation disease.  Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE) is widely used in industry, health, emergency response, military settings and many other applications and are in daily use by thousands of people in Australasia.   The equipment is generally used to filter or ab/adsorb the contaminants from the air prior to delivery to the wearer by filtering or ad/absorbing contaminants from the air prior to being breathed.  There is increasing concerns being expressed worldwide as well as in Australia and New Zealand about the apparent increase in diagnosed occupational diseases and the use of RPE is an essential preventative measure able to be adopted by workplaces.  The use of this type of equipment is the option after the preferred options of elimination and isolation of the individual from the contaminant in the atmosphere.  In spite of this, many different types of RPE are routinely in use.    There are, however, enormous practical, physiological and psychological difficulties in the wearing of RPE.  Concerns have been expressed in the literature as well as in practical situations that many different types of RPE was unable to meet the needs of workers, particularly as related to airflows and that current standards did not reflect the real-life workplace demands.  This work set out to determine an improved methodology for users to determine the total inward leakage (TIL), the different types and quantities of airflows, particularly Peak Inspiratory Air Flows (PIAF).  When communicating (an essential aspect in the workplace for safety reasons), PIAFs rise dramatically.  This work showed that PIAF were very high, particularly when communicating, and is likely to exceed the ability of many commercial types of commercially available respiratory equipment as well being in excess of the  certification requirements of standard bodies.  In addition, Minute Volumes (MV) in a typical Australian workforce were shown to be very variable between individuals and current certification requirement of airflows do not appear to reflect practical use.  The thesis further investigated using a questionnaire survey, the knowledge and current intervention measures adopted by farmers in different sections of agriculture, particularly dairy farming.  Agriculture in New Zealand is a critical economic activity, employing 10% of the total workforce.  This work showed that in spite of many different types of intervention activity spread over many years by Government agencies and private organisations to date, limited awareness exists of inhalation diseases and appropriate types of RPE in different applications (for example, confined space applications).  The research would suggest that a different and more intensive approach is needed by Government agencies to address the problem in this workplace community if workplace inhalation diseases are to be reduced in the future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PPE</field><field name="subject">Respirator</field><field name="subject">Airflows</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reassembling scholarly publishing: open access, institutional repositories and the process of change</field><field name="creator">Kennan, Mary Anne, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Open access (OA) to scholarly publishing is encouraged and enabled by new technologies such as the Internet, the World Wide Web, their standards and protocols, and search engines.  Institutional repositories (IR) as the most recent technological incarnations of OA enable researchers and their institutions to make accessible the outputs of research. While many OA repositories are being implemented, researchers are surprisingly slow in adopting them. While activists promote OA as emanating from the ideals of scholarship, others revile OA as undermining of scholarly publishing's economic base and therefore undermining quality control and peer review.   Change is occurring but there are contested views and actions. This research seeks to increase understanding of the issues by addressing the research questions: "How and why is open access reassembling scholarly publishing?" and "What role does introducing an open access institutional repository to researchers play in this reassembly?"  This thesis contributes to answering these questions by investigating two IR implementations and the research communities they serve. The research was conducted as an Actor-Network Theory (ANT) field study, where the actors were followed and their relations and controversies explored in action as their landscape was being contested.  The research found that central to our understanding of the reassembling of scholarly publishing is the agency emerging from the sociomaterial relations of the OA vision, IR technology and researchers.  Being congruent with the aims of scholarship, and also being flexible and mutable, the OA vision enrols researchers to enact it through OA IR, thus transforming scholarly communications. This is counteracted by publishers aligned with the academic reward network within traditional publishing networks. In this delicate choreography the OA IR, its developers, researchers, university administrators and policy makers are merging as critical actors with their more or less congruent vision of OA enacted in their network. The comparative ANT account of the two IR life stories shows how such enactment depends on the degree to which different OA visions could converge, enrol and mobilise other actors, in particular institutional actors, such as a mandate, in transforming researchers' publishing behaviour. This thesis contributes to a novel and in-depth understanding of OA and IR and their roles in reassembling scholarly publishing. It also contributes to the use of ANT in information systems research by advancing a sociomaterial ontology which recognises the intertwining of human and material agency.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Institutional repositories.</field><field name="subject">Scholarly publishing.</field><field name="subject">Open access.</field><field name="subject">Actor network theory.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43924</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies into global asset allocation strategies using the markov-switching model</field><field name="creator">Emery, Martin, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the potential opportunities of global asset allocation and the possible enhancement of these opportunities from using a Markov Switching Model.  The thesis extends upon previous conditional asset pricing studies in global asset allocation, such as those done by Ilamnen (1995), Harvey, Solnik and Zhou (1992) and Bilson (1993), where expected future returns are forecast based on conditional variables.  The finding of these studies, and many others, are combined with the works on Markov Switching models and market segmentation theories to create a uniform structure for analysing regime switching properties in currencies, international equities and international bond markets.  This thesis is segregated into 4 major sections.  The chapters 1-4 develop a unified framework that is used in the analysis of markets.  The chapters 5-7 are focused on currencies, international equities and international bonds.  For each market a model is constructed that is based upon the structure proposed by Frankel and Froot (1988).  In this model the market is segmented into two groups ?? value based investors and momentum based investors.  To replicate this structure, a two regime Markov Switching model is used, where one regime is constructed as a value regime and the second is constructed as a momentum regime.  These models are then compared to linear versions of the models, to see whether there is any additional benefit to the application of regime switching methods.  In conjunction with testing the potential benefits of the Markov Regime Switching process, this study also investigates the very nature, or characteristics of regime switching in the international markets.  This is undertaken though some alternate models and enhancements to see whether there is any predictability, or characterisations can be made of the switching process.  To ensure a comprehensive analysis, several analytical methods have been used, including extensive econometric modelling, statistical analysis of forecasts and portfolio back testing.  A number of conclusions can be drawn from the results.  Firstly it appears that there is substantial evidence of regime switching in international markets, such as that shown in a Frankel-Froot framework.  This in turn has major implication for the understanding of the way in which international markets function, and further the empirical evidence supports many of the anecdotal observations of market based participants.  Secondly, there appears to be a strong level of economic relevance to the modelling.  The models are shown to generate a theoretical economic profit, which shows that the international markets are only semi efficient.  Further, forecasts generated from the Markov Switching models outperform the linear counterparts in economic significance in portfolio tests.  However, for both equities and bonds, the general accuracy of the forecast tends to be inferior to the linear counterparts.  Finally, the nature of regime switching is investigated in detail, particularly in reference to 3 potential drivers ?? greed, fear and success.  The evidence shows that these can help explain the characteristics of regime switching, as in some cases potentially adding economic value.  However, it seems that success is more important than a broader economic environment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asset Allocation</field><field name="subject">Markov Switching</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of merging and environment on galaxies and clusters of galaxies</field><field name="creator">Owers, Matthew Scott, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses two fundamental questions in astrophysics: (i) To what extent is environment a driver of galaxy evolution? And (ii) How does hierarchical structure formation affect the galaxy environment? The former is addressed by examining the environments of starburst galaxies, the latter by examining clusters undergoing major mergers with focus placed on the efficacy of ??cold fronts?? in identifying systems that have recently undergone a major merger - an essential first step to understanding their impact.  For the first of these studies, the 2dFGRS was exploited to select large samples of starburst galaxies. These were used to derive measurements of the local and large-scale environments, clustering properties, and morphologies of starburst galaxies. It is found local environment is most germane in terms of a starburst triggering mechanism, with the starburst galaxies showing an excess of close (&lt;20 kpc) neighbours with comparable luminosity/mass, while 20-30% exhibit a morphology consistent with them being involved in an ongoing tidal/merger interaction. On large scales (5-15 Mpc), the starburst galaxies were found to be much less clustered compared to the overall 2dFGRS population, and were not preferentially found in rich clusters with just over half residing in low to intermediate luminosity groups. However, in a number of cases, evidence for obvious local environmental influences was lacking, indicating starbursts can also be internally driven.  For the latter study, the Chandra, archive was used to select a sample of clusters exhibiting ??cold front?? features. Selection required the presence of significant density jumps (&gt;1.5 at the lower 90% CI) in the intracluster medium and for the gas on the denser side of the front to be cooler. From this sample, the clusters Abell 1201, Abell 2163, RXJ1720.1+2638, and Abell 3667 were targeted for comprehensive spectroscopic follow-up at optical wavelengths using the 3.9m Anglo Australian and 6.5m Multiple Mirror Telescopes. Using 321 spectroscopically confirmed members for Abell 1201, 550 for Abell 3667 and 491 for Abell 2163 it is shown that these clusters contain substructure which can be directly related to the cold fronts, whilst for 335 confirmed members in RXJ1720.1+2638 promising evidence exists for merger activity related to the cold front. Despite the range of different types of cold fronts and substructures detected, it is clear that cold fronts are robust signposts of merger activity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">galaxies</field><field name="subject">clusters of galaxies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42795</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Communicating astrobiology in public: A study of scientific literacy</field><field name="creator">Oliver, Carol Ann, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The majority of adults in the US and in Europe appear to be scientifically illiterate. This has not changed in more than half a century. It is unknown whether the Australian public is also scientifically illiterate because no similar testing is done here. Public scientific illiteracy remains in spite of improvements in science education, innovative approaches to public outreach, the encouraging of science communication via the mass media, and the advent of the Internet. Why is it that there has been so little change? Is school science education inadequate? Does something happen between leaving high school education and becoming an adult? Does Australia suffer from the same apparent malady?  The pilot study at the heart of this thesis tests a total of 692 Year Ten (16-year-old) Australian students across ten high schools and a first year university class in 2005 and 2006, using measures applied to adults. Twenty-six percent of those tested participated in a related scientific literacy project utilising in-person visits to Macquarie University in both years. A small group of the students (64) tested in 2005 were considered the best science students in seven of the ten high schools. Results indicate that no more than 20% of even the best high school science students - on the point of being able to end their formal science education - are scientifically literate if measured by adult standards. Another pilot test among 150 first year university students supports that indication. This compares to a scientific literacy rate of 28% for the US public.  This thesis finds that the scientific literacy enterprise ?? in all its forms ?? fails scrutiny.  Either we believe our best science students are leaving high school scientifically illiterate or there is something fundamentally wrong in our perceptions of public scientific illiteracy. This pilot study ?? probably the first of its kind ?? indicates we cannot rely on our current perceptions of a scientifically illiterate public. It demonstrates that a paradigm shift in our thinking is required about what scientific literacy is and in our expectations of a scientifically literate adult public.  In the worst case scenario, governments are pouring millions of dollars into science education and public outreach with little or no basis for understanding whether either is effective. That is illogical, even irresponsible. It also impacts on the way astrobiology ?? or any science ?? is communicated in public.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">astrobiology</field><field name="subject">scientific literacy</field><field name="subject">public understanding of science</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42878</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The governance of AIDS in China: assessing the impact of global norms</field><field name="creator">Hague, Rowan, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis documents the development of the Chinese government??s response to HIV/AIDS in the context of the global AIDS regime in order to assess when, how and to what extent international AIDS norms have had an impact upon China??s governance of AIDS. Employing an applied constructivist framework, the thesis argues that the impact of global norms at the domestic level has been contingent on a) the socializing actions of norm entrepreneurs, b) the domestic political context and c) crisis. In the case of China and the impact of global AIDS norms, the central argument is that key elements of China??s domestic political context minimized the socializing affects of the global AIDS regime until the SARS crisis in 2003 led to a reappraisal of AIDS in the context of political legitimacy, at which time global AIDS norms began to have increasing salience in China. This thesis begins by identifying the evolution of a global AIDS regime before moving on to an exploration of China??s domestic political context. The thesis then documents and analyses China??s governance of AIDS from 1985 to 2007 through the use of five indicators ?? political commitment, legislation and policy, representation of AIDS in the media, the participation of civil society, and international engagement. The findings demonstrate that there has been a significant change between China??s pre-SARS and post-SARS AIDS governance with China acting increasingly in accordance with global norms following the SARS crisis of 2003. The thesis proposes that the SARS crisis was catalytic in that it exposed the vulnerability of the Chinese government??s claims to legitimacy, and in so doing, enabled the domestic political context to shift, allowing health, and by extension AIDS, to be reframed as a political issue. Importantly however, when the Chinese government scaled up its response to the epidemic it was able to be guided by the normative framework prescribed by the global AIDS regime.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">constructivism</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">global norms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The transformation in direct private share ownership in Australia: Embourgeoisement? Democracy?</field><field name="creator">Ivancic, Antonny John, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The increase in direct personal investment in capital market assets by Australians over the past two decades represents an unprecedented engagement with that sector of Australian economic life. This dissertation critically investigates claims that this engagement heralds a shareholder democracy. Increased economic participation based on private direct ownership of corporate securities could be interpreted as a weak form of democratisation. Using a class-theoretical framework, the dissertation conceptualises the private shareholder phenomenon as a process of embourgeoisement and argues that the development of a macro-level mass consumer financial products market is the result of capitalist class development and expansion. A thesis of strong democratisation proffers the notion that the private shareholder, as an ascendant class of financial actor, engages with real democratic processes in addition to simply owning securities. To test this thesis the dissertation measures the extent to which small shareholders control the objective conditions under which they accumulate greater wealth by seeking evidence of potential or actual engagement with macro-market and meso-corporate level social processes. The dissertation assesses macro-level practice by drawing on the work of Bourdieu and on notions of the social field. It considers the entry of the new class of financial actor to the financial field and analyses their capacity to accumulate and deploy informational capital, and compares their ability to influence a state-sponsored economic reform process (CLERP) with that of other actors. The dissertation analyses longitudinal ownership and shareholder voting data from a set of over 30 major Australian companies. It finds that the new class of economic actor is most prevalent in privatised state-owned enterprises and mutuals. In the context of an ideal Habermasian public sphere, the study considers the potential for small shareholders to participate in meso-level, corporate agenda-setting and deliberation. Using the ideal political space of Arendt, it searches for methods of achieving democratic outcomes. The dissertation finds that while the personal ownership of tradable financial assets may constitute a weak form of economic democratisation, small shareholders?? inability to influence real outcomes, even in companies in which they constitute the majority, places substantial restrictions on the overall strength of the share ownership-as-democracy thesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">class analysis</field><field name="subject">share ownership</field><field name="subject">democratisation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42985</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Method development in electrospray ionisation fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry study of plant oils - macadamia oil as a model</field><field name="creator">Mokhtari-Fard, Ahmad, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A novel analytical method is developed to examine the chemical composition of plant oils by electrospray ionisation high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry in both positive- and negative-ion modes. To date, this is the first reported application of this technique for the study of macadamia nut oil. Samples of macadamia nut oil from the Macadamia Integrifolia- Proteaceae family (smooth shell) are examined. The fatty acid profile of the oil is obtained by this mass spectrometric examination of the transesterified and hydrolysed oil samples. The Fourier transform ion-cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry results are compared to those obtained from similar samples using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry  techniques. High performance liquid chromatography and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry are used to separate and assign the isomers present in the methanol extract of the oils in separate experiments. Significant results in this study include: - The first observation and identity of a number of oxidised triacylglycerols in macadamia oil samples. - The first observation of oxidised and free fatty acids, measured directly in hydrolysed oil and in the methanol extract of macadamia oil. - High resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry in broadband mode which enables isobars to be observed. - Esterified oil Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry results are consistent with our gas chromatography-mass spectrometry results and with the results of similar studies on macadamia oil in the literature. - A number of fatty acids with odd number of carbon atoms are observed in the oil. - In electrospray ionisation Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry of oils, the sample preparation is straightforward. The sample is dissolved in methanol or acetonitrile and the solution is introduced to the electrospray source directly. Introducing oil samples to the gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer needs the oils to be esterified prior to the analysis. - In this work, state-of-the-art mass spectrometry demonstrates distinct advantages in comparison to gas chromatography measurements such as direct identification of free fatty acids in oil samples, whereas this is not possible in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry due to the required esterification step prior to the analysis. - High performance liquid chromatography fraction collection is combined with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry in off-line mode and found to improve the sensitivity, selectivity and signal to noise levels due to the lower number of compounds in each high performance liquid chromatography fraction compared to the methanol extract of macadamia oil sample.

This continuum theory births the proposal of a new class of physical tensors described as the Intrinsic Field Tensors capable of generalising the response of most classical mechanical metrics, a number of specialised formulations and the solutions shown to be kinematically intermediate.

The TNFR associated factor (TRAF) family are signal adapter molecules that are recruited to various members of the TNFR family and are important for the transduction of signals downstream of these receptors.  In these studies, gene targeting was used to create a mouse capable of undergoing conditional inactivation of the Traf3 gene.  These mice were studied alongside previously generated mice that were similarly genetically modified with respect to the Traf2 gene.  The mice produced lacked expression of either TRAF2 or TRAF3 in either B or T cells.  In resting B cells TRAF2 and TRAF3 were shown to cooperate to negatively regulate the signalling of B cell activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF) and its receptor (BAFF-R), the TNF ligand and receptor pair that provide obligate survival signals to B cells.  Thus, TRAF2- and TRAF3-deficient B cells displayed hyperactive NF-kB2 signalling, an increased ability to survive, and almost identical gene expression profiles, emphasizing the cooperative nature of their roles in resting B cells.  Importantly, the survival of these B cells was completely independent of BAFF.  In normal B cells, BAFF signalling was shown to lift the negative regulation of survival mediated by TRAF2 and TRAF3, by depleting TRAF3 from the cell.  This process was shown to require TRAF2.  T cells deficient in TRAF2 or TRAF3 also displayed hyperactivity of the NF-kB2 pathway, but they did not accumulate in vivo or show extended survival in vitro.  Mice lacking TRAF2 or TRAF3 in their T cells did however display a decrease in the number of memory phenotype CD8+ T cells.  These studies indicate that some of the roles of TRAF2 and TRAF3 are common between B and T cells.  However, the consequences of loss of TRAF2 or TRAF3 in B and T cells differs considerably, presumably due to the differential TNFR expression and usage by each cell type.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">B lymphocyte</field><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="subject">Signalling</field><field name="subject">TRAF</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the influence of Edo and Meiji period monster art on contemporary Japanese visual media</field><field name="creator">Papp, Zilia, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Abstract Japanese anime being an important part of modern and contemporary popular visual culture, its aesthetic merits, its roots in Japanese visual arts as well as its rich symbology derived from Japanese folkloristic, literary and religious themes are worth investigating. This research aims to track the visual links between Edo and Meiji period monster art (y??kai-ga) paintings and modern day anime by concentrating on the works of Edo and Meiji period painters and the post-war period animation and manga series Gegegeno Kitaro, created by Mizuki Shigeru. Some of the Japanese origins of anime and manga imagery can be traced back to the early 12th century Ch??j?? Giga animal scrolls, where comic art and narrative pictures first appear. However, more recent sources are found in woodblock prints of the late Edo period. These prints are the forerunners of manga in that dialogues appear with the image, generally no anatomical details are given nor are they in perspective, but often a mood is expressed in a cartoon-like manner. The visual rendering of y??kai (monsters) is a Japanese cultural phenomenon: y??kai paintings originate in the Muromachi period, and take up part of the visual arts of that era. The distinct monster (y??kai) imagery emerging in the late Edo to early Meiji periods is the focus of this research. Investigating the Gegegeno Kitaro series, the study pinpoints the visual roots of the animation characters in the context of y??kai folklore and Edo and Meiji period monster painting traditions. Being a very popular series consisting of numerous episodes broadcast from the 1960s to the present time, by analyzing the changing images related to the representation of monsters in the series the study documents the changes in the perception of monsters in this time period, while it reflects on the importance of Mizuki??s work in keeping visual traditions alive and educating new audiences about folklore by recasting y??kai imagery in modern day settings in an innovative way. Additionally, by analyzing and comparing character, set, costume and mask design, plot and storyline of y??kai-themed films, the study attempts to shed light on the roles the representations of y??kai have been assigned in post-war Japanese cinema.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">animation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of phosphorus-donor based silicon qubit and nanoelectronic devices</field><field name="creator">Escott, Christopher Colin, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Modelling of phosphorus donor-based silicon (Si:P) qubit devices and mesoscopic single-electron devices is presented in this thesis.

The mesoscopic properties of single and double island devices with source-drain leads is investigated through ion implantation simulation (using Crystal-TRIM), 3D capacitance extraction (FastCap) and single-electron circuit simulation (SIMON). Results from modelling two generations of single and double island Si:P devices are given, which are shown to accurately capture their charging behaviour. The trends extracted are used to forecast limits to the reduction in size of this Si:P architecture. Theoretical analysis of P2+:Si charge qubits is then presented.

The charge qubit energy levels are calculated using the atomistic simulator NEMO 3-D coupled to TCAD calculations of the electrostatic potential distribution, further demonstrating the precise control required over the position of the donors. Theory has also been developed to simulate the microwave spectroscopy of P2+:Si charge qubits in a decohering environment using Floquet theory. This theory uses TCAD finite-volume modelling to incorporate realistic fields from actual device gate geometries. The theory is applied to a specific P2+:Si charge qubit device design to study the effects of fabrication variations on the measurement signal. The signal is shown to be a sensitive function of donor position. Design and analysis of two different spin qubit architectures concludes this thesis. The first uses a high-barrier Schottky contact, SET and an implanted P donor to create a double-well suitable for implementation as a qubit. The second architecture is a MOS device that combines an electron reservoir and SET into a single structure, formed from a locally depleted accumulation layer. The design parameters of both architectures are explored through capacitance modelling, TCAD simulation, tunnel barrier transmission and NEMO 3-D calculations. The results presented strengthen the viability of each architecture, and show a large &#916;q (&gt; 0.1e) can be expected.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">qubit</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">nanoelectronic</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41470</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investment manager trading behaviour and fund performance</field><field name="creator">Gardner, Peter Alan, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation investigates three types of investment manager trading behaviour to ascertain whether behavioural biases are present in the Australian investment management industry.  In particular, this thesis examines whether these biases are detrimental to fund performance and market efficiency, and whether there is a need for regulatory review given the behaviour of institutions in their trading on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).  The three empirical issues examined in this thesis are: leader and follower patterns in institutional trading; quarter-end gaming behaviour; and short-term trading activity and the role of institutional monitoring.  Firstly, in the analysis of leader-follower behaviour, this thesis finds profitable trade packages are executed using multiple brokers as a way to accumulate a larger package in a shorter window of time and as means of enhancing disguise.  Profitability is higher when these trade packages are mimicked and when there are up to three mimickers, compared to situations in which no mimicking occurs. Potential mimickers do not appear to ignore their own signal when deciding whether or not to follow when the sequence is short, but may do so for longer sequences as predicted by Grenadier (1999). It is concluded that short sequences of mimicking trades by active fund managers speed the price discovery process. Secondly, in an investigation of ??portfolio pumping?? by Australian active investment managers, this thesis finds significant abnormal stock and fund returns on the final business day of the calendar quarter-end.  This thesis then identifies particular trades, appearing mostly in less liquid stocks, which accompany stocks that are marked up at quarter-end (it is not possible in this thesis to prove causation given the trades in this sample are not time-stamped).  Fund managers execute more purchases than normal on the last day of the quarter in stocks in which they are overweight, providing strong evidence that manager behaviour is modified on the last day of the quarter-end.  This study also finds poor-performing managers are more likely to perpetrate gaming trades, which may be as a result of career concerns and business risk management.  New investors in funds would benefit substantially by delaying their entry to the fund until the day after the end of the quarter, as there is a lower entry price into the fund.  However, portfolio pumping does not substantially affect the returns of extant fund investors, as the trading cost associated with the relatively small gaming trades is relatively small.  Attempts by the ASX to reduce price manipulation, such as instituting a closing price call auction and then later revising the algorithm of this auction, have been effective in limiting both the number of occurrences, as well as the severity of gaming on the efficiency of the market. Thirdly, in an examination of the short-term trading activity of active investment managers which threaten exit, this thesis find that a larger number of actively trading multi-blockholders significantly raises firm performance. It remains true that an individual blockholder who intervenes to raise firm performance has to share gains with other blockholders. But firm manager effort is enhanced by the threat of exit by blockholders when they receive a bad signal concerning managerial effort. This study tests seven nested hypotheses proposed by Edmans and Manso (2008) using sequences of short-term institutional trades that threaten exit. Blockholder net profit is diminishing in the number of traders, consistent with a common signal of poor managerial performance. Moreover, these trade sequences are profitable even after transaction costs. Spreads are lower and the firm??s share price becomes more sensitive to managerial performance as more blockholders threaten exit. From the three broad investigations into fund manager activity this thesis undertakes, active fund managers are shown to behave rationally and, apart from their behaviour at quarter-end, they act in the interests of their investors, aid price discovery, reduce bid-ask spreads and thereby exhibit a positive influence on market efficiency.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blockholders</field><field name="subject">Herding</field><field name="subject">Pumping</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Orthokeratology epithelial changes and susceptibility to microbial infection</field><field name="creator">Choo, Jennifer Denise, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Orthokeratology (OK) is a specialty contact lens procedure that involves the overnight wear of lenses to reshape the corneal tissue resulting in clear vision upon lens removal.  Currently it is the only way of achieving clear vision without having to wear spectacles or contact lenses during the day or undergoing refractive surgery.  This thesis investigated the effects of this procedure on the corneal epithelium and the potential increase in risk of microbial infection in an animal model.  The cat was first established as an appropriate animal model in a pilot study to examine OK epithelial changes.  Initial findings of epithelial thickness changes similar to those found with human myopic and hyperopic OK clinical studies led to the further development of this animal model to better mimic human lens wear for the remaining studies undertaken.  Histological studies were used to examine epithelial effects of overnight myopic OK lens wear.  Repeatable and differential effects on epithelial thickness and morphology across the cornea were found, including thinning of the central and peripheral epithelium and thickening of the mid-peripheral epithelium.  Central thinning was attributed to compression of cells and was less in overnight wear compared to continuous wear.  Mid-peripheral thickening was due to increased cell layers and peripheral thinning was attributed to cellular compression.  Recovery of epithelial morphologic and thickness changes commenced one day after ceasing lens wear and was complete within one week.  Minimal changes to keratocyte populations in regions adjacent to epithelial thickness changes were found.  Microbiological studies investigated the effect of epithelial changes on corneal susceptibility to bacterial infections by exposing OK-treated corneas to large amounts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  The hypothesis that OK lenses increased susceptibility to infection (within the time tested) was rejected as no infections were produced in any animals (except the positive scratch control).  Length of OK treatment, duration and quantity of bacterial exposure, lens wearing schedule and bacterial strain type did not affect susceptibility to infection.  The epithelium is a major contributor to OK-induced corneal changes.  These epithelial changes are reversible and do not appear to predispose to infection provided corneal integrity is maintained.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infection</field><field name="subject">Orthokeratology</field><field name="subject">Epithelium</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Correlating structural and optical properties of silicon nanocrystals embedded in silicon nitride: An experimental study of quantum confinement for photovoltaic applications</field><field name="creator">Scardera, Giuseppe, ARC Centre of Excellence in Advanced Silicon Photovoltaics &amp; Photonics, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Silicon nanocrystals embedded in silicon nitride have received attention as promising materials for optoelectronic applications. More specifically, band gap engineering of novel materials based on silicon nanocrystals has been proposed for possible application in an all-silicon tandem solar cell within the field of `third generation' photovoltaics. Such an application would require nanocrystals to exhibit quantum confinement whereby the optical and electrical properties of a film could be tuned by controlling the size of these `quantum dots'. This thesis investigates the correlation between the structural and optical properties of silicon nanocrystals grown in silicon nitride multilayer structures via solid phase crystallisation, as part of an experimental investigation into quantum confinement.  A study of the relevant processing parameters for the solid phase crystallization of silicon nanocrystals in amorphous silicon nitride is presented and the effectiveness of the multilayer approach for controlling nanocrystal size is demonstrated. Structural characterisation using transmission electron microscopy and glancing incidence x-ray diffraction is complemented with a new application of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for the detection of silicon nanocrystals. A case study on the effects of annealing temperature on the photoluminescence from silicon nitride multilayers is presented. While a clear correlation between the structural, molecular and optical properties is demonstrated, evidence of quantum confinement remains ambiguous. The investigation into the limits of parameter space for the formation of silicon nanocrystals in silicon nitride multilayers also leads to the formation of a novel Si-Si3N4 nanocomposite material. A comprehensive study of the photoluminescence from silicon nanocrystals embedded in nitride is presented in the context of homogeneous and multilayer nitride films. Size dependent PL and absorption is demonstrated for silicon nitride multilayers with silicon-rich silicon nitride layer thicknesses varying from 1 to 4.5 nm, indicating the formation of quantum wells. These same structures are annealed to form arrays of silicon nanocrystals. Although the PL and absorption spectra suggest quantum effects, inherent ambiguities remain. The findings in this thesis provide greater insight into the nature of confinement and indicate the need for further research if the successful implementation of these structures into an all silicon tandem cell is to be achieved.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multilayers</field><field name="subject">silicon nanocrystals</field><field name="subject">silicon nitride</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Salinity hazard mapping and risk assessment in the Bourke irrigation district</field><field name="creator">Buchannan, Sam, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">At no point in history have we demanded so much from our agricultural land whilst simultaneously leaving so little room for management error. Of the many possible environmental impacts from agriculture, soil and water salinisation has some of the most long-lived and deleterious effects. Despite its importance, however, land managers are often unable to make informed decisions of how to manage the risk of salinisation due to a lack of data. Furthermore, there remains no universally agreed method for salinity risk mapping. This thesis addresses these issues by investigating new methods for producing high-resolution predictions of soil salinity, soil physical properties and groundwater depth using a variety of traditional and emerging ancillary data sources. The results show that the methodologies produce accurate predictions yielding natural resource information at a scale and resolution not previously possible. Further to this, a new methodology using fuzzy logic is developed that exploits this information to produce high-resolution salinity risk maps designed to aid both agricultural and natural resource management decisions. The methodology developed represents a new and effective way of presenting salinity risk and has numerous advantages over conventional risk models. The incorporation of fuzzy logic provides a meaningful continuum of salinity risk and allows for the incorporation of uncertainty. The method also allows salinity risk to be calculated relative to any vegetation community and shows where the risk is coming from (root-zone or groundwater) allowing more appropriate management decisions to be made. The development of this methodology takes us a step closer to closing what some have called our greatest gap in agricultural knowledge. That is, our ability to manage the salinity risk at the subcatchment scale.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fuzzy analysis</field><field name="subject">Salinity</field><field name="subject">Precision agriculture</field><field name="subject">Remote sensing</field><field name="subject">Multiple criteria analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The extracellular functions of S100A12</field><field name="creator">Goyette, Jesse Davis, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The S100s comprise a group of Ca2+-binding proteins of the EF-hand superfamily with varied functions. Within this family, three inflammatory-related proteins - S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 - form a subcluster known as the 'calgranulins'. S100A12 levels are elevated in sera from patients with inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. S100A12 is constitutively expressed in neutrophils and induced in monocytes by LPS and TNF&#945;, and in macrophages by IL-6. S100A12 is a potent monocyte and mast cell chemoattractant and its potentiation of mast cell activation by IgE cross-linking indicates an important role in allergic inflammation. Importantly, mast cell-dependent activation of acute inflammatory responses and monocyte recruitment is provoked by S100A12 administration in vivo. S100A12 may also influence adhesion molecule expression on endothelial cells, stimulate IL 1&#946; and TNFinduced in monocytes production in BV 2 microglial cells, and stimulate IL 2 secretion by T lymphocytes via ligation of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE). To date, the only extracellular receptor characterised for S100A12 is RAGE, although additional/alternate receptors are indicated. In particular, recent studies indicate that chemotaxis and mast cell activation by S100A12 are likely mediated by other receptors. The studies presented here investigated some extracellular functions of S100A12, factors influencing these functions and suggest mechanisms that may be involved. In addition to Ca2+, S100A12 binds Zn2+. Chapter 3 explores the relevance Zn2+ binding to S100A12 structure and function. Zn2+ induced formation of complexes, principally hexamers, and this was not influenced by Ca2+. S100A12 inhibited the gelatinolytic activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and  9 by chelating Zn2+ from their active sites. MMPs are important in processes leading to plaque rupture. An antibody that specifically recognised Zn2+-induced complexes was generated and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated S100A12, the hexameric complex, and MMP 2 and  9 co-localisation in human atheroma. These results suggest that hexameric S100A12 may form in vivo and may implicate S100A12 in regulating plaque rupture by inhibiting MMP activity. Interestingly S100A12 synergised with LPS to induce MMP 3 and  13 expression in vitamin D3-differentiated THP 1 macrophages (THP 1 macs). S100A12 regulation of MMP expression and activity indicates that it may be involved in a self-regulatory loop, which depends on relative levels of Zn2+ and on other stimuli (eg LPS) in the inflammatory milieu. Chapter 4 describes the development of tools and methods for assessing interactions of S100A12 with cell surface receptors. To assay surface binding, an alkaline phosphatase fusion protein, a biotinylated hinge peptide and biotinylated recombinant S100A12 were generated; only S100A12 b proved useful. Surface binding of S100A12 was detected on several monocytoid/macrophage and mast cells using flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. Some cells contained intracytoplasmic granular structures that were S100A12-positive. Unexpectedly, a subpopulation of cells in murine bone marrow-derived mast cell cultures that expressed low levels of c-kit, a marker of mature mast cells, bound high levels of S100A12. These may represent haematopoietic stem cells, which express low levels of c kit, and S100A12-mediated functional changes of these cells is worthy of characterisation. Unlike interactions of S100A8/A9 with endothelial cells, pre-incubation of S100A12 with Zn2+ or heparin had no effect on surface binding to THP 1 macs, indicating that Zn2+-induced structural changes were unlikely to alter receptor interactions. Heparan sulfate moieties are unlikely to mediate surface binding of S100A12 even though S100A12 bound heparin with relatively high affinity. Chapter 5 focussed on mechanisms involved in some S100A12 extracellular functions. Based on experiments studying effects of bovine S100A12 on BV-2 murine microglial cells, S100A12 is proposed to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine in monocytes via RAGE. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells or human THP 1 macs activated with S100A12 did not increase cytokine induction at the mRNA or protein levels, indicating that the 'S100/RAGE pro-inflammatory axis' theory should be re-evaluated. In an attempt to provide insights into a novel receptor, mechanisms involved in S100A12-provoked THP 1 chemotaxis were investigated. This activity was sensitive to pertussis toxin, but not to an ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor, suggesting involvement of a G protein-coupled receptor. Although some RAGE ligands also bind and activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) antibodies to TLR2 and TLR4 did not block S100A12 binding to THP 1 macs. Affinity enrichment and separation of proteins by SDS PAGE and peptide mapping by mass spectrometry identified the &#945; and &#947; subunits of F1 ATP synthase, implicating ATP synthase as a putative receptor. Although primarily mitochondrial, this complex is expressed on the surface of several cell types and was confirmed on THP 1 cells and mast cells by flow cytometry. By modulating surface F1 ATP synthase activity, and thereby extracellular ATP/ADP concentrations, S100A12 may mediate its pro-inflammatory functions through G-protein coupled purinergic receptors. This work has generated new directions for studying mechanisms by which S100A12 influences monocyte/macrophage and mast cell functions that are relevant to important inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis and allergic inflammation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Inflammation</field><field name="subject">S100 proteins</field><field name="subject">S100A12</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genomic sequence processing: gene finding in eukaryotes</field><field name="creator">Akhtar, Mahmood, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Of the many existing eukaryotic gene finding software programs, none are able to guarantee accurate identification of genomic protein coding regions and other biological signals central to pathway from DNA to the protein. Eukaryotic gene finding is difficult mainly due to noncontiguous and non-continuous nature of genes. Existing approaches are heavily dependent on the compositional statistics of the sequences they learn from and are not equally suitable for all types of sequences. This thesis firstly develops efficient digital signal processing-based methods for the identification of genomic protein coding regions, and then combines the optimum signal processing-based non-data-driven technique with an existing data-driven statistical method in a novel system demonstrating improved identification of acceptor splice sites. Most existing well-known DNA symbolic-to-numeric representations map the DNA information into three or four numerical sequences, potentially increasing the computational requirement of the sequence analyzer. Proposed mapping schemes, to be used for signal processing-based gene and exon prediction, incorporate DNA structural properties in the representation, in addition to reducing complexity in subsequent processing. A detailed comparison of all DNA representations, in terms of computational complexity and relative accuracy for the gene and exon prediction problem, reveals the newly proposed ?paired numeric? to be the best DNA representation. Existing signal processing-based techniques rely mostly on the period-3 behaviour of exons to obtain one dimensional gene and exon prediction features, and are not well equipped to capture the complementary properties of exonic / intronic regions and deal with the background noise in detection of exons at their nucleotide levels. These issues have been addressed in this thesis, by proposing six one-dimensional and three multi-dimensional signal processing-based gene and exon prediction features. All one-dimensional and multi-dimensional features have been evaluated using standard datasets such as Burset/Guigo1996, HMR195, and the GENSCAN test set. This is the first time that different gene and exon prediction features have been compared using substantial databases and using nucleotide-level metrics. Furthermore, the first investigation of the suitability of different window sizes for period-3 exon detection is performed. Finally, the optimum signal processing-based gene and exon prediction scheme from our evaluations is combined with a data-driven statistical technique for the recognition of acceptor splice sites. The proposed DSP-statistical hybrid is shown to achieve 43% reduction in false positives over WWAM, as used in GENSCAN.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gaussian mixture models</field><field name="subject">deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)</field><field name="subject">discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs)</field><field name="subject">correlation</field><field name="subject">discrete cosine transforms (DCTs)</field><field name="subject">Eukaryotes</field><field name="subject">Gene mapping -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">DNA -- Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When home is the navel of the world: an ethnography of young Rapa Nui between home and away</field><field name="creator">Andreassen, Olaug Irene Rosvik, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Rapa Nui (Easter Island) has for centuries been known as an isolated island of archaeological mysteries; yet after a rapid modernisation this is today an international tourist destination, a World Heritage Site and a glocalised community.

Two theoretical frameworks were developed. First, an IOIS for SCM Adoption Framework was constructed to understand the IOIS for SCM adoption process. Secondly, an Inter-organisational Collaboration Framework was constructed and used as a lens to examine and understand the process of inter-organisational collaboration. Five underlying theories, namely agency, needs and motivation, resource dependency, cultural and negotiated order, were drawn on to develop an understanding of collaboration in this latter framework.  The study of collaboration for IOIS adoption is exploratory. Eight organisations were approached from three industries and sixteen interviews were carried out with managers who are involved in the supply chain activities. Data was primarily collected using an interview instrument based on literature, and documentary and archival evidence. Interviews were transcribed and cross-case analysis was conducted on the data.  Three of the four levels of collaboration sophistication were supported. At the highest level of collaboration, namely cooperation sophistication, the organisations that were studied have growth motivations, same interests and common business objectives, and prepare to develop strategy and finance projects while reengineering their business processes and redesigning their supply chains collectively. Collaboration is not limited to one dimension but multi-dimensional. An organisation collaborates with its partners in one project but that at the same time, they may not want to collaborate on a different project due to differences in business objectives. When there is a disagreement between parties, negotiation is an important process to help resolve their differences.  The process of collaboration was summarised into three perspectives: industry, intra-organisational and inter-organisational. These perspectives can assist practitioners who need to understand how to address the process of collaboration in the adoption of IOISs for SCM with their partners.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Collaboration</field><field name="subject">Inter-organisational Information System (IOIS)</field><field name="subject">Inter-organisational Information System (IOS)</field><field name="subject">Supply Chain Management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41297</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrical stimulation of cells involved in wound healing</field><field name="creator">Ly, Mai Thanh, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Problem investigated:  Chronic wounds are not only a major burden to the patient arising from general pain and discomfort but also generate economic costs to both these individuals and the health care system.  Various electrical stimulation regimes have been employed to study the effects of electrical stimulation on wound healing both in vivo and in vitro.  In was hypothesised that electrical stimulation using various waveforms can modulate cell function, particularly cell migration.  The aim of this thesis was to study the effects of electrical stimulation on cellular migration, in particular endothelial cells and fibroblasts, key cell types involved in wound healing.  The impact of collagen matrix on cell migration was also assessed.  Methods:  Cells were seeded on either glass or collagen I substrate and stimulated with various electrical regimes via platinum electrodes connected to a constant current source.  Cell migration was accessed by manual tracking of cell nuclei over a period of 3 hours from digital time-lapse images acquired during stimulation.  Data from cell tracking were analysed for directional migration, migration rates and mean square displacement.  Results:  No directional cell migration for both endothelial cells and fibroblasts were observed when stimulated with either alternating or biphasic currents.  However, surface substrate had impacted on cell motility with opposite effects being observed for the two cell types.  Endothelial cells tended to migrate at a faster rate on collagen I substrate than on glass, compared with fibroblasts, which displayed a slower rate of migration on collagen I substrate.  Significant changes in mean square displacement of biphasic current stimulated cells on collagen I substrate compared to unstimulated cells were also observed.  Conclusion:  This thesis has illustrated cell migration can be modulated by electrical stimulation, in particular asymmetric biphasic current.  It has also been demonstrated surface substrate can impact cell migration.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surface substrate</field><field name="subject">Electrical stimulation</field><field name="subject">Cell migration</field><field name="subject">Wound healing</field><field name="subject">Biphasic stimulation</field><field name="subject">AC stimulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial and temporal variation in the hydrochemistry of marine prawn aquaculture ponds built in acid sulfate soils, Queensland, Australia.</field><field name="creator">Groves, Sarah Anne, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Many brackish water aquaculture ventures in Australia and overseas have established ponds in coastal regions with acid sulfate soils (ASS). Acid sulphate soils are known to leach relatively high concentrations of metals, acid (metal and H+ ion) and sulfur, however very little is known about how these leached elements affect the water quality of aquaculture ponds. The main objective of this thesis was to describe the hydrochemical processes controlling the water chemistry in the water column and sediment pore water in the studied aquaculture ponds over time and space. Water samples providing the spatio-temporal data were collected from the ponds with the use of adapted sampling methods commonly used in the groundwater environment. A transect of five nested piesometers was installed in two prawn ponds at Pimpama, south east Queensland, Australia. Each piesometer nest contained a multilevel with eight outtakes, a mini ?? horizontal, and a slotted piesometer. Water samples were collected from each nested piesometer on a bi-monthly basis over the prawn-growing season. The unstable elements and water quality variables (pH, Eh, DO, EC, water temperature) were measured in the field. Stable elements were analysed in the laboratory using ICP-OES and ICP-MS. Soil samples were collected at the end of the season for elemental analysis. A number of key sediment/water interactions and processes such as precipitation/dissolution reactions, oxidation-reduction reactions, photosynthesis, adsorption and seawater buffering were identified as important controls on pond water conditions. This is the first study to provide detailed hydrochemcial analysis of the pond water over time and space and aided in identifying that even shallow water bodies can be chemically heterogeneous. Analysis of the water and sediment highlighted the selection of metals that can be associated with ASS and that are mobilised from pond sediments under certain chemical conditions. In Pond 7 Al, As, Ni and Zn concentrations were generally higher at the beginning of the grow-out season. Variability of the metal concentration was observed between the water column (0 ?? 1500 mm) and the pore-water (0 - -1000 mm). The highest concentration of Al (1044 ??g/L) and Zn (104 ??g/L) were sampled in the water column (approximately 400 mm from the surface of the pond). The highest concentration of As (130 ??g/L) and Ni (73 ??g/L) were sampled in the pore water sediment (associated with ASS). Elevated Mn and Fe2+ concentrations were also associated with the sediment pore water. The highest concentrations of Mn and Fe2+ were 4717 ??g/L and 5100 ??g/L respectively. In Pond 10, Ni concentrations (167 ??g/L) were the highest at the beginning of the grow-out season. However, As (97 ??g/L), Al (234 ??g/L) and Zn (308 ??g/L) were most concentrated during the middle of the cycle. The highest mean concentrations of these elements are As (63 ??g/L), Al (91 ??g/L) and Zn (69 ??g/L) which are each associated with the sediment-water interface. These metals are integral in degrading the pond water quality and lead to a loss of beneficial algal blooms, a reduction in pond water pH, poor growth rates and high mortality in shrimp. It is also possible that the dissolved ions and precipitated compounds that are leached from the ASS are discharged into the adjacent coastal estuary of Moreton Bay. With knowledge obtained from this PhD study, effective management and treatment systems can be developed and implemented to minimise the impact of these soils on the pond system and the water discharging into natural coastal ecosystem.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">heavy metals</field><field name="subject">hydrochemistry</field><field name="subject">acid sulfate soils</field><field name="subject">pond water</field><field name="subject">aquaculture</field><field name="subject">Kuruma prawns</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topics in human capital and taxation: effective tax rates on education, the heterogeneous human capital model and the impact of nominal rigidities in the tax system</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Glenn Michael, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis I address several neglected issues relating to the theoretical and applied analysis of human capital and the impact of taxation. I begin with the problem of measuring the effective tax rate on human capital accumulation. I develop a forward-looking measure of the effective tax rate that is grounded in human capital theory, allowing for features that differentiate human capital formation from physical capital formation. These features include concavity of the earnings-investment frontier and adjustments in capital utilization through leisure. I argue that the few attempts that have been made to measure the effective tax rate on skill formation are either limited by the fact that they inherit assumptions applicable to the theory of the firm or have dubious theoretical foundations (Chapter Two). The new measure is used to derive the effective tax rate on human capital in 25 OECD countries, including Australia (Chapter Three).  While there are numerous general equilibrium models which integrate nominal rigidities of one form or another, little attention has been devoted to nominal rigidities arising from partial indexation of income tax thresholds. No doubt one of the reasons for this gap in the literature is the difficulty associated with introducing a fully specified progressive tax regime into an applied general equilibrium model. I show that this hurdle can be overcome through a zero-profit condition for general equilibrium on the labour market. The condition is integrated into an aggregative model of the economy consisting of two sectors (consumption and education) and two factors of production (skilled and unskilled labour). Since skill formation is endogenous, the model allows us to reopen research into the optimal level of skill formation and the role of government (Chapter Four). An applied general equilibrium version of the model is used to evaluate the impact of recent tax reform proposals on skill formation (Chapter Five).  A concluding chapter draws together these lines of enquiry with suggestions for future research (Chapter Six).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Effective tax rates</field><field name="subject">Human capital</field><field name="subject">Taxation</field><field name="subject">Applied general Equilibrium</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding bacteria-protozoa interactions: from grazing resistance mechanisms to carbon flow in bacteria-protozoa food webs</field><field name="creator">Moreno, Ana Maria, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Bacteria-protozoa interactions are one of the oldest between prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. As such, their study offers a unique opportunity to understand the different relationships that have evolved between them, including pathogenesis, and how their interaction can affect some important processes, such as wastewater treatment. In the first part of the work described here, the grazing defence mechanisms employed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa against the surface grazer, Acanthamoeba castellanii, were investigated. P. aeruginosa cells from early logarithmic growth and stationary phase were found to use different defence strategies. The type-III secretion system (T3SS) was found to be responsible for cytotoxicity of early logarithmic growth cells against A. castellanii. Of the three exotoxins produced by P. aeruginosa PA99, the phospholipase ExoU was found to make the greatest contribution to bacterial toxicity against the amoebae. Interestingly, a PA99null mutant that does not produce any known exotoxins but synthesises a secretion apparatus, was also found to be toxic to the amoeba, suggesting that the T3SS was being used to translocate other unknown toxins. Quorum sensing regulated virulence factor production was found to be involved in the grazing defence response of stationary phase P. aeruginosa cells. A. castellanii was found to be most susceptible to hydrogen cyanide and elastase produced during late logarithmic and stationary phase. In the second part, a stable isotope probing method was developed to investigate carbon flow through bacteria-protozoa food webs in activated sludge. The method was subsequently used to track carbon from bicarbonate and acetate through bacteria-orotozoa food webs under ammonia oxidising and nitrate reducing conditions. It was found that the Peritrich ciliate Campanella umbellaria, dominated the acquisition of carbon from bacteria with access to CO2 under ammonia oxidising conditions. Thus it appears that some of these bacteria must live in the plankton, as C. umbellaria is a filter feeder. No specific protozoan groups were found to dominate carbon acquisition from bacteria with access to acetate, under nitrate reducing conditions, probably due to label dilution.  Overall the results presented here showed how bacteria-protozoa interactions have shaped infectious processes in higher eukaryotes, and the dynamics of carbon flow in activated sludge.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grazing resistance</field><field name="subject">Bacteria-protozoa interactions</field><field name="subject">Bacteria-protozoa food webs</field><field name="subject">Protozoa</field><field name="subject">Carbon</field><field name="subject">Bacteria</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The molecular biology of cancellous bone defects and oestrogen deficiency fractures, in rodents; and the in vivo effects of acid on bone healing</field><field name="creator">Low, Adrian Kah Wai, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The management of significant bone defects, delayed and non-union of fractures can be extremely challenging. Development of specific treatment is hindered by an absence of information regarding the molecular events which regulate these processes. In this thesis, a bilateral cancellous bone defect model of the femur and tibia was developed in a rodent and the spatiotemporal profile of TGF-&#946;, BMP 2 and 7, Smads 1, 4 and 5 characterised. Next, the capability of acid solution to augment healing was tested in both a bone defect and in a closed femoral fracture model. Finally, a long term oestrogen deficiency (OVX) rat model of postmenopausal osteoporosis was characterised and the spatiotemporal profiles of IGF-1, IGFR-1, MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-13, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-7, TGF-&#946;, Smad4, Smad7, VEGF, Flt-1, Ihh and FGF-2 were compared in femoral osteotomies between OVX and Sham groups. The bilateral cancellous defect model was successfully created with a number of advantages with which to recommend its use in future studies. TGF-&#946;, BMP 2 and 7, Smads 1, 4 and 5 had characteristic spatiotemporal profiles during cancellous bone defect healing suggesting that they have a regulatory role. The results of the acid study were inconclusive and problems with substance delivery and maintenance at the desired site need to be addressed in the future to fully test this hypothesis. No significant differences were detected on histology or three-point mechanical testing between the fracture calluses of acid and control groups. In the final study, OVX rats after six months had significantly increased weight and decreased bone mineral density compared to their sham counterparts. A histological delay in osteotomy healing was observed in the OVX group but no significant differences on tensile testing were seen between OVX and Sham groups up to six weeks. Immunohistochemistry revealed that delayed healing may be due to the down-regulation of IGF-1, BMP-2, 4, and 7 and the up-regulation of MMP-3 in OVX compared to Sham groups. In conclusion, the results of this thesis give some insight into the molecular biology of bone defects and osteoporotic fractures. This information may also be useful in the development of specific treatments aimed at augmenting healing in bone defects and osteoporotic fractures.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cancellous bone defects</field><field name="subject">fracture healing</field><field name="subject">osteoporotic fractures</field><field name="subject">growth factors</field><field name="subject">mechanical testing</field><field name="subject">immunohistochemistry</field><field name="subject">oestrogen deficiency</field><field name="subject">rodents</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42884</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New mechanisms modulating S100A8 gene expression</field><field name="creator">Endoh, Yasumi, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">S100A8 is a highly-expressed calcium-binding protein in neutrophils and activated macrophages, and has proposed roles in myeloid cell differentiation and host defense. Functions of S100A8 are not fully understood, partly because of difficulties in generating S100A8 knockout mice. Attempts to silence S100A8 gene expression in activated macrophages and fibroblasts using RNA interference (RNAi) technology were unsuccessful. Despite establishing validated small interfering RNA (siRNA) systems, enzymaticallysynthesized siRNA targeted to S100A8 suppressed mRNA levels by only 40% in fibroblasts activated with FGF-2+heparin, whereas chemically-synthesized siRNAs suppressed S100A8 driven by an S100A8-expression vector by ~75% in fibroblasts. Suppression of the gene in activated macrophages/fibroblasts was low, and some enzymatically-synthesized siRNAs to S100A8, and unrelated siRNA to GAPDH, induced/enhanced S100A8 expression in macrophages. This indicated that S100A8 may be upregulated by type-1 interferon (IFN). IFN-&#946; enhanced expression, but did not directly induce S100A8. Poly (I:C), a synthetic dsRNA, directly induced S100A8 through IL-10 and IFN-dependent pathways. Induction by dsRNA was dependent on RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), but not cyclooxygenase-2, suggesting divergent pathways in LPS- and dsRNA-induced responses. New mechanisms of S100A8 gene regulation are presented, that suggest functions in anti-viral defense. S100A8 expression was confirmed in lungs from influenza virus-infected mice and from a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Multiple pathways via mitochondria mediated S100A8 induction in LPS-activated macrophages; Generation of reactive oxygen species via the mitochondrial electron transport chain and de novo synthesis of ATP may be involved. This pathway also regulated IL-10 production, possibly via PKR. Extracellular ATP and its metabolites enhanced S100A8 induction. Results support involvement of cell stress, such as transfection, in S100A8 expression. A breast tumor cell line (MCF-7) in which the S100A8 gene was silenced, was established using micro RNA technology; S100A8 induction by oncostatin M was reduced by &gt;90% in stably-transfected cells. This did not alter MCF-7 growth. The new approach to investigate the role of S100A8 in a human tumor cell line may assist in exploring its functions and lead to new studies concerning its role in cancer.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">S100A8</field><field name="subject">Gene silencing</field><field name="subject">Macrophage activation</field><field name="subject">Interleukin 10</field><field name="subject">TLR- 3</field><field name="subject">Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Model based analysis of time-aware web services interactions</field><field name="creator">Ponge, Julien Nicolas, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Web services are increasingly gaining acceptance as a framework for facilitating application-to-application interactions within and across enterprises. It is commonly accepted that a service description should include not only the interface, but also the business protocol supported by the service. The present work focuses on the formalization of the important category of protocols that include time-related constraints (called timed protocols), and the impact of time on compatibility and replaceability analysis.  We formalized the following timing constraints: CInvoke constraints define time windows of availability while MInvoke constraints define expirations deadlines. We extended techniques for compatibility and replaceability analysis between timed protocols by using a semantic-preserving mapping between timed protocols and timed automata, leading to the novel class of protocol timed automata (PTA). Specifically, PTA exhibit silent transitions that cannot be removed in general, yet they are closed under complementation, making every type of compatibility or replaceability analysis decidable. Finally, we implemented our approach in the context of a larger project called ServiceMosaic, a model-driven framework for web service life-cycle management.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">service-oriented architectures</field><field name="subject">web services</field><field name="subject">timed business protocols</field><field name="subject">compatibility analysis</field><field name="subject">replaceability analysis</field><field name="subject">timed automata</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New mechanisms of regulation of mast cell activation</field><field name="creator">Endoh, Ikuko, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Mast cells (MCs) play a central role in inflammation by releasing mediators following activation. S100A8 and S100A9 are abundantly expressed in inflammatory sites such as asthmatic lung, sunburnt skin and atherosclerosis where MCs are involved in pathogenesis; roles of S100A8 in MC function are undetermined. The aims of this thesis were to determine effects of S100A8 on MC activation, particularly provoked by IgE and UVB. Initially, effects of UVB on MC activation were investigated as detailed functions were unclear. Cord blood-derived human mast cells (CBMCs) were treated in vitro with varying doses of UVB and production of multiple cytokines and viability investigated. UVB exposure selectively increased levels of IL-8 (CXCL8), and to a less extent IL-1&#946;, but not eight other cytokines tested. New protein synthesis partially contributed and IL-8 production was p38 MAPK-dependent. UVB dose-dependently induced MC apoptosis indicating a potential regulatory mechanism of MC function. The ability of recombinant S100A8, S100A9 or S100A8/9 heterodimer to modulate IgE/antigen (DNP/anti-DNP)-mediated activation of a murine MC line, and of bone marrow-derived (mBM) MC activation was determined. The S100s did not directly induce degranulation or induce IL-6. S100A8 significantly inhibited DNP/anti-DNP-provoked degranulation, and IL-6 and TNF mRNA and protein induction. S100A8 did not alter Fc&#949;RI&#945; expression. S100A9 was less effective; and the S100A8/9 complex was also suppressive. S100A8 only weakly suppressed non-specific MC degranulation. Mutation of Cys41 in S100A8 negated its suppressive activity. Because S100A8 scavenges oxidants via this reactive Cys residue, we propose that this may mediate its ability to downmodulate IgE-dependent MC responses. Similar to the thiol scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine, S100A8 but not the Ala41 mutant, attenuated DNP/anti-DNP-provoked LAT phosphorylation. However, the disulfide-bonded S100A8 dimer and S100A8 containing a sulfinamide bond between Cys41 and Lys34/35 also reduced MC activation, indicating an additional pathway(s). S100A8 did not suppress antigen/IgE-induced responses of CBMC possibly because these may not truly reflect fullymature human tissue MCs. S100A8 did not alter UVB-induced IL-8 release by CBMCs, or affect apoptosis. Murine S100A8 may have anti-inflammatory properties by regulating MC activation in an activator-specific manner, at least partially by scavenging ROS to suppress intracellular signalling.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ultraviolet light (UVB)</field><field name="subject">inflammation</field><field name="subject">mast cells</field><field name="subject">S100A8</field><field name="subject">allergic response</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematics of Elatostema (Urticaceae)</field><field name="creator">Hadiah, Julisasi Tri, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Elatostema J.R.Forst. &amp; G.Forst. (Urticaceae) is a taxonomically problematic genus of approximately 300 species that is widespread throughout the tropical, subtropical and sub-temperate regions of Africa through to SE Asia, Australasia to Polynesia. Morphological and molecular analyses were conducted to evaluate the infra-familial classification of the Urticaceae, to test the monophyly of Tribe Elatostemeae, to define generic limits of Elatostema and assess its relationship within the tribe, and to examine the current infrageneric grouping within Elatostema. Phylogenetic analyses based on choloroplast DNA sequences of rbcL and trnL-F do not provide support for the monophyly of Urticaceae, because of the position of Poikilospermum (currently Cecropiaceae) within the tribe Urticeae. Although the status of Cecropiaceae is equivocal, there is support for the inclusion of this family in the Urticaceae, with Cecropia and Coussapoa (Cecropiaceae) having close affinities to the Boehmerieae and Parietarieae. The phylogenetic position of Myriocarpa is unresolved, but is excluded from the Boehmerieae, as currently classified. The Elatostemeae is paraphyletic with Pilea placed sister to the Urticeae. Evaluation of the infrageneric classification of Elatostema, based on phylogenetic analyses of both morphological and molecular data (trn and ITS) does not support the current subgeneric classification as proposed by Schr??ter and Winkler (1935, 1936). The analyses support two main infrageneric grouping: (1) a group consisting of Elatostema subg. Pellionia and Procris, and (2) a group consisting of the remaining members of Elatostema (including E. griffithianum ??? subg. Pellionia). The molecular data are regarded as a more accurate estimate of the phylogeny than provided by morphology, with molecular data having a higher Rescaled Consistency Index on the most parsimonious trees, together with a much greater level of resolution and support than that of the morphological analyses.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Taxonomy.</field><field name="subject">Elatostema.</field><field name="subject">Urticaceae.</field><field name="subject">Phylogenetic.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FG7142 attenuates expression of overexpectation in Pavlovian fear conditioning</field><field name="creator">Garfield, Joshua Benjamin Bernard, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The experiments reported in this thesis studied the mechanisms of expression of overexpectation of conditioned fear, as measured by freezing. In Stage I, rats were conditioned to fear a tone and a flashing light conditioned stimulus (CS) through pairings with a 0.5 mA, 1 s shock. In Stage II, overexpectation was trained by the reinforcement of a compound of these CSs with a shock of the same magnitude. Two compound ?? shock pairings produced an overexpectation effect, as measured by freezing to presentations of the tone alone, while further Stage II training caused over-training of overexpectation. Expression of the overexpectation effect produced by two compound ?? shock pairings could be prevented by pre-test injection of the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist FG7142. This effect was dose-dependent and not due to state-dependent memory. Control experiments suggested that it was also not due to any general effect of FG7142 on the Pavlovian freezing response. Freezing to a tone that had been conditioned, but not subjected to any decremental training procedures, was unaffected by administration of FG7142 before either the conditioning or test session. FG7142 also did not affect freezing to a tone that had been subjected to an associative blocking procedure. The hypothesis that overexpectation of conditioned fear may be context-dependent was also tested. However, renewal was not observed. Rats that received Stage II training in a context distinct from the Stage I training context showed equivalent expression of overexpectation regardless of whether testing was conducted in the Stage I or Stage II training context. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that overexpectation, like extinction, leads to the imposition of a GABAA receptor-mediated mask on the fear CR. Moreover, they suggest that this masking of fear is the specific consequence of negative predictive error.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">FG7142</field><field name="subject">fear</field><field name="subject">overexpectation</field><field name="subject">rat</field><field name="subject">Pavlovian</field><field name="subject">extinction</field><field name="subject">benzodiazepine</field><field name="subject">GABA</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conducting polymers for neural interfaces: impact of physico-chemical properties on biological performance</field><field name="creator">Green, Rylie Adelle, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research investigates the use of conducting polymer coatings on platinum (Pt) electrodes for use in neuroprostheses. Conducting polymers aim to provide an environment conducive to neurite outgrowth and attachment at the electrode sites, producing intimate contact between neural cells and stimulating electrodes. Conducting polymers were electropolymerised onto model Pt electrodes. Conventional polymers polypyrrole (PPy) and poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene (PEDOT) doped with polystyrenesulfonate (PSS) and para-toluenesulfonate (pTS)were investigated. Improvement of material properties was assessed through the layering of polymers with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). The ability to incorporate cell attachment bioactivity into polymers was examined through the doping of PEDOT with anionic laminin peptides DCDPGYIGSR and DEDEDYFQRYLI. Finally, nerve growth factor (NGF), was entrapped in PEDOT during polymerisation and tested for neurite outgrowth bioactivity against the PC12 cell line. Each polymer modification was assessed for electrical performance over multiple reduction-oxidation cycles, conductivity and impedance spectroscopy, mechanical adherence and hardness, and biological response. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualise film topography and x-ray photon spectroscopy was employed to examine chemical constitution of the polymers. For application of electrode coatings to neural prostheses, optimal bioactive conducting polymer PEDOT/pTS/NGF was deposited on electrode arrays intended for implantation. PC12s were used to assess the bioactivity of NGF functionalised PEDOT when electrode size was micronised. Flexibility of the design was tested by tailoring PEDOT bioactivity for the cloned retinal ganglion cell, RGC-5, differentiated via staurasporine.  It was established that PEDOT films had superior electrical and cell growth characteristics, but only PPy was able to benefit from incorporation of MWNTs. Bioactive polymers were produced through inclusion of both laminin peptides and NGF, but the optimum film constitution was found to be PEDOT doped with pTS with NGF entrapped during electrodeposition. Application of this polymer to an implant device was confirmed through positive neurite outgrowth on vision prosthesis electrode arrays. The design was shown to be flexible when tailored for RGC-5s, with differentiation occurring on both PEDOT/pTS and PEDOT/DEDEDYFQRYLI. Conducting polymers demonstrate the potential to improve electrode-cell interactions. Future work will focus on the effect of electrical stimulation and design of bioactive polymers with improved cell attachment properties.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bioactive</field><field name="subject">conducting polymers</field><field name="subject">neural interfaces</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outside traditional book publishing centres : the production of a regional literature in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Henningsgaard, Per Hansa</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a study of book publishing as it contributes to the production of a regional literature, using Western Australian publishing and literature as illustrative examples of this dynamic. 'Regional literature' is defined in this thesis as writing possessing cultural value that is specific to a region, although the writing may also have national and international value. An awareness of geographically and culturally diverse regions within the framework of the nation is shown to be derived from representations of these regions and their associated regional characteristics in the movies, television and books. In Australia, literature has been the primary site for expressions of regional difference. Therefore, this thesis analyses the impact of regionalism on the processes of book production and publication in Western Australia&#146;s three major publishing houses&#151; a trade publishing house (Fremantle Press), an Indigenous publishing house (Magabala Books), and an academic publishing house (University of Western Australia Press). Book history, print culture studies and publishing studies, along with literary studies and cultural studies, roughly approximate a disciplinary map of the types of research that constitute this thesis. By examining regional literature in the context of its 'field of cultural production', this thesis maintains that regionalism and regional literature can avail themselves of a fresh perspective that shows them to be anything but marginal or exclusive. Regionalism has been a topic of peripheral interest, at least as far as scholarly research and academia are concerned, because those who are most likely to be affected by and thus interested in the topic, are also those who are most disempowered as a result of its attendant dynamics. However, as this thesis clearly demonstrates, access (or a lack thereof) to the field of cultural production (which in the case of print culture includes writers, literary agents, editors, publishers, government arts organisations, the media, schools, book clubs, and book retailers, just to name a few) plays a significant role in establishing and shaping an identity for marginalised 3 constituencies. The implications for this research are far-ranging, since both Western Australia and Australia can be understood as peripheries dominated in their different spheres (the 'national' and the 'international', respectively) by literary cultures residing elsewhere. Furthermore, there are parallels between this dynamic and the dynamic responsible for producing postcolonial literatures. The three publishing houses detailed in this thesis are disadvantaged by many of the factors associated with their distance from the traditional centres of book publishing, while at the same time producing a regional literature that serves as a platform from which the state broadcasts its distinctive contributions to the cultural landscape and to a wider understanding of concepts such as space, place and belonging. These publishing houses changed the way in which Australians and others have come to know and think about 'Australia', re-routing public consciousness and the national imagination.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fremantle Press</field><field name="subject">Magabala Books</field><field name="subject">University of Western Australia Press</field><field name="subject">Australian literature -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Publishers and publishing -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Regionalism in literature</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Regional literature</field><field name="subject">Book publishing</field><field name="subject">Western Australian literature</field><field name="subject">Fremantle Press</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The British government and the Peninsula War, 1808 to June 1811</field><field name="creator">Muir, Rory, 1962-</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 393-408.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Peninsular War, 1807-1814</field><field name="subject">Great Britain Politics and government 1800-1837</field><field name="subject">Great Britain History, Military 1789-1820</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phm953.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:6442838</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Firm performance and default risk for publicly listed companies in emerging markets : a case study of Jordan</field><field name="creator">Zeitun, Rami M. A.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the determinants of corporate performance and likelihood of default of Jordanian publicly listed companies. Despite the large body of work that has investigated the determinants of corporate performance and default, no comprehensive study has emerged in an emerging market. Indeed, most of the empirical research on corporate performance and failure has been conducted in the developed markets such as the USA and the UK. This is the first rigorous and comprehensive study to examine empirically the determinants of corporate performance and failure of the publicly listed companies in an emerging market of Jordan. Also, it is the first study to present evidence on the determinants of corporate performance and failure in the Jordanian market using microeconomic and macroeconomic variables. Another objective of the research is to investigate the effect of the two financial systems on corporate health, since two banking systems operate in Jordan. It is also the objective of this thesis to investigate the effects of external shocks on Jordanian corporate performance and failure, especially those occurring within the Middle East region such as the Gulf Crisis 1990-1991 and the outbreak of the Intifadah in September 2000. Our study uses time-series and cross-sectional data of the publicly traded companies on the Amman Stock Exchange over the period 1989-2003. The study examines the determinants of capital structure and corporate performance using the random effects model and the pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) regression method. The study also examines the determinants of corporate failure (default) using the Logit model. A firm&#8217;s tangibility is found to have a positive and significant impact on a firm&#8217;s capital structure, while it has a negative impact on the short-term debt to total assets ratio. Firm profitability, liquidity, and stock market activity are found to have a negative and significant impact on a firm&#8217;s capital structure. The analyses show that a firm&#8217;s capital structure is negatively and significantly related to corporate performance, but positively and significantly related to its failure. The Gulf Crisis 1990-1991 had a positive impact on corporate performance, while the outbreak of Intifadah had a negative effect on corporate performance. The study also highlighted the importance of industrial sectors in determining corporate performance. Ownership concentration measured by the largest five shareholders was found to be positively and significantly related to corporate failure in both the cross-sectional sample and the panel data sample. The analysis also found that there is a non-linear relationship between a firm&#8217;s performance value and ownership structure. Another important finding is that Islamic banks' credit has an important and significant impact in increasing a firm&#8217;s performance measure return on assets (ROA). Unexpected changes in interest rates are found to be negatively and significantly related to corporate default (failure). This implies that corporate performance and distress, or insolvency, are affected by their capital structure, ownership structure, cash flow, and macroeconomic variables.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corporations</field><field name="subject">Jordan</field><field name="subject">finance</field><field name="subject">corporate governance</field><field name="subject">developing countries</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">default (finance)</field><field name="subject">bankruptcy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/35666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emptiness as a visual strategy: an exploration of visual absence in contemporary art practice</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Yue Qu</field><field name="description">This project explores the idea of visual absence in relation to the notion of Chinese classical aesthetics of emptiness.

The aim of the research is to explore visual absence as a painting strategy in contemporary art practice, referring to the painting method of reduction, incompleteness and metaphor that extends the painting space and meaning through visual presence, thus unfurling an extended art form and creative strategy from Chinese classical aesthetics. The outcome is a series of paintings as an exploration in extending the Chinese painting aesthetics. This project is constituted of 80% practice-based work, accompanied by 20% exegesis in approximately 11,600 words as a complement.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Painting strategy</field><field name="subject">Visual transformation</field><field name="subject">Interaction of emptiness and fullness</field><field name="subject">Artistic intentions and enlightened imageries</field><field name="subject">Reflection</field><field name="subject">Transcendency</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/483</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of spoken English on learning English as a foreign language: a cognitive load perspective</field><field name="creator">Moussa, Jase, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">When learning a second language, students are taught to read, write, and listen often simultaneously, as it is assumed that it is more effective if both spoken and written versions of the same material are taught together.  However, recent research on cognitive load theory and second language learning (Diao, Chandler, &amp; Sweller, 2007; Diao &amp; Sweller, 2007) has shown that a combination of listening to and reading the same material creates a potential for redundancy (Sweller &amp; Chandler, 1994; Kalyuga, Chandler, &amp; Sweller, 1999; 2000; 2004).  Learning can be impeded if the same information appearing in one modality is repeated in the other (Sweller, 2005).  The aim of this study was to investigate the consequences of listening and reading on the acquisition of listening skills.  Four experiments were conducted. During acquisition, native Arabic-speaking students were required to learn a set of English words and sentences. Learners were either exposed to written work only (single modality), auditory work only (single modality) or written work with an auditory component (dual modality). The findings in this study were consistent in that even though participants in the Read + Listen group had had more experience with listening than participants in the Read Only group, they performed more poorly on listening tasks. Students were better able to learn to listen through reading alone because working memory resources were not required to attend to another mode that contained similar, redundant information. These results also suggest that if we want learners to enhance their listening skills, they may be better off reading the materials only rather than simultaneously reading and listening.  These results are further discussed in terms of CLT and redundancy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The deprioritised approach to prioritised algorithms</field><field name="creator">Howe, Stephen Alexander, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Randomised algorithms are an effective method of attacking computationally intractable problems. A simple and fast randomised algorithm may produce results to an accuracy sufficient for many purposes, especially in the average case. In this thesis we consider average case analyses of heuristics for certain NP-hard graph optimisation problems. In particular, we consider algorithms that find dominating sets of random regular directed graphs. As well as providing an average case analysis, our results also determine new upper bounds on domination numbers of random regular directed graphs. The algorithms for random regular directed graphs considered in this thesis are known as prioritised algorithms. Each prioritised algorithm determines a discrete random process. This discrete process may be continuously approximated using differential equations. Under certain conditions, the solutions to these differential equations describe the behaviour of the prioritised algorithm. Applying such an analysis to prioritised algorithms directly is difficult. However, we are able to use prioritised algorithms to define new algorithms, called deprioritised algorithms, that can be analysed in this fashion. Defining a deprioritised algorithm based on a given prioritised algorithm, and then analysing the deprioritised algorithm, is called the deprioritised approach. The initial theory describing the deprioritised approach was developed by Wormald and has been successfully applied in many cases. However not all algorithms are covered by Wormald??s theory: for example, algorithms for random regular directed graphs. The main contribution of this thesis is the extension of the deprioritised approach to a larger class of prioritised algorithms. We demonstrate the new theory by applying it to two algorithms which find dominating sets of random regular directed graphs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">combinatorics</field><field name="subject">random graphs</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of DNA methylation in the development of colorectal neoplasia</field><field name="creator">Wong, Justin Jong Leong, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">DNA methylation is increasingly recognised as a significant epigenetic event that may initiate and drive the process of neoplasia in humans. In the colon, DNA methylation of key genes is common in a subset of colorectal cancers. The extent to which DNA methylation at various genes contributes to initiation of colorectal neoplasms is less clear. This study sought to clarify the biological and clinicopathological significance of methylation of various genes in the development of sporadic and familial colorectal neoplasia. Quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) assays (capable of detecting down to a measureable proportion of 0.1% of the total input DNA) were developed to determine the presence of CpG methylation at a given gene. Methylation of MLH1-C was found in the apparently normal mucosa samples from seven of 104 (7%) of individuals with sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) showing microsatellite instability (MSI). No methylation of MLH1-C was found in the biological samples of individuals with microsatellite stable (MSS) counterparts (n=131). MLH1-C methylation may be a field defect that predisposes to the development of sporadic colorectal neoplasia, particularly those demonstrating MSI. Methylation of three of five genes within the 3p22 region including AB002340, MLH1, ITGA9, PLCD1 and DLEC1 (regional 3p22 methylation) was found in 83% of sporadic MSI (n=86) and 12% of MSS cancers demonstrating BRAF V600E mutation (n=42). Regional 3p22 correlated strongly with CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), and other clinicopathological characteristics typical of CIMP. Thus, regional 3p22 methylation and CIMP may be overlapping phenomena. Regional 3p22 methylation and the BRAF V600E mutation were found in normal colonic mucosa of four individuals with sporadic MSI CRC, and these cases also had multiple synchronous serrated polyps. These molecular aberrancies may predispose some individuals to the development of metachronous serrated neoplasia. Germline epimutations of APC do not contribute towards the development of FAP, AFAP, or hyperplastic polyposis syndromes. However, APC methylation in normal colonic mucosa of these individuals may represent a field defect in the development of futher neoplasms. In conclusion, different patterns of DNA methylation in normal colonic mucosa may represent a field defect important in the development of different subtypes of colorectal neoplasia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Field defect.</field><field name="subject">DNA methylation.</field><field name="subject">Colorectal neoplasia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43359</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the zinc fingers of Erythroid Kruppel-Like Factor</field><field name="creator">Hallal, Samantha</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eklf</field><field name="subject">Erythroid Kruppel-Like Factor</field><field name="subject">RNA-binding</field><field name="subject">zinc finger</field><field name="subject">megakaryopoiesis</field><field name="subject">post-transcriptional gene regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Film as Cultural Performance</field><field name="creator">Summerhayes, Catherine</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates how Victor Turner&#146;s concept of &#145;cultural performance&#146; can be used to explore and analyse the experience of film. Drawing on performance theory, hermeneutics, phenomenology and Bakhtin&#146;s dialogism, Sections One and Two develop this investigation through a theoretic discussion which relates and yet distinguishes between three levels of &#145;performance&#146; in film: filmmaking performance, performances as text and cultural performances. The theory is grounded within four films which were researched for this thesis: Once Were Warriors (Lee Tamahori, 1994), Rats in the Ranks (Bob Connolly and Robin Anderson,1996), beDevil (Tracey Moffatt, 1993) and Link-Up Diary (David MacDougall, 1987). Section Three undertakes the close analyses of the latter two films. These analyses address specific cultural performances that are performed &#145;across&#146; cultures and which are concerned particularly with Australian society&#146;s relationship with indigenous Australians.
&#182;
Section One locates Turner&#146;s concept of &#145;cultural performance&#146; within his wider theory of &#145;social drama&#146; and introduces the three-tiered mode of analysis which is developed throughout this thesis. His concept of &#145;liminality&#146; is also investigated in order to consider specific relationships between performances which take place in film and theatre. Performances which take place in film are located in this Section within the theatrical understanding of performance as &#145;for an audience&#146;. I describe this relationship between performances in film and theatre through Kristeva&#146;s interpretation of Bakhtin&#146;s concept of heteroglossia as intertextuality, especially through her distinction of a &#145;transformative&#146; intertextuality. Three specific concepts from theatre and performance theory are interrogated for their relevance to film theory: 
1.	Brecht&#146;s theory of &#145;gest&#146;, 
2.	&#145;direct address to the audience&#146; in relation to the &#145;gaze&#146; in film and 
3.	Rebecca Schneider&#146;s conceptualisation of &#145;the performance artist&#146;.
&#182;
Using these three tropes of performance, Section Two develops a theory of performance in film. Besides Turner&#146;s concept of &#145;cultural performance&#146;, this theory draws on aspects of several other substantial bodies of work. These works include Richard Schechner&#146;s performance theory, Michael Taussig&#146;s understanding of &#145;mimesis&#146;, Vivian Sobchack&#146;s phenomenology of film, Paul Ricoeur&#146;s theory of text &#145;as meaningful action&#146;, Gadamer&#146;s concept of &#145;meaningful play&#146;, Bakhtin&#146;s conceptualisation of a &#145;dialogic&#146; text and Catherine Bell&#146;s theory of &#145;ritualised behaviour&#146;. The two analyses in Section Three do not rigidly follow the three-tiered process of analysis which is developed in the previous two Sections. They rather focus on the films as sites for particular cultural performances which are specific for each film and which need for their description, different aspects of the theory that is offered through this thesis. These analyses especially draw on my interpretation of David MacDougall&#146;s &#145;transcultural cinema&#146; and Jodi Brook&#146;s conceptualisation of a &#145;gestural practice&#146; in film, which she positions both in terms of Brecht&#146;s theatrical concept of &#145;gest&#146; and Walter Benjamin&#146;s concept of the &#145;shock&#146; of modernity.
&#182;
The film analyses are of one fiction film, beDevil, and one non-fiction film, Link-Up Diary. Both films use audiovisual images of Aboriginal Australians as content. According the terms of this thesis, these people must also be considered as filmmakers. Although this role may constitute varying degrees of authority and power, a film analysis which considers the filmmaking roles of people whose images are present in the filmic text also allows a particular consideration of the social relationships which exist between people who &#145;film&#146; and people who &#145;are filmed&#146;. My focus on the cultural performances of these two films allowed an even closer description of this relationship for two reasons. Firstly, both Moffatt and MacDougall respectively present their own images in the films. Secondly, my analyses of these films as cultural performance draw out and describe the different ways in which the two films address the same &#145;social drama&#146;: the relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. My analyses expose how a description of these differences in address can extend beyond the distinction between one film as &#145;fiction&#146; and the other as &#145;non-fiction&#146; towards a description of the different ways in which people relate to each other, at both the individual level and at the level of society, through the production and reception of a particular film. While locating these films as cultural performances within in particular sets of social relationships, my consideration of film in this thesis in terms of theatrical performance also enables a description of the experience of film which draws on the social experience of live theatre. The theory developed in this thesis and its application in the analyses of these two films suggest further areas of research which might look more closely at whether or not, or how much people draw from the social practices of live theatre as they live their lives with film &#150; a signifying practice which has existed just over one hundred years.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Victor Turner</field><field name="subject">cultural performance</field><field name="subject">experience of film</field><field name="subject">performance theory</field><field name="subject">Mikhail M.

As result of the terms the Macedonian general demanded Phocion became pre-eminent in Athens for a few years from 322/1 to 319/8 B.C. It is my belief that, although he did not seek to become leader in Athens, Phocion none-the-less accepted his new role out of a sense of duty and a firm belief that he was the only person suited for the job. Here was a man whose logical, pragmatic and unemotional attitude to political and world affairs enabled him to rise above what he believed to be the short-sightedness of his contemporaries and accurately assess the future for Athens and the city-state's place in the new world order. Of course our picture of Phocion is taken, mainly, from Plutarch's encomiastic Life of Phocion. According to his account the Athenian general and statesman did not want war but peace and prosperity. He did not believe the Athenians capable of defeating Macedonia. Instead, he felt that the people should accept their new position in the world and make the best of the situation. It should not be forgotten, however, that Plutarch was writing at a time when Europe was under the yoke of the new superpower: Rome. He saw the benefits of living in Greece at a time when the city-states were no longer continually involved in internecine warfare. It was, perhaps, this appreciation of the state of his own world, gained with the benefit of hindsight, that gave rise to his admiration of (what he perceived to be) Phocion's foresight. Phocion appeared to understand, as Plutarch did, that there was no reason why Athens could not still be prosperous. Plutarch's Phocion saw the city-state's future as no longer being primarily reliant on military preparedness but rather on trade and sound economic policy. With the protection of the powerful Macedonian overlord Athens would be free to enjoy life in relative peace and prosperity. Ultimately, Plutarch has had a significant influence on our understanding and appreciation of Phocion the general, statesman and man. The aim of this paper then is, with the use of other primary and secondary sources, to look beyond Plutarch's encomium and attempt to find the real Phocion. In particular, I will be examining the aging general's role in Athenian affairs after the Lamian War. This pivotal time in Athenian history has received too little attention. Life in Athens changed dramatically after Antipater defeated the Greek forces at the Battle of Crannon. The Athenians lost their freedom and autonomy and were fated never to regain the hegemony of the Greeks. Moreover, they had failed to live up to the glorious deeds of their ancestors. It was Phocion's task to help his people to come to terms with this new state of affairs and to find a place for Athens in the new world order. And so, political life in Athens was turned upside down as democracy was changed to oligarchy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coelius Antipater, Lucius</field><field name="subject">Phocion, -- d. 318 B.C</field><field name="subject">Athens (Greece) -- Politics and government</field><field name="subject">Greece -- History -- Macedonian Hegemony, 323-281 B.C</field><field name="subject">Athens under Phocion</field><field name="subject">Phocion</field><field name="subject">Antipater</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Western barred bandicoots in health and disease</field><field name="creator">M.Bennett@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">For more than a decade, community groups, scientific organizations and government agencies have collaborated to repopulate the endangered western barred bandicoot (Perameles bougainville). While initially successful, the unexpected discovery of a papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome in captive and wild populations of P. bougainville exposed a dearth of knowledge regarding their diseases. This dissertation addresses this issue through study of the clinical pathology, immunology, parasitology, and virology of P. bougainville. 

To facilitate the detection and understanding of diseases in P. bougainville, guidelines for interpreting haematology and clinical chemistry results were developed, including calculated species-specific reference intervals for plasma aspartate transaminase activity (20&#150;283 U/L), haemoglobin (122-165 g/L), haematocrit (0.36-0.49 L/L), total leukocytes (2.9-14.9 x10^9/L), monocytes (0-0.6 x10^9/L), eosinophils (0-0.9 x10^9/L) and total protein (47-63 g/L) estimated by refractometry. P. bougainville immunoglobulin was also fractionated from plasma and inoculated into sheep to derive antiserum for serological screening assays. 

Arthropods, helminths and protozoa parasitic on P. bougainville were catalogued and Eimeria kanyana n. sp. was formally described. The pathogenic and zoonotic potential of bacteria detected in ticks parasitic on P. bougainville was also considered.

The association between bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 1 (BPCV1) and the western barred bandicoot papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome was investigated using PCR, in situ hybridization and virus isolation. Optimized in situ hybridization techniques demonstrated BPCV1 DNA within keratinocyte and sebocyte nuclei, and BPCV1 mRNA within the cytoplasm. BPCV1 virions were isolated by ultracentrifugation and visualized with negative stain transmission electron microscopy revealing icosahedral, non-enveloped viral capsids ~47 nm in diameter, comparable to viruses classified within Papillomaviridae and Polyomaviridae. 

A novel virus, tentatively named bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 2 (BPCV2) was discovered in papillomatous lesions from a southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus). It had a circular double-stranded DNA genome of 7277 bp, and encoded two papillomavirus-like structural proteins, L1 and L2, and two polyomavirus-like putative transforming proteins, large T antigen and small t antigen. DNA and RNA in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of BPCV2 nucleic acids within lesion biopsies. The discovery of the bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis viruses has provoked reassessment of the established virus taxonomy paradigm, theories of virus-host co-speciation and bandicoot population management strategies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Perameles bougainville</field><field name="subject">bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis viruses</field><field name="subject">clinical pathology</field><field name="subject">parasitology</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090202.100128</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Vygotskian perspective on promoting critical thinking in young children through mother-child interactions</field><field name="creator">julia.suleeman@ui.ac.id</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how mothers, as primary caretakers, might promote the development of critical thinking of their 4- and 5-year-olds.  Interest in critical thinking in very young children can be traced back to the early years of the 20th century with views expressed by philosophers such as John Dewey and John Stuart Mill that were in favour of giving young children opportunities that might encourage their free expression and inquiring, critical nature in the school context.  Educators like Frobel and Montessori who developed programs for kindergartens worked on similar assumptions. However, how the home environment especially maternal support might foster the development of critical thinking in young children has received only minimal attention. The rise of the critical thinking movement in the 1970s enhanced the conceptualization of critical thinking, and how to assess the critical thinking ability.  But studies of the precursors of critical thinking in young children received only minimal attention. 

Two theoretical perspectives, the constructivist and the socio-cultural, represented by their most authoritative figures, Piaget and Vygotsky, respectively, have provided the conceptual basis for this research.  While Piaget viewed children&#146;s cognition as developing through active construction while dealing with concrete, practical problems, Vygotsky considered children&#146;s cognitive development as evolving through the internalization of interactions with more able people in their immediate environment.  In this thesis, Piaget&#146;s approach to investigating children&#146;s higher thinking processes was applied to the design of tasks that assessed critical thinking features in very young children whilst Vygotsky&#146;s notion of the zone of proximal development was used to design the overall intervention program to develop very young children&#146;s critical thinking through meaningful interactions with their mothers.  

How critical thinking in young children might develop through mothers&#146; interaction strategies was investigated in the context of Indonesian participants in their home settings.  In that cultural context, critical thinking is not nurtured, and even children&#146;s curiosity is often regarded as irritating by adults.  The challenge for this study, therefore, was to design a program that would challenge the mothers&#146; personal and cultural assumptions and to empower them to support the development of critical thinking in their young children. The effectiveness of the intervention was evaluated against whether and, if so, how the children&#146;s precursors of critical thinking improved across the intervention period.  

The main contributions this study was expected to make are: (1) advance the conceptualization of the nature of critical thinking in very young children (2) develop and test innovative methods to identify the features of critical thinking in very young children; and (3) identifying how mothers, having been empowered through the metacognitive program, may promote the development of critical thinking in very young children. 

The nature of critical thinking in very young children was operationalised through two different assessment methods specifically developed for this purpose.  One was a dynamic qualitative assessment where each child interacted with his or her mother in a teaching-learning setting.  The other consisted of a series of quantitative, Piagetian-like assessments, using play settings.  The research used a pre- and post-intervention control group design in order to allow for comparisons both within-subjects, across the intervention period, and between-subjects as another group of mother-child pairs served as control receiving no intervention. 

The findings revealed that very young children are able to show precursors of critical thinking consisting of both cognitive and affective elements, such as questioning, authentication, moral reasoning, and appropriate emotion.  Features indicating inhibitors of critical thinking (such as passivity and over-compliance) were also found.  Through the intervention program, the experimental group mothers learned to notice, encourage and support children's attempts at inquiry as the children grappled with making sense of their environment.  Although the precursors of critical thinking identified before the intervention continued to develop over time due to maturation (as shown by the performance of the control group children), the experimental group children performed even better over time.  In addition, the mothers of children with better performance in critical thinking tasks were observed to emphasize informing and reasoning, and to enjoy interacting with their children, rather than pressuring or commanding them.  

This research has highlighted conceptual and methodological issues in identifying and assessing very young children&#146;s critical thinking, as well as the educational implications for the promotion of children&#146;s critical thinking at home and in schools through similar metacognitive programs for parents and teachers.  More research into the assessment of very young children&#146;s critical thinking in different settings and with persons other than mothers is indicated, as is a focus on other factors that may influence the development of critical thinking.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognitive development</field><field name="subject">Young children's critical thinking</field><field name="subject">Mother-child</field><field name="subject">Intervention</field><field name="subject">Metacognition</field><field name="subject">Vygotsky</field><field name="subject">Piaget</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090209.101855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">UNDERSTANDING WORKPLACE EXPECTATIONS:
A STUDY OF THE PERCEPTIONS OF PRELINGUALLY DEAF WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS</field><field name="creator">Rosengreen, Kathleen</field><field name="description">This study examined the understanding of workplace expectations of a group of deaf workers. Nine males and fifteen females, ranging in ages 18 to 48, all prelingually deaf, and whose preferred mode of communication was Auslan (Australian Sign Language), participated in the study. All had a history of extended periods of unemployment, interspersed with short-term vocational training courses that had not resulted in long-term employment. Ten of the participants were individuals identified as low-functioning deaf (LFD) characterised by their limited communication skills in sign language, English and presence of secondary disabilities.
The purpose of this research was to investigate the extent the deaf participants understood employer expectations and how this knowledge may have impacted their employment success. Each deaf participant completed a 25-item written questionnaire exploring their views about workplace behaviours. A group of 100 employers from the Western Sydney area completed the same survey. The 24 deaf participants were interviewed regarding how they prioritised the items in the questionnaire and were asked to describe their workplace experiences. Subsequently, both data sets were analysed and compared.
The participants were divided into four subgroups based on their employment status: employed/unemployed and functional levels: medium/LFD. Analysis of questionnaire rankings indicated the employed participants? responses showed good understanding of employer expectations. Results for the unemployed participants were divided; the rankings for the medium-functioning unemployed participants were very similar to
the employed participants except in four areas. Predictably, the unemployed participants with LFD demonstrated a much lower understanding of employer expectations.
The qualitative interviews provided further insight into the deaf participants? attitudes towards employment and the importance of meeting employer expectations. Additionally the interview transcripts identified many workplace problems experienced by the deaf participants which contribute to a lack of correspondence. The findings suggest deaf workers? dissatisfaction with their workplace conditions may play a role in their ability to sustain employment. Therefore, meeting employer expectations can be seen as only one of many components of successful employment.
The findings suggest that both deaf workers and employers would benefit from greater understanding of each others? perspectives about the workplace. Seven topics are recommended for inclusion in future curricula. Better understanding of each others? views can support improved workplace relationships, employment retention and satisfaction levels.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hearing impaired</field><field name="subject">employment</field><field name="subject">workplace</field><field name="subject">employer expectations</field><field name="subject">Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20090209.162542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managerial sex role stereotyping among Chinese students in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhu, Dan</field><field name="description">The management literature in gender issues argues that in spite of the progress made in the last few decades, women still face difficulties in being accepted and recognised as managers because the manager&#8217;s role has been perceived as masculine. Gender stereotypes, hence, continue to become a barrier to women&#8217;s access to top management position. This study examines the perceptions of the relationship between sex role stereotypes and the perceived characteristics necessary for managerial success among Chinese students in New Zealand. The study sample consisted of 94 male Chinese students and 119 female Chinese students studying in New Zealand. In order to allow for cross-cultural comparisons, this study used a direct replication the Schein Descriptive Index (SDI) from previous study (Schein &amp; Mueller, 1992). The male and female perceptions on the relationship between sex role stereotypes and characteristics were analysed separately. The results revealed that both male and female Chinese students in New Zealand perceive that successful middle managers possess characteristics, attitudes and temperaments more commonly ascribed to men than to women in general. In addition, the results were compared with previous studies conducted in China and Japan, New Zealand, America, Britain, Canada, and Germany. Our findings conclude that Asian people are worse than Western people in respect to managerial sex role stereotyping, particularly, Chinese males who show a very strong degree of managerial gender stereotyping.   Multiple discriminant analysis was used to discriminate the relationship between men, women and middle managers on 92 items from the survey questionnaire. The analysis resulted in two separate canonical functions which distinguished between three groups women, men and managers).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stereotypes</field><field name="subject">sex roles</field><field name="subject">managers</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/822</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of floral resources by the lacewing Micromus tasmaniae and its parasitoid Anacharis zealandica, and the consequences for biological control by M. tasmaniae</field><field name="creator">Robinson, K. A.</field><field name="description">Arthropod species that have the potential to damage crops are food resources for communities of predators and parasitoids. From an agronomic perspective these species are pests and biocontrol agents respectively, and the relationships between them can be important determinants of crop yield and quality. The impact of biocontrol agents on pest populations may depend on the availability of other food resources in the agroecosystem. A scarcity of such resources may limit biological control and altering agroecosystem management to alleviate this limitation could contribute to pest management. This is a tactic of &#8216;conservation biological control&#8217; and includes the provision of flowers for species that consume prey as larvae but require floral resources in their adult stage. The use of flowers for pest management requires an understanding of the interactions between the flowers, pests, biocontrol agents and non-target species. Without this, attempts to enhance biological control might be ineffective or detrimental. This thesis develops our understanding in two areas which have received relatively little attention: the role of flowers in biological control by true omnivores, and the implications of flower use by fourth-trophic-level life-history omnivores. The species studied were the lacewing Micromus tasmaniae and its parasitoid Anacharis zealandica. Buckwheat flowers Fagopyrum esculentum provided floral resources and aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum served as prey. Laboratory experiments with M. tasmaniae demonstrated that although prey were required for reproduction, providing flowers increased survival and oviposition when prey abundance was low. Flowers also decreased prey consumption by the adult lacewings. These experiments therefore revealed the potential for flowers to either enhance or disrupt biological control by M. tasmaniae. Adult M. tasmaniae were collected from a crop containing a strip of flowers. Analyses to determine the presence of prey and pollen in their digestive tracts suggested that predation was more frequent than foraging in flowers. It was concluded that the flower strip probably did not affect biological control by lacewings in that field, but flowers could be significant in other situations. The lifetime fecundity of A. zealandica was greatly increased by the presence of flowers in the laboratory. Providing flowers therefore has the potential to increase parasitism of M. tasmaniae and so disrupt biological control. A. zealandica was also studied in a crop containing a flower strip. Rubidium-marking was used to investigate nectar-feeding and dispersal from the flowers. In addition, the parasitoids&#8217; sugar compositions were determined by HPLC and used to infer feeding histories. Although further work is required to develop the use of these techniques in this system, the results suggested that A. zealandica did not exploit the flower strip. The sugar profiles suggested that honeydew had been consumed by many of the parasitoids. A simulation model was developed to explore the dynamics of aphid, lacewing and parasitoid populations with and without flowers. This suggested that if M. tasmaniae and A. zealandica responded to flowers as in the laboratory, flowers would only have a small effect on biological control within a single period of a lucerne cutting cycle. When parasitoids were present, the direct beneficial effect of flowers on the lacewing population was outweighed by increased parasitism, reducing the potential for biological control in future crops. The results presented in this thesis exemplify the complex interactions that may occur as a consequence of providing floral resources in agroecosystems and re-affirm the need for agroecology to inform the development of sustainable pest management techniques.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Micromus tasmaniae</field><field name="subject">brown lacewing</field><field name="subject">Hemerobiidae</field><field name="subject">Anacharis zealandica</field><field name="subject">parasitoid</field><field name="subject">Figitidae</field><field name="subject">Fagopyrum esculentum</field><field name="subject">buckwheat</field><field name="subject">Acyrthosiphon pisum</field><field name="subject">pea aphid</field><field name="subject">Medicago sativa</field><field name="subject">lucerne</field><field name="subject">floral resources</field><field name="subject">flowers</field><field name="subject">omnivory</field><field name="subject">true omnivore</field><field name="subject">life-history omnivore</field><field name="subject">fourth trophic level</field><field name="subject">conservation biological control</field><field name="subject">pest management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::210000 Science-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270703 Terrestrial ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300204 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Testing hypotheses in molecular ecology: genetic exchange and hybrid performance</field><field name="creator">Holleley, Clare Ellen, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Population structure, gene flow and dispersal are some of the most commonly estimated population parameters in population genetics, evolutionary biology and conservation genetics. The primary aim of thesis is to test the precision and accuracy of genetic estimates of population structure, gene flow and dispersal. The controlled replicated Drosophila melanogaster experiments of known effective population size (Ne = 14.3) and dispersal rate (m = 0.0025 - 0.04) all adhered to Wright??s demographic island model. Three statistical approaches were empirically tested: 1) the conversion of population structure to gene flow using FST, RST, SHUA and PhiST ; 2) the private alleles method to estimate gene flow; 3) a Bayesian assignment method to estimate dispersal (BAYESASS 1.2). Even in the best-case scenario, almost all current methods except SHUA significantly underestimate population structure, and consequently overestimate gene flow and dispersal when applied to real populations. It was crucial to ensure that the manipulated rate of gene flow was correctly defined. This led to three supporting investigations of hybrid performance, inversion polymorphisms and effective population size. The hybrid performance investigation demonstrated that the manipulated rate of gene flow had not been unexpectedly inflated by hybrid vigour or reduced by breakdown. These experiments also demonstrated that close inbreeding is not a necessary precondition for hybrid vigour or breakdown, which is important for conservation strategies involving induced dispersal. The investigation of inversion polymorphisms ensured that the manipulated rate of gene flow was not affected by selection on inverted regions. The effective population size investigation used a temporal estimation method to confirm that the Ne was accurately predicted by an N:Ne ratio of 0.286. Additionally this experiment showed that the single-sample estimation methods implemented by ONeSAMP or LDNE resulted in downwardly biased estimates of Ne in structured populations. In conclusion these results call into question the confidence that biologists may have in some of the most widely used molecular tools in conservation biology.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hybrid fitness</field><field name="subject">Population structure</field><field name="subject">Gene flow</field><field name="subject">Dispersal</field><field name="subject">Population genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The kinetics of formation and characterizations of skeletal cobalt catalysts</field><field name="creator">Garciano, Leonito II, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Clear images of the open sponge structure of skeletal cobalt catalysts with and without chromium promotion are presented for the first time utilising a dual electron/focussed ion beam microscopes. Chromium promotion during leaching gives a finer structure with smaller pores. The reaction interface during leaching was sharp. The kinetics of formation of the skeletal cobalt catalyst were successfully modelled using the Avrami- Erofeev equation with a time exponent of unity - ln(1-&#945;) = Koverall t The overall specific rate constant (Koverall) was directly proportional to the sodium hydroxide concentration only for relatively low values, and inversely proportional to the average particle size. The final quantitative kinetic model for the leaching of skeletal cobalt with no promotion from 2.7M-10.4M NaOH concentration range where the effect of NaOH was weak was found to be: ?? ln(1- &#945; ) = [(2.8x1015&#956;m/h*exp(-72kJ/mol/(0.008314kJ/kmol*T)))/so] t With chromium promotion, the quantitative model that describes the rate of leaching in the NaOH concentration range 2.7M-10.4M was: ?? ln(1- &#945;) = [(1.5x1014&#956;m/h*exp(-74kJ/mol/(0.008314kJ/kmol*T)))/(so(C??o+0.029))] t The mechanism of leaching involves lineal or threadlike needle growth of numerous cobalt nuclei formed from the activation of correspondingly numerous alloy potential nuclei randomly distributed across the reaction interface. The mechanism involves nil ingestion/encapsulation of the alloy potential nuclei by the growing cobalt nuclei. The effect of chromate on slowing the leaching kinetics is attributed to a complex electrochemical effect. The various kinetic models proposed to date in the literature on the formation of different skeletal metal catalysts were re-analysed and consolidated to just two. Alloys of highly leachable phases, such as for skeletal copper or cobalt, follow the Avrami-Erofeev model with a time exponent of unity. Alloys with a significant amount of a less reactive alloy phase or that leach via a less reactive intermediate phase, for example skeletal nickel or silver, follow a modified Prout-Tompkins model where ingestion/encapsulation of either the alloy or intermediate phase becomes significant, leading to a lower maximum removal of aluminium from the alloy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrative Medicine in Contemporary Australian Health Care</field><field name="creator">Grace, Sandra</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">integrative medicine</field><field name="subject">complementary and alternative medicine</field><field name="subject">Australian health care</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting the retention and progression of postgraduate business distance education students: an exploratory case study at the University of Southern Queensland</field><field name="creator">Carroll, David</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Universities have traditionally focused their efforts on recruiting new students and increasing participation rates. However, higher retention and progression rates of students are likely to have a beneficial effect on the overall performance of universities in terms of their student-based income. The majority of previous studies addressing student retention have largely been focused on younger undergraduate on-campus students therefore this research seeks to investigate the factors which affect the retention and progression of postgraduate business students undertaking their studies by distance education. This study is based on a qualitative exploratory research design comprising twenty semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted with current and former students and university staff members. The key findings of this study indicate that a combination of situational, institutional and dispositional factors impact upon the retention and progression of postgraduate business distance education students. The employment and family commitments of students, whether students believed that their studies would benefit their career goals and the design of the distance education program appear to be the most important factors impacting upon student retention and progression. In contrast to the majority of services marketing literature, it would appear that student satisfaction is not a key factor impacting upon student retention and progression in this context. This research also provides a range of managerial implications and recommendations for postgraduate distance education providers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">postgraduate;</field><field name="subject">business</field><field name="subject">students;</field><field name="subject">distance</field><field name="subject">education;</field><field name="subject">University</field><field name="subject">of</field><field name="subject">Southern</field><field name="subject">Queensland;</field><field name="subject">progression;</field><field name="subject">retention</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004922/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of forest models to understand effects of elevated CO2 on aboveground forest productivity</field><field name="creator">Hazareh, Termeh, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Experiments show that forest net primary productivity (NPP) increases as atmospheric [CO2] increases. The aim of this thesis is to use process-based models to analyse the mechanisms underlying this response to atmospheric [CO2]. I used two models named MAESTRA, which is a complex model of canopy photosynthesis and MATE, a simpler model of forest carbon and water balance that is useful for long-term simulations. These models are applied to a Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment on a sweetgum plantation at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA. In this experiment, trees growing at elevated CO2 (eCO2, 550 ppm) have a higher net primary production (NPP) than trees at ambient CO2 (aCO2, 375 ppm). The aim of my research is to understand the reasons for differences in production at aCO2 and eCO2 rings. Simulations of both models are analysed to determine whether differences between NPP at aCO2 and eCO2 are the result of changes in light use efficiency (LUE) or absorbed photosynthetically-active radiation (APAR). A second question is whether the models can explain inter-year variation in NPP. The model focuses on a two-year period, 1999-2000 when extensive data are available on NPP, photosynthesis, leaf area index (LAI), and tree transpiration.  Using MAESTRA I found that: 1. Because LAI was not affected by eCO2, simulated APAR is insensitive to eCO2. Therefore enhanced total canopy photosynthesis at eCO2 is caused by increased LUE. 2. Jmax and Vcmax were slightly higher at aCO2 than in eCO2 (except for May and September 1999), indicating that photosynthesis was not down-regulated at eCO2. Values of LUE were higher in 2000 compared with 1999 at both aCO2 and eCO2. LUE was higher on days when incident PAR (IPAR) was low.  3. APAR was reduced from 1999 to 2000 due to changes in IPAR and LAI. The counter-action between reduced APAR and increased LUE cancelled each other so that NPP simulated by MAESTRA did not differ greatly from 1999 to 2000. This was in contrast with NPP data, which showed considerably higher values in 2000 than in 1999.  4. Modelled transpiration agreed well with sapflux data in mid-season at both aCO2 and eCO2 but transpiration was underestimated at start and end of year.  5. The response of simulated NPP to eCO2 was 18 and 15% in 1999 and 2000, respectively. These results compare with measured NPP responses to eCO2 of 16 and 27%, respectively.  Using MATE model I found that: 1. Simulated APAR is insensitive to eCO2, thus increased GPP at eCO2 was associated with enhanced LUE rather than enhanced APAR.  2. Simulated GPP in 2000 was higher than in 1999 due to increased LUE in 2000, despite reduced annual APAR. 3. Modelled transpiration agreed well with sapflux data at aCO2 in mid-season but underestimated transpiration at eCO2. The model underestimated transpiration at start and end of the year.  4. Simulations of plant available water showed wetter soils at eCO2.  5. Modelled NPP showed less response to eCO2 in 1999 (6% increase) than in 2000 (12% increase). These CO2 responses compare with measured NPP increases of 16 and 27% in 1999 and 2000, respectively.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strolling to the beat of another drum : living the 'Slow Life'</field><field name="creator">Zeestraten, J.</field><field name="description">As the pace of life in contemporary Western society accelerates, an increasing number of people are engaging in an alternative lifestyle: &#8216;Slow Living&#8217;.

Given a lack of empirical research, especially on the realities of the Slow Life in a New Zealand context, this ethnographic study aims to augment the knowledge on this lifestyle by focusing on how families experience Slow Living. The key research question is: How do families live their interpretations of a Slow Life? To answer this question, this study examined the everyday lives of five Slow Living families in Canterbury, New Zealand. Adult family members were given a time-use diary to complete over two days. These diaries were then used as a foundation for in-depth interviews and participant observation. Slow Living families hold to a number of personal values, such as personal agency, conscious living and leading meaningful lives. These comprise their ideal way of living. The families are also faced with a number of challenges and have to employ strategies to balance their ideal and what is possible. The different ways families adapt produces a variety of Slow Living lifestyles.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Slow Living</field><field name="subject">lifestyles</field><field name="subject">quality of life</field><field name="subject">time-use</field><field name="subject">families</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">personal agency</field><field name="subject">conscious living</field><field name="subject">meaningful living</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs</field><field name="subject">pace of life</field><field name="subject">Canterbury</field><field name="subject">values</field><field name="subject">challenges</field><field name="subject">strategies</field><field name="subject">practices</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Form, function, phylogeny and biogeography of enigmatic Australian metatherians</field><field name="creator">Beck, Robin Michael Davenport, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A molecular phylogeny of marsupials based on a 20.1 kb nuclear and mitochondrial supermatrix, with associated divergence dates calculated using a Bayesian ??relaxed?? molecular clock approach, is presented. Monophyly of the currently recognised orders, Australidelphia and a clade comprising Dasyuromorphia, Notoryctes, and Peramelemorphia is strongly supported; the name Agreodontia is proposed for the latter clade. The molecular divergence dates indicate that the interordinal divergences within Marsupialia occurred during the Late Cretaceous and early Palaeogene, and that several groups within the Australian radiation radiated during periods of significant environmental change in the Miocene. The fossil record of didelphids and most Australian marsupial groups appears to be particularly incomplete. Based on information provided by isolated petrosals and tarsals referred to this taxon, the early Eocene Australian metatherian Djarthia murgonensis appears to be the most plesiomorphic undoubted australidelphian and the oldest known crown-group marsupial from Australia. The presence of microbiotherians in South America may be the result of a back-dispersal from Australia or elsewhere in eastern Gondwana.  A qualitative functional analysis of the craniodental anatomy of the Oligo-Miocene Australian metatherian Yalkaparidon supports the hypothesis that this taxon was probably a ??mammalian woodpecker??, similar to Daubentonia, Dactylopsila, and the extinct apatemyids. The craniodental anatomy of Yalkaparidon is described in detail, and isolated astragali and calcanea are tentatively referred to the genus. Yalkaparidon appears to be a member of Australidelphia but without close relationships to any other australidelphian order. The order Yalkaparidontia is maintained, and revised ordinal and species-level diagnoses are presented. A revised phylogenetic definition for Marsupialia is proposed. Numbigilga ernielundeliusi, a bunodont metatherian from the early Pliocene of northeastern Queensland, is described, and the distribution of bunodont dental characters within Metatheria is reviewed. An overview of Gondwanan metatherian biogeography is presented. It is argued that current evidence supports only limited dispersal of metatherians between South America and Australia during the Late Cretaceous or early Palaeogene, and that this was largely due to dispersal barriers (climatic and environmental) present within the Antarctic mainland. Future priorities for a better understanding of metatherian evolution and the origin of the modern Australian marsupial fauna are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42789</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enrichment of skeletal muscle stem cell transplantation using chemotherapeutic drugs.</field><field name="creator">Kahatapitiya, Prathibha Chathurani</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">muscle stem cell</field><field name="subject">transplantation</field><field name="subject">selective enrichment</field><field name="subject">drug selection</field><field name="subject">muscle regeneration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Meat trays, marginalisation and the mechanisms of social capital creation: An ethnographic study of a licensed social club and its older users</field><field name="creator">Simpson-Young, Virginia</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ageing</field><field name="subject">social participation</field><field name="subject">clubs</field><field name="subject">social capital</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">independence</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4049</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Qualitative analysis of T-cell repertoire for relevance to non-progressive HIV infection</field><field name="creator">van Bockel, David John, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes are important for the control of viral replication during HIV infection, however the magnitude and breadth of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell response does not correlate well. The purpose for this study was the examination of the HLA-B*2705-specific CD8+ T-cell response to the KRWIILGLNK (KK10) epitope as a definitive model of immune control over HIV replication. The breadth of the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire was determined for an association between the qualitative nature of this response and immune escape and therefore, disease progression. Methodology was developed and validated for TCR repertoire analysis in formaldehyde fixed antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells. The TCR repertoire for the KK10-specific CD8+ T-cell response was defined in cross-section and longitudinally for 6 HLA-B*2705+ patients. Comparison was made to cognate HLA-A*0201 CMV NV9 and HLA-B*2705 EBV RL9-specific CD8+ T-cell populations using the Simpson??s diversity index and the Morisita-Horn similarity index for standardized repertoire analysis. HLA-B*2705 KK10-specific TCR repertoire was not found to be a determinant of control. Greater clonotype variation was found within CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell populations, suggesting an association with reactivation of CMV and disease state. An association was found between KK10-specific population diversity and the prevalence of cognate KK10 epitope in vivo. Cross-reactivity observed for dominant KK10-specific clonotypes suggested that avidity of CD8+ T-cells was important for in vivo survival. Phenotype and function was tested through multiparameter analysis of HIV and CMV-specific CD8+ T-cells. Increased frequency of CD127 (IL-7R) and Bcl-2 expression within dominant populations was suggestive of selective advantage. Division of dominant and sub-dominant CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell populations into ??early?? and ??late?? differentiation phenotypes indicated virus-specific mechanisms of clonotype turn over. No simple association of TCR expression was found for HIV and CMV-specific CD8+ T-cells with published examples of definitive TCR bias. Over-represented TCR ??-chain families of patients were found in association with public clonotypes. Convergent recombination of TCR genes was demonstrated as a mechanism for the prevalence of shared clonotypes. Standardized assessment of T-cell repertoire successfully identified mechanisms of antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell recruitment. A substantial increase in sample numbers is required before this methodology can be used to accurately demonstrate the importance of TCR repertoire usage in the control of human viral infection.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TCR</field><field name="subject">HIV</field><field name="subject">T-cell</field><field name="subject">CD8</field><field name="subject">LTNP</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PECVD silicon nitride for n-type silicon solar cells</field><field name="creator">Chen, Wan Lam Florence, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The cost of crystalline silicon solar cells must be reduced in order for photovoltaics to be widely accepted as an economically viable means of electricity generation and be used on a larger scale across the world. There are several ways to achieve cost reduction, such as using thinner silicon substrates, lowering the thermal budget of the processes, and improving the efficiency of solar cells. This thesis examines the use of plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposited silicon nitride to address the criteria of cost reduction for n-type crystalline silicon solar cells. It focuses on the surface passivation quality of silicon nitride on n-type silicon, and injection-level dependent lifetime data is used extensively in this thesis to evaluate the surface passivation quality of the silicon nitride films. The thesis covers several aspects, spanning from characterisation and modelling, to process development, to device integration. The thesis begins with a review on the advantages of using n-type silicon for solar cells applications, with some recent efficiency results on n-type silicon solar cells and a review on various interdigitated backside contact structures, and key results of surface passivation for n-type silicon solar cells. It then presents an analysis of the influence of various parasitic effects on lifetime data, highlighting how these parasitic effects could affect the results of experiments that use lifetime data extensively. A plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition process for depositing silicon nitride films is developed to passivate both diffused and non-diffused surfaces for n-type silicon solar cells application. Photoluminescence imaging, lifetime measurements, and optical microscopy are used to assess the quality of the silicon nitride films. An open circuit voltage of 719 mV is measured on an n-type, 1 &#8486;.cm, FZ, voltage test structure that has direct passivation by silicon nitride. Dark saturation current densities of 5 to 15 fA/cm2 are achieved on SiN-passivated boron emitters that have sheet resistances ranging from 60 to 240 &#8486;/&#9633; after thermal annealing. Using the process developed, a more profound study on surface passivation by silicon nitride is conducted, where the relationship between the surface passivation quality and the film composition is investigated. It is demonstrated that the silicon-nitrogen bond density is an important parameter to achieve good surface pas-sivation and thermal stability. With the developed process and deeper understanding on the surface passivation of silicon nitride, attempts of integrating the process into the fab-rication of all-SiN passivated n-type IBC solar cells and laser doped n-type IBC solar cells are presented. Some of the limitations, inter-relationships, requirements, and challenges of novel integration of SiN into these solar cell devices are identified. Finally, a novel metallisation scheme that takes advantages of the different etching and electroless plating properties of different PECVD SiN films is described, and a preliminary evalua-tion is presented. This metallisation scheme increases the metal finger width without increasing the metal contact area with the underlying silicon, and also enables optimal distance between point contacts for point contact solar cells. It is concluded in this thesis that plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposited silicon nitride is well-suited for n-type silicon solar cells.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">n-type solar cells</field><field name="subject">PECVD</field><field name="subject">Silicon nitride</field><field name="subject">Surface passivation</field><field name="subject">Laser processing</field><field name="subject">Photoluminescence</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of combined failure mechanisms in large scale open pit slopes</field><field name="creator">Franz, Juergen, Mining Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Failure mechanisms in large scale open pit slopes are more complex than could be considered through conventional slope design methods. Pit slope behaviour must be predicted accurately, because for very deep open pits, a small change of slope angle can have serious technical and economic consequences. Failure of hard rock slopes often involves both failure along naturally existing weakness planes and failure of intact rock. Without an advanced understanding of combined rock slope failure mechanisms, the validity of commonly applied methods of large scale slope analysis is questionable. The problem was investigated by means of a toolbox approach, in which a wide range of slope stability analysis methods were used and compared to address specific problems arising during slope design optimisation of the Cadia Hill Open Pit, NSW. In particular, numerical modelling is an advanced tool to obtain insight into potential failure mechanisms and to assist the slope design process. The distinct element method was employed to simulate complex rock slope failure, including fracture extension, progressive step-path failure and brittle failure propagation, which were previously often considered unimportant or too difficult to model. A new, failure-scale-dependent concept for the categorisation of slope failures with six categories ranging from 0 (stable) to 5 (overall slope failure) was suggested to assist risk-based slope design. Parametric slope modelling was conducted to determine the interrelationship between proposed categories and critical slope/discontinuity parameters. Initiation and progression of complex slope failure were simulated and described, which resulted in an advanced understanding of combined slope failure mechanisms and the important role of rock bridges in large scale slope stability. A graphical presentation of the suggested slope failure categories demonstrated their interrelationship to varied slope/discontinuity parameters. Although large scale slope analyses will always involve data-limited systems, this investigation shows that comprehensive, conceptual modelling of slope failure mechanisms can deliver a significantly improved insight into slope behaviour, so that associated slope failure risks can be judged with more confidence. The consideration of combined slope failure mechanisms in the analysis of large scale open pit slopes is essential if slope behaviour is to be realistically modelled.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">slope modelling</field><field name="subject">combined slope failure mechanism</field><field name="subject">large scale open pit slope</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public pedagogies, place and identity: an ethnographic study of an emerging postmodern community</field><field name="creator">Hickey, Andrew</field><field name="description">[Abstract]:Community is one of those &#8216;slippery terms&#8217;, something that is &#8216;nice to have&#8217; as Zygmunt Baumann (2001) notes, but something that we don&#8217;t often stop to think about- it is just there. The significance of community can&#8217;t be overstated however, and the ways that human interactions and connections to space are mediated have much to do with how we understand and interact with our communities. The project that underpinned this dissertation sought toexplore how ideas of community were constructed, represented and consumed by residents of a new &#8216;edge city&#8217; located in south- east Queensland, Australia. Applying a cultural studies approach and drawing on Anthony Cohen&#8217;s (2004) ideas of the boundary of community, thisdissertation suggests that mediations of community in the late-capitalist, postmodern world have taken on new meanings resulting in a shift in the way that individuals experience each other and the places they inhabit. In particular, the operation of public pedagogies deployedin consumer oriented mass communication artefacts including billboards, sales brochures and magazines, carry significant influence in determining how community is expressed and lived. Following an exploration of how various image and text-rich public pedagogical artefactsdeploy ideas of community and a survey of discussions with residents of this new urban space, ideas on what community means in the current era are proffered.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community;</field><field name="subject">public</field><field name="subject">pedagogies</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004958/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Born of fire, possessed by darkness : mysticism and Australian poetry</field><field name="creator">Davidson, Toby</field><field name="description">This dissertation is structured around five Australian mystical poets: Ada Cambridge,
John Shaw Neilson, Francis Webb, Judith Wright and Kevin Hart. It examines the
varieties of Western Christian mysticism upon which these poets draw, or with which
they exhibit affinities. A short prelude section to each chapter considers the thematic
parallels of their contemporaries, while the final chapter critically investigates
constructions of Indigeneity in Australian mystical poetry and the renegotiated
mystical poetics of Indigenous poets and theologians.
The central argument of this dissertation is that an understanding of Western
Christian mysticism is essential to the study of Australian poetry. There are three
sub-arguments: firstly, that Australian literary criticism regarding the mystical
largely avoids the concept of mysticism as a shifting notion both historically and in
the present; secondly, that what passes for mysticism is recurringly subject to poorly
defined constructions of mysticism as well as individual poets&#146; use of the mystical
for personal, creative or ideological purposes; thirdly, that in avoiding the concept of
a shifting notion critics have ignored the increasing contribution of Australian poets
to national and international discourses of mysticism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian poetry</field><field name="subject">Mysticism and poetry</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20090218.124155</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Current practices and future possibilities of performance recording extensively-grazed commercial beef herds in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Craig W.</field><field name="description">There is little evidence that the productivity of New Zealand beef herds has improved over time.  Data from the NZ Meat and Wool Board&#8217;s Economic Service (2006) suggest that the average national calving percentage has declined over the last two decades.  During the same period cattle carcass weights have increased but so too has the average cow live-weight which has resulted in increased maintenance costs of the cow herds.  It is unclear whether production efficiency in the industry has improved or declined over time.   The aim of this research was to develop means of improving productivity in commercial beef herds through practical methods of performance recording.  The objectives were firstly to establish current management practices in commercial herds and secondly to develop an objective system for cow selection and culling which would have practical application in commercial herds.	 Beef management survey Ninety two commercial beef producers with more than 100 breeding cows from the greater Canterbury region of New Zealand were surveyed.  Pasture control was the main reason given for owning a beef herd.  Size and conformation were the main selection criteria for choosing replacement heifers and bulls.  Over 80% of herds retained their own heifers as replacements and &gt;60% mated yearling heifers to first calve at two years of age.  Fertility was poor in the surveyed herds.  In-calf rates at pregnancy testing averaged 88% for maiden heifers, 92% for rising second calvers and 93% for mixed age (m.a.) cows.  There was no significant difference between in-calf rates of maiden heifers mated to first calve at two or three years of age; nor was there any significant difference between the re-breeding success of the two groups.  Heifers mated at least one week earlier than m.a. cows, achieved a re-breeding success 4.7% greater (P&lt;.01) than those mated at the same time.  Reasons for cows not weaning a calf included wet dry (9.3% of pregnant cows wintered), pregnancy tested not-in-calf (7.4%) and dam death (2.6%).  Only 87.9% of pregnant females wintered weaned a calf (89.4% of m.a. cows and 84.9% of heifers). Reasons why cows exited the herds included diagnosed empty (37.2% of all exits), involuntary culls (25.4%), sold wet dry (16.2%), deaths (13.1%) and poor calf production (5.1%).  Vaccination was infrequent with clostridial vaccines the most common in m.a. cows (15.2%) and in calves (40.7%); vaccination against Leptospirosis was much less common. Very few of the surveyed farms used any system of performance recording; as a result there was very little performance-based selection or culling practiced.  Evaluation of alternative measures of cow productivity	Data from four performance recording beef herds were used to compare alternative measures of cow productivity with the industry standard which is calf weaning weight adjusted for sex (SOC) and age of calf and age of dam (AOD), i.e. the &#8220;200 day weight.&#8221;  None of the alternative measures evaluated required knowledge of calving date and all were relatively easily obtainable in extensively managed beef herds.  The assessment of cows was based not on their estimated breeding values but instead on their most probable producing ability which, as the sum of all of the permanent, repeatable aspects of the calf-rearing ability of the cow, explains considerably more of the variance of weaning weight than does breeding value alone. SOC and AOD-adjusted marking weight, weaning weight and average daily gain (ADG) between marking and weaning were the traits mostly highly correlated with the 200d wt of calves (r = 0.68, 0.90 and 0.74. respectively). An Extensively- Grazed-Cow-Weaning-Index of these three indicator traits was found to be more highly correlated than any of the individual traits on their own (r = 0.94).  Index weights for the three indicator traits were calculated within each herd and then those within-herd index weights were regressed on readily obtainable herd descriptive variables to obtain a regression equation that could predict index weights for any herd.  When the model was applied to data from two additional herd years not included in the original model, the EGCW Index was highly correlated with the 200d weights (r&gt;0.90).    Performance-based culling of previously unselected commercial beef herds based on the EGCW Index will result in improved productivity due to the moderately high repeatability of calf weaning weight.  Objective data from extensively grazed commercial herds will also make possible the use of commercial herd data in genetic evaluations of herd sires.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">beef cows</field><field name="subject">performance recording</field><field name="subject">extensively grazed</field><field name="subject">200 day weight</field><field name="subject">weaning weight</field><field name="subject">marking weight</field><field name="subject">average daily gain</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300401 Animal breeding</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/844</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multisystemic therapy in New Zealand : effectiveness and predictors of outcome : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Turitea Campus, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Russell, Claire Jennifer</field><field name="description">A one-group pre-test post-test design (including 6- and 12-month follow-up), supplemented with benchmarking analyses, was employed to assess the effectiveness of Multisystemic Therapy (MST) for youth displaying antisocial behaviours in New Zealand. An additional aim of the current study was to assess for predictors and moderators of outcome. The predictor variables assessed included: Client satisfaction, therapeutic and supervisory alliance, therapist and supervisor adherence, therapist and supervisor allegiance, and therapist and supervisor accountability. Seventy-three youth and their families completed the MST program (M = 162 days) and the present study&#8217;s measures. Youth and their families experienced improvements in ultimate outcomes (offending frequency, offending seriousness, and days in out-of-home placements) and instrumental outcomes (youth positive and negative behaviour, parent well-being and psychopathology, parent ability, and family functioning) following MST treatment. With a few exceptions, these gains were largely maintained up to 12 months following treatment. Benchmarking analyses indicated that the completion rate and effect sizes were comparable with those from previous MST studies both in New Zealand and the United States. The predictor variables of service satisfaction, therapeutic alliance, and therapist adherence predicted higher levels of change in most instrumental outcomes as expected. However, of significant importance, higher supervisor adherence and supervisory alliances were associated with significantly lower therapist adherence, therapeutic alliance, and some client outcomes. Furthermore, the few significant interactions between predictor variables produced mixed findings, many of which contradicted widely held assumptions. As MST has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for youth offenders in New Zealand, continuing dissemination and ongoing evaluation of MST in New Zealand is recommended. In particular, given the negative impact of supervision variables on therapist adherence, therapeutic alliance, and some client outcomes, this would include research aimed at assessing various quality control functions of supervision, including supervisor training, mechanisms of supervision related to therapist and client variables, and the potential value of more closely monitoring the process of supervision.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multisystemic therapy</field><field name="subject">psychotherapy</field><field name="subject">antisocial behaviour</field><field name="subject">youth</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380105 Social and community psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Palaeoecological and biochronological studies of Riversleigh, world heritage property, Oligo-Miocene fossil localities, north-western Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Travouillon, Kenny James, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Riversleigh, World Heritage Property, located in North-western Queensland, Australia, contains over 200 fossil bearing localities from the Oligo-Miocene.

It is a challenge that is not only of interest for the construction of AI agents, but is of equal importance in the modelling of agent behaviour. The goal of this thesis is to contribute to the formalisation of agent reasoning by showing that the computational limitations of agents is a vital component of modelling rational behaviour. To achieve this aim, both motivational and formal aspects of resource-bounded agents are examined.  It is a central argument of this thesis that accounting for computational limitations is critical to the success of agent reasoning, yet has received only limited attention from the broader research community. Consequently, an important contribution of this thesis is in its advancing of motivational arguments in support of the need to account for computational limitations in agent reasoning research.  As a natural progression from the motivational arguments, the majority of this thesis is devoted to an examination of propositional approximate logics. These logics represent a step towards the development of resource-bounded agents, but are also applicable to other areas of automated reasoning.  This thesis makes a number of contributions in mapping the space of approximate logics. In particular, it draws a connection between approximate logics and knowledge compilation, by developing an approximate knowledge compilation method based on Cadoli and Schaerf??s S-3 family of approximate logics. This method allows for the incremental compilation of a knowledge base, thus reducing the need for a costly recompilation process. Furthermore, each approximate compilation has well-defined logical properties due to its correspondence to a particular S-3 logic. Important contributions are also made in the examination of approximate logics for clausal reasoning. Clausal reasoning is of particular interest due to the efficiency of modern clausal satisfiability solvers and the related research into problem hardness. In particular, Finger's Logics of Limited Bivalence are shown to be applicable to clausal reasoning. This is subsequently shown to logically characterise the behaviour of the well-known DPLL algorithm for determining boolean satisfiability, when subjected to restricted branching.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rational Reasoning</field><field name="subject">Approximate logics</field><field name="subject">Intelligent Agents</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analytical modeling of HSUPA-enabled UMTS networks for capacity planning</field><field name="creator">Liu, Tuo</field><field name="description">PhD</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">UMTS, HSUPA, Capacity Planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the relationships of interaction,
learner styles, and course content on student
satisfaction and outcomes in online learning</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Jay</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Online education offers many people the opportunity to begin or continue their education. The option to undertake studies has also expanded dramatically due toincreasing numbers of online programs. One of the strengths of online learning is the ability to provide a rich learning experience where students have the opportunity to interact using technology. Although a general profile of students who enrol in onlinecourses has been developed, very little of the research is comprehensive enough to create an understanding of the experience of individual online learners. Many studies have been conducted on the process of interaction and there is a need to learn more about how students use interaction and tools in online learning.A review of current research into online learning uncovered a need for a deeper understanding of how online students engage in interaction, their learning styles, and the types of content they use in their online courses. The research review raised a number of specific questions:&#8226; What types of online interactions are students having?&#8226; Are there particular learner types that are more successful in the online learning environment?&#8226; Is there specific course content that is used more often than others in online learning?&#8226; Are there obstacles to online interactions for students and if so what are they?&#8226; What factors influence student satisfaction in online learning?In particular do learning styles, course content and interaction influence learner satisfaction and outcomes in online learning? What impact do these variables have,separately and together, on online learners? This study looked at the educational experience of 124 online students using a 125 item online survey and follow-upinterview.The outcomes of this study showed that Participant and Independent learner styles were important factors contributing to the success of online learners. Even if they did not possess the skills before they entered the courses, the ability to demonstrate, analyze, andapply course content was of benefit to learners. Interaction did not have a significant impact on the outcomes or satisfaction of learners. The more closely the online courses matched the individual&#8217;s personal learning style and approach to online learning the moresatisfied and successful they were.The results of the research include a number of practical examples that can be easily integrated into the online learning environment. Those delivering, teaching, andstudying in online programs can use these results to increase their understanding of online education and apply that understanding to making online education more effective.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">online</field><field name="subject">learning;</field><field name="subject">online</field><field name="subject">education;</field><field name="subject">interaction;</field><field name="subject">learner</field><field name="subject">styles;</field><field name="subject">course</field><field name="subject">content;</field><field name="subject">satisfaction;</field><field name="subject">outcomes;</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004963/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collective intelligence in schools: an exploration of teacher engagement in the making of significant new meaning</field><field name="creator">Conway, Joan Margaret</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: It is universally acknowledged that teachers are a critical key in the enhancement of student achievement in our schools. Less accepted is that teachers are key knowledge workers in emerging 21st century societies, demonstrating understandings of how new knowledge is created as well as what it looks like. The related issue of how schools actually function as productive professional learning communities, and how teachers engage in their own learning processes, remains at best vaguely understood.The research on which this dissertation was based sought to establish new insights into the dynamics of how teachers who are engaged in a process of successful development and revitalisation create new knowledge and make significant new meaning. The research acknowledged that meanings ascribed to the processes in question might well be influenced by issues of ideology. Thus, in addition to drawing heavily on recent literature relating to the concepts of professional learning communities, distributed leadership and collective intelligence, the study incorporated a multiperspective dimension. The following research problem was established to guide the creation of research questions, a research design and related methodology:What emerges as a construct of collective intelligence in schools when teacher engagement in a pedagogical knowledge formation process is viewed from different ideological perspectives?The collective in this study was constituted of the membership of two professional learning communities independently engaged in a widely used process of school revitalisation, the IDEAS (Innovative Designs for Enhancing Achievement in Schools) process. IDEAS utilises a number of distinctive educational constructs, including parallel leadership, alignment of key organisational elements and a schoolwide approach to teaching and learning, to engage the professional community of a school in the creation of significant new knowledge in the form of vision statements, values and pedagogical frameworks.The data collected from each school community&#8217;s knowledge-generating experiences are presented in two case study bricolages. Interpretation of these data led to identification of particular characteristics associated with professional learning processes for successful meaning-making. Further analysis of the data, through the lenses of three ideological perspectives (critical reflection, hermeneutic phenomenology and orgmindfulness) resulted in the proposal of a construct for collective intelligence in schools.Of particular significance as a result of the research is the postulation of a new image of the professional teacher &#8211; one who recognises his/her capacity for engagement in collective and reflective practices through the exercise of new ways of thinking and acting in support of student achievement. The findings prompt further inquiry into the deep meanings associated with the dynamics of successful professional learning communities in both schools and a spectrum of other organisations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">collective</field><field name="subject">intelligence;</field><field name="subject">schools;</field><field name="subject">teacher</field><field name="subject">engagement</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004965/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Linear phase filter bank design by convex programming</field><field name="creator">Ha, Hoang Kha, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Digital filter banks have found in a wide variety of applications in data compression, digital communications, and adaptive signal processing. The common objectives of the filter bank design consist of frequency selectivity of the individual filters and perfect reconstruction of the filter banks. The design problems of filter banks are intrinsically challenging because their natural formulations are nonconvex constrained optimization problems. Therefore, there is a strong motivation to cast the design problems into convex optimization problems whose globally optimal solutions can be efficiently obtained.  The main contributions of this dissertation are to exploit the convex optimization algorithms to design several classes of the filter banks. First, the two-channel orthogonal symmetric complex-valued filter banks are investigated. A key contribution is to derive the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of complex-valued symmetric spectral factors. Moreover, this condition can be expressed as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and hence semi-definite programming (SDP) is applicable. Secondly, for two-channel symmetric real-valued filter banks, a more general and efficient method for designing the optimal triplet halfband filter banks with regularity is developed. By exploiting the LMI characterization of nonnegative cosine polynomials, the semi-infinite constraints can be efficiently handled. Consequently, the filter bank design is cast as an SDP problem. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the resulting filter banks are applied to image coding with improved performance. It is not straightforward to extend the proposed design methods for two-channel filter banks to M-channel filter banks. However, it is investigated that the design problem of M-channel cosine-modulated filter banks is a nonconvex optimization problem with the low degree of nonconvexity. Therefore, the efficient semidefinite relaxation technique is proposed to design optimal prototype filters. Additionally, a cheap iterative algorithm is developed to further improve the performance of the filter banks.  Finally, the application of filter banks to multicarrier systems is considered. The condition on the transmit filter bank and channel for the existence of zero-forcing filter bank equalizers is obtained. A closed-form expression of the optimal equalizer is then derived. The proposed filter bank transceivers are shown to outperform the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Semidefinite programming</field><field name="subject">Filter banks</field><field name="subject">Convex optimization</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Unified Mobility Management Architecture for Interworked Heterogeneous Mobile Networks</field><field name="creator">Munasinghe, Kumudu S</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">3G Cellular, WLAN, Interworking, Mobility Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4063</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Installation of Suction Caissons in Dense Sand and the Influence of Silt and Cemented Layers</field><field name="creator">Tran, Manh Ngoc</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">suction caissons</field><field name="subject">offshore foundations</field><field name="subject">installation</field><field name="subject">sand</field><field name="subject">silt</field><field name="subject">cemented</field><field name="subject">seepage</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4064</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterned and switchable surfaces for biomaterial applications</field><field name="creator">Hook, Andrew Leslie</field><field name="description">The interactions of biomolecules and cells at solid-liquid interfaces play a pivotal role in a range of biomedical applications and have hence been studied in detail. An improved understanding of these interactions results in the ability to manipulate biomolecules and concurrently cells spatially and temporally at surfaces with high precision. Spatial control can be achieved using patterned surface chemistries whilst temporal control is achieved by switchable surfaces. The combination of these two surface properties offers unprecedented control over the behaviour of biomolecules and cells at the solid-liquid interface. This is particularly relevant for cell microarray applications, where a range of biological processes must be duly controlled in order to maximise the efficiency and throughput of these devices. Of particular interest are transfected cell microarrays (TCMs), which significantly widen the scope of microarray genomic analysis by enabling the high-throughput analysis of gene function within living cells 
Initially, this thesis focuses on the spatially controlled, electro-stimulated adsorption and desorption of DNA. Surface modification of a silicon chip with an allylamine plasma polymer (ALAPP) layer resulted in a surface that supported DNA adsorption and sustained cell attachment. Subsequent high density grafting of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) formed a layer resistant to biomolecule adsorption and cell attachment. PEG grafted surfaces also showed significantly reduced attachment of DNA with an equilibrium binding constant of 23 ml/mg as compared with 1600 ml/mg for ALAPP modified surfaces. Moreover, both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions were shown to contribute to the binding of DNA to ALAPP. Spatial control over the surface chemistry was achieved using excimer laser ablation of the PEG coating which enabled the production of patterns of re-exposed ALAPP with high resolution. Preferential electro-stimulated adsorption of DNA to the ALAPP regions and subsequent desorption by the application of a negative bias was observed. Furthermore, this approach was investigated for TCM applications. Cell culture experiments demonstrated efficient and controlled transfection of cells. Electro-stimulated desorption of DNA was shown to yield enhanced solid phase transfection efficiencies with values of up to 30%. The ability to spatially control DNA adsorption combined with the ability to control the binding and release of DNA by application of a controlled voltage enables an advanced level of control over DNA bioactivity on solid substrates and lends itself to biochip applications.  
As an alternative approach to surface patterning, the fabrication and characterisation of chemical patterns using a technique that can be readily integrated with methods currently used for the formation of microarrays is also presented. Here, phenylazide modified polymers were printed onto low fouling ALAPP-PEG modified surfaces. UV irradiation of these polymer arrays resulted in the crosslinking of the polymer spots and their covalent attachment to the surface. Cell attachment was shown to follow the patterned surface chemistry. Due to the use of a microarray contact printer it was easily possible to deposit DNA on top of the polymer microarray spots. A transfected cell microarray was generated in this way, demonstrating the ability to limit cell attachment to specific regions and the suitability of this approach for high density cell assays. In order to allow for the high-throughput characterisation of the resultant polymer microarrays, surface plasmon resonance imaging was utilised to study the adsorption and desorption of bovine serum albumin, collagen and fibronectin. This analysis enabled insights into the underlying mechanisms of cell attachment to the polymers studied. For the system analysed here, electrostatic interactions were shown to dominate cellular behaviour.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">surface analysis</field><field name="subject">biomolecular manipulation</field><field name="subject">transfection</field><field name="subject">microarray</field><field name="subject">surface plasmon resonance imaging</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090210.161131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Associated movements as an indicator of motor functioning in children</field><field name="creator">Licari, Melissa Kym</field><field name="description">[Tuncated abstract] Previous research has shown that associated movements (AMs) decrease with age in typically developing children. However, considerable variability has been found to exist between children of the same chronological age (Wolff et al., 1983; Largo et al., 2001) and the reasons for this variability are unclear. As AMs are considered to be a construct of motor behaviour it is possible that varying levels of motor ability may contribute to this variability. Only a few studies have investigated the relationship between motor ability and AM expression, and those have resulted in equivocal findings. Therefore, the aim of the first study in this research project was to investigate the relationship between motor ability and AMs using a large sample of normative children (N=165). Group 1 consisted of 19 boys and 33 girls in school year 1 with a mean age of 6 years and 4 months (SD = 4 months); Group 2 consisted of 28 boys and 29 girls in school year 3 with a mean age of 8 years and 3 months (SD = 3 months); and Group 3 consisted of 27 boys and 29 girls in school year 5 with a mean age of 9 years 11 months (SD = 5 months). Motor ability was established using the McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development (MAND) (McCarron, 1982). Associated movements were measured using tasks adapted from the Zurich Neuromotor Assessment (Largo et al., 2002), the Fog Test (Fog &amp; Fog, 1963), and Licari et al. (2006). '...' The second study in this research project continued to explore the relationship between motor ability and AMs by investigating whether increased severity of AMs previously reported in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Denckla &amp; Rudel, 1978; Lazarus, 1994; Mostofsky et al., 2003) is reflective of symptoms associated with the disorder or movement difficulties co-occurring in some children with the disorder. Four groups of children participated in the study. Group 1 consisted of 13 children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) with a mean age of 7 years 3 months (SD = 9 months); Group 2 consisted of 13 children with ADHD with a mean age of 7 years 4 months (SD = 11 months); Group 3 consisted of 10 children with co-occurring DCD and ADHD with a mean age of 7 years 4 months (SD = 10 months); and, Group 4 was a normative sample 15 control children. The children undertook the same AM assessment protocol outlined for Study 1. The AM data was entered into the RUMM 2020 and person location estimates (Rasch AM scores) were created for each child based on the person location map from Study 1. A comparison of AM scores between the groups revealed that the DCD and DCD/ADHD groups showed significantly more (p &lt;0.001) AMs than the children in the ADHD and control groups. No significant differences were found between children in the DCD and DCD/ADHD groups (p = 0.19) or the ADHD and control groups (p = 0.67). The findings of this research show that increased expression of AMs is not influenced by the symptoms of ADHD. In addition, the finding that increased expression of AMs in children with DCD extends the findings from Study 1 showing that AM expression is linked to motor ability. Overall this research has enhanced the understanding of a unique measure of motor behaviour.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motor ability in children -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Motor learning</field><field name="subject">Movement disorders in children</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magneto-chemical speciation of pathogenic iron deposits in thalassaemia and malaria</field><field name="creator">Hackett, Sara</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Iron is essential to most biological systems. Under pathological conditions affecting the iron metabolic pathway, iron can be deposited in the tissue in various forms. The work presented in this thesis has exploited the relationship between the magnetic and the chemical properties of tissue iron deposits to further understanding of two major pathologies, the haemoglobinopathies termed thalassaemias and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, both amongst the most common health concerns in tropical countries. The iron-specific magnetic susceptibilities &#191;Fe for spleen tissue samples from 7 transfusion dependent &#223;-thalassaemia (&#223;-thal) patients and 11 non-transfusion dependent &#223;-thalassaemia/Haemoglobin E (&#223;/E) patients were measured at 37&#176;C. Both groups of patients were iron loaded with no significant difference in the distribution of spleen iron concentrations between the two groups. There was a significant difference between the mean &#191;Fe of the spleen tissue from each group. The &#223;/E patients had a higher mean (&#177; standard deviation) spleen &#191;Fe (1.55 &#177; 0.23 &#215; 10-6 m3.kgFe -1) than the &#223;-thal patients (1.16 &#177; 0.25 &#215; 10-6 m3.kgFe -1). Correlations were observed between &#191;Fe of the spleen tissue and the fraction of magnetic hyperfine split sextet in the 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectra of the tissues at 78 K (Spearman rank order correlation &#191; = -0.54, p = 0.03) and between &#191;Fe of the spleen tissue and the fraction of doublet in the spectra at 5 K (&#191; = 0.58, p = 0.02) indicating that &#191;Fe of the spleen tissue is related to the chemical speciation of the iron 2 deposits in the tissue. The biological variability of the iron-specific magnetic susceptibility of the tissue iron examined would contribute a random uncertainty of 19% to magnetic susceptibility based non-invasive measurements of tissue iron concentration. ... Magnetic susceptibility measurements were also performed on malaria parasitised red blood cells. In vitro cultures of P. falciparum were magnetically enriched up to 61-fold using high field gradient magnetic separation columns, and the magnetic susceptibility of cell contents was directly measured. Forms of haem iron were quantified spectroscopically. Further fractionations were performed such that, by controlling the fluid velocity through the column, cells with more than a critical amount of paramagnetic 3 iron were preferentially extracted. A chloroquine-sensitive (CQS) laboratory strain of parasites converted approximately 60% of host cell haem iron to haemozoin and this product was the primary source of the increase in cell magnetic susceptibility. The volumetric magnetic susceptibility of the magnetically enriched cells was found to be 0.15 &#177; 0.03 &#215; 10-7 relative to the suspension medium, accounting for the enrichment of mature parasites. Comparisons of fractionation samples of two pairs of CQS and chloroquine resistant (CQR) strains showed enrichment of mature parasites was significantly greater in the CQS than the CQR strains. The results suggest the possibility of using magnetic separation columns in identifying CQR strains of P. falciparum, potentially in a diagnostic or research setting. The study also underlines the need to identify and quantify the forms of iron in CQR and CQS parasite strains as the fate of haem iron will have implications in understanding the mechanisms of chloroquine resistance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antimalarials</field><field name="subject">Blood -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">Chloroquine</field><field name="subject">Iron -- Metabolism</field><field name="subject">Iron -- Physiological transport</field><field name="subject">Malaria -- Pathogenesis</field><field name="subject">Thalassemia</field><field name="subject">Malaria</field><field name="subject">Iron nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">Magnetism</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamically installed anchors for floating offshore structures</field><field name="creator">Richardson, Mark Damian</field><field name="description">The gradual depletion of shallow water hydrocarbon deposits has forced the offshore oil and gas industry to develop reserves in deeper waters. Dynamically installed anchors have been proposed as a cost-effective anchoring solution for floating offshore structures in deep water environments. The rocket or torpedo shaped anchor is released from a designated drop height above the seafloor and allowed to penetrate the seabed via the kinetic energy gained during free-fall and the anchor&#146;s self weight. Dynamic anchors can be deployed in any water depth and the relatively simple fabrication and installation procedures provide a significant cost saving over conventional deepwater anchoring systems. Despite use in a number of offshore applications, information regarding the geotechnical performance of dynamically installed anchors is scarce. Consequently, this research has focused on establishing an extensive test database through the modelling of the dynamic anchor installation process in the geotechnical centrifuge. The tests were aimed at assessing the embedment depth and subsequent dynamic anchor holding capacity under various loading conditions. Analytical design tools, verified against the experimental database, were developed for the prediction of the embedment depth and holding capacity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anchorage (Structural engineering)</field><field name="subject">Offshore structures -- Anchorage</field><field name="subject">Offshore structures -- Hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Structural analysis (Engineering)</field><field name="subject">Soil mechanics</field><field name="subject">Floating structures</field><field name="subject">Offshore foundation</field><field name="subject">Anchors</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unsupervised categorization : perceptual shift, strategy development, and general principles</field><field name="creator">Colreavy, Erin Patricia</field><field name="description">Unsupervised categorization is the task of classifying novel stimuli without external feedback or guidance, and is important for every day decisions such as deciding whether emails fall into 'interesting</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Categorization (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Cognition</field><field name="subject">Perception</field><field name="subject">Unsupervised categorization</field><field name="subject">Perception</field><field name="subject">Supervised categorization</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-testing the link between youth receptivity to tobacco promotion and their susceptibility to smoke</field><field name="creator">Lee, Alvin Yiam Chuah</field><field name="description">The Index of Receptivity to Tobacco Industry Promotion (IRTIP) is a model that is used by hundreds of articles. The causal claim based on findings from this model is even more pervasive, and has resulted in much of the modern post 1998 tobacco legislation that is still enforced. This thesis tested the link between adolescent receptivity to tobacco industry promotion and susceptibility to smoking. Pierce et al. (1998) reported that they had found a positive and causal association between receptivity and susceptibility by using IRTIP. They claimed that receptivity to tobacco industry promotion was the only significant causal factor affecting adolescent susceptibility to smoking. Exposure to peer and parental smoking was not found to be a significant effect. A review of the literature found that many sections of IRTIP differ from accepted marketing theory on how cigarette advertising and promotions affect adolescent adoption of cigarette smoking. The proxy measures used in IRTIP were shown to diverge from those previously used for measuring the constructs of Attention, Intention, Desire and Action (AIDA) in marketing communications. IRTIP also differs from previous theory by including measures that attempt to quantify the effect of tobacco premiums into a model that was designed to measure the effects of advertising.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Advertising -- Cigarettes -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Advertising -- Tobacco industry</field><field name="subject">Advertising and youth</field><field name="subject">Mass media and youth</field><field name="subject">Smoking</field><field name="subject">Youth -- Tobacco use</field><field name="subject">Advertising</field><field name="subject">Tobacco</field><field name="subject">Receptivity</field><field name="subject">Adolescents</field><field name="subject">Validation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attentional and interpretive bias manipulation : transfer of training effects between sub-types of cognitive bias</field><field name="creator">Jeffrey, Sian</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] It is well established that anxiety vulnerability is characterised by two biased patterns of selective information processing (Mathews &amp; MacLeod, 1986; Mogg &amp; Bradley, 1998). First anxiety is associated with an attentional bias, reflecting the selective allocation of attention to threatening stimuli in the environment (Mathews &amp; MacLeod, 1985; MacLeod, Mathews &amp; Tata, 1986; MacLeod &amp; Cohen, 1993). Second anxiety is associated with an interpretive bias, reflecting a disproportionate tendency to resolve ambiguity in a threatening manner (Mogg et al., 1994). These characteristics are shown by normal individual high in trait anxiety (Mathews, Richards &amp; Eysenck, 1989; Mogg, Bradley &amp; Hallowell, 1994; Mathews &amp; MacLeod, 1994), and by examining clinically anxious patients who repeatedly report elevated trait anxiety levels (MacLeod, Mathews &amp; Tata, 1986; Mogg &amp; Bradley, 1998). '...' Two alternative hypotheses regarding this relationship are proposed. One hypothesis is that attentional and interpretive biases are concurrent expressions of a single underlying biased selectivity mechanism that characterises anxiety vulnerability (the Common Mechanism account). In contrast, a quite different hypothesis is that attentional and interpretive biases are independent cognitive anomalies that represent separate pathways to anxiety vulnerability (the Independent Mechanisms account). The present research program was designed to empirically test the predictions that differentiate the Common Mechanism and Independent Mechanisms accounts. The general methodological approach that was adopted was to employ bias manipulation tasks from the literature that have been developed and validated to directly modify one class of processing bias (i.e. attentional bias or interpretive bias). The effect of these direct bias manipulation tasks on a measure of the same class of processing bias or the other class of processing bias was then examined. The Common Mechanism and Independent Mechanisms accounts of the relationship between attentional and interpretive bias generate differing predictions concerning the impact of directly manipulating one class of processing bias upon a measure of the other class of processing bias. The central difference between the alternate accounts is their predictions regarding cross-bias transfer, that is the transfer of training effects from direct manipulation of one class of processing bias to a measure of the other class of processing bias. Whereas the Common Mechanism account predicts that such cross-bias transfer will occur, the Independent Mechanisms account does not predict such transfer. A series of seven studies is reported in this thesis. There was some difficulty achieving successful bias modification using bias manipulation approaches established in the literature; however when such manipulation was achieved no cross-bias transfer was observed. Therefore the obtained pattern of results was consistent with the Independent Mechanisms (IM) account, and inconsistent with the Common Mechanism (CM) account. A more detailed version of the IM account is developed to more fully accommodate the specific results obtained in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anxiety -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Attention</field><field name="subject">Emotions and cognition</field><field name="subject">Interpersonal communication</field><field name="subject">Self-perception</field><field name="subject">Interpretive bias</field><field name="subject">Bias manipulation</field><field name="subject">Attentional bias</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deep-placed phosphate fertiliser improves phosphorus uptake and seed yield of canola (Brassica napus L.) in a Mediterranean-type climate</field><field name="creator">Rose, Terry</field><field name="description">In Mediterranean-type climates, topsoil frequently dries out during spring. Problems associated with reduced nutrient (P, K) availability in dry topsoil may be overcome by placing fertilisers deeper in the soil, where the soil is more likely to remain moist for longer periods as opposed to conventional fertiliser placement. Deep-P placement has resulted in significant yield improvements for lupin crops in Mediterranean environments because lupin crops generally require soil P supply during spring (throughout the flowering stage); in contrast, wheat yields have seldom improved with deep P placement, presumably because plants have accumulated sufficient P prior to spring (grain filling stage) for maximum grain yields. The P and K accumulation patterns of canola had not been investigated, and therefore any potential yield benefits of deep placed fertilisers were unknown. This study aimed to define the P and K demands of canola throughout the growing season, and assess the viability of deep placement of fertiliser in matching soil P and K supply to crop demand. The study further investigated the impact of deep placement of P fertiliser on root growth and distribution throughout the soil profile. Initial glasshouse studies compared the P and K accumulation patterns of several canola cultivars with wheat, and found that the P and K demand of canola continued until later into the season than wheat, but there was little difference in the P and K accumulation patterns of the various canola cultivars. Further experiments in sand culture determined that regardless of the level of K supply, canola plants had accumulated sufficient K for maximum seed yields by early flowering. Under high P supply, canola plants had accumulated enough P for maximum seed yields by early flowering, but when P supply during vegetative growth was just adequate, plants required a continual P supply until mid silique-filling to attain maximum yields. Because plants had accumulated sufficient K for maximum seed yields by early flowering (therefore topsoil drying in spring was unlikely to affect yields), further field experiments examined only deep placement of P fertiliser to improve P uptake and yields.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant nutrients</field><field name="subject">Fertilizers -- Application</field><field name="subject">Phosphorus in agriculture</field><field name="subject">Phosphatic fertilizers</field><field name="subject">Potassium in agriculture</field><field name="subject">Potassium fertilizers</field><field name="subject">Canola</field><field name="subject">Phosphorus</field><field name="subject">Potassium</field><field name="subject">Deep-placed fertiliser</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Associative strength determines prejudice-linked differences in automatic stereotype activation</field><field name="creator">Wood, Chantelle</field><field name="description">There is little consensus in the social-cognitive literature concerning the way in which prejudice and stereotyping are related, though a number of explanatory models have been proposed. The present research program empirically examines one recent model; Lepore and Brown's Associative Strength Model (ASM: 1997; 1999; 2002). The main premise of the ASM is that differential endorsement of stereotypic content leads to individual variation in the content that is automatically activated upon categorisation. Specifically, it predicts that high-prejudice people automatically activate negative stereotypic traits, and low-prejudice people automatically activate positive stereotypic traits. The current research used a primed lexical decision task to examine prejudicelinked differences in automatic stereotype activation. In addition, an impression formation task based on that of Lepore and Brown was included to measure stereotype application. Experiments 1A and 1B attempted to evaluate the predictions of the ASM using the category and stereotype of Asians. However, neither experiment was able to demonstrate a priming effect, prejudice-linked or otherwise, using this social category. Experiments 2 and 3, in contrast, successfully induced stereotype activation using the category of gay men. Furthermore, results were consistent with the predictions of the ASM. After priming with the category of gay men, high-prejudice participants exhibited greater activation of negative stereotypic traits and low-prejudice participants exhibited greater activation of positive stereotypic traits. However, parallel patterns of stereotype application were not found in the impression formation task, with participants forming positive impressions, regardless of prejudice. Experiment 4 used an honesty manipulation to investigate the possibility that self-presentational concerns were responsible for the discrepancies between stereotype activation and application. Consistent with this argument, Experiment 4 found prejudice-linked patterns of stereotype application that mirrored the patterns of stereotype activation when self-presentation concerns were reduced. When instructed to be honest, high-prejudice participants in the gay prime condition formed negative impressions and low-prejudice participants in the gay prime condition formed positive impressions. The current program of research provides the first direct empirical support for the predictions of the Associative Strength Model concerning stereotype activation. In addition, new questions have been raised that future research should seek to explore.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prejudices -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Prejudices -- Psychology -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Stereotypes (Social psychology)</field><field name="subject">Associative strength model</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hormonal regulation of the anticoagulant Protein S</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Qunitin William</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Every year thousands of individuals suffer from thrombotic related complications that in some cases can be fatal and every year millions of women take some form of hormonal contraceptive. In some cases, there is a cause and effect relationship between the two as users of the combined oral contraceptive pill have an increased risk of developing a thrombotic event. Increased circulating levels of oestrogen cause a prothrombotic shift in the coagulation cascade resulting from upregulation of several procoagulant proteins and a decrease of key anticoagulant proteins. One of the most oestrogen sensitive anticoagulants is Protein S (PS), a product of the PROS1 gene. PS acts as a cofactor to activated protein C (aPC) and the PS-aPC complex serves to downregulate clot formation by deactivating the tenase and prothrombinase complexes via proteolytic cleavage of activated factors VIII and V, respectively. As such, low PS levels are associated with an increased risk of developing thrombotic disorders such as pulmonary embolism, stroke or coronary thrombosis and deep vein thrombosis. During pregnancy when oestrogen levels increase, a steady decline in PS is evident in the early weeks of gestation and continues to decrease to below the normal range in the 2nd trimester, remaining there until post-partum. In addition, reduced free and total PS levels are observed in users of the combined oral contraceptive (COC) pill that contains an oestrogen and a progestin. Interestingly, users of 3rd generation COCs have significantly greater reductions of PS than do 2nd generation COC users. The difference between the two forms is the type of progestin, not the oestrogen, which is predominantly ethinyl oestradiol in the majority of commercially available preparations. At present, a mechanism to describe the relationship between oestrogen and/or progesterone associated with the observed in vivo changes in the levels of PS has not been identified. The aim of this thesis was to define the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of PS expression by oestrogen and progesterone. In this study, a Combined Single-stranded conformational analysis and Heteroduplex Analysis (CSHA) iv methodology was optimised for screening both PROS1 DNA and mRNA for the detection of mutations. '...'  This may explain why users of 3rd generation COCs display a greater reduction in circulating PS levels compared to 2nd generation users. To investigate potential PS interactions with other proteins that could be hormonally regulated, a yeast-2-hybrid (Y-2-H) screen was performed using the PS molecule as a 'bait' against molecules derived from liver and bone marrow cDNA libraries. A clone that contained a portion of another haemostatic protein, Protein Z (PZ) was isolated and confirmed via sequencing. As no full length PZ clones were identified, a second Y-2-H screen was performed once again using the PS molecule as bait and the PZ molecule as the fish. Interaction between the two proteins was shown to be possible via the successful growth of colonies on triple knock out selective media and by positive &#223;-galactosidase activity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blood -- Coagulation</field><field name="subject">Hematology</field><field name="subject">Hemostasis</field><field name="subject">Hormones</field><field name="subject">Protein S</field><field name="subject">Haematology</field><field name="subject">Endocrinology</field><field name="subject">Coagulation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In situ chemical analysis of tattooing inks and pigments : modern organic and traditional pigments in ancient mummified remains</field><field name="creator">Poon, Kelvin Weng Chun</field><field name="description">At various points in human history, tattooing has been ubiquitous on almost every continent on Earth, used for reasons of aestheticism, religious beliefs or for social purposes. To study the art of tattooing with respect to a particular culture, one must always be critical to any references to the practice (written, pictorial or artefactual) due to issues of translation and misinterpretation. Complete verification may only come with the discovery of actual tattooed human remains. In combination with artefactual and anthropological evidence, these remains not only provide physical proof of the practice in a culture's ancestry but also possess the ability to link various other forms of physical evidence, which on their own would remain speculative. By its very nature, tattooing may only exist while the bearer is alive. Once the owner dies, the skin, along with the tattoo, decomposes (under normal decomposition conditions) and is lost forever. However, tattoos may survive if the dermal layers of the skin are preserved, either by natural or artificial means. The processes of mummification in various civilisations have provided us with a rare opportunity to study the art and processes of tattooing in antiquity. Existing tattooed mummified remains have been found in: Egypt; Siberia; Eastern Central Asia; Greenland; Alaska and St. Lawrence Islands; Central Andes (Peru and Chile); Philippines; New Zealand and Italy. Existing literature regarding the analysis of tattooing inks and pigments once deposited into the skin is very limited. Comparatively, the industrial organic pigments used to colour the majority of modern tattooing inks sold today have not been officially approved by any regulating body and as such, manufacturers are not required to disclose the chemical ingredients of their products. Chemical identification of these tattoo pigments post-procedure will aid medical practitioners in the event of complications or for the purposes of tattoo removal. Forensically, tattoos are often one of the distinguishing features used in the identification of victims of crime or accidents. Experiments were carried out using an animal model (Sus scrofa) for the tattooing. Given the theoretically large but ultimately limited range of substances available to both ancient and modern tattooists, the premise of the experiment involved surveying the literature regarding possible tattooing pigments and either obtaining or reproducing a careful selection of these in the laboratory. These pigments were then tattooed onto the ii animal model and after allowing for the essential healing period, the tattooed areas were excised, with those tattooed with traditional pigments subjected to various simulated mummification environments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Archaeological chemistry</field><field name="subject">Chemistry, Analytic</field><field name="subject">Mummies</field><field name="subject">Organic compounds -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">Pigments</field><field name="subject">Tattooing</field><field name="subject">Tattoo</field><field name="subject">In situ chemical</field><field name="subject">Mummification</field><field name="subject">Industrial organic pigments</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power, politics and policy : creating, deploying and resisting meaning in New Zealand public sport policy</field><field name="creator">Piggin, Joe</field><field name="description">All policy involves the transmission of language and ideas and therefore power. Public sport and recreation policy, through which millions of tax dollars are allocated and which disseminates knowledge and understandings about sport and recreation, is one arena where power relations are constantly formed, reformed and challenged. To understand more about the exercise of power in New Zealand sport and recreation policy, this research examines the dissemination and challenge of policies written by Sparc (Sport and Recreation New Zealand), the organisation responsible for public sport and recreation policy in New Zealand. 
 Three questions were used to understand the exercise of power in New Zealand public policy. These questions included: How is knowledge about sport and recreation produced and disseminated through public policy? How is &#65533;the truth&#65533; about sport and recreation proclaimed and constructed in public policy? How can individuals affected by sport and recreation policy challenge existing relations of power? 
 Theoretically, this research draws on Foucauldian conceptions about power, knowledge, truth and the self. Foucault argued that individuals and groups exercise power discursively, by promoting and deploying certain dominant discourses (or understandings) to the exclusion of other (subjugated) knowledges. As such, the way in which individuals within a society understand knowledge, truth and the self is governed by dominant discourses, and is continually formed discursively over time. Discourses are deployed through a variety of means, including the writing, implementation and resistance of public policy. 
 Methodologically, the thesis merges Foucault&#65533;s archaeological and genealogical approaches to studying discourses. Further, it is guided by a critical discourse analysis, which enables the researcher to question the assumptions behind policy discourses. Data is gathered from various sources, including policy documents, public debate over policy, media articulations of policy and interviews with individuals involved in the writing and resistance of public policy. 
 This research highlights four distinct practices (or techniques) that illustrate how power is exercised in public sport and recreation policy. These techniques include an analysis of bio-power, techniques used to analyse, control, and define the body; governmentality, which dictates the range of possible actions of individuals and citizens; games of truth, through which &#65533;the truth&#65533; is part of a constant discursive debate; and parrhesia, a practice through which citizens can lessen the effect of dominant discourses on their lives. These practices are analysed through specific case studies within the discursive terrain of public sport and recreation policy. With each case study both theoretical considerations and practical suggestions for policy making are offered. 
 Four findings are discussed. Firstly, public policy can discursively and problematically construct understandings of the world through policy goals and measurements. Secondly, the thesis suggests that while public sport and recreation policy is often defended by policy makers as scientific and rational, its writing and implementation is formed by a number of other understandings which cannot be reconciled with the espoused, positivist logic. Thirdly, the thesis suggests that because policy writing is an ongoing process, and because of changing social conditions, &#65533;the truth&#65533; about particular policies is also susceptible to change. Fourthly, despite protestors of public policy often believing their resistance is in vain, this study suggests that their efforts do appear to influence the subsequent writing of policy. 
 The research concludes with reflections about the problematic discursive effects of public policy as well as a consideration of the potential for groups and individuals to challenge or resist understandings about sport and recreation which they do not agree with. In turn, it offers recommendations about the future development of sport public policy, as well as a reflection of this particular type of research approach used. Finally, using this research as a pivot point, sites for future research are considered. In particular, an examination of the effect of public policy on individuals&#65533; lived experiences (as distinct from communities or nations) might be of interest, as would an investigation of effects of global discourses about sport, recreation and physical activity on national public policy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sports and state</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081117.154305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary ecology of non-diadromous galaxiid fishes (Galaxias gollumoides and G. &#65533;southern&#65533;) in Southern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Crow, Shannan Kyle</field><field name="description">Coexisting species are interesting from evolutionary and ecological perspectives. Sympatry can provide insights into mechanisms that allow stable long-term coexistence, such as niche partitioning, character displacement, interspecific competition and species boundaries. In New Zealand streams, a flock of closely related non-migratory galaxiid fishes exist throughout eastern South Island (Galaxias vulgaris sensu lato). These fishes are largely parapatric, but recent studies have found streams that contain coexisting populations of two newly discovered galaxiids (Galaxias &#65533;southern&#65533; and G. gollumoides). In such streams there is a cline from allotopic (sections of streams containing predominantly one species) G. &#65533;southern&#65533; (lower altitudes) to allotopic G. gollumoides (higher altitudes), with a syntopic (both species) transition section. Such coexistence makes G. &#65533;southern&#65533; (yet to be formally described) and G. gollumoides ideal for examining the ecology and evolution of sympatric taxa. Very little is known about these two taxa. This thesis aims to detail the morphology, ecology and genetic differentiation between G. &#65533;southern&#65533; and G. gollumoides. These factors will be used to address separate species status and the possibility of interspecific competition. Data will also be used to examine resource and morphological shifts in either species between syntopy and allotopy, which maybe consistent with character displacement theory. 
 All fish collected for analysis were first classified as G. &#65533;southern&#65533; or G. gollumoides by eye and by mtDNA. Morphological and ecological (habitat use and diet/isotope enrichment) differentiation between the two species were examined from three sympatric streams (streams containing allotopic and syntopic sites; representing three separate catchments) and four allopatric streams (streams containing only allotopic sites; representing two separate catchments). For sampling purposes, sympatric streams were subdivided into lower (allotopic G. &#65533;southern&#65533;), mid (syntopic) and upper (allotopic G. gollumoides) sections. We used this sampling regime to test for character displacement (i.e. ecological and morphological shifts between syntopy and allotopy). Diet, stable isotope, genetic structuring and hybridisation (amplified fragment length polymorphisms) were analysed from the three sympatric streams. Artificial stream channels were also used to observe the influence of interspecific competition on resource use over a complete diel cycle. 
 G. &#65533;southern&#65533; and G. gollumoides were found to be morphologically distinct, differing significantly in 21 of 25 morphological measurements. The two species were also segregated ecologically with G. &#65533;southern&#65533; preferring shallower water, coarser substrate, and higher water velocity, feeding predominantly on mayflies (Ephemeroptera). In contrast, G. gollumoides preferred deeper water, finer substrate and lower water velocity, feeding predominantly on terrestrial invertebrates. Dietary segregation was also reflected by differences in [delta]&#65533;&#65533; Carbon and [delta]&#65533;&#8309; Nitrogen enrichment. Morphological shifts consistent with character displacement were seen in overbite size and mouth size, but neither trait showed consistent statistical differences within and across streams. Ecological shifts were seen in distance to the nearest cover, with G. gollumoides being found further away from cover in syntopy and G. &#65533;southern&#65533; being found the same distance away from cover in syntopy and allotopy. In artificial stream channels, resource use of both species was not affected by the presence of a congener, but both species used faster water velocities during the night while remaining ecologically distinct. AFLP analysis revealed distinct genotypic clustering between these species with no F1 hybrids. Fine-scale genetic structuring was also observed within both species among streams, and among sites within streams. 
 The minimal effect of a congener on resource use suggests that interspecific competition is not a strong force shaping sympatric populations of Southland galaxiids. This is also reflected by the lack of consistent morphological shifts between allopatry and sympatry. Similarly, character displacement does not seem to be a strong influencing G. &#65533;southern&#65533; and G. gollumoides. Diel cycles influenced niche expression in both fishes suggesting that abiotic factors may be important in structuring freshwater fish communities in Southland. The fine-scale genetic structuring within both species suggests limited conspecific genetic mixing and movement within streams, which possibly reflects drainage evolution. The absence of F1 hybrids suggests reproductive isolation between G. &#65533;southern&#65533; and G. gollumoides which may be associated with assortative mating. The present study provides evidence for the separate status of these sympatric fishes under several species concepts. There is conclusive evidence for morphological, ecological and genetic differentiation between sympatric G. &#65533;southern&#65533; and G. gollumoides, and such segregation maybe associated with long term coexistence in nature.

To date in New Zealand, there has been no specific investigation of this aspect of education, despite the widespread reliance on teacher aide support as the primary means of responding to disabled students&#65533; presence in schools. Similarly, there are very few New Zealand studies in which teacher aides are the primary participants. This thesis seeks to address this absence in New Zealand educational research by exploring students&#65533; and teacher aides&#65533; experiences of working together, in order to understand the impact of assigning responsibility for students who have complex learning support requirements to teacher aides who require no qualification, training, or experience to work in this role. 
 This interpretive qualitative study is positioned in a multi-dimensional framework of current disability, social justice, and sociology of childhood theorising. A series of semi-structured meetings were held with ten students, aged eight to seventeen years, who attended schools in the South Island of New Zealand. As well, semi-structured interviews were conducted with eighteen teacher aides who worked in a range of primary, intermediate, and secondary schools in the same geographic area as the student participants. Data were interpreted utilizing both inductive and deductive means of analysis. 
 Students&#65533; participation in the research and their contributions to the findings demonstrated their competence, agency, and heterogeneity. Students conveyed a sense of the importance and value of the teacher aide&#65533;s role, if clearly defined and carried out in a positive, professional manner within the context of supportive schools. The findings relating to teacher aides&#65533; experiences highlighted the diverse, ambiguous nature of their roles, conceptualised as a continuum of support ranging from aiding teachers in inclusive contexts, to aiding students in assimilationist circumstances, to assuming the role of teacher or babysitter for students in exclusive educational environments. Analysis of teacher aides&#65533; experiences revealed the fundamental importance of relationships in coming to know students in terms of their humanness and competence, and in underpinning teacher aides&#65533; efforts to do the right thing by students. Participants also identified the need for all adults involved in the policy and practice of education to develop shared understandings of respectful, socially just ways of thinking about disability and childhood as the foundation of a common commitment to teach all students well. 
 The insight generated by participants, who represent perhaps the least powerful of students and employees in New Zealand schools, illuminates some of the most significant changes that need to occur in the thinking and practices of people involved in educational policy-making, teacher and teacher aide education, and schools. Addressing these educational deficits may contribute to the development of a socially just education system that is respectful of and responsive to human difference while recognising and respecting our mutual humanness.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teachers' assistants</field><field name="subject">students with disabilities</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">social justice</field><field name="subject">special education</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081125.160830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Glutamate receptor expression during the maintenance of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus</field><field name="creator">Kennard, Jeremy Thomas Timothy</field><field name="description">Changes in the strength of connections between neurons underlie information storage in the mammalian brain. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a long-lasting form of synaptic plasticity that has been described extensively in the hippocampus, a brain structure that plays a key role in memory formation. The molecular events that realise the persistence of LTP are not well understood, but it is known to require protein synthesis. The aim of this thesis was to investigate synaptic protein expression during the late-phase of hippocampal LTP in freely moving rats. 
 LTP was induced in the perforant path input to the dentate gyrus of Sprague-Dawley rats using high-frequency electrical stimulation paradigms known to produce LTP that persists for many days. To focus on late-occurring events, and complement existing data sets, rats were sacrificed 48 h after LTP induction. A broad survey of synaptic proteins was conducted by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using postsynaptic density (PSD) fractions. Over 200 protein spots were resolved, from which 163 individual proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. These included cytoskeletal proteins, signalling molecules, molecular chaperones and mitochondrial components, but no transmembrane receptor proteins were detected. 
 Few of the identified proteins were found to undergo significant changes in expression, although proteomic comparison of PSDs prepared from LTP-stimulated and control dentate gyri showed reduced expression of the three component proteins of the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel. While these data complement earlier studies suggesting that the late-phase of LTP is associated with mitochondrial restructuring, they cannot alone explain the persistence of LTP. To directly test whether LTP persistence is associated with increased expression of presynaptic marker proteins, suggesting increased neurotransmitter release; and/or increased postsynaptic receptor expression, implicating an increase in postsynaptic contact area, a targeted approach using Western Blot analysis of dentate gyrus subcellular fractions was undertaken.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gutamic acid</field><field name="subject">receptors</field><field name="subject">hippocampus (brain)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081127.155142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Iron signalling pathways of Pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="creator">Mettrick, Karla Adelle</field><field name="description">The pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses a variety of highly efficient chelating compounds (siderophores) to acquire sufficient iron for growth and virulence. These siderophores can either be endogenous or acquired from exogenous sources such as other bacteria or fungi. The transport of the endogenous siderophore pyoverdine activates a signal-transduction pathway that increases the synthesis of both the ferripyoverdine receptor protein (FpvA) and pyoverdine itself. Signal-transduction systems similar to this have three specific proteins involved: a receptor protein specific for one siderophore in the outer membrane, an anti-sigma factor in the cytoplasmic membrane and a sigma factor that activates gene expression in the cytoplasm. 
 The aim of the research presented in this thesis was to study the roles of the proteins in three different iron uptake and signalling pathways of P. aeruginosa. The substrates for each receptor protein were confirmed and the roles of each protein in the pathways were compared to the P. aeruginosa pyoverdine signalling pathway. The pyoverdine, desferrioxamine and ferrichrome transport pathways were studied to find whether interactions occur between them and if so, the mechanism(s) for that interaction. Furthermore, a technique for analysing gene expression of P. aeruginosa in sputum from the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung was developed. This technique was subsequently used to study the levels of iron responsive gene expression. 
 The receptor, sigma factor and anti-sigma factors were all found to have a role in the siderophore-induced expression of their own signalling pathway. The experimental data provide evidence of similarities in the roles of the sigma and receptor proteins within each pathway but different roles for the anti-sigma factors. In the absence of the cognate sigma factor or anti-sigma factor the expression of the desferrioxamine and ferrichrome receptors could not be upregulated. Without its cognate sigma factor fpvA could no longer be upregulated in the presence of pyoverdine. However, unlike the other systems, in the absence of the cognate anti-sigma factor, expression of fpvA was always observed. This is consistent with the anti-sigma factors being required for the activity of the cognate sigma factor in the ferrichrome and desferrioxamine signalling pathways but not the pyoverdine signalling pathway. 
 The siderophore signalling pathways were found to be upregulated in the presence of multiple siderophores, but generally to a lesser extent than if only one siderophore was available. This suggests that in the presence of multiple siderophores, P. aeruginosa uses all available iron chelators. The study of the role of the receptor, sigma factor and anti-sigma factor into these effects indicate sigma factor competition for RNA polymerase has a major role in the effects of multiple siderophores on pathways upregulation. 
 The gene expression studies of P. aeruginosa in sputum from the lungs of CF patients provided support for the hypothesis that the bacteria were growing in an environment where iron levels were sufficient for bacterial growth, but not storage of iron. The expression of the sigma factor gene pvdS that is required for pyoverdine synthesis was studied because expression of this gene is a sensitive reporter of intracellular iron levels. It was found to be downregulated in bacteria in sputum compared to laboratory grown bacteria. This result suggests the bacteria are inhabiting a more iron-replete environment within the lung. This finding advances our understanding of the CF lung environment and the impact it has on P. aeruginosa infection. This knowledge has medical implications for the development of novel therapies to combat P. aeruginosa infection.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cellular signal transduction</field><field name="subject">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">iron</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081128.143145</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sky detection in images for solar exposure prediction</field><field name="creator">Laungrungthip, Nuchjira</field><field name="description">This project describes a technique for segmenting regions of sky in an image from the remainder of the image. This segmentation technique is part of a method for predicting the solar exposure at a location of interest from a set of photographs. Given the latitude and longitude of the position and the direction and field of view of the camera it is possible to calculate the position of the sun in the image at a particular time on a particular day.  If that position is in a sky region of the image then the location will be exposed to the sun at that time. Critical to the success of this method for determining solar exposure is the image processing used to separate the sky from the rest of the image. This work is concerned with finding a technique which can do this for images taken under different weather conditions. The general approach to separate the sky from the rest of the image is to use the Canny edge detector and the morphology closing algorithm to find the regions in the image. The brightness and area of each region are then used to determine which regions are sky. The FloodFill algorithm is applied to identify all pixels in each sky region.  An extensive empirical study is used to find a set of threshold values for the Canny edge detector, applied to the blue colour channel, which allow successful identification of the sky regions in a wide range of images. Tests using different camera filters show that they do not usefully increase the contrast between the sky and the rest of the image, when a standard compact camera is used. The work reported in this thesis shows that this approach of finding edges to identify possible sky regions works successfully on a wide range of images although there will always be situations, such as when the image is taken directly into the sun, where manual adjustment to the identified regions may be required.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">solar exposure</field><field name="subject">skyline</field><field name="subject">image processing</field><field name="subject">image segmentation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280203 Image processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Retirement: self-esteem and leisure lifestyles</field><field name="creator">Graham, Sarah</field><field name="description">The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between participation in leisure activities and the self-esteem and life satisfaction of retired New Zealanders. A mail questionnaire and interviews were used to gather information from 100 retirees in Christchurch, New Zealand. The issues examined were: the individual's perceived self-esteem and life-satisfaction levels, their pre- and post-retirement leisure activities and their own personal characteristics that may be related to the types of leisure activities in which they participate. A number of hypotheses were proposed. Results from this research supported the proposed hypotheses at a 95% confidence level. There were no significant differences between catagories of retirees, classified according to such things as their leisure activities, life satisfaction and self-esteem. Results showed that although there was no relationship at such a high confidence level, there were relationships at a lower confidence level. Those retirees who participated in the questionnaire and interviews appeared to be well adjusted to retirement, and involved in a wide range of leisure activities. Overall, there was an increase in the number of activities regularly participated in after retirement. The majority rated themselves as being in very good or excellent health. Not only do those who are married and live with others participate in all types of activities, but so do those who are widowed, never married and live alone. For those who live alone, their leisure participation provides the opportunity for social interaction and skill development. "Just as the ancient Greeks believed the life of leisure required extensive preparation, so too does retirement" (Godby, 1985:179). My research suggests that those with a wide range of recreation and leisure skills adapt best to retirement. There is a need for leisure activity to be a part of pre-retirement planning. Those with limited leisure interests may need to rekindle old interests or develop new leisure pursuits so that, in retirement, they will enjoy some continuity of lifestyle.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">retirement</field><field name="subject">leisure</field><field name="subject">self-esteem</field><field name="subject">lifestyles</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370403 Recreation and leisure studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/859</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Observations on the sodium airglow</field><field name="creator">Greet, P.

Infection of the enterohepatobiliary tract of several mammals by this group of bacteria results in various pathological disorders. The availability of the Helicobacter hepaticus sequenced and annotated genome, allowed molecular characterisation of the responses of H. hepaticus to host factors such as bile. The adaptation/responses of the bacterium to bovine, porcine and human bile were investigated using proteomics and transcriptomics. Ninety-one different proteins were identified in the responses of H. hepaticus response to the three types of bile. These proteins participate in several key cellular processes including DNA replication; protein transcription, translation and folding; oxidative stress response; motility; virulence; and metabolism. In particular, the bacteria deployed several strategies such as inhibition of the TCA cycle and the electron transport chain as well as iron sequestration to ensure control of the levels of hydroxyl radicals. The results of this study revealed also the modulation by bile of the expression of H. hepaticus genes involved in response to oxidative stress and virulence. The responses of human HEp-2 and Huh7-derived cell-lines to H. hepaticus and Helicobacter bilis, respectively, were investigated employing proteomics and transcriptomics. One-hundred and twenty different proteins were differentially expressed in the responses of the human cells to the presence of Helicobacter spp. in the cell cultures. These proteins are involved in regulation of cell proliferation and structure; metabolism; protein transcription, translation and modification; stress response; and tumour induction. For example, in co-cultures of Huh7-derived cells and H. bilis, the activation of several mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins and the dysregulation of several apoptosis effectors were suggested as mechanisms that could result in the death of the liver cells. Importantly, the differential expression of several tumour-related proteins by the Huh7 cells supported a possible role for Helicobacter spp. in liver cancer.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proteomics</field><field name="subject">Helicobacter hepaticus</field><field name="subject">Helicobacter bilis</field><field name="subject">Molecular</field><field name="subject">Bile</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Liver</field><field name="subject">2D-PAGE</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43379</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Location tracking architectures for wireless VoIP</field><field name="creator">Shah, Zawar, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A research area that has recently gained great interest is the development of network architectures relating to the tracking of wireless VoIP devices. This is particularly so for architectures based on the popular Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Previous work, however, in this area does not consider the impact of combined VoIP and tracking on the capacity and call set-up time of the architectures. Previous work also assumes that location information is always available from sources such as GPS, a scenario that rarely is found in practice. The inclusion of multiple positioning systems in tracking architectures has not been hitherto explored. It is the purpose of this thesis to design and test SIP-based architectures that address these key issues.  Our first main contribution is the development of a tracking-only SIP based architecture. This architecture is designed for intermittent GPS availability, with wireless network tracking as the back-up positioning technology. Such a combined tracking system is more conducive with deployment in real-world environments.  Our second main contribution is the development of SIP based tracking architectures that are specifically aimed at mobile wireless VoIP systems. A key aspect we investigate is the quantification of the capacity constraints imposed on VoIP-tracking architectures. We identify such capacity limits in terms of SIP call setup time and VoIP QoS metrics, and determine these limits through experimental measurement and theoretical analyses.  Our third main contribution is the development of a novel SIP based location tracking architecture in which the VoIP application is modified. The key aspect of this architecture is the factor of two increase in capacity that it can accommodate relative to architectures utilizing standard VoIP.  An important aspect of all our tracking architectures is the Tracking Server. This server supplies the location information in the event of GPS unavailability. A final contribution of this thesis is the development of novel particle-filter based tracking algorithms that specifically address the GPS intermittency issue. We show how these filters interact with other features of our SIP based architectures in a seamless fashion.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Network architectures</field><field name="subject">Location tracking</field><field name="subject">Voice over IP</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher Leadership in South-East Queensland Anglican Schools</field><field name="creator">Sly, Mark Donald</field><field name="description">This research study explores the issue of teacher leadership in South-East Queensland Anglican schools. An initial exploration of the context of Anglican education in South-East Queensland confirmed that both nationally and within the Anglican system, hierarchical understandings of school leadership were being challenged amidst a growing expectation of teacher leadership. However, despite this expectation of teacher leadership, there was little in respect to formal policy and resource support for teacher leadership within South-East Queensland Anglican schools. This research study seeks to gain a more informed and sophisticated understanding of teacher leadership, with particular focus on the perspective of classroom teachers. A comprehensive analysis of key literature in educational change, professionalism in education and educational leadership, revealed a number of key insights that informed this study. Significant socio-economic change in recent decades has brought about corresponding educational change. This has resulted in a call for greater professionalism in education and a new paradigm of educational leadership. Within this context, there is new interest in distributing leadership beyond the formal role of the principal and into the hands of teacher leaders. However, a further review of the literature highlighted the lack of a clear conceptualisation of teacher leadership. While teacher leadership is predominantly considered in the literature as the domain of those in formal, positional roles, less is known about informal, in-class teacher leadership. Based on these insights, the researcher identified one major research question: How do teachers, who are recognised as teacher leaders in South-East Queensland Anglican schools, conceptualise teacher leadership? To answer this research question, four research sub-questions were posed: Behaviour of teacher leaders - What do they do? Purpose of teacher leadership - Why do teachers strive for this? Feelings of teacher leaders - How do they feel about what they do? Support for teacher leaders - What do they need? This research study is situated within the theoretical framework of symbolic interactionism. As both a perspective and a method, symbolic interactionism is situated within a pragmatic constructivist research paradigm. This research study explored a restricted group of 16 teachers within three South-East Queensland Anglican schools, and employed qualitative research methods including Experience Sampling Method and focus group interviews. The findings of this research study suggest that teacher leaders in South-East Queensland Anglican schools have a confused conceptualisation of teacher leadership, with little common symbolic language to delineate the phenomenon. This study made the following conclusions in relation to teacher leadership in South-East Queensland Anglican schools: The broad understanding of teacher leadership is unrecognised in the field of education. Teacher leadership is a complex phenomenon. Teacher leadership is principled action in support of learning. There is untapped potential for teacher leaders to act as change agents in school revitalisation. Collegial relationships, the provision of time, relevant professional development and administrative support enable teacher leadership There is a need for a role-making policy to support teacher leadership. The development of teacher leadership in South-East Queensland Anglican schools requires support from the Anglican Schools Commission, school principals and the teachers themselves, through deliberate action in developing appropriate policy and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teacher leadership</field><field name="subject">Anglican schools</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp190.24022009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epilepsy research using nonlinear signal processing</field><field name="creator">Wallace, Angus Keith</field><field name="description">This thesis applies several standard nonlinear quantifiers to EEG analysis to examine both human primary generalised epilepsy (PGE) and rat models of human epilepsy.
We analysed rat EEG, and then used the analysed data, in parallel with an impedance recording, to better understand the events during experiments.
Next, the nonlinear analysis of EEG was used to attempt to model the behaviour of the impedance data. This modeling did not yield a useful predictive tool, so we recommend the continued recording of impedance data as a means of augmenting EEG recordings.
The analyses were also applied to human data, and showed differences between the PGE and control groups in apparently normal EEG. We then attempted to use these differences to detect the presence of PGE in an unclassified subject &#150; a diagnostic tool. This was done using a feed-forward neural network. We found that the inter-group differences were exploitable and facilitated the diagnosis of PGE in previously unknown subjects. The extent to which this is useful as a diagnostic tool should be assessed by further trials.
Finally, the analyses were used to examine data from a paralysed human subject, in an attempt to identify the mental task being performed by that
subject. This was not successful, suggesting that the same analyses that were useful in discriminating between PGE and control were not useful in detecting the mental state of the subject. It was also apparent that the presence of EMG (in an unparalysed state) assisted task-classification.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">epilepsy</field><field name="subject">nonlinear</field><field name="subject">signal processing</field><field name="subject">classification</field><field name="subject">neuroscience</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20081124.210552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Falling in Place: Place and its Imaginary in Making Performance</field><field name="creator">Haren, Sam</field><field name="description">This study began with a personal recognition of the importance of space in my creative process. As a theatre director, I need to see and feel the space for a work before I know how to direct or create the performance. Once I know what the space is &#151; everything falls into place. This fascination with space in my creative process has triggered a larger investigation into the operations of place in the making of contemporary performance. 
 
The first part of the thesis embarks on a series of theoretical and creative journeys to learn more about place and how it is positioned within contemporary performance. It journeys 
through contemporary theory on place in the work of Gaston Bachelard, Edward S. Casey, Henri Lefebvre, Michel de Certeau and Marc Auge. These theorists think about place as a product of human dwelling and social production, and its conceived dimensions as psychic structures for a culture that embodies the fantasies, desires and visions of our places. 
 
The thesis traces my physical journey from Australia to the Wooster Group in New York City and Forced Entertainment in Sheffield where I observed and worked with two significant contemporary performance companies, each in their own place. The Wooster Group has maintained an ongoing &#145;osmotic&#146; relationship with SoHo, absorbing the underground experimentations of performance makers in the 1960s, to the retail experimentations of Prada today in the now gentrified district. Similarly, Forced Entertainment has lived through a rejuvenation of Sheffield, which is examined in relation to a shift in the company&#146;s aesthetic and style. I also encountered these 
companies and another, Societas Raffaello Sanzio, at festivals in Australia. Societas Raffaello Sanzio avoid endless repetition on tour with Tragedia Endogonidia &#151; a project that creates a new work for each place it performs in &#151; balancing the desires of the international performing arts market with a portable strategy towards place. 

The second part of the thesis returns to examine the imaginaries of Australia and Adelaide, the nation and city in which I work. It considers the impact of these imaginaries in a performance laboratory called The Rope Project, which explores Adelaide&#146;s myth of &#145;The Family&#146; and Alfred Hitchcock&#146;s Rope. Lacan&#146;s notion of the imaginary is used to examine the &#145;national imaginary&#146; of Australia as place where people disappear, an imaginary maintained by representations that imbue the Australian landscape with a hostile agency. The thesis argues that the erasure implicit in the colonial concept of terra nullius has informed a national imaginary obsessed with disappearance. A dossier of The Rope Project reveals the myth of &#145;The Family&#146; explored as a representation in the performance laboratory. &#145;The Family&#146; is the result of two competing imaginaries connected to the city of Adelaide: its founding utopian imaginary, the &#145;Athens of the South&#146;, and its horror-inverse, &#145;The World&#146;s Murder Capital&#146;. This mythology was generated as a conservative backlash to the social reforms of Premier Don Dunstan and maintains a perceived connection between homosexuality and deviance. The thesis offers in conclusion fresh insights into the use of the imaginary and lived aspects of place in the creation of new performance works.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">place</field><field name="subject">adelaide</field><field name="subject">australia</field><field name="subject">family</field><field name="subject">disappearance</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090224.142202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic influences on vaccine response in children</field><field name="creator">Baynam, Gareth</field><field name="description">Vaccination is one of the most efficacious public health interventions1 and has been increasingly used to combat non-infectious diseases. Mechanisms underlying vaccine responses overlap with those regulating immune responses in health and disease. Therefore, an understanding of mechanisms underpinning these responses will have broad implications. Variation in immune response genes contributes to impaired vaccine responses2-4. Understanding the contribution of genetic variants to vaccine responses is likely to be particularly important in early life given the generalized functional immaturity of the immune system in infants and the highly variable kinetics of its maturation over the first few years of life5-7. However, studies of genetic influences on early childhood vaccine responses are scarce. Since a number of genes from several pathways are likely to be important, a targeted approach is necessary. This thesis explored the effects and interactions of genes associated with atopy, as atopy, or the genetic risk for it, has been associated with modulation of early childhood vaccine responses. This thesis aimed to: 1) investigate genetic variants associated with atopy on early childhood vaccine responses; 2) examine interactions between these genetic variants and non-genetic factors; 3) approach developmental genetic influences on genetic effects and their interactions; and 4) extend findings on vaccine responses to other immunological phenotypes and disease outcomes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vaccination of children</field><field name="subject">Immunization of children</field><field name="subject">Diphtheria -- Vaccination</field><field name="subject">Tetanus -- Vaccination</field><field name="subject">Pneumococcal vaccine</field><field name="subject">Vaccination -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="subject">Vaccines</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The taming of London's commons</field><field name="creator">Thornton, Neil P.

Fishing, for instance, has always played a very important role in these communities' culture and tradition. Subsistence fishing is traditional in most rural coastal communities. Small-scale fishing is also wide-spread. Traditionally marine areas and resources were managed by the custodians of the adjacent land and the traditional leaders in some local communities. While small-scale fisheries are managed by the Government, much of the enforcement responsibility is in the hands of the community leaders, given the realities of what that Government can provide. This research has explored the interaction between rural coastal livelihoods and marine resource management under Customary Marine Tenure (CMT) in one area of Temotu Province, Solomon Islands. Specifically the research seeks to explore, explain and describe how the livelihoods of the rural coastal villagers influence the use, access and management of marine resources and vice versa. Particular attention has been given to: first exploring the traditional marine resource management under CMT and livelihoods in the three villages; second, how the changes in the villagers' livelihoods system affects the customary marine resource management in the three case study villages; third, how changes in customary marine resource management influences the livelihoods of the villagers and finally the nature of the relationship between livelihoods and customary marine resource management is described for the first time for this part of the Solomon Islands. The research results showed that villagers' livelihoods have changed over the past decade and much of these changes have affected the customary marine resource management in the three case study villages. Consequently, customary marine resource management under CMT is no longer effective. The changes in customary marine resource also have implications on the villagers' livelihoods. For this reason the study argues that when trying to understand the factors affecting customary marine resource, the entire livelihoods system of the people should be considered. The study states that the nature of the interactions between livelihoods and customary marine resource management is a two-way relationship, dynamic and very complex. Should there be further marine resource development, the study suggests that understanding the livelihoods of the people concerned is important for better management.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">livelihoods</field><field name="subject">customary marine resource management</field><field name="subject">marine resources</field><field name="subject">customary marine tenure</field><field name="subject">fishing</field><field name="subject">Temotu Province</field><field name="subject">Solomon Islands</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/861</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbial factors associated with the natural suppression of take-all wheat in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chng, Soon Fang</field><field name="description">Take-all, caused by the soilborne fungus, Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt), is an important root disease of wheat that can be reduced by take-all decline (TAD) in successive wheat crops, due to general and/or specific suppression. A study of 112 New Zealand wheat soils in 2003 had shown that Ggt DNA concentrations (analysed using real-time PCR) increased with successive years of wheat crops (1-3 y) and generally reflected take-all severity in subsequent crops. However, some wheat soils with high Ggt DNA concentrations had low take-all, suggesting presence of TAD. This study investigated 26 such soils for presence of TAD and possible suppressive mechanisms, and characterised the microorganisms from wheat roots and rhizosphere using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). A preliminary pot trial of 29 soils (including three from ryegrass fields) amended with 12.5% w/w Ggt inoculum, screened their suppressiveness against take-all in a growth chamber. Results indicated that the inoculum level was too high to detect the differences between soils and that the environmental conditions used were unsuitable. Comparison between the Ggt DNA concentrations of the same soils collected in 2003 and in 2004 (collected for the pot trial), showed that most soils cropped with 2, 3 and 4 y of successive wheat had reduced Ggt DNA concentrations (by 195-2911 pg g-1 soil), and their disease incidences revealed 11 of the 29 test soils with potential take-all suppressiveness. Further pot trials improved the protocols, such that they were able to differentiate the magnitudes of suppressiveness among the soils. The first of the subsequent trials, using 4% w/w Ggt inoculum level, controlled conditions at 16&#176;C, 80% RH with alternate 12 h light/dark conditions, and watering the plants twice weekly to field capacity (FC), screened 13 soils for their suppressiveness against take-all. The 13 soils consisted of 11 from the preliminary trial, one wheat soil that had been cropped with 9 y of wheat (considered likely to be suppressive), and a conducive ryegrass soil. The results revealed that 10 of these soils were suppressive to take-all. However, in only four of them were the effects related to high levels of microbial/biological involvement in the suppression, which were assessed in an experiment that first sterilised the soils. In a repeat trial using five of the soils H1, H3, M2, P7 (previously cropped with 3, 3, 4 and 9 y successive wheat, respectively) and H15 (previously cropped with 5 y of ryegrass), three of them (H1, H3 and M2) had reduced Ggt DNA concentrations (&gt;1000 pg g-1 soil reductions), and were confirmed to be suppressive to take-all. A pot trial, in which 1% of each soil was transferred into a &#947;-irradiated base soil amended with 0.1% Ggt inoculum, indicated that soils H1 and H3 (3 y wheat) were specific in their suppressiveness, and M2 (4 y wheat) was general in its suppressiveness. The microbial communities within the rhizosphere and roots of plants grown in the soils, which demonstrated conduciveness, specific or general suppressiveness to take-all, were characterised using PCR-DGGE, and identities of the distinguishing microorganisms (which differentiated the soils) identified by sequence analysis. Results showed similar clusters of microorganisms associated with conducive and suppressive soils, both for specific and general suppression. Further excision, re-amplification, cloning and sequencing of the distinguishing bands showed that some actinomycetes (Streptomyces bingchengensis, Terrabacter sp. and Nocardioides sp.), ascomycetes (Fusarium lateritium and Microdochium bolleyi) and an unidentified fungus, were associated with the suppressive soils (specific and general). Others, such as the proteobacteria (Pseudomonas putida and P. fluorescens), an actinomycete (Nocardioides oleivorans), ascomycete (Gibberella zeae), and basidiomycete (Penicillium allii), were unique in the specific suppressiveness. This indicated commonality of some microorganisms in the take-all suppressive soils, with a selected distinguishing group responsible for specific suppressiveness. General suppressiveness was considered to be due to no specific microorganisms, as seen in soil M2. An attempt to induce TAD by growing successive wheat crops in pots of Ggt-infested soils was unsuccessful with no TAD effects shown, possibly due to variable Ggt DNA concentrations in the soils and addition of nutrients during the experiment. Increasing numbers of Pseudomonas fluorescens CFU in the rhizosphere of plants, during successive wheat crops was independent of the Ggt DNA concentrations and disease incidence, suggesting that increases in P. fluorescens numbers were associated with wheat monoculture. This study has demonstrated that TAD in New Zealand was due to both specific and general suppressiveness, and has identified the distinguishing microorganisms associated with the suppression. Since most of these distinguishing microorganisms are known to show antagonistic activities against Ggt or other soilborne pathogens, they are likely to act as antagonists of Ggt in the field. Future work should focus on validating their effects either individually, or interactively, on Ggt in plate and pot assays and under field conditions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici</field><field name="subject">take-all</field><field name="subject">successive wheat</field><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="subject">inoculum</field><field name="subject">suppressive soils</field><field name="subject">take-all decline</field><field name="subject">microbial populations</field><field name="subject">wheat</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology::270306 Microbial genetics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300204 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/863</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Lutheran orthodoxy of J.S.

I was inspired to undertake this study by the relatively low rate of wives, particularly mothers, in full-time employment in Japan. 291 Japanese husbands in Kawasaki and the Tokyo area answered the questionnaire. Their occupations were company employees, teachers and self-employed men and their ages ranged from the 20s to 50s. The results of my survey revealed that these Japanese husbands did not actively participate in housework and childcare. Their participation increased somewhat when wives were highly educated or older. However, a wife??s higher income was the most powerful incentive to encourage their participation. Husbands also participate in these tasks in accordance with their preferences rather than their expressed abilities. With respect to their views on married women and employment, many husbands acknowledged a general relationship between power and finance (that is, that income-earning is connected with domestic power), yet denied that it applied to themselves when asked about it. The majority showed supportive or sympathetic attitudes towards full-time housewives, which were rarely extended to employed wives except for those who work (part-time) due to clear financial necessity.  Concerning men??s views on their wives, they were likely to appreciate a wife??s additional income. Nonetheless, a majority wanted their wives either to earn less than themselves or to have no income, even though the majority had income-earning wives. Their most popular employment status for a wife was part-time employment. The study revealed that most of these husbands had a strong identity as the ??breadwinner?? or ??head of the house??.  In this study I explored a new dimension to Japanese husbands?? perceptions of their wives?? employment: the possibility that husbands?? attitudes and preferences were militating against their wives?? employment. My study demonstrated that husbands especially resist full-time employment for their wives, and seek to maintain traditional gender roles because this sustains their self-esteem. This is clearly one significant reason for the comparatively low rate of participation of Japanese wives in full-time employment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gender role</field><field name="subject">Japanese men</field><field name="subject">wife's employment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A computable overlapping generation model (OLG) of Chinese pension reform</field><field name="creator">Yi, Xin, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis uses a computable Overlapping Generation (OLG) model to examine the Chinese pension reform. The research involves two steps: calibrating an OLG model for the Chinese economy; and undertaking policy evaluations. Model calibration involves choosing a set of household and firm parameters to capture the key features of the Chinese economy and pension system. Policy evaluation involves using the calibrated model to compare economic variables under alterative pension policies.  The major pension policy focus is a comparison of Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) and full funded social security designs. The thesis examines the effect of pension reform on the economy from both economy-wide and inter-generational dimensions. On the economy-wide variables, the thesis finds that economic outputs would eventually (at steady state level) increase substantially if the pension system switched to full-funding from a PAYG scheme. This outcome mainly results from the difference in capital stock under alterative pension schemes, as the thesis assumes labor inputs and technological progress grow exogenously. On the inter-generational aspect, the results from the thesis suggest that if pension reform occurred, household wages would be much higher than under the PAYG scheme, which is taken to be the existing policy structure, as would lifetime income and household saving. I find that consumption initially declines at the time of reform, but recovers to a higher level. Finally the thesis concludes that the utility of the generation born just before pension reform would fall by between 0.4 and 0.6 percent, but the utility of future generations would eventually increase by between 2.4 and 4.3 percent.  Based on the simulation results the thesis argues for two conclusions. Firstly, China??s economic output would increase if the pension reform occurred, as the capital stock under the full funded scheme is higher than under the PAYG scheme. Secondly, the thesis finds that the losers are the older generation at the time of the pension reform but that all other generations would benefit from the reform.

Several important issues closely relevant to deep-water oil and gas developments were investigated, covering installation of suction caisson foundations, interpretation of fullflow penetrometers and shallow penetration of a cylindrical object (submarine pipeline or T-bar), all in clayey sediments such as are often encountered in deep-water sites. These problems are commonly characterised by large vertical movements of structural elements relative to the seabed. A large deformation finite element method was adopted and further developed to simulate these challenging problems, referred to as Remeshing and Interpolation Technique with Small Strain. In this approach, a sequence of small strain Lagrangian increments, remeshing and interpolation of stresses and material properties are repeated until the required displacement has been reached. This technique is able to model relative motion between the penetrating objects and the soil, which is critical for evaluating soil heave inside the caissons, the effect of penetration-induced remoulding on the resistance of full-flow penetrometers, and influence of soil surface heave on the embedment of pipelines. '...'  Simple expressions were presented allowing the resistance factors for the T-bar and ball penetrometers to be expressed as a function of the rate and strain-softening parameters. By considering average strength conditions during penetration and extraction of these full-flow penetrometers, an approximate expression was derived that allowed estimation of the hypothetical resistance factor with no strain-softening, and hence an initial estimate of the stain-rate dependency of the soil. Further simulations of cyclic penetration tests showed that a cyclic range of three diameters of the penetrometers was sufficient to avoid overlap of the failure mechanism at the extremes and mid-point of the cyclic range. The ball had higher resistance factors compared with the T-bar, but with similar cyclic resistance degradation curves, which could be fitted accurately by simple expressions consistent with the strain-softening soil model adopted. Based on the curve fitting, more accurate equations were proposed to deduce the resistance factor with no strain-softening, compared with that suggested previously based on the resistances measured in the first cycle of penetration and extraction. The strain-rate dependency was similar in intact or post-cyclic soil for a given rate parameter. The resistance factor for the post-cyclic condition was higher than that for the initial conditions, to some degree depending upon soil sensitivity and brittleness parameter. For the shallow penetration of a cylindrical object, the penetration resistance profile observed from centrifuge model tests was very well captured by the numerical simulation. The mechanism of shear band shedding was reproduced by the numerical technique, although the frequency of the shear band generation and the exact shape of the heave profile were not correctly captured, which were limited by the simple strainsoftening soil model adopted.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Caissons</field><field name="subject">Ocean engineering</field><field name="subject">Offshore structures -- Foundations</field><field name="subject">Offshore structures -- Hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Finite element method</field><field name="subject">Large deformation</field><field name="subject">Suction caisson</field><field name="subject">Full-flow penetrometer</field><field name="subject">Shear strength</field><field name="subject">Clays</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment and comparison of osseointegration in conventionally and immediately restored titanium implants in a sheep model</field><field name="creator">Fitzgibbon, Daniel Nathan</field><field name="description">Objectives: The present work was under taken to compare osseointegration of immediately and delayed restored implants in a sheep model, and to compare methods of assessing osseointegration. 
 Methods: Twenty wide-platform implants were placed in the posterior mandibles of 10 sheep, 3 months after premolar extractions. Ten were control implants placed and restored after 3 months of submerged healing. Ten were test implants placed contralaterally and immediately restored. Animals were sacrificed after a further 3 months of healing. At each experimental stage implant stability was measured with resonance frequency analysis (RFA) and standardized radiographs were taken. Tissue blocks with the implants were embedded in acrylic resin. The specimens were analysed by three-dimensional micro tomogram (micro-CT) images. Ground sections of the tissue blocks were then prepared for light microscopy and quantitative morphometry. Morphometric parameters computed by both methods were mean percent bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and mean percent bone density (BD). Radiographic, stability and morphometric measurements were compared statistically. 
 Results: The survival rate was 60% (controls) versus 40% (test) (p=0.28). Mean crestal bone levels after three months restoration did not differ significantly between control (5.54 &#65533; 0.92) and test groups (4.35 &#65533; 1.61) (p=0.56). All surviving implants were stable at stage three and RFA values in implant stability quotient (ISQ) did not differ significantly between the two groups (test 82.3 &#65533; 3.9 versus control 78.8 &#65533; 4.3, p=0.36). No correlation was found between crestal bone loss and RFA (Spearman&#65533;s rho =-0.27, p=0.46). Histomorphometric analysis found no statistical difference (%BIC test 65.65 &#65533; 12.7%, control 53.36 &#65533; 6.41%, p=0.18; and %BD test 54.84 &#65533; 8.45%, control 64.69 &#65533; 13.57%, p=0.11). A similar trend was observed for mean micro-CT (%BIC test 65.72 &#65533; 72, control 50.84 &#65533; 4.19, p=0.11). Histology revealed high density inflammatory infiltrates beneath the sulcular and pocket epithelium. No significant difference was found between histomorphometric (HMA) and microCT analysis (%BIC p=0.08, %BD p=0.08). A statistically significant correlation was observed between HMA and microCT for %BIC (Spearman&#65533;s rho = 0.89, p=0.02) but not %BD (Spearman&#65533;s rho = 0.51, p=0.30). 
 Conclusions: The results suggest that the sheep mandibular model has limited potential for evaluation of implants designed for poor quality bone and for the assessment of implant loading protocols. This thesis does highlight the potential for the use of this model in peri-implantitis studies. The results suggest that morphometric variables determined by HMA and microCT analysis are comparable, however further studies are required to standardize the microCT protocol to reduce metal artifacts and enhance bone-implant contrast.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">osseointegrated dental implants</field><field name="subject">osseointegration</field><field name="subject">titanium</field><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081201.161832</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Osteogenic gene expression by human periodontal ligament cells under cyclic mechanical tension</field><field name="creator">Wescott, David Clark</field><field name="description">Background and objectives: The most widely accepted tooth movement model is defined by the pressure-tension hypothesis. An orthodontic force applied to a tooth generates areas of compression and tension in the periodontal ligament (PDL), which are transmitted to the alveolar bone. Areas of tissue exposed to tensile strain undergo bone deposition, whereas areas of tissue exposed to compressive strain undergo bone resorption. We propose that human PDL cells in monolayer culture exposed to tensile mechanical strain would express multiple genes involved in osteogenesis. 
 Materials and Methods: Human PDL cells were isolated and cultured from premolar teeth that were extracted for orthodontic reasons. These cells were plated on control and experimental Uniflex[TM] plates. Using a Flexercell FX4000 strain unit, PDL cells on experimental plates were exposed to a 12% uni-axial cyclic strain for 6 seconds out of every 90 seconds over a 24 hour period. RNA was extracted from the PDL cells at 6 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours. The differential expression of 78 genes implicated in osteoblast differentiation and bone metabolism was analysed using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) array technology. 
 Results: Of the 78 genes tested, sixteen genes showed statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) changes in expression in response to the mechanical strain regime. Eight genes were up-regulated (ALPL, BMP2, BMP6, COL2A1, ICAM1, PHEX, SOX9, and VEGFA) and eight genes were down-regulated (ANXA5, BMP4, COL11A1, COL3A1, EGF, ITGB1, MSX and SMAD1). 
 Conclusions: This study has demonstrated that cultured human PDL cells express multiple osteogenic genes under tensile strain, which suggests that PDL cells may have a potential role in osseous remodeling during tooth movement.

These lesions have a vast array of clinical and radiographic presentations from which a dentist forms a clinical provisional diagnosis and treats the lesions accordingly. The aim of this study was to determine the range, demographic and clinical features of all histologically diagnosed radiolucent jaw lesions in a New Zealand population over a twenty-year period. Additionally, the provisional diagnosis was compared to the histopathological diagnosis in an effort to gain an insight into the difficulties practitioners face in clinically diagnosing radiolucent jaw lesions. 
 Material and Methods: From the histopathology diagnostic service at the University of Otago School of Dentistry all specimens with a diagnosis of a radiolucent jaw lesion between 1986 and 2006 were retrieved and classified into six diagnostic categories. For each lesion the age, gender, site, clinical presentation, clinicians provisional diagnosis and the final histological diagnosis was gathered and analysed. 
 Results: During the study period 4983 specimens were identified as radiolucent jaw lesions. The diagnostic category with the largest number of specimens was inflammatory lesions (72.8%), followed by developmental odontogenic cysts (21.8%). Malignant tumours accounted for less than 1% of all specimens. Concordance of provisional and histopathological diagnoses ranged from 81.0% for nasopalatine duct cyst to 0% for the majority of intra-osseous malignant tumours. 
 Conclusions: The range and demographic features of radiolucent jaw lesions in this study are comparable to that of other populations with a European majority. No radiolucent jaw lesion can be reliably accurately diagnosed from clinical presentation and radiographic appearance alone.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">jaws</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">tumors</field><field name="subject">radiography</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081202.144835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of solutes, debris and temperature on the shear strength of basal ice in cold-based glaciers</field><field name="creator">Sirota, Paul</field><field name="description">Isotropic ice samples containing measured concentrations of solutes and debris similar to basal material found in several cold-based glaciers in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, were manufactured in a laboratory and tested for peak shear strength at constant strain rates with a direct-shear device. The shear tests show that differences in rheology and shear strength appear to be related to impurity content and concentration. Debris-laden ice becomes more ductile with greater concentrations of solutes, whereas, low solute-concentrations and high debris-concentrations are associated with increases in shear strength and brittle behaviour. Stress exponents from Glen&#65533;s flow law calculated for isotropic solute and debris-laden ice ranged between 4 and 5, leading to the conclusion that higher rates of deformation may be expected in dirty basal ice than predicted for glacial ice models that use stress exponents where, n = 3. Observations of both natural and synthetic samples tested over a range of temperatures between -25&#65533;C and -5&#65533;C showed that natural basal ice samples containing high solute and debris concentrations were highly sensitive to temperature change. These tests showed an approximate 10 % loss in shear strength for every 1&#65533;C increase in temperature between -25&#65533;C and -10&#65533;C. In addition, contrasts in rheology and rates of deformation within basal ice are responsible for the development of debris-laden ice structures in the basal zones of cold-based glaciers that flow over unconsolidated substrates. As layered sedimentary bedding was preserved in frozen blocks within the deforming basal ice of several of these glaciers, the evidence suggests that at some point each glacier has interacted with its bed and entrained portions of the substrate material. Empirical shear strength data and observations of rheological changes attributed to composition together with evidence acquired during fieldwork in Antarctica help to support the argument that cold-based glaciers flowing over unconsolidated sediment are capable of affecting geomorphic change. Hence, isotropic ice models that exclude basal processes may need to be adjusted, especially where small increases in the temperature of the basal zones of cold glaciers may occur. In conclusion, palaeo-climate inferences based purely upon small amounts of geomorphic evidence, which suggest warmer climate conditions, may need to be re-evaluated in order to portray more accurate renditions of formerly glaciated landscapes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ice</field><field name="subject">glaciers</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">Dry Valleys Region</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081204.142406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolvable virtual machines</field><field name="creator">Nowostawski, Mariusz</field><field name="description">The Evolvable Virtual Machine abstract architecture (EVMA) is a computational architecture for dynamic hierarchically organised virtual machines. The concrete EVM instantiation (EVMI) builds on traditional stack-based models of computation and extends them by notions of hierarchy and reflection on the virtual machine level. The EVM Universe is composed of a number of autonomous and asynchronously communicating EVM machines. The main contribution of this work lies in the new model of computation and in the architecture itself: a novel, compact, flexible and expressive representation of distributed concurrent computation. The EVMA provides a way of expressing and modelling auto-catalytic networks composed of a hierarchical hypercycle of autopoietic subsystems characterised by self-adaptable structural tendencies and self-organised criticality. EVMA provides capabilities for: a) self-learning of dynamical patterns through continuous observation of computable environments, b) self-compacting and generalisation of existing program structures, c) emergence of efficient and robust communication code through appropriate machine assembly on both ends of communication channel. EVMA is in one sense a multi-dimensional generalisation of stack machine with the purpose of modelling concurrent asynchronous processing. EVMA approach can be also seen as a meta-evolutionary theory of evolution. The EVMA is designed to model systems that mimic living autonomous and adaptable computational processes. The EVMI prototype has been designed and developed to conduct experimental studies on complex evolving systems. The generality of our approach not only provides the means to experiment with complex hierarchical, computational and evolutionary systems, but it provides a useful model to evaluate, share and discuss the complex hierarchical systems in general. The EVMA provides a novel methodology and language to pursue research, to understand and to talk about evolution of complexity in living systems. In this thesis, we present the simple single-cell EVMI framework, discuss the multi-cell EVM Universe architecture, present experimental results, and propose further extensions, experimental studies, and possible hardware implementations of the EVMI.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">virtual computer systems</field><field name="subject">computer architecture</field><field name="subject">system design</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081204.145510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing teachers&#65533; theory and practice in literacy teaching</field><field name="creator">Thornley, Christina</field><field name="description">In recent years, professional development programmes that have been made available to teachers in New Zealand and other western countries have not often achieved the desired outcomes of improved teacher practice and decision making, or increased student achievement. The professional development research literature implies that the reason for this situation, is the inadequacy of programmes that do not acknowledge the teacher as a learner with individual knowledge, experience and priorities for their learning. As resources and attention continue to be focused on improving curriculum policies and classroom decision making to enhance student literacy achievement and reduce disparities, it is important to continue the search for teacher learning opportunities that achieve the desired goals. 
 While teachers have often been viewed as knowledge recipients, the research literature alerts readers to the dearth of knowledge to inform the decision making in classrooms and in the wider realms of schooling and education. Moreover, teachers have often been positioned simply as the subject of research that once published appears to have little bearing in their work. Developing Teachers&#65533; Theory and Practice in Literacy Teaching is a study of four teachers and a facilitator, who is also the researcher, engaging in four teacher researcher partnership projects. The aim of these projects was to provide the teachers with professional learning opportunities while simultaneously producing knowledge about literacy teaching and learning. 
 This alternative approach to professional development sought to investigate the outcomes of teacher researcher partnership projects, each designed by individual teachers who worked with the facilitator to address their self-identified &#65533;questions about practice&#65533;. The facilitator and the teachers worked together over a fifteen month period during which time they had individual and group meetings to learn about the research process and to design and implement their individual projects. The facilitator as researcher, gathered data from the teachers using qualitative methods and the teachers in turn gathered their own data to inform the progress and outcomes of their projects. 
 While there were a number of factors that contributed to the outcomes of each project, the way in which the facilitator and the teachers conducted their projects and managed the partnership was central to the success of the teacher learning and their ability to produce findings to inform curriculum decision making. The teachers&#65533; and facilitator&#65533;s knowledge of the theory and practice of research, literacy and professional learning were shown to be important. It is argued that in order to produce and disseminate knowledge, a body of prerequisite knowledge that transcended that which would previously be expected of the teachers and of the facilitator, had to be acquired. 
 The study recommends that further attention be given to such partnership projects as a means to increment the knowledge about teaching and learning, at the same time that teachers learn and improve their curriculum decision making. The teacher researcher partnership project approach that was implemented is discussed and analysed and an alternative &#65533;four tier&#65533; approach is advocated as more likely to result in the production and dissemination of information to enhance the curriculum of the classroom.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reading teachers</field><field name="subject">in-service training</field><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">reading (primary)</field><field name="subject">english language</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081205.084524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms by which COMMD1 down-regulates Epithelial Sodium Channel (ENaC) activity</field><field name="creator">Ke, Ying</field><field name="description">The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) made up of &#945;, &#946; and &#947; subunits is located at the apical membrane of polarised epithelia and mediates transport of sodium ions into the cells. Tight control of ENaC function is essential for maintaining sodium homeostasis, blood volume and blood pressure. Controlling the number of active channels present at the cell surface appears to be critically important in regulating ENaC activity. The neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated gene 4 (Nedd4) family of proteins (eg. Nedd4-2) ubiquitinate ENaC and decrease its cell surface expression. The activity of Nedd4-2 is modulated by serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase (SGK), which phosphorylates Nedd4-2 and increases cell surface expression of ENaC. 
 The c&#818;o&#818;pper m&#818;etabolism gene M&#818;URR1 d&#818;omain 1 (COMMD1) protein is a recently identified ENaC binding partner and negative regulator of channel activity. Studies by other groups suggest that COMMD1 is also involved in the processes of intracellular protein trafficking and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. The aims of this study were 1). To characterise the interactions between COMMD1 and ENaC. 2). To identify the mechanism(s) by which COMMD1 down-regulates ENaC activity. 
 Here protein-protein interaction studies were used to show that a recently identified conserved C-terminal domain (the COMM domain) in COMMD1 is essential for its binding to ENaC. The binding site for COMMD1 in &#946;ENaC was found to be located in its N-terminal domain. COMMD1 was shown to down-regulate ENaC by increasing ubiquitin modification of ENaC and by decreasing the cell surface population. COMMD1 was found to interact with SGK and formed a complex with SGK and Nedd4-2. Ussing chamber studies of Na&#8314; transport showed that COMMD1 attenuated the stimulation of ENaC by SGK and abolished insulin-stimulated ENaC current in epithelial cells. Conversely, knock-down of COMMD1 increased ENaC current in mammalian epithelial cells. These data suggest that COMMD1 plays a role in regulating ENaC activity in epithelial cells and its effect is likely mediated via SGK. 
 In addition COMMD1 was found to bind to the adaptor protein subunit [mu]2. Mutations in COMMD1 that disrupt its interaction with [mu]2 impair its ability to decrease cell surface expression of ENaC in Cos-7 cells, therefore COMMD1 may also have a role in the endocytosis of ENaC by linking cell surface ENaC to the clathrin-dependent endocytosis machinery. 
 In summary, this study investigated the interactions between COMMD1 and ENaC and identified that the SGK/Nedd4-2 pathway is involved in the COMMD1-mediated ubiquitination and down-regulation of ENaC activity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sodium in the body</field><field name="subject">copper in the body</field><field name="subject">epithelium</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="subject">sodium channels</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081205.161914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epiphyseal plate repair using fat interposition to reverse physeal deformity : an experimental study</field><field name="creator">Foster, Bruce Kristian.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 169-197.

This research explores the contribution of synaesthesia to fashion design in an effort to highlight the positive aesthetic and intellectual impact of this integration. Such research advances my creative practice. The method of realising garments which address synaesthetic principles is an extension of personal interest in synaesthesia, driven from both an experiential perspective and a desire to gain a greater understanding into theories in relation to challenging the senses in a contemporary fashion world. If fashion includes novelty as a crucial and desirable aspect, and can be defined as an ever evolving and self rejuvenating art form, then the energy and frivolity of these components in association with multiple sensory stimuli and response will expose the consequence of the study through design-work. Recognition of the importance of sensory cross-overs in fashion design will reveal the quintessence of how humans position themselves and respond to a specific environment. If realisation of the senses is with regard to surroundings, and fashion becomes the surrounding which elicits multiple involuntary responses from stimuli, a conscious recognition has begun. Traditional theories on the organisation of sense modalities speculate that humans perceive their world with five senses, the most dominant generally being sight. The combined effect of these senses creates the environment in which we inhabit. The visual and tactile senses have long been the focus of the fashion product but, of all the senses, touch is most key to our species (Ackerman, 1990). Sound, taste and smell have been under-recognised as providers of ceaseless information about our environment. The investigation into the notion that fashion and other sensory systems are not separate entities assists with establishing the links between sensory integration and fashion design. The emergence of the synaesthetic paradigm has highlighted a unity between the senses rather than the traditional hierarchy of favouring the visual. The research on synaesthesia relative to fashion design occupies a parallel position to neurological theory and allows synaesthetic investigation to be a pivotal determining factor towards my outcome. I have engaged in critical self-reflection of my design process and production as a means of elucidating stimuli associated with multi-sensory perception.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fashion</field><field name="subject">synaesthesia</field><field name="subject">senses and sensation</field><field name="subject">perception</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/721</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Successful social skills : designing a way of learning non-verbal communication skills : a thesis submitted for the degree of Master of Design, Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Blair, Tracey</field><field name="description">This research identifies, and respond to, the particular challenges of teaching social skills to children with autistic characteristics, specifically in this case Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome (AS).

Colonial representations of otherness have left Chinese longing to be recognised as established settlers. Fresh interpretations are much needed to align myth with the longstanding realities of settlement. The absence of a recognisable Chinatown in New Zealand has meant that many of the Chinese customs inherited from the first settlers are observed in private within the family home. This condition coupled with emerging research and exposure on the topic offers a chance to define Chinese spaces and author Chinese stories from within a local community. This research project interrogates the transformation of Cantonese settlers into Chinese New Zealanders through illustration design. By claiming the book as a space, unsung moments of settlement are made visible to challenge stereotypes and forge a new space for Chinese New Zealand stories. The process of collage is used to illustrate the complexities of constructing identity. Home Made is an alternative cultural history told through visual metaphor. Gold was responsible for first transforming the sojourner into the settler, the bowl is used to mediate tradition between home and enterprise in settlement, while the lantern illuminates and celebrates local Chinese spaces. Brought out from home kitchens and backrooms of family businesses, these artefacts represent a longstanding Chinese presence. Home Made activates these metaphors to structure an argument for the longevity and contemporary significance of Chinese settlement in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese New Zealanders</field><field name="subject">immigration</field><field name="subject">settlement</field><field name="subject">cultural history</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The economics of petroleum exploration and development in China</field><field name="creator">Hou, Wanwan, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The international oil and gas industry views China as a key country in its search for petroleum exploration and development investment opportunities. China offers a range of opportunities ?? from mature, producing areas to frontier exploration areas. When Oil and gas companies make investment decisions to explore for and develop petroleum resources in a particular country, they need to examine many aspects of that country. The decision to invest focuses on assessments of the likely economic rewards and the risks involved. In this thesis, I attempt to provide a detailed assessment of various factors affecting the economics of petroleum exploration and development in China from an oil and gas investors?? point of view. The thesis is aimed at assisting international oil and gas companies to make investment decisions and assisting their understanding of the petroleum prospects in China.  Based on detailed economic modelling, the thesis aims to demonstrate the profitability of exploration and development of a range of hypothetical but representative oil and gas prospects and discoveries in different areas in onshore and offshore China. The thesis also reviews the key fiscal terms in China and shows the economic impact of individual components of Chinese fiscal terms on field developments in China. The thesis quantifies and analyses the impact of Chinese fiscal terms by measuring the Government Take for a range of hypothetical oil field developments. It includes an analysis of the flexibility of the Chinese fiscal terms by quantifying the effect of Government Take on marginal field developments. In addition, the thesis intends to assess the competitiveness of Chinese fiscal regime in terms of its severity and flexibility as compared to other fiscal regimes in the Asia Pacific Region.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="subject">Petroleum</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The life history of a gizzard shad, the bony bream, Nematalosa erebi (Gunther) (Dorosomatinae, Teleosti) in the lower River Murray, South Australia</field><field name="creator">Puckridge, James Terence.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: p.

Methods: A randomised controlled mixed methods trial was conducted with residents of an aged care facility between May and August 2007. Qualitative data was examined for related themes which enhanced the quantitative analysis. There were 41 participants (age range: 74-93 years) all with a medical diagnosis of dementia. Informed consent and ethical approval was obtained. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Choir Therapy, Reminiscence Therapy or Control Group. The study was single blind as the researcher conducted the sessions with research assistants. Fifteen sessions of choir and reminiscence therapies were conducted twice weekly. Symptoms of depression were measured before and after the treatments using the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia. The Mini Mental State Examination was used to gauge the levels of cognitive functioning at baseline. Participants&#8217; responses to the therapy sessions were concurrently collected and analysed for related themes as qualitative data. Results: Average depression scores declined significantly for all groups over time. When the choir group was compared with the control group over time, there was a significant difference (p= 0.027), indicating that the choir group was more effective in reducing depression over time. The reminiscence group scores were also compared with the control group scores over time, revealing a reduction in depression which was less significant than the choir group scores (p = 0.111). Themes from the qualitative data showed improvements in the following areas: safety and security needs; increased communication and social interaction; increased positive moods; increased motivation; and, expanded attention spans. Conclusion: All three groups showed decreased depression with the greatest fall in the choir group. This indicated that choir when compared to reminiscence has higher efficacy in mitigating symptoms of depression in people with dementia. Both therapies were shown to be effective and safe.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">depression, mental</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">dementia</field><field name="subject">patients</field><field name="subject">care</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">music therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/35810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactions between plasticised PVC films and citrus juice components</field><field name="creator">Fayoux, Ste&#769;phane C.</field><field name="description">The study presented here consists in an original piece of work to better understand complex food packaging interactions. The majority of investigations on food polymer interactions related to orange juice and this provided a good base to our study (Literature reviews: cf. Chapters 1a and b). Additionally a rather remarkable finding in 1994 was that limonin, a trace bitter material found in some varieties of orange juice was rapidly absorbed by highly plasticised polyvinyl chloride (PVC plastisol) (Chapter 2). Several commercial absorbants are available for debittering, relying on limonin absorption on the large surface area of the highly porous absorbant pellets. However, the absorptive properties of the smooth plastisols apparently relied on a different mechanism. Limonin is a very large (470.5 g/mol) compound, but some preliminary experiments with another much smaller orange juice constituent d-  of absorbates in plastisols, methods used earlier (Moisan 1980, Holland and Santangelo 1988) to measure solubilities and diffusion constants in packaging films could be advantageously used to survey these properties in a wide range of materials, including model compounds of various types, and a number of compounds which may be found in citrus juices (Chapters 3, 4 and 5). Experimentally, the method found most suitable was to use a &#8216;test film&#8217; of pure plastisol which was wrapped tightly on both sides by a similar &#8216;supply film&#8217; blended with 1 Molar test material (also called &#8216;absorbate&#8217;), setting up a concentration gradient. The inner test film was removed at regular intervals (minutes to hours) to measure (mainly by weighing) the uptake of the test reagent with time. Rather unexpectedly, it was found in a number of cases that the test film lost weight, either from the beginning, or after a period of time. Three main types of behaviour were identified: Type A lost weight from the beginning and over a long period of time, Type B gained weight initially and then lost weight, and Type C gained weight until a steady state was reached. Often the maximum, or near maximum, mass increase occurred within around 100 minutes, indicating a very rapid, liquid-like diffusion mechanism, in harmony with the rapid uptake of d-limonene and limonin. The major parameters of interest with these compounds are their diffusion rates and their solubilities, and in the presence of aqueous media (orange juice and other foodstuffs) the partition coefficient between the plastisol and water, which is related to the hydrophobicity function LogP for the compound. The major complicating factor in these measurements is the observation that the plasticiser materials themselves also migrate, in the reverse direction, because of the lower effective concentration in the supply film. This effect tends to be small, but is one explanation for the mass loss observed above, and cannot be ignored over the long term, nor in its practical applications to contamination in foods. There are many possible applications for the techniques described above. The removal or addition of compounds in food packaging itself is one. Upgrading foods, such as orange juice, commercially, is another. In many cases &#8216;scalping&#8217; off-flavours or other minor components takes place exclusively through solid or liquid contact with the packaging. The removal from the headspace measured by the current gas permeation methods is irrelevant for the vast numbers of involatile, but easily diffusable compounds. For such compounds these novel applications are simple and rapid, require little specialised equipment, and fill a niche in the armoury of food and packaging chemists.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">orange juice</field><field name="subject">packaging</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">polyvinyl chloride</field><field name="subject">bitterness (taste)</field><field name="subject">limonin</field><field name="subject">debittering</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/35863</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Will the show go on? : a marketing concept analysis of the management effectiveness of agricultural show societies in Australia</field><field name="creator">Meyer, Paula</field><field name="description">Agricultural shows are community-based festivals that represent a majority of festivals staged in rural destinations within Australia. Recent anecdotal evidence indicates their survival is being threatened. Declines in the overall number of shows and visitor attendance have been widely reported, yet an analysis of the reason for these declines has not been investigated. Agricultural shows are managed by volunteers within not-for-profit show societies who are finding it difficult to survive in an increasingly competitive and challenging external environment. Little is understood about these show societies, their volunteer managers and the management effectiveness. This study has addressed these gaps by investigating show society management effectiveness by means of a marketing concept paradigm. A case study method employing qualitative in-depth interviews with key show society members and other stakeholders was conducted on one agricultural show. Findings reveal that this show society is managed by volunteers whose primary involvement motivation is based upon self-interest in one or more components of the show. The majority of these individuals do not have management skills and expertise required to manage a festival and whilst it is important to note their volunteering contribution, it is this lack of skills and knowledge that has prevented a systematic approach to management. There is no attempt at consumer research, strategic planning, organisational planning or volunteer recruitment. The show programs do not change to reflect the current needs of the community, rather what is affordable, who can organise it and what has always been done. As a result, the case study show society is not employing a marketing concept orientation but a product concept orientation. This study concludes that without this focus, the show society will be ill equipped to meet changing customer demands and stay abreast of competitors. To assist agricultural shows to manage future challenges and adopt a marketing concept, a theoretical model has been proposed that incorporates existing frameworks and this study&#8217;s findings.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Royal Easter Show (Sydney, N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">agricultural exhibitions</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/35888</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development and Testing of an Instrument for Measuring Awareness of Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors Reduction in a Hong Kong Chinese Population</field><field name="creator">Chan, Choi Wan</field><field name="description">Coronary heart disease (CHD) claims millions of lives every year worldwide. In the developed countries, a clear connection has been documented between a decline in CHD mortality and modifiable risk factor reductions. While raising awareness of CHD risk factors reduction is imperative, no valid instrument backed by robust psychometric data is available to measure people&#8216;s awareness in this regard. In addition, especially among the Chinese population, despite many studies already conducted concerning awareness of CHD-related issues, inconsistency in how people define and measure this concept remains. This study aimed to develop a valid instrument that measures Hong Kong Chinese people&#8216;s awareness of CHD risk factors reduction. The study involved two phases. Phase I involved qualitative data collection through 18 focus group interviews (n=100). Participants in this phase included members from three groups: (1) the low risk general public, (2) people having multiple CHD risk factors either with or without CHD, and (3) people who have been diagnosed of myocardial infarction. The objective of this phase was to identify key elements and to clarify the concept inherent in awareness, from which served as a basis to generate items to form the awareness instrument. Upon completion of this phase, three main categories were generated including: CHD knowledge, perceptions of CHD, and risk control efficacy. Under these main categories, twelve subcategories emerged. Under the category of CHD knowledge, the subcategories were: pathological causes of CHD, external forces in causing CHD, modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, CHD trends, symptoms of CHD, and knowledge of CHD prevention. Under the category of perceptions of CHD, the subcategories were: perceived seriousness of CHD and perceived risk. Under the category of risk control efficacy, the subcategories were: planning of health actions, control over risk reducing behaviour, perceived opportunities to understand CHD, and chest pain appraisal/perceptions. A total of 70 items were generated to form the Awareness of Coronary heart disease Risk Factors Reduction (ACRFR) scale. The second phase of this study focused on the evaluation of the psychometric properties of ACRFR scale. The objective of this phase was to establish the validity and reliability of the instrument. It commenced with determining the content validity by expert review, followed by identifying the factor structure, construct validity and reliability. A good content validity index (CVI) of 0.84 was achieved. The factor structure of ACRFR was identified through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) data collected from a sample (n=232) of the three groups as described in phase one. The final results revealed a seven-factor model with 43 items accounting 49.5% of the total explained variance. The seven factors were: (1) CHD knowledge, (2) planning of health actions, (3) perceived ability to monitor health-related behaviour, (4) perception of risk, (5) perceived opportunities to understand CHD, (6) perceived seriousness of CHD, and (7) chest pain appraisal/perceptions. The factor structure of ACRFR was further cross-validated by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in another independent sample (n=225) of the three groups. Goodness of fit statistics fell within acceptable ranges: 2 / d = 1.6, RMSEA = 0.053, NNFI = 0.92, IFI = 0.93, CFI = 0.93. The factor model was further supported by hypothesis testing and known-groups comparisons. The results of hypothesis testing demonstrated significant correlations between ACRFR and other measures. Known-groups comparisons among subjects with MI, those with CHD and without CHD provided satisfactory evidence for construct validity. Reliability of this developed instrument, as estimated by the internal consistency Cronbach&#8216;s alphas, ranged from 0.60 to 0.90 for each sub-scale and for the total scale was 0.82, and the test-retest reliability was 0.89, suggesting good instrument reliability. While current literature reveals no objectively devised conceptual definition of ACRFR and that no published instrument was made available for healthcare professions to enhance people&#8216;s awareness of reducing CHD, this study fills these gaps. It is envisaged that this developed instrument could assist healthcare professional in accurately estimating people&#8216;s awareness of risk factors reduction that could provide valid and reliable data that could inform future directions in CHD prevention and cardiac health promotion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coronary heart disease</field><field name="subject">Hong Kong Chinese</field><field name="subject">Coronary heart disease risk factors</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp191.26022009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Activation of Gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons by Kisspeptin in the mouse</field><field name="creator">Clarkson, Jenny</field><field name="description">The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are the final output neurons of a complex neuronal network that controls fertility in all mammals. The GnRH neurons reside in a scattered continuum throughout the anterior hypothalamus. The majority of GnRH neurons project an axon to the median eminence where GnRH is secreted into the hypophyseal-pituitary portal vessels from whence it travels to the anterior pituitary gland. GnRH acts on the gonadotrophs of the anterior pituitary gland to cause the secretion of luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) into the peripheral circulation. LH and FSH act on the gonads to control gametogenesis and steroidogenesis. This thesis focuses on two unanswered questions in reproductive neurobiology that are fundamental to fertility 1) how the GnRH neurons become activated at puberty to produce patterned GnRH secretion and 2) the nature of the positive feedback mechanism that drives the preovulatory GnRH and LH surges. 
 Recently, a novel neuropeptide called kisspeptin and its G-protein coupled receptor GPR-54 were found to be essential for pubertal activation of GnRH neurons, with GPR-54 mutation or deletion resulting in failed puberty and infertility in humans and mice. In addition, kisspeptin administration potently stimulates GnRH neuron-mediated gonadotropin secretion and advances the onset of pubertal maturation suggesting an important role for kisspeptin in the activation and perhaps post-pubertal modulation of GnRH neurons. 
 In this thesis I have used immunocytochemical, whole animal manipulations and knockout mouse approaches to investigate the role of kisspeptin in both the activation of GnRH neurons at puberty and in the estrogen positive feedback mechanism in the mouse. 
 I have demonstrated that kisspeptin neurons are located principally in the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) and the arcuate nucleus (ARN), which are both known to be important areas for the modulation of GnRH neuronal activity. Kisspeptin fibres are found in abundance throughout the hypothalamus, but of particular interest are the kisspeptin fibres found in close apposition with a subset of GnRH neurons in the rostral preoptic area (rPOA). 
 The kisspeptin neurons in the RP3V are sexually dimorphic with up to ten times more neurons in the female than the male. The number of kisspeptin neurons in the RP3V increases throughout pubertal development reaching adult levels at the time of puberty in both males and females. In concert with the increase in the number of kisspeptin neurons in the RP3V there is an increase in the percentage of GnRH neurons in the rPOA which exhibited a close apposition with a kisspeptin fibre indicating that kisspeptin neurons may target GnRH neurons to activate them at puberty. Additionally, I demonstrate that the increase in the number of neurons in the RP3V of the female mouse approaching puberty is driven by estrogen secreted from the ovary. 
 A significant number of kisspeptin neurons in the RP3V were shown to express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The number and percentage of kisspeptin cells colocalised with TH cells in the RP3V did not change throughout the estrous cycle. Some colocalisation of kisspeptin and TH was observed at terminal appositions with GnRH neurons in the rPOA, though the magnitude of colocalisation also did not change throughout the estrous cycle. 
 I demonstrate that RP3V kisspeptin neurons are a critical part of the estrogen positive feedback mechanism which drives the preovulatory GnRH and LH surges. Kisspeptin neurons in the RP3V express steroid receptors and are activated by estrogen positive feedback. Loss of kisspeptin-GPR-54 signalling prevents the GnRH neurons from being activated by estrogen positive feedback indicating that the RP3V kisspeptin neurons not only contribute to the estrogen positive feedback mechanism, but are a critical component of the mechanism. 
 The results of these studies demonstrate that kisspeptin is an integral component in both the activation of GnRH neurons at puberty and in the estrogen positive feedback mechanism which drives the preovulatory GnRH and LH surges. Therefore, kisspeptin plays an important role in the neuroendocrine control of reproduction in the mouse.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">luteinizing hormone releasing hormone</field><field name="subject">neuropeptides</field><field name="subject">neuroendocrinology</field><field name="subject">animal models</field><field name="subject">mice</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081208.114143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Osmotic and desiccation stress-tolerance of Serratia entomophila</field><field name="creator">Sheen, Tamsin</field><field name="description">Serratia entomophila, the causative agent of amber disease, is an endemic bacterium used for the biocontrol of New Zealand grass grub larvae. Although the available biopesticide is effective, its use is limited to areas where sub-surface application is feasible, and is also impacted by soil conditions such as moisture levels and osmolarity. The aim of this study was to elucidate the responses of S. entomophila to osmotic and desiccation stresses in relation to challenges encountered during production, storage and soil application, with the goal of developing a more robust and versatile biocontrol agent. 
 RpoS is a key factor in the stress response of many enteric bacteria. In order to dissociate the effect of RpoS from subsequent cellular stress studies, an rpoS mutant was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. Assessment of the rpoS mutant showed that RpoS was not implicated in NaC1 or desiccation tolerance of S. entomophila. The rpoS mutant was instead found to have enhanced salt tolerance and could be distinguished from the wild-type by the ability to ferment arabinose, a phenotype that was confirmed through complementation. Complete abolition of the amber disease process was observed using an rpoS strain also missing the Sep virulence genes, suggesting that RpoS is a regulator of the S. entomophila anti-feeding prophage (Afp). These findings indicate a subtle interplay between NaC1 tolerance, virulence and RpoS-mediated regulation of amber disease in S. entomophila. 
 A transposon mutagenesis screen was carried out to identify genes associated with NaC1 tolerance in S. entomophila. Fourteen mutants displaying NaC1 sensitivity were identified, two of which had mutations in genes with potential implications for the formulation of the bacterium as a biocontrol agent. The gene leuO that encodes a LysR-family transcriptional regulator was found to be essential for S. entomophila NaC1 tolerance. The toxicity of increased cellular LeuO from an over-expression vector led to the investigation of the effects of leuO mutation on the proteome. Multiple protein changes observed by two-dimensional gel analysis suggested that LeuO may be a global regulator in S. entomophila, as has been hypothesised for Salmonella species. A second NaC1-sensitive mutant contained an insertion in afp15, the product of which is thought to be involved in assembly of the Afp. As well as being sensitive to NaC1, the afp15 mutant was unable to induce the anti-feeding component of amber disease, again highlighting the link between stress tolerance and virulence in S. entomophila. 
 This study also determined that pre-exposure to NaC1 in conjunction with the provision of exogenous glycine betaine significantly enhanced the survival of S. entomophila either in a desiccated state or after application to soil, regardless of the soil moisture content. The implication of this finding on the future formulation of S. entomophila led to investigation of the underlying genetic mechanisms involved in glycine betaine synthesis and NaC1 tolerance. The genes involved in glycine betaine biosynthesis from choline were identified through genomic comparison, degenerate PCR and primer walking. A 6.5 kb region was sequenced and found to contain four genes with homology and similar chromosomal arrangement to the E. coli bet genes (betTIBA). The S. entomophila betIBA genes comprised an operon, flanked by the divergently-transcribed betT gene whose product is responsible for choline transport. To ascertain the relative transcription levels of components of the bet operon, quantitative RT-PCR was performed. Results of qRT-PCR showed that choline in conjunction with NaC1 induced the greatest levels of bet gene transcription, and that levels of the betA transcript were significantly lower than those of the other bet genes. Examination of the betA 5&#65533; non-coding region identified a previously undetected hairpin region, possibly accounting for the observed decrease in betA transcript levels. 
 The findings of this study have significantly advanced our understanding of how S. entomophiia responds to stress, and will contribute to the development of formulation strategies for the production of a robust product capable of application to pasture by a range of teclmiques. In addition, there is significant potential to utilise these findings in the development of other bacterial inocula for a range of biotechnological applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Serratia entomophila</field><field name="subject">grass grub</field><field name="subject">biological control</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081208.114925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis towards a carbon labelled Anthocyanin</field><field name="creator">Compton, Benjamin Jason</field><field name="description">The total synthesis of cyanindin-3-glucoside (C3G) appropriate for &#65533;&#65533;C enrichment at C-1` and C-6` has been achieved for metabolic studies.

The pineal gland hormone melatonin is known for its anti-oncotic, anti- inflammatory and immuno-modulatory effects. However, its role in wound healing has not been established. 
 Since melatonin is synthesised endogenously, we primarily sought to investigate whether the melatonin receptors played a role in the wound healing process. Using immunohistochemical methods and Western blot analysis we observed that MT&#8321; was normally absent in the rat skin but was strongly expressed on day 1 to day 3 post wounding in the epidermis adjacent to the wound edge. MT&#8321; expression was restricted to the stratum granulosum and stratum spinosum layers of the epidermis in the rat wounds. MT&#8321; expression declined thereafter and became nonexistent by day 21 when the wound had completely healed. In contrast, MT&#8322; was constitutively expressed in all the layers of the normal rat epidermis. MT&#8322; expression gradually decreased at the injury site following wounding but returned to the normal profile by day 21. Aged rat epidermis showed similar MT&#8321; and MT&#8322; expression as adult rats. The profile of tissue distribution of MT&#8321; and MT&#8322; in the human epidermis was comparable to the rat epidermis. In the CVUs MT&#8321; and MT&#8322; localisation profiles resembled that of a healing wound, akin to a day 1 or day 3 rat dermal wound, during the inflammatory phase. Surprisingly, in contrast to all the tissues investigated, MT&#8321; was also localised in the stratum basale layer of the keloid epidermis. MT&#8322; localisation in the same keloid tissues however resembled normal human skin profiles. 
 Secondly, we determined the effects of exogenously administered melatonin, on scarring and wound healing, using a full thickness incisional model of wound healing in rats. Melatonin treatment significantly improved the quality of scarring by day 21. However, our findings would have been strengthened by a more explicit wound closure analysis, measurement of granulation tissue weight, tensile strength, hydroxyl proline content and immunohistochemical assessments of neutrophil infiltration, macrophages, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and reepithelialization. The treatment also accelerated the angiogenic process and enhanced the VEGF protein profile. Arginase generates proline, the building block for collagen synthesis. Melatonin treatment increased arginase activity and consequently would increase collagen synthesis from day 1. An increase in NOS activity and therefore NO production is known to be detrimental during inflammation. However, various studies have also shown that the NO is essential for granulation tissue formation. Melatonin treatment significantly decreased iNOS activity during the acute inflammatory phase in this study, but significantly increased iNOS activity during the resolving phase. Other markers of inflammatory response and repair were also examined in this study. COX-2 has been shown to play an anti-inflammatory role and melatonin increased COX-2 activity and protein following wounding. SOD (the antioxidant enzyme) activity was also significantly increased during the chronic inflammatory phase on melatonin administration. HO-1 and HO-2 isoforms have also been previously demonstrated to participate in the repair process. Melatonin treatment increased up-regulation of both HO-1 and HO-2 protein expression in the wounded skin. A significant decrease in all the mitochondrial enzyme activities (except complex-II-III), was observed post wounding. Melatonin treatment restored the complex activities to near normal levels. Melatonin also protected mitochondrial membrane integrity and reduced oxidative stress as evidenced by the maintained level of aconitase and citrate synthase activities at near normal levels. 
 In vitro experiments using macrophage and fibroblast cell lines illustrated that melatonin may decrease NOS activity and protein profiles indirectly by stimulating arginase activity and thereby depleting the availability of arginine. 
 This study is the first to fully demonstrate the distribution of melatonin receptors in normal and abnormal wounds. Improvement in the quality of scarring in a rat model of wound healing on melatonin administration is promising but much more quantitative work and preclinical studies are required before melatonin advances into clinical assessment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">melatonin</field><field name="subject">physiological effect</field><field name="subject">wound healing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081208.151313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Amorphous drug preparation using ball milling</field><field name="creator">Chieng Heng Liang, Norman</field><field name="description">Polymorphism and crystallinity are now recognised as important issues in drug development. This is shown by the increased amount of research in this area over recent years. In pharmaceutical development milling is an important unit operation for size reduction to improve powder handling, processing and dissolution rate. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the effect of ball milling (and cryo-milling) on the solid state properties, including amorphous drug formation, of pharmaceutical solids. 
 Milling was carried out using an oscillatory ball mill (Mixer Mill MM301, Retsch GmbH &amp; Co., Germany). In cryo-milling the milling jars were immersed in liquid nitrogen for three min before milling. XRPD was used as the main technique to evaluate the milled samples. Ranitidine hydrochloride (RAN) and indomethacin (INDO) were the model drugs used in this study. 
 It was found that upon milling, RAN form 1 converts to RAN form 2 via an amorphous phase. A faster amorphization rate was observed when the crystalline samples were cryo-milled. Amorphous ranitidine hydrochloride was characterized to have a glass transition (T[g]) range of 13 to 30 &#65533;C and a crystallization exotherm (T[c]) between 30 and 65 &#65533;C. Conversion was found to occur faster when the temperature of the solid powder was greater than the T[c]. Under various storage conditions, similarly, crystallization of the amorphous phase mainly led to RAN form 2. However, some form 1 and amorphous phase was also detected on the XRPD diffractograms. Using partial least squares regression, the amount of solid form components in the ternary RAN mixtures were successfully quantified. RAN form 2 did not convert to form 1 under any milling (including cryo-milling) or storage conditions used in this study. Overall, RAN form 2 was found to be the thermodynamically stable form and the two (RAN) polymorphs are likely to be a monotropic pair. 
 In a co-milling study of INDO and RAN, the two crystalline drugs were successfully converted into a single amorphous phase after 60 min of co-milling in a cold room (4 &#65533;C). The T[g] range (26-44 &#65533;C) was also characterized for these mixtures. DRIFTS spectra of the co-milled amorphous samples indicated an interaction had occurred between the carboxylic acid carbonyl (HO-C=O) and benzonyl amide (NC=O) of the INDO molecule with the aci-nitro (C=NO&#8322;) of RAN. Depending on the ratio of INDO to RAN, in general, the amorphous mixtures were stable at 4 &#65533;C after 30 days of storage. Crystallization was faster when the binary mixtures were stored at higher temperature or contained higher amounts of RAN in the mixture. Although XRPD and DRIFTS suggested an interaction between the two drugs, co-crystal formation was not observed between INDO and RAN. 
 Ball milling can be used to produce amorphous drug. The rate and extent of amorphization is dependent on the milling conditions. A faster rate of amorphization was observed when the crystalline drugs were cryo-milled. Amorphous drug formation can be made either alone or in combination with another crystalline drug. Amorphization could offer a significant improvement on the dissolution profile and the bioavailability of the poorly water soluble drug - indomethacin. Furthermore, ball milling can also be used to produce a homogenous mix between solids. The &#65533;goodmix&#65533; effect can be used for seed-induced crystallization or, when the XRPD or Raman data were combined with partial least squares regression, to create a reliable calibration model for quantitative analysis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drugs design</field><field name="subject">drug development</field><field name="subject">ball mills</field><field name="subject">amorphous substances</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081209.162001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurement of intraoral pressure during normal swallowing</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Daniel Lloyd</field><field name="description">Aim: The aim of this research was to measure functional intraoral pressures using a newly developed method; specifically, three areas were examined. Firstly, this new approach to measurement allowed the equilibrium theory of tooth position to be re-addressed. Secondly, it allowed investigation the patterns of pressure change in the palatal midline during water swallowing. Lastly, this approach allowed a preliminary investigation of the affect of the viscosity of the food ingested on the pressures generated in the mouth. 
 Methods: The participants were 6 healthy volunteers (4 males, 2 females) recruited from the post-graduate students at the University of Otago, School of Dentistry. The age range was 25 to 35 years. All had full permanent dentitions, Angle Class I occlusions (normal) with acceptable overbite and overjet relationship, and none of them had a history of previous orthodontic treatment. For each of the subjects a cast chrome-cobalt baseplate was constructed to house 8 miniature strain gauge pressure transducers (Precision Measurement Co. Michigan). The location of the sensors were standardised as follows: Three sensors were paired on the buccal and lingual surfaces of the central, canine and first molar. Two palatal vault sensors were placed in the midline of the palate, one at level of the distal of the first premolar, and the second slightly anterior to the junction of the hard and soft palate. Simultaneous recordings were taken during a set of tasks including water swallows, saliva swallows and food ingestion. 
 Results: The results showed that swallowing was a highly complex wellcoordinated event, and that each individual had their own unique signature pattern of swallowing, characterised by pressure changes of high frequency, in excess of &#65533;1000 kPa/s. 
 Conclusions: The analysis of the pressure acting on the teeth showed that although the pattern and magnitude of pressure generated varied among the group, the observation of waveforms would suggest a tendency for no inherent balance between the buccal and the palatal pressures on the teeth during swallowing for any of the individuals tested. 
 This investigation of the pressure in the midline revealed an aspect previously not fully explored; these experiments showed that there were large and persistent negative pressures generated during swallowing, that preceded the positive pressures and which appear important in bolus propulsion 
 The patterns of swallowing and the magnitudes of pressure generated, changed with the different consistency of the various substances ingested. There was a general trend for increased pressures during swallowing of substrates that are more viscous; water showed the lowest pressures, followed by saliva and finally jelly.

The three key features of Australian indie music festivals are, firstly, that they are multi-staged ticketed outdoor events, with clearly defined yet temporal boundaries. Secondly, the festivals have a youth-orientated focus yet are open to all ages. Finally, the festivals are primarily dominated by indie-guitar culture and music. My aim is to investigate how these music festivals are able to strike an apparently paradoxical balance between the creation of a temporal community, or network of festivalgoers, and the commodity of the festivals themselves. My research methodology utilises a postmodern approach to ethnography, which has allowed me to investigate the festivalgoers as an &#8216;insider researcher.&#8217; Data was collected through a series of participant observations at Australian indie music festivals which included the use of photographs and field notes. In addition I conducted nineteen semi-structured interviews and two focus groups with festivalgoers and festival organisers. The thesis adopts a post-subcultural approach to investigating the festivalgoers as an ideal type of a neo-tribal grouping. Post-subculture theory deals with the dynamic, heterogeneous and fickle nature of contemporary alliances and individuals&#8217; feelings of group &#8216;in-betweeness&#8217; in late capitalist/ global consumer society. I argue that Maffesoli&#8217;s theory of neo-tribalism can shine new light on the relationships between youth, music and style. Music festivals are anchoring places for neo-tribal groupings like the festivalgoers as well as a commercialised event. An analysis of the festivalgoers&#8217; ritual clothing (t-shirts as commodities), leads to the conclusion that the festivalgoers use t-shirts to engage in a process of identification. T-shirts, I argue, are an example of a linking image which creates both a sense of individualism as well as a connection to a collective identity or sociality. Through a case study of moshing and audience behaviour it is discovered that the festivalgoers develop neo-tribal sociality and identification with each other through their participation in indie music festivals. Although pleasure seems to be the foremost significant dimension of participating in these festivals, the festivalgoers nevertheless appear to have developed an innate sense of togetherness and neo-tribal sociality. The intensity and demanding experience of attending a festival fosters the opportunity for a sense of connectedness and belonging to develop among festivalgoers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rock music festivals</field><field name="subject">music festivals</field><field name="subject">popular music</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">economic aspects</field><field name="subject">subculture</field><field name="subject">group identity</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/35961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Amazing grace : the nature and significance of reported after-death communication experiences</field><field name="creator">Keane, Elizabeth C.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this qualitative study is to describe the nature and significance of the after-death communication experience (ADC). The research asks what is it like to have an experience of communication with a deceased loved one, what is the essential nature of the experience, and what are the effects and meanings of the experience within the lives of the participants? This study explores the lived experiences of eighteen participants, sixteen women and two men, who report a variety of ADCs over the years following their bereavement. The ADCs are explored within the context of the participants&#8217; lives so as to show how these extraordinary experiences can be understood as happening to real people within their own history rather than as isolated events. The first part of the thesis gives biographical descriptions of the participants&#8217; lives following their ADCs.  The second part of the thesis analyses the essential nature and qualities of the ADC experience and gives a robust description of the nature of the phenomenon. Phenomenological analysis of the data occurs in overlapping steps consisting of the individual descriptions, reduction techniques and emergence of seven themes describing the essence of the experiences for these participants. The themes show the experiences are unexpected and startling and intrude into ordinary experience. Familiar characteristics authenticate the presence of the deceased. Information, care, love and ongoing relationship are conveyed. The participants grapple with the experiences over time. They find they are deeply imprinted and powerful, and produce immediate and long-term effects. Heightened awareness that transcends ordinary experience gives the bereaved a &#8216;knowing&#8217; of the ongoing life of their loved one. Expanded consciousness and reflection lead to seeing reality as larger and more complex and includes an unseen world where their loved one is continuing to live in another form. The themes are illustrated using the participants&#8217; descriptions of their ADCs. Last of all a description of the phenomenon is compiled using an intuitive reflective process. Powerful and transforming after-effects demonstrate that the ADCs contribute to managing grief in the major losses of the participants&#8217; lives, to the allaying of fears of death, to belief in an after-life and to belief in the interconnectedness and continuity of relationships across the boundary of death. There are major changes in sense of self, life and living, purpose and meaning, spiritual and religious understanding, and psychic sensitivity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">after-death communication experience</field><field name="subject">death</field><field name="subject">spiritualism</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="subject">apparitions</field><field name="subject">grief</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/36018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Locating interiority: text, image, identity, and the domestic</field><field name="creator">Cunniffe, Paula Marie</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates ideas of interiority and thought in relation to the building of self identity.

Regional government was not new, but the comprehensiveness of reforms established a comprehensive regional layer of government across all of New Zealand and was part of a wider decentralisation of government functions.  The new regional councils were intended to be the primary environmental policy and implementation agencies underpinning the parallel environmental resource management law reforms, promising a new era of regional government.  This thesis examines the public value of this regional government structure two decades later using environmental management as a case study.  Public value was assessed using substantive value, authorising agency and operational feasibility drawing on published data and a survey of perceptions held by environmental resource practitioners and stakeholders.  The results indicate a low level of public value.  Despite some improvements, and some regional variation, overall environmental conditions have deteriorated nationally since 1989.  The councils also show low public support and apparent sector capture and vary in capability to undertake their functions.  While sub-national environmental conditions and problems were identified, they do not match existing regional council jurisdictions, nor match each other.  Most councils share many characteristics, suggesting uniform rather than separate management regimes are appropriate.  Consequently, the efficacy of the regional council-based model for managing the environment is questioned.  The role of the councils is also queried.  Although classified as part of local government, these democratically elected regional councils are really multi-special purpose authorities that parallel a national government decentralised regional administration.  Despite being endowed with a broad mandate to promote their communities&#8217; well-being, most regional councils continue to exercise a narrow set of functions.  These are based on their historical role as environmental management agencies.  This discourages allocative efficiency, limiting their sustainable development capability.  Importantly, the hierarchical policy-making system developed has been compromised by an ongoing lack of national level government policy. Recommendations for alternative environmental management institutional arrangements in New Zealand are made, while more broadly the implications of the research for regional studies identified.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">local government</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">environmental resource management</field><field name="subject">environmental policy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360101 New Zealand government and politics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Climate calculus : does realist theory explain the Howard Government's decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol? : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dempster, Benjamin Paul</field><field name="description">Climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions has the potential to cause widespread damage to the environment. As scientific and political consensus converged on the necessity to take action, a large number of countries negotiated the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1997, with the goal of limiting these emissions. Australia under the Howard Government initially played an important part in these negotiations, but refused to ratify the Protocol. The government cited the lack of binding targets on developing countries and the potential for harm to the Australian economy as the reasons it rejected the agreement. International relations theory studies large-scale political forces and analyses their interplay in the global political system. Realism is a model of international relations that views countries as self-interested, security-driven bodies that exist in a state of international anarchy. This study examines whether realist theory offers a satisfactory explanation for the Howard Government&#8217;s decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. The study focuses on six realist ideas and examines the evidence for each. Based on thematic analysis of textual data taken from official political archives and newspapers from 1998&#8211;2004, it suggests that realist theory does provide an adequate explanation of the Howard Government&#8217;s rejection of the Kyoto Protocol.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">realist theory</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">international relations</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Kyoto Protocol</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370102 Social policy and planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical and Biochemical Factors That Influence the Gelation of Soybean Protein and the Yield of Tofu</field><field name="creator">Blazek, Vladimir</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soybean</field><field name="subject">gelation</field><field name="subject">tofu</field><field name="subject">protein</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4084</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silica Immobilised Metal Ion Activated Molecular Receptors</field><field name="creator">Hodyl, Jozef Andrew Zbigniew</field><field name="description">Immobilisation of functional entities, such as, enzymes, onto solid supports, as a means of facilitating their removal from the surrounding environment and subsequent regeneration has been in practice for many decades. This work focuses on the immobilisation and analysis of three-walled (pendant armed), cyclen based receptor complexes immobilised onto a silica surface for the purpose of sequestering aromatic anions from aqueous solution: Si-GPS-[Cd(Trac)](ClO4)2, Si-GPS-[Cd(DiPTrac)](ClO4)2, and Si-GPS-[Cd(TriPTrac)](ClO4)2 were the immobilised receptors used.
	Initially, synthesis of a three-walled model receptor, [Cd(TracHP12)](ClO4)2, that is not bound to silica yet mimics the properties of the silica anchored receptor complexes with a hydroxypropyl pendant arm was effected. Aromatic anion binding constant measurements were made on the model receptor using 1H NMR monitored titrations in DMSO-d6 which showed that, in comparison to the first generation four-walled receptors, the removal of one of the pendant arms did not affect the binding capability of the receptor's cavity significantly. It was shown that the binding strength correlated well with the pKa of the particular anion with, for example, p-hydroxybenzoate &gt; m-hydroxybenzoate &gt; o-hydroxybenzoate. The precursor to this receptor was then immobilised onto a silica surface and subjected to metal ion uptake studies to gauge its coordination properties with a number of divalent metal(II) ions: Cd(II), Pb(II), Zn(II), Cu(II) and Ca(II). The three Cd(II) coordinated receptor complexes mentioned above were then subjected to inclusion studies with a number of aromatic anions in aqueous conditions whereupon a reversal of the previously mentioned trend, i.e. o-hydroxybenzoate &gt; m-hydroxybenzoate &gt; p-hydroxybenzoate was observed. This indicated that the presence of water in the system changes the hydrogen bonding mode of the host-guest complexes, and was a major discovery arising from this work.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">molecular receptors</field><field name="subject">silica immobilisation</field><field name="subject">aromatic anion inclusion</field><field name="subject">cyclen</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090301.162335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Contemporary Tourism Development on Colonial Built Heritage: Case Study of the Portuguese Legacy in Macau, China</field><field name="creator">Chaplin, Robert Ian Chaplin</field><field name="description">The hypothesis put forward in this thesis is that tourism can be the agent for the sustainable conservation and development of the valuable legacy of colonial built heritage by capitalizing on its tangible and intangible assets.

In the surveyed regions, the warabandi system was performing poorly. In-built rigidity in water allocations was found as main reason behind its poor performance. The results from the farmers?? surveys also revealed that the objective of increasing irrigation water productivity would never be attained under the warabandi arrangements. Hence, a completely new concept that could replace the warabandi system and improve the productivity of limited irrigation water should be introduced. My aim was to find a better way to allocate the scarce water resource between farmers. In this study, I have introduced a new concept for determining water allocations among the farmers, which is based on a multicriterion decision making (MCDM) approach. The consideration of multiple criteria in irrigation water allocations would improve irrigation water productivity. Upon an extensive survey of well-known MCDM methods, I concluded that all previously existing MCDM methods were using subjective inputs, usually from a single modeller, to establish priorities of alternatives and therefore, a predetermined solution could easily be obtained. I have developed an approach based on conjoint analysis which removes that subjectivity from the chosen MCDM method (i.e. ELECTRE). Interval scales and relative importance criteria weights, two usually subjective inputs in ELECTRE, are objectively estimated from the conjoint analysis study. For that purpose, the author designed a conjoint questionnaire and administered it to 62 farmer respondents in face-to-face interviews. Conjoint analysis, which does not appear to have been previously used in water resources or allocation studies, is a method for creating the interval scales and the relative criteria weights objectively from the respondents?? judgements on the importance of conjoint objects. The objective estimation of these two important factors is a completely new development which can assist in the unbiased determination of the best division or allocation of scarce water resources between farmers. The approach is applied, as a demonstration, to a region with nine distributary watercourses to determine which of the distributaries should have the highest priority for allocation of the regional water.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multicriterion Decision Making</field><field name="subject">Rotational Irrigation Delivery System</field><field name="subject">The warabandi</field><field name="subject">ELECTRE</field><field name="subject">Subjectivity</field><field name="subject">Pakistan</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The new scientific eyewitness: The role of DNA profiling in shaping criminal justice</field><field name="creator">Wise, Jenny Alice, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since its first use in criminal investigations in 1987, DNA profiling has become the new gold standard for investigations and prosecutions. Academics, politicians and law enforcement officials have presented DNA evidence as a ??scientific hero?? that is capable of solving crimes and preventing miscarriages of justice. However, in spite of this reputation, few studies have explored the impact of this technology on criminal justice practitioners, or on the process of investigating and processing criminal offences. This dissertation provides a comparative study of the use of DNA profiling in two jurisdictions: New South Wales (NSW) in Australia and the Thames Valley in the United Kingdom (UK). Interviews canvassed the perspectives and experiences of police officers, scene of crime officers (SOCOs), forensic scientists, criminal lawyers, and judicial officers from these areas. These interviews were analysed in conjunction with appeal judgments and police statistics to reveal how DNA evidence has been used in the NSW and Thames Valley. The research presented in this dissertation indicates that DNA profiling is having a number of far-reaching effects on both criminal justice systems and is seen as a reliable forensic tool by criminal justice practitioners. Practitioners routinely use DNA evidence throughout the various stages of the criminal justice process and are actively changing their practices to utilise the technology more effectively. One of the main impacts of the introduction of DNA evidence into criminal investigations has been the need to provide substantial resources and infrastructure for the collection, analysis, and storage of samples. Both jurisdictions encountered a number of problems because they provided insufficient resources to effectively use DNA profiling. This study also offers insight into how criminal justice practitioners perceive the dangers of using DNA evidence and how miscarriages of justice can occur. Finally, through an analysis of the combined experiences of criminal justice practitioners, this dissertation challenges the widespread acceptance and routine use of forensic DNA profiling. It further suggests that it is now time to re-consider current practices in relation to how resources are devoted to the technology, and how criminal justice practitioners are using the technology.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA evidence</field><field name="subject">criminal justice</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bodhasara by Narahari: An Eighteenth Century Sanskrit Treasure</field><field name="creator">Cover, Jennifer Joy</field><field name="description">PhD</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bodhasara</field><field name="subject">Sanskrit</field><field name="subject">Eighteenth century India</field><field name="subject">Advaita vedanta</field><field name="subject">Yoga</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4085</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic Solvency Testing in Life Insurance</field><field name="creator">Hayes, Genevieve Katherine</field><field name="description">Stochastic solvency testing methods have existed for more than 20 years, yet there has been little research conducted in this area, particularly in Australia. This is for a number of reasons, the most pertinent of which being the lack of computing capabilities available in the past to implement more sophisticated techniques. However, recent advances in computing have made stochastic solvency testing possible in practice and have resulted in a trend towards this being done in advanced studies.
&#182;	
The purpose of this thesis is to develop a realistic solvency testing model in a form that can be implemented by Australian Life Insurers, in anticipation that the Australian insurance regulator, APRA, will ultimately follow the world trend and require stochastic solvency testing to be carried out in Australia. The model is constructed from three interconnected stochastic sub-models used to describe the economic environment and the mortality and lapsation experience of the portfolio of policies under consideration. Australian economic and Life Insurance data is used to fit a number of possible sub-models, such as generalised linear models, over-dispersion models and asset models, and the ``best'' model is selected in each case. The selected models are a modified CAS/SOA economic sub-model; either a Poisson or negative binomial (NB1) distribution (depending on the policy type considered) as the mortality sub-model; and a normal-Poisson lapsation sub-model.
&#182;	
Based on tests carried out using this model, it is demonstrated that, for portfolios of level and yearly-renewable term insurance business, the current deterministic solvency capital requirements provide little protection against insolvency. In fact, for the test portfolios of term insurance policies considered, the deterministic capital requirements have levels of sufficiency of less than 2% (on a Value at Risk basis) when compared to the change in capital distribution over a three year time horizon. This is of concern, as yearly-renewable term insurance comprises a significant volume of Life Insurance business in Australia, with there being over 426,000 yearly-renewable term insurance policies on the books of Australian Life Insurers in 1999 and more business expected since then.  
&#182;	
A sensitivity analysis shows that the results of the stochastic asset requirement calculations are sensitive to the choice of sub-model used to forecast economic variables and to the choice of formulae used to describe the mean mortality and lapsation rates. The implication of this is that, if APRA were to require Life Insurers to calculate their solvency capital requirements on a stochastic basis, some guidance would need to be provided regarding the components of the solvency testing model used. The model is not, however, sensitive to whether an allowance is made for mortality or lapsation rate over-dispersion, nor to whether dependency relationships between mortality rates, lapsation rates and the economy are allowed for. Thus, over-dispersion and dependency relationships between the sub-models can be ignored in a stochastic solvency testing model without significantly impacting the calculated solvency requirements.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stochastic</field><field name="subject">solvency testing</field><field name="subject">life insurance</field><field name="subject">mortality</field><field name="subject">lapsation</field><field name="subject">asset models</field><field name="subject">capital</field><field name="subject">value at risk</field><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090226.084732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Network journalism : journalistic practice in interactive spheres</field><field name="creator">Heinrich, Ansgard</field><field name="description">Today&#65533;s globalized network communication initiates new interactive formats, transforming not only the dissemination, but - increasingly - the production of news. The &#65533;one-way&#65533; flow of news from a news outlet to the audience has been replaced by a network structure. Following Castells&#65533; concept of the &#65533;network&#65533; (1996) as the central model of information structures, I perpetuate this paradigmatic shift and suggest that networks also transform the professional journalism sphere in many world regions. A revised sphere of journalism is taking shape in which an increasingly global flow of news is evolving and a multiple platform structure of journalism is taking shape in which boundaries between traditional media outlets of print, radio, and television and between national and &#65533;foreign&#65533; journalism are blurring. Furthermore, I argue that a globalized journalistic network sphere is emerging which involves &#65533;traditional&#65533; journalistic outlets and bloggers, media activists, so-called citizen journalists, or user-generated content providers alike. These new journalistic spheres of connectivity establish new (and continuous) links between journalists, their sources as well as their audiences. This fundamental change creates new professional levels of connectivity on one hand and on the other, has severe strategic and organizational implications for the management of print, broadcast and online news outlets. 
 Within this new &#65533;network&#65533; sphere of journalistic practice, the roles of journalistic outlets change. This work suggests a framework that helps to understand journalistic organization today, with innovative work structures based on digital technologies transforming the character and in effect substituting the model of &#65533;top-down&#65533; journalism models by a model that is far more complicated. I argue that within an evolving global news sphere, information flows are multidirectional. Decentralization and non-linearity become the key parameters defining news flows at the beginning of the twenty-first century. The character of this network in the journalism sphere is transnational, crossmedia, and cross professions. Based on results of thirteen qualitative interviews with media practitioners in Germany, the US and the UK, I argue that a new geography of journalism is taking shape in which journalistic outlets are being transformed into nodes. 
 These nodes are arranged in a dense net of information gathers, producers and disseminators and the interactive connections among them constitute what I want to call network journalism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">digital communications</field><field name="subject">mass media</field><field name="subject">blogs</field><field name="subject">news agencies</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081211.162922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who cares? : the role of attachment assessments in decision-making for children in care</field><field name="creator">Atwool, Nicola</field><field name="description">In this practice-based research the use of attachment assessments to assist with decision-making about the placement of children in State care is explored. In Aotearoa New Zealand care and protection legislation emphasises the importance of working with families. The central decision-making forum is the Family Group Conference where families, their support people and statutory social workers come together to work out a plan for children considered to be in need of care and protection. This research focused on conflicted situations where agreement could not be reached about where children should live. 
 The research was structured around one over-arching objective: the examination of a specific aspect of practice, namely the use of attachment assessments in decision-making, with a view to identifying elements of best practice. Within this were three other objectives: an exploration of the impact of attachment assessments on decision-making processes; an exploration of the experience of participants in this process; and an examination of perceived outcomes for children who have an assessment completed. In order to achieve these objectives the historical and cultural context influencing these decision-making processes was explored; the theoretical framework underpinning the use of attachment assessments was critically examined; recent literature on children&#65533;s experience in foster care was reviewed; the role of assessment in decision-making was explored; and the use of attachment assessments was evaluated from the perspective of social work practitioners. 
 The outcomes of this research indicate that attachment assessments are theoretically sound processes, which provide relevant information that facilitates decision-making in conflicted situations and the achievement of positive outcomes for children. It was, however, found that attachment assessments have an indirect influence by providing a pivotal point in the decision-making process rather than a direct impact. A number of variables influencing outcomes for children were identified and explored: availability of suitable placements; management of contact with birth family; provision of support networks including attention to ongoing cultural connectedness; and support through adolescence. Children&#65533;s absence from participation in decision-making was highlighted. I conclude with an outline of guidelines for best practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child welfare</field><field name="subject">children's rights</field><field name="subject">foster home care</field><field name="subject">kinship care</field><field name="subject">social work with children</field><field name="subject">child psychology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081212.143625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Smith and society in Bronze Age Thailand</field><field name="creator">Cawte, Hayden James</field><field name="description">A metalsmith&#65533;s ability to turn stone into metal and mould metal into useable objects, is one of the most valuable production industries of any society. The conception of this metallurgical knowledge has been the major catalyst in the development of increasing socio-political complexity since the beginning of the Bronze Age (Childe, 1930). 
 However, when considering the prehistory of Southeast Asia, especially Thailand, it is noted that the introduction of metallurgical activity, namely copper and bronze technology, did not engender the increase in social complexity witnessed in other regions. It is suggested that the region is anomalous in that terms and concepts developed to describe and define Bronze Ages by scholars working in other regions, lack strict analogues within Southeast Asia. Muhly (1988) has famously noted the non-compliance of Southeast Asia to previous models, "In all other corners of the Bronze Age world-China, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, the Aegean and central Europe-we find the introduction of bronze technology associated with a complex of social, political and economic developments that mark the rise of the state. Only in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand and Vietnam, do these developments seem to be missing" (Muhly, 1988:16). 
 This "rise of the state" is associated with the development of hierarchy, inequality, and status differentiation, evidence for which, it is argued, is most explicitly articulated in mortuary contexts (Bacus, 2006). Evidence would include an intra-site restriction in access to resources, including prestige goods, and ranking, a vertical differentiation, often related to interment wealth. Thus the introduction of metallurgical technology saw copper and other prestige goods, used to entrench authority and advertise status (Coles and Harding; 1979). Such evidence has so far been absent in Bronze Age, Southeast Asian contexts. Accordingly, the usefulness of the term "Bronze Age" for describing and defining Southeast Asian assemblages has been questioned (White, 2002). However, the Ban Non Wat discovery of wealthy Bronze Age interments, with bronze grave goods restricted to the wealthiest, has furrowed the brow of many working in the region, providing evidence to at least reconsider this stance. 
 Despite its obvious importance in shaping Bronze Age societies around the globe, and now, significance in Northeast Thailand, very little is known of the acceptance, development, and spread of tin-bronze metallurgical techniques during the prehistory of Southeast Asia. Only a handful of investigations of archaeological sites in the region have investigated the use of metals beyond macroscopic cataloguing. 
 Utilising an agential framework, the Ban Non Wat bronze metallurgical evidence has been investigated as an entire assemblage, from the perspective of the individual metalsmith, in order to greater understand the industry and its impact upon the society incorporating the new technology. 
 Furthermore, mortuary data is investigated by means of wealth assessment, as an insight into social form throughout the corresponding period of adoption, development and spread of metallurgy. 
 The bivalent study of society and technology has shed light on the development of socio-political, and economic complexity during Bronze Age Southeast Asia, and in doing so, outlined the direct impact the metalsmiths themselves had on the supply, spread and functioning of their important industry. 
 Variabilities in grave &#65533;wealth,&#65533; have been identified at Ban Non Wat. A further situation not previously encountered in Bronze Age Southeast Asia, is the restriction of bronze goods, in death, to differentiated, wealthy individuals. The existence of such individuals suggests that society during this period was rather more complex than regional precedents would suggest. I contend that it is the introduction of metallurgy, and in particular, the nature in which it was conducted that engendered these developments. 
 Therefore, when considering the traditional course of developing social-political complexity during the Bronze Age, it now seems that Thailand at least, is potentially, not that anomalous.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bronze age</field><field name="subject">excavations (archaeology)</field><field name="subject">metal-workers</field><field name="subject">antiquities</field><field name="subject">Ban Non Wat</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081212.151716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secreted amyloid precursor protein-alpha modulates hippocampal long-term potentiation, in vivo</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Chanel Jayne</field><field name="description">Alzheimer&#65533;s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, charaeterised by progressive loss of memory. It is important to understand what factors initiate the onset of AD so that effective therapeutic treatments can be developed to target the precise mechanisms that initiate this disease. Currently, synaptic dysfunction is widely believed to be the first significant alteration preceding the onset of AD, and is thought to be initiated by an intracellular accumulation of amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;), or a free radical-induced increase of oxidative stress. As A&#946; levels rise during the onset of AD, a concomitant reduction of secreted amyloid precursor protein-&#945; (sAPP&#945;) is observed, as the two proteins exist in equilibrium. Intriguingly, the neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties of sAPP&#945; indicate that it is intimately involved in the physiological pathways of the major hypotheses for the cause of AD, and may also be involved in the mechanisms that underlie learning and memory. Therefore, it is possible that during the onset of AD, the decrease of sAPP&#945; may contribute to synaptic dysfunction by disrupting the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. 
 Long-term potentiation (LTP) is the leading experimental model for investigating the neural substrate of memory formation, and describes the molecular mechanisms that underlie an increase in the strength of synaptic transmission. The role sAPP&#945; may play in the induction and maintenance of LTP has not previously been addressed in vivo. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to investigate whether sAPP&#945; affects the induction of LTP in the hippocampus of the anaesthetised rat. The present findings are the first to suggest that sAPP&#945; may modulate the induction of LTP in vivo. Decreasing the function of endogenous sAPP&#945; (with sAPP&#945;-binding antibodies and a pharmacological inhibition of &#945;-secretase) significantly reduced the magnitude of LTP induced in the dentate gyrus. Therefore, the reduction of sAPP&#945; during AD is likely to have a detrimental impact on the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, and by extension, learning and memory. The present investigation has also found that the application of recombinant, purified sAPP&#945; to the rat hippocampus has an &#65533;inverted U-shaped&#65533; dose-response effect on the magnitude of LTP. Low concentrations of sAPP&#945; significantly enhanced LTP, supporting previous findings that exogenous sAPP&#945; can facilitate in vitro LTP and enhance memory performance in animals. On the other hand, comparatively high concentrations of sAPP&#945; significantly decreased the magnitude of LTP. This observation is also consistent with previous findings, in which high concentrations of sAPP&#945; have been shown to be less synaptogenic and memory enhancing than lower doses. These results are the first to suggest that sAPP&#945; modulates in vivo synaptic plasticity, and have important implications for the development of strategies to treat AD.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hippocampus (brain)</field><field name="subject">alzheimer's disease</field><field name="subject">amyloid beta-protein precursor</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">physiological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081217.144344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rebel rivers : an investigation into the river rights of indigenous people of Canada and New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Strack, Michael S</field><field name="description">In Canada and New Zealand there are increasing calls for recognition of aboriginal rights which previously were ignored or denied because of the application of English law to concepts of property rights and ownership. English legal principles are vitally important in Canadian and New Zealand society, but there has always been room for local adaptations which could have recognised the existing practices and rights of the indigenous peoples. 
 The English law makes various assumptions about ownership of rivers, dividing them into bed, banks and water, and applying various tests of adjoining occupation, tidalness and navigability to determine rights. Aboriginal property rights have been guaranteed and protected by various mechanisms such as government policy, treaty, and the courts, but there is uncertainty about the status of rivers. The form of the survey definition of reserves and rivers is also fundamental to how property rights may be determined. This thesis examines the situation of rivers in Canada and New Zealand through common law, treaty provisions and through what is now, a developing body of applicable and recognised customary/Aboriginal law. From these three legal foundations, a case study approach focuses on the practical situation of the Siksika people on the Bow River in southern Alberta, and the Kai Tahu on the Taieri River in Otago. 
 This investigation concludes that there are various legal mechanisms by which indigenous people may claim rights to the rivers with which they have a relationship; by resorting to English common law principles; by applying new and developing conceptualisations of customary and aboriginal rights doctrines; by appealing to tribunals examining treaty agreements; or by direct negotiation with the Crown. All of these processes require evidence of past and current relationships, use and occupation of rivers by the indigenous claimants. Current undisputed possession and control may be a satisfactory outcome, but ultimately an acknowledgement of ownership may depend on politically negotiated settlements.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kai Tahu (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">Siksika Indians</field><field name="subject">land tenure</field><field name="subject">water rights</field><field name="subject">customary law</field><field name="subject">Alberta</field><field name="subject">Bow River</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Taieri River</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081217.163025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Where did we go wrong? : a critical assessment of management in the Bluff Oyster Fishery</field><field name="creator">Knight, Peter David</field><field name="description">More than a century of dredging for oysters in the Foveaux Strait has resulted in a decimated fishery. In 1999 the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment asked the question: Where did we go wrong? This thesis provides answers to this question by presenting information provided by the Bluff oyster fishermen. In order to gain as much exposure to the community of fishermen as possible, a cumulative period of approximately six months was spent living in the town of Bluff between 2002 and 2007. During this time relationships were built with key informants, and a total of more than 50 community members were interviewed. The thesis describes the practical knowledge of the oyster fishermen, and places it in the context of more that 40 years of modem scientific studies concerned with the fishery. The finding are that since 1996 when the Quota Management System was introduced in the fishery, the most knowledgeable and responsible people in the fishery have been systematically excluded from roles in management. The practical knowledge of fishermen has been discounted in an industry and government led management system, which is an elaborate justification for continued maximum exploitation of the fishery. The theoretical contribution of the thesis lies in its description of belonging as a factor as important as that of property-rights in a sustainable resource system. The practical knowledge and conservation-mindedness of the fishery elders are characteristics of belonging, but not necessarily of ownership. Fishery management should recognize belonging as cultural capital, and make use of it under the present system (i.e. the Quota Management System) by according fishermen rights of management and access to the oyster fishery.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oyster fisheries</field><field name="subject">fishery management</field><field name="subject">effect of dredging</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Bluff</field><field name="subject">Foveaux Strait</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081218.160813</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical outcomes of dental implant treatment provided at the School of Dentistry, University of Otago from 1989 to 2005</field><field name="creator">Verma, Rajiv</field><field name="description">Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of oral implant treatment provided at the School of Dentistry, University of Otago from 1989 to 2005. 
 Methods: Oral implant patients (n=320) with 586 implants were identified and invited to attend for a clinical examination. Implant demographics of all the patients were extracted from the files. Implant demographics of the examined and unexamined patients were compared to assess if the examined patients were representative of the total group. One hundred and three patients with 214 implants agreed to attend for an examination. In the clinical examination full mouth plaque scores, probing depths, bleeding on probing and suppuration were measured. In addition, around implants recession and width of keratinized gingiva were also recorded. For the radiographic examination, baseline radiographs and radiographs taken at the time of examination were digitized and compared to measure the amount of bone lost or gained around implants using NIH Image J software. 
 Results: There were equal numbers of males and females with a mean age of 46.3 &#65533; 15 years at the time of implant placement. The smoking history at the time of examination was recorded, 56% of the patients were non-smokers, 37% former smokers, and 7% were current smokers. More than half of the implants (56%) were placed in the anterior region. Based on the type of implant system, 79% were Branemark implants, 10% Straumann, 6% Southern implants and 4% were unknown. Most of the patients (64%) had implant-supported crowns, 19% had fixed denture prostheses, and 17% had implant-supported overdentures. The overall implant survival rate was 97.7% with five implants lost (2.3%) and 8 implants treated for peri-implantitis (3.8%). The mean PD around implants was 2.3mm (SD 0.6mm), mean recession was 0.5mm (SD 0.8mm) and mean attachment level of 2.8mm (SD 0.9mm). Probing depths [greater than or equal to] 4mm with BOP were recorded around implants in 8.9% of patients. The mean full mouth plaque score was 30% while mean plaque score around implants was 15.9%. The average bone loss around implants was 0.3mm (SD 0.8). Maximum bone loss observed was 2.9 mm. 
 Conclusion: The prevalence of peri-implant inflammation and implant survival rates in this group of patients appeared comparable to that reported in the literature.

Indeed, a large body of theoretical and empirical work has already gone into elucidating the causes and consequences of frequency-dependent selection. Most theoretical work, to date, has focused either on the diallelic case, or dealt with only very specific forms of frequency-dependence. A general model of the maintenance of multiallelic genetic diversity has been lacking. Here we extend a flexible general model of frequency-dependent selection, the pairwise interaction model, to the case of multiple alleles. 
 First, we investigate the potential for genetic variation under the pairwise interaction model using a parameter-space approach. This approach involves taking a large random sample of all possible fitness sets and initial allele-frequency vectors of the model, iterating each to equilibrium from each set of random initial conditions, and measuring how often variation is maintained, and by which parameter combinations. We find that frequency- dependent selection maintains full polymorphism more often than classic constant-selection models and produces more skewed equilibrium allele frequencies. Fitness sets with some degree of rare advantage maintained full polymorphism most often, but a variety of non-obvious fitness patterns were also found to have positive potential for polymorphism. 
 Second, we further investigate some unusual dynamics uncovered by the parameter-space approach above. Long-period allele-frequency cycles and a small number of aperiodic trajectories were detected. We measured the number, length and domains of attraction of the various attractors produced by the model. The genetic cycles produced by the model did not have periods short enough to be observable on an ecological time scale. In a real world system, allele-frequency cycling is likely to be indistinguishable from stable equilibrium when observed over short time scales. 
 Third, we use a construction approach to model frequency-dependent selection with mutation under the pairwise interaction model. This approach involves the construction of an allelic polymorphism by bombarding an initial monomorphism with mutant alleles over many generations. We find that frequency-dependent selection is able to generate large numbers of alleles at a single locus. The construction process generates a wide range of allele- frequency distributions and genotypic fitness relationships. We find that constructed polymorphisms remain permanently invasible to new mutants. Analysis of constructed fitness sets may even reveal a signature of positive frequency dependence. 
 Finally, we examine the numbers and distributions of fitnesses and alleles produced by construction under the pairwise interaction model with mutation from existing alleles, using several different methods of generating mutant fitnesses. We find that, relative to more general construction models, generating mutants from existing alleles lowers the average number of alleles maintained by frequency-dependent selection. Nevertheless, while the overall numbers of alleles are lower, the polymorphisms produced are more stable, with more natural allele-frequency distributions. 
 Overall, frequency-dependent selection remains a powerful mechanism for the maintenance of genetic variation, although it does not always work in intuitively obvious ways.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gene frequency</field><field name="subject">variation (biology)</field><field name="subject">natural selection</field><field name="subject">chromosome polymorphism</field><field name="subject">allelomorphism</field><field name="subject">population genetics</field><field name="subject">evolution (biology)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081114.120926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of queen mandibular pheromone on locomotor behaviour and learning in worker honey bees Apis mellifera</field><field name="creator">Vergoz, Vanina</field><field name="description">In a honey bee colony, the queen uses queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) to induce young worker bees to feed and groom her. Among its many behavioural and physiological effects, QMP reduces dopamine levels in the brains of young worker bees. Dopamine is a biogenic monoamine involved in numerous functions including motor control and aversive learning. This study investigates the effects of QMP on motor activities and aversive learning behaviour and the potential link between QMP and dopamine levels in the brain of young bees. 
 In young bees under the age of 15-days, QMP dramatically reduced locomotor activity and inhibited aversive learning behaviour. Interestingly in older bees these behaviours were not affected by pheromone. Treating young bees with the dopamine precursor, L-dopa (3.25 [mu]g/mI), partially rescued the levels of locomotor activity in QMP-treated bees, and reduced QMP&#65533;s effects on aversive learning. This suggests that blocking effects of QMP on both locomotor activity and aversive learning result at least in part from QMP-induced changes in brain dopamine levels. 
 Two components of the QMP blend, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylethanol (HVA) and methyl p-hydroxybenzoate (HOB) were examined more closely. Both HVA and HOB are structurally similar to dopamine. HVA was found to mimic the effects of the full QMP blend on aversive learning. Treating bees with HVA reduced aversive learning in young bees. In contrast, treatment with HOB did not affect learning ability. This strongly suggests that HVA is one of the key components that mediates the actions of QMP on aversive learning. 
 The final section of this thesis investigates why it might be advantageous to honey bee queens to block aversive learning and reduce locomotor activity in young worker bees. The study reveals age-related differences in behaviours that individual worker bees display towards QMP. Young bees reared with QMP or collected from a queenright hive showed attraction to QMP. Conversely, older bees displayed avoidance behaviour towards QMP. By blocking the establishment of aversive memories, young bees may be prevented from forming an association between QMP and any unpleasant side effects induced by this pheromone. This may confer significant benefit to the queen by increasing the likelihood of young workers remaining in her attendance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chemical senses</field><field name="subject">dopamine receptors</field><field name="subject">honeybee</field><field name="subject">behavior</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">pheromones</field><field name="subject">dopaminergic mechanisms</field><field name="subject">motor ability</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081121.161845</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Land use and Giardia in Otago</field><field name="creator">Winkworth, Cynthia Lee</field><field name="description">Agriculture is key to New Zealand&#65533;s economy with land-use conversions in response to market forces occurring regularly. Recently, high-intensity dairy farming has replaced low-density livestock farming, often degrading surrounding waterways. Of particular concern is that dairy cattle can be a source of the parasite Giardia, which in humans is a common cause of gastrointestinal infection. Thus, this thesis evaluated whether dairy farm conversions posed significant consequences for public health. 
 First I examined the prevalence of Giardia in calves in a rapidly intensifying dairying region of New Zealand. A total of 1190 faecal samples were collected from calves one to seven weeks old during two spring calving seasons and screened by direct immunofluorescent microscopy. Giardia cysts were detected in 31% of samples. 
 To evaluate the potential risk that this environmental source of Giardia posed to the human population, molecular genotyping was used to compare forty Giardia strains isolated from calves with thirty isolates from humans collected in the same region and period. Sequencing the &#946;-giardin gene, Giardia duodenalis assemblages A and B were identified from both hosts, with genotype comparisons revealing substantial overlap of identical genotypes for both assemblages, implying zoonotic transmission. 
 Environmental agencies routinely promote the planting of streamside edges to decrease nonpoint pollution from dairy farms entering waterways. However, current methods for tracking pathogens across farmland and into waterways via surface runoff are limited and typically have been developed using artificially created landscapes. Furthermore, no studies have investigated how Giardia moves across the landscape in farm surface runoff. I developed a field-based tracking method specific for Giardia and used this technique to compare the ability of recently planted vegetation strips with bare soil strips cleared of vegetation at decreasing pathogen concentrations; a typical scenario when planting barriers to reduce waterway contamination. A spike containing a bromide tracer and inactivated Giardia cysts was applied in drip-irrigated surface runoff, with one-minute samples collected from the bottom of the plot. A significant treatment effect was identified for Giardia, with 26% fewer detected in runoff from the planted strip, highlighting the immediate benefit of vegetation planting in removing pathogens. 
 Next I evaluated the effects of four riparian treatments on Giardia runoff: exotic pasture grass and weeds growing in the absence of cattle grazing due to fencing, in comparison to monocultural plantings of three New Zealand native grassland species. Runoff experiments were performed after planting, both prior to and following the main summer growing season. Bromide recovery was high from all four treatments (54 - 99%), with no significant treatment effects. By comparison, Giardia recovery was low (1 - 13%). Prior to summer, two native species reduced Giardia in runoff more than the pasture grass/weed treatment which was almost vegetation-free at this time. After summer, Giardia recoveries were uniformly lower in all treatments. These results demonstrate that after one growing season, fencing waterways produces riparian buffers, via the growth of exotic pasture plants released from grazing, that decrease pathogen concentrations in surface runoff to concentrations indistinguishable from native plantings. 
 Given infectious organisms are known to be in the environment, it is important to assess the risk these pose to human populations. Findings from this research can be used to improve currently available risk-assessment models for Giardia transmission from infected dairy animals via water to humans.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Giardiasis</field><field name="subject">Giardia</field><field name="subject">dairy farming</field><field name="subject">animal waste</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">water in agriculture</field><field name="subject">riparian areas</field><field name="subject">streambank planting</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Otago</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081219.162139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interspecific and intraspecific interactions of trematodes parasitising the New Zealand cockle Austrovenus stutchburyi</field><field name="creator">Leung, Tommy Ling Fong</field><field name="description">Most organisms are rarely infected with just a single species of parasite and are usually simultaneously infected with a range of species. Thus, the parasite fauna of a host represents an entire community composed of multiple individuals from many different species. In nature, it is within the host that parasites can encounter conspecifics and individuals from other species. As in any ecosystem, while such interactions between parasites can be antagonistic due to competition or conflicting interests, association between different species can also be beneficial. 
 In this thesis, I investigated patterns of associations between parasites in the New Zealand cockle Austrovenus stutchburyi through a combination of descriptive and experimental studies employing both standard ecological field techniques and molecular biology methods. 
 It was found that the presence and infection intensity of various parasites species are not independent of each other. Among cockles, an association was found between two trematode taxa, i.e. between the infection intensity by foot-encysting echinostomes and the metacercariae of Gymnophallus sp. It was also found that the presence of the parasitic copepod Pseudomyicola spinosus was associated with greater infection intensity by the echinostomes but not Gymnophallus sp. While it was postulated that the positive association between the echinostomes and Gymnophallus sp. was due to the latter&#65533;s preference to infect cockles that are stranded on the sediment surface as a result of heavy echinostome metacercariae burden in their foot, a field experiment found that Gymnophallus cercariae did not preferentially infect cockles that have been forced to remain above the sediment surface as opposed to those that were forced to remain buried. 
 Meanwhile, the two species of echinostomes known to encyst in the cockle&#65533;s foot, Acanthoparyphium sp. and Curtuteria australis, were found to represent cryptic species complexes. The presence of such cryptic species means that it is possible that some potential interspecific interactions are overlooked. 
 A study of the population structure of Gymnophallus sp. found that each cockle contains multiple genetically distinct individuals and that clonal individuals rarely co-occur in the same cockle. This adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that in addition to acting as a means of reaching the definitive host, the second intermediate host also acts to promote genetic diversity by accumulating cercariae shed by multiple first intermediate hosts in the environment. 
 An experimental infection study conducted with Curtuteria australis cercariae deriving from singly-infected first intermediate hosts revealed that different clonal lineages varied with respect to their contribution to host manipulation. It was found that while certain lineages have a preference for host manipulation, others tend to adopt a "hitch-hiker"-type life history strategy. However, this genetic predisposition was also found to be a phenotypically plastic trait, as the presence of a higher number of manipulators seems to encourage newly-arrived cercariae to become manipulators, regardless of clonal lineage. 
 This thesis provides evidence that patterns of interactions can affect various aspects of parasite life history. Apart from host condition, parasites can also be affected by other parasites. Studying the dynamics of mixed infections can provide informative insights for evolutionary and ecological research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Austrovenus stutchburyi</field><field name="subject">Cardiidae</field><field name="subject">parasites</field><field name="subject">trematoda</field><field name="subject">host-parasite relationships</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090105.160127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stimulation of immune cells by heat-killed lactobacilli and exopolysaccharide</field><field name="creator">Livingston, Megan M</field><field name="description">Lactobacilli are intestinal bacteria with known immunomodulatory competence. Numerous strains of this genus have been implicated in both the prevention and treatment of intestinal inflammation as well as in maintenance of immunological homeostasis. The frequent inclusion of lactobacilli in probiotic products attests to this ability. These lactic acid bacteria colonise the murine forestomach and burgeon in other environments similarly rich in carbohydrate-containing substrates. Accordingly, lactobacilli may utilise fermentable carbohydrates to synthesise exopolysaccharides (EPS). These polymers are secreted into the cellular milieu and, while the ecological function of EPS is yet to be defined, evidence points towards a protective role. This function may include bacterial protection from immunological attack, via EPS recognition by immune cells, resulting in modulation of immunological activity. 
 Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen presenting cells, providing an essential link between the innate and adaptive arms of the intestinal immune system. DC efficiently sample intestinal antigens and present peptides to cognate naive CD4&#8314; T cells in secondary lymphatic tissue. Under the influence of secreted cytokines, DC direct the differentiation of naive CD4&#8314; T cells and therefore, instruct the resultant immune response. Anti-inflammatory Th2 and regulatory T cells can down-regulate the destructive Th1 pro-inflammatory effects associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). As such, bioactives with the aptitude to direct DC activity and T cell differentiation have the potential to prevent or reduce intestinal inflammation. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether heat-killed EPS-producing strains of lactobacilli, and their secreted EPS, exert an immunomodulatory effect on the murine gut which may down-regulate the immune reactions associated with IBD. 
 Lactobacilli were screened for their ability to produce EPS when grown in the presence of glucose, sucrose or lactose. Heat-killed EPS-producing strains were then used to stimulate bone marrow-derived DC (BMDC) and the resultant cytokine profile was analysed. Nine Lactobacillus strains were found to produce EPS when grown in the presence of sucrose. Of these, L. reuteri 100-23 and L. johnsonii 100-33 exhibited potential anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, these strains, as well as L. johnsonii 100-5 and L. johnsonii #21, with relatively weak BMDC stimulatory effect, were selected for further investigation. 
 EPS of the potentially anti-inflammatory strain L. reuteri 100-23 was analysed. This sample contained approximately 85% carbohydrate and was composed of a (2[to]6)-&#946;-fructofuranan (levan) and a mannan. The fructan, with an estimated molecular weight of 7 kDa, comprised at least 50% of the EPS, while the mannan made up at least 22%. The mannan component was likely linked to a protein and may have originated from the culture medium. 
 The immunostimulatory capacity of heat-killed Lactobacillus bacterial cells and their EPS was determined in vitro. Firstly, the effect of lactobacilli and EPS on BMDC cytokine secretion, particularly levels of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and pro-inflammatory IL-12, as well as the expression of cell surface activation markers, was determined. L. reuteri 100-23 stimulated relatively high IL-10 secretion but low IL-12, while L. johnsonii 100-33-stimulated BMDC produced elevated levels of both IL-10 and IL-12. All bacterial cells up-regulated co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD80 on BMDC. The effect of these stimulated BMDC on T cell proliferation and cytokine production was then assessed, employing the ovalbuminDO11.10 T cell model. L. reuteri 100-23-stimulated BMDC down-regulated T cell production of the proliferation-stimulating cytokine, IL-2, up-regulated regulatory TGF-&#946; secretion, but did not affect pro-inflammatory IFN-&#947; levels. The EPS of all strains did not stimulate significant BMDC cytokine production and failed to alter BMDC activation marker expression. However, BMDC stimulated with L. reuteri 100-23 and L. johnsonii 100-33 EPS significantly enhanced T cell IL-2 secretion, but did not alter TGF-&#946; or IFN-&#947; levels. 
 The effect of in vivo L. reuteri 100-23 and EPS intestinal stimulation on the reactivity of immune cells was subsequently investigated. Mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells and splenic T cells from reconstituted Lactobacillus-free mice fed stimulant or PBS on two occasions were co-cultured with stimulated or unstimulated donor CD11c&#8314; splenic DC ex vivo. Cellular proliferation as well as TGF-&#946; and IFN-&#947; secretion was analysed, and IL-10 neutralisation assays were carried out to ascertain the involvement of this cytokine. Primary exposure of MLN cells to L. reuteri 100-23 resulted in suppressed cell proliferation in the presence of enhanced TGF-&#946; levels, which may have also involved IL-10. Primed splenic T cells exhibited increased proliferation in the presence of elevated TGF-&#946; levels following re-exposure to L. reuteri 100-23, and IL-10 may be involved in limiting this proliferation. L. reuteri 100-23 EPS did not alter MLN cell proliferation, possibly due to the suppressive activity of IL-10, but did enhance that of naive and primed splenic T cells. 
 The effect of ingested L. reuteri 100-23 and EPS on intestinal sIgA concentration was assessed by quantifying IgA levels in the faecal supernatant of RLF mice previously ingesting L. reuteri 100-23 and EPS. L. reuteri 100-23 EPS-fed female mice exhibited significantly elevated levels of sIgA, while heat-killed bacteria did not affect antibody levels. 
 The present study demonstrated that oral administration of heat-killed L. reuteri 100-23 and EPS exerts immunomodulatory effects on the murine intestine. These bioactives may promote a suppressive environment by conditioning DC to secrete a cytokine profile conducive to regulatory T cell induction and memory generation. Additionally, mucosal protection may be favoured by the stimulation of elevated sIgA levels. Therefore, a therapeutic composite is possibly obtained to preserve the intestinal barrier by defending against pathogen-induced injury and buffering inflammatory events. In these ways, L. reuteri 100-23 and EPS may confer long-lasting protection against, and down-regulate the immune reactions associated with, IBD.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">molecular immunology</field><field name="subject">lactobacillus</field><field name="subject">microbial exopolysaccharides</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090108.142107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The intestinal immune response to Giardia in the rat</field><field name="creator">Waight Sharma, Agnes Phyllis.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 183-228</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Giardia lamblia</field><field name="subject">Giardiasis Immunological aspects</field><field name="subject">Rats Diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phw138.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:6606354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical, social and stylistic study of Australian children's comics</field><field name="creator">Foster, John E.

Based on the results of a program placement test of rate and accuracy, students were assigned to one of two entry points into the Corrective Reading program (A, B1). The students in the intervention group received 60-65 lessons (in groups of five to ten students) from teachers at their schools, or, for some students, at a resource centre for surrounding schools. An additional study, with younger (mean age 8.8 years) less advanced readers involved a similar design and teaching approach. The program, Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons, was presented to thirteen student s in two settings.   When compared with a similar cohort of wait-list students, the students in each program made statistically significant and educationally important gains in such phonologically-based processes as word attack, phonemic awareness, and spelling; and, statistically significant gains, of at least moderate effect size, in phonological recoding in lexical access and phonological recoding in working memory.

The thesis critically analyzes adult learning literature, then develops models, and tests the approaches at a commercial university.       The professional learning model overcomes the gap in applied online learning design and delivery theories through a perspective transformation of the fundamental educational psychology principles, to shift the philosophy towards an integrated humanistic-constructivist paradigm. The key principles emphasized in this new approach are andragogical motivation, self-schema, self-efficacy, and self-regulation.      A repeated-measures quasi-experiment was designed and conducted in a university online MBA program (n=48), using a scientific research methodology (that controlled confounding factors) to empirically test the professional learning factor model. Paired-treatment tests, factor covariances, coefficient of multiple determinations, and cause/effect multiple regression findings were statistically significant at the 95% confidence level (most tests exceeded 99%). A linear mathematical predictor and systemic model was substantiated from the concept testing, to quantitatively explain 66%(r&#178;) of cause-effect variance between the contextual factors and dependent variables. These findings were compared to, and were in agreement with similar studies. The limitations of the quasi-experiments are small sample size, natural selection (as opposed to pure randomization), and generalizability to other contexts (models not yet replicated).

The   main aim of the reform is to establish a national vocational and education system within a   federal political system and to make vocational educations and training providers more   responsive to the needs of industry, by industry specifying its skill needs through the   mechanism of national Training Packages.   The background to this workplace project, the Review of the Community Services   Training Package, and this study, is established by a review of policy and literature in   relation to national training reform issues and stakeholder management within a public   policy context. This review established some principles of good practice in relation to   stakeholder management. The industry context of the workplace project is discussed. The   workplace project is then unpacked in some detail with specific reference to stakeholder   management strategies and issues and some specific stakeholder groups.   This exegesis goes on to explore stakeholder behaviour in this particular workplace project   in its historical context of the introduction of Training Packages to the vocational   education and training system.

The exegesis concludes with some suggestions of opportunities for enhanced workplace   practice in stakeholder management and for further research.

The key objectives of this research were to understand the features of effective iTours; to explore the processes and techniques of designing and testing effective iTours; and to establish new praxis in new media design for technical communication.      Design artefacts resulted from six key activities including: (1) Sub-project   1- RMIT Multimedia Online documentation with basic animation; (2) Sub-project 2- Online @ RMIT Orientation with some iTour animation;   (3) Third-party iTour analytical review to deconstruct iTours and determine key elements; (4) Sub-project 3- Online @ RMIT iTours; (5)   iTour Guidelines; and (6) A second, more comprehensive third-party iTour analysis to test the Guidelines.      The outcome of the research is encapsulated in a web site that binds the artefacts of design sub-projects with a set of Guidelines. These Guidelines form a conceptual, structural and operational framework for iTour designers, and draw on the knowledge established while designing and testing iTours, analysing third-party iTours, and researching comparative fields. These fields include technical communication; new media; web;   usability design and testing; and, to a lesser extent, software design and testing. The Guidelines, in conjunction with the knowledge base, were developed to facilitate effective communication through iTours.      Through this research, the design action case study was established as a hybrid research approach: design research and action research are blended; and knowledge is situated within, and derived from, a case study. In support of design research, the PDIOR design cycles have been specified and include these phases: plan; develop; implement; observe; and reflect. The PDIOR approach combines design research and action research in a cyclical mode to explore technical communication and new media activities.      Finally, eleven principles for designing effective iTours emerged from this research project. Articulation of these principles, in addition to the Guidelines, contributes new knowledge in the field for technical communicators, new media designers and others, who wish to engage in   iTour design.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">technical documentation</field><field name="subject">iTours</field><field name="subject">technical writing</field><field name="subject">design research</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">design action case study</field><field name="subject">animation</field><field name="subject">PhD Project</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">information design</field><field name="subject">new media</field><field name="subject">usability</field><field name="subject">online interactive animated tours</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20060825.153207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient Query Expansion</field><field name="creator">Billerbeck, Bodo</field><field name="description">Hundreds of millions of users each day search the web and other repositories to meet their information needs. However, queries can fail to find documents due to a mismatch in terminology. Query expansion seeks to address this problem by automatically adding terms from highly ranked documents to the query. While query expansion has been shown to be effective at improving query performance, the gain in effectiveness comes at a cost: expansion is slow and resource-intensive.      Current techniques for query expansion use fixed values for key parameters, determined by tuning on   test collections. We show that these parameters may not be generally applicable, and, more significantly, that the assumption that the same parameter settings can be used for all queries is invalid.

In conventional approaches to query expansion, the additional terms are selected from highly ranked   documents returned from an initial retrieval run. We demonstrate a new method of obtaining expansion   terms, based on past user queries that are associated with documents in the collection.      The most effective query expansion methods rely on costly retrieval and processing of feedback documents. We explore alternative methods for reducing query-evaluation costs, and propose a new method based on keeping a brief summary of each document in memory. This method allows query expansion to proceed three times faster than previously, while approximating the effectiveness of standard expansion. We investigate the use of document expansion, in which documents are augmented with related terms extracted from the corpus during indexing, as an alternative to query expansion.

Such injuries often have long-term complications leading to significant personal and societal costs. An improved   mathematical model of the whole human body would contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of lower back injury and be valuable in injury prevention research.      Current biodynamic human models reported in the literature lack detailed information for predicting the non-linearity due to vibration amplitude of transmission of vibration from seat to a human. Therefore, one of the primary   objectives of this research has been to develop and validate a detailed threedimensional   biodynamic human model, with special attention given to the incorporation of active trunk muscles with non-linear stiffness properties. These   muscles have been incorporated into an existing spine and neck model of a MADYMO 50th percentile male occupant model. A detailed multi-body human   model has been developed, called MODEL ONE. This thesis shows that incorporating non-linear stiffness functions and energy dissipation using hysteresis or damping into a human model is appropriate for predicting non-linear biodynamic   responses in arbitrary excitation functions. A major advantage of MODEL ONE compared to other multi-body models and lumped mass models is its ability to predict nonlinear seat-to-human transmissibility.      However MADYMO 50th male occupant models use simplified geometry and rigid bodies to represent the lower lumbar spine. These simplified spinal models have no ability to simulate the internal stresses and deformations of soft tissues, even if these are the apparent cause of lower back pain (LBP). Therefore a detailed finite element   human lower lumbar spine model - with appropriate material properties and capable of simulating internal stresses&#9135;is necessary, in order to better understand spinal injuries under WBV. A three-dimensional finite element model of a lower lumbar spine motion segment - called MODEL TWO - has thus been developed for the present study. MODEL TWO comprises a detailed geometric description of vertebrae, nucleus pulposus, endplates, and intervertebral discs. The intervertebral discs lump together the annulus fibrosus, ground substance and ligaments. The   vertebrae have been assumed to be rigid. The material properties of the intervertebral discs of MODEL TWO were obtained from test matrices and from various parameter data reported in the literature. MODEL TWO has been validated   against cadaveric experiments reported in the literature. The mechanical behaviour and stress distribution within the MODEL TWO intervertebral disc agree reasonably well with the cadaveric experiments.      MODEL TWO was integrated into MODEL ONE to form a new human model, called MODEL THREE, which was subsequently dynamically validated against   volunteers&#239;&#191;&#189; responses to WBV reported in the literature. MODEL THREE, as presented in this thesis, consists of a multi-body human model with detailed representation of a finite element (FE) lower lumbar spine. As far as the author is aware, MODEL THREE is the first model with detailed representation of a FE lower lumbar spine to successfully demonstrate that it is capable of simulating the stress profile of the entire intervertebral disc and endplate region due to WBV. The simulated results revealed abnormal stress concentrations in both the posterior and   xviii the posterolateral annulus. The stresses increased most in the posterolateral intervertebral discs region during WBV, suggesting a possible mechanism for disc mechanical overload leading to fatigue fracture and degeneration. The results from MODEL THREE are promising and lead to a more comprehensive understanding of   the behaviour of the intervertebral disc under WBV. MODEL THREE has also provided a good foundation for the development of a bio-fidelity human model. However, implementation of currently unavailable and/or inadequate in vitro and in vivo experimental studies is needed to further validate and develop MODEL THREE. A better understanding of injury mechanisms and the clinical significance of LBP will ultimately be arrived at using a combination of analytical models with in vitro and in vivo experimental data.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">whole-body vibration</field><field name="subject">lower back pains</field><field name="subject">human model</field><field name="subject">MADYMO</field><field name="subject">intervertebral disc</field><field name="subject">endplate</field><field name="subject">vibration</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20060825.160144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of White-rot Fungi for the Biodegradation of Natural Organic Matter in Wastes</field><field name="creator">Lee, Monn Kwang</field><field name="description">Natural organic matter (NOM), a complex mixture of organic compounds, influences drinking water quality and water treatment processes. The presence of NOM is unaesthetic in terms of colour, taste and odour, and may lead to the production of potentially carcinogenic disinfection by-products (DBPs), as well as biofilm formation in drinking water distribution systems. Some NOM removal processes such as coagulation, magnetic ion exchange resin (MIEXTM) and membrane filtration produce sludge and residuals. These concentrated NOM-containing sludges from alum precipitation, membrane treatment plants and MIEX regeneration must therefore be treated prior to disposal. The white-rot fungi possess a non-specific extracellular oxidative enzyme system composed of lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese-dependent peroxidase (MnP) and laccase (Lac) that allows these organisms to mineralise lignin and a broad range of intractable aromatic xenobiotics. Rojek (2003) has shown the capabi lity of Phanerochaete chrysosporium ATCC 34541 to remove 40-50% NOM from solution, however, this was found to be mainly due to adsorption and to be a partially metabolically linked activity. Consequently, the bioremediation of NOM wastes by selected white-rot fungi was further investigated in the present study. The P. chrysosporium seemed to preferentially remove the very hydrophobic acid (VHA) fraction, and so was most effective for a NOM preparation with a high proportion of hydrophobic content (and so high in colour and specific UV absorbance (SUVA)). The extent of NOM decolourisation by P. chrysosporium in three growth media with different C:N ratios followed the trends: Waksman (C:N = 6) &gt; Fahy (C:N = 76) &gt; Fujita medium (C:N = 114), such that the lower the C:N ratio, the greater NOM removal. This was consistent with the findings of Rojek (2003), who used a different NOM preparation and demonstrated that the removal of NOM increased with decreased C:N ratio (1.58-15.81). As removals of NOM with P. c hrysosporium ATCC 34541 were low, and little biodegradation occurred, this organism was compared with P. chrysosporium strain ATCC 24725, Trametes versicolor ATCC 7731, and three strains of yeast (Saccharomyces species arbitrarily denoted 1, 2 and 3). T. versicolor gave the greatest removal (59%) which was attributed largely to degradation, whereas the NOM removal by the two strains of P. chrysosporium (37%) and the yeast was predominantly due to adsorption as indicated by the deep brown colouration of the biomass. Saccharomyces sp. 1, 2 and 3 removed 12%, 61% and 23% of the colour, respectively. Although Saccharomyces sp. 2 had similar high colour reduction to T. versicolor, the specific removal values differed markedly: 0.055 compared to 0.089 mg NOM/mg biomass, respectively. The low level of the ligninolytic enzymes secreted by both strains of P. chrysosporium corresponded with the low degree of NOM removal by biodegradation as shown by high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). The high NOM  removal attained by T. versicolor was attributed to the activities of the ligninolytic enzymes, especially laccase. The NOM removal was attributed to the breakdown of the high molecular weight compounds to form a pool of low molecular weight materials, which were then most likely utilised by the T. versicolor. Growth of T. versicolor cultures at 36oC caused inhibition or denaturation of the activity of the phenoloxidase enzymes compared to those grown at 30oC. The low activity of LiP in both cultures suggested that this enzyme may not play much of a role in NOM removal. The higher levels of MnP and Lac activities at 30oC were responsible for the greater NOM removal (73% vs. 59%) and thus the cleavage of aromatic rings, conjugated and C-C&#946; &#945;bonds in phenolic moieties, as well as catalysing alkyl-aryl cleavage in the NOM structures. T. versicolor cultured in Waksman medium with higher initial glucose (5 g/L cf. 2 g/L) led to lower ligninolytic enzyme activities and a lower degree of NOM removal (25%  less colour reduction), probably due to preferential use of glucose over NOM as carbon source. NOM removal (mg removed) increased linearly with NOM concentration up to 600 mg C/L (62 mg (A446); 31 mg (A254)), above which removal decreased markedly. This trend coincided with increasing total ligninolytic enzyme activity, where the level of Lac increased up to 600 mg C/L NOM although MnP decreased gradually across the range while LiP was only detected for 100 and 300 mg C/L NOM. Hence, the removal of NOM from solution by T. versicolor was associated with high oxidative enzyme activity, particularly of laccase. Laccase was the major extracellular enzyme secreted by T. versicolor and by deduction, played a major role in NOM removal. The optimum temperature for Lac activity secreted by T. versicolor cultured in Waksman medium supplemented with 4.5 g/L wheat bran plus 0.5% Tween 80 was determined to be 50oC. The optimum pH for the Lac activity for guaiacol and NOM was identified as pH 4.0-4.5. Although the optimum  enzyme activity occurred at 50oC, 30oC was recommended for enzymatic removal of NOM as the phenoloxidase enzyme activity may be denatured if the NOM removal process were considered to run for long period at high temperature. Although agitation led to apparent enzyme denaturation, fermentations with continuous agitation promoted enzyme activity faster than those with occasional agitation (agitated every 6 hours for 30 minutes at 130 rpm and 30oC) as it provides better mass transfer. However, it seemed that continuous agitation had an adverse effect on the fungal growth and enzyme production over extended fermentation periods. Addition of 4.5 g/L wheat bran to modified Waksman medium in the absence of NOM led to high production of Lac activity compared with LiP and MnP activities, showing its great potential as a laccase inducer. Addition of Tween 80 alone to the cultures led to a small improvement in Lac activity; however, with the presence of wheat bran it caused marked increases in LiP, MnP and Lac activit ies. When NOM was added to cultures of T. versicolor with the two supplements, it led to markedly reduced Lac activity, but increased LiP and MnP activities, and no improvement in NOM removal compared with the cultures in the absence of supplements (12 mg (or 61%) cf. 15 mg (or 73%) for 100 mg C/L after corrected for colour from and adsorption by wheat bran).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biodegradation</field><field name="subject">natural organic matter</field><field name="subject">white-rot fungi</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20060825.161147</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient Admission Control Schemes in Cellular IP Networks</field><field name="creator">Giang, Truong Minh Triet</field><field name="description">The thesis reviews current admission control schemes in cellular IP networks.

To date, research on participants' perspectives has been limited   to a few predominantly quantitative studies, most of which have been commissioned or   conducted by government departments. This study provides a more qualitative and   independent perspective on participants' experiences and their views about their rights and   obligations as unemployed people. It considers the extent to which these experiences and   views are consistent with or conflict with the rationales for mutual obligation.   The study included a survey of 87 participants in nine Melbourne and Geelong-based Work   for the Dole projects conducted in 1999, eight focus groups conducted with 59 of these   participants, and 37 in-depth interviews conducted with a new sample of Work for the Dole   participants in 2002. Unemployed participants in the study had a strongly positive orientation   towards work and many had substantial experience of employment. They viewed work as   necessary to fulfil human capacities and needs, and often believed that they should work for   their own well-being, as much as to contribute to society. Far from expressing any distinctive   values of a 'dependency culture', participants appeared to share many of the work values of   the wider community. However, many also had substantial experience of unemployment and   faced significant barriers to gaining ongoing work.   This thesis provides evidence that Work for the Dole provides short-term benefits for many   such unemployed people: most study participants enjoyed taking part in the program and felt   that they gained benefits from participating. They clearly endorsed some kind of work   placement and skill development programs for the unemployed. Given the Howard   Government's abolition of a range of previous programs of this type, Work for the Dole is   now the only such program available for many participants and was often preferred to doing   no program at all.   However, more than four in ten survey participants did not enjoy doing the program overall,   and a fifth actively disliked taking part. Further, the program's impact on employment   prospects appeared to be either negligible or negative-which was not surprising given the   scheme's focus on the unemployed discharging their 'obligations to the community' and   2   overcoming a 'psychology of dependency', rather than on job outcomes for participants.   However, this thesis argues that there is very limited value in a program which provides   benefits at the time of participation but does not help in achieving the main aim of the   unemployed: gaining work.   The study analyses the Howard Government's three central rationales for the mutual   obligation policy: that it ensures that participants fulfil the requirements of the 'social   contract' by requiring them to 'contribute to the community' (the contractualist claim), that it   deters the unemployed from being 'too selective' about jobs (the 'job snob' claim), and that it   benefits participants by developing their capacity for autonomy and self-reliance (the new   paternalist claim). These three rationales are assessed in the light of participants' responses.   With regard to the contractualist claim, the study finds that most participants shared the   widespread community belief that only 'genuine' jobseekers deserve unemployment   payments, but many did not share the community's support for the requirement to work for   payments. While a third of survey participants supported this requirement, almost half   opposed it. Most believed the government was not fulfilling its obligations to the   unemployed to provide appropriate employment and training opportunities which were   relevant to the jobs they were seeking. Many viewed the mutual obligation 'contract' as a   one-way set of directives imposed on them and believed that the breaching regime which   enforced these directives was unreasonably punitive and unfairly administered.   With regard to the 'job snob' claim, study participants largely rejected an expectation that   they should be required to accept any job, and most had substantial concerns about the   specific form of the job search regime. They did not agree that 'any job is better than no job'   and objected to the pressure under mutual obligation arrangements to apply for jobs which   they considered inappropriate. They were not willing to be forced into jobs in which they   feared they would be unhappy and which they were likely to soon leave; rather, they wanted   assistance to help them to find sustainable work.   Finally, with regard to the 'new paternalist' claim, many participants believed that compelling   recipients to undertake certain activities or to apply for unsuitable jobs unreasonably restricted   their freedom of choice, undermining rather than increasing their autonomy. As argued by   Yeatman (2000b), recipients may benefit from a program, or from a case manager who assists   3   them to develop their capacities, but compulsion to undertake activities that are not related to   individual needs and goals is likely to undermine capacity-building. The evidence of poor   employment outcomes from Work for the Dole adds further weight to this view. The   provision of a greater range of program types in place of Work for the Dole-including those   which combine work with accredited training and those providing subsidised placement in   mainstream jobs-would address many concerns held by participants in this study. However,   compulsion to participate in a labour market program would remain problematic in a society   which generates far fewer jobs than are needed for full employment.   The thesis concludes that the mutual obligation principle privileges the obligations of the   unemployed over their rights to autonomy and to work. Its associated requirements have   further added to the already considerable constraints faced by unemployed people who are   attempting to identify and meet their own work-related goals. Ironically, a policy which is   portrayed by the Government as promoting active participation in society, in reality requires   many payment recipients to passively obey government directives-instead of actively   participating in shaping their own future.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mutual obligation</field><field name="subject">work for the dole</field><field name="subject">unemployment</field><field name="subject">welfare</field><field name="subject">income support</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20060926.093507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Application of Relationship Marketing to   Construction.</field><field name="creator">Davis, Peter Rex</field><field name="description">Relationship Marketing is relatively unknown in construction, but is widely   researched in non project disciplines and applied similarly. Relationship marketing as   a sub-component of marketing provides valuable and reliable tools that a manager can   use to enhance a service that is being provided to a range of clients. It provides a   better solution to client interaction than traditional marketing due to its focus on   mutual attainment of common goals. The purpose of relationship marketing is to   attract new clients and ensure that existing clients are looked after in a collaborative   engagement where objectives are identified and mutual goals set. Overall collective   aims of venture participants are identified and achieved.   The aim of the research is to identify key relationship factors that should be   considered when selecting a construction service. This is achieved through a number   of steps that include: examining the principles of marketing and its association with   RM; examining alliance principles and construction RM principles, supply chain and   service selection issues and relationship development constructs; interviewing a   number of construction actors to theorise issues that are important to construction, its   connections and relationships. Other activities include interviewing a substantial body   of construction actors that have experience of Alliance projects and are able to   comment on the relationship development process and observe activities undertaken   at a number of alliance development and alliance lessons learned (outcome)   workshops. The research identifies methods that enable relationships to be developed   and a model that gives buyers the ability to pre-qualify and select contractors that are   committed to providing value is provided.   The main findings from the research show that RM has many attributes that   should be applied to construction; indeed several aspects of RM are currently being   applied in alliance projects. The particular form that RM takes in alliance projects is   in the relationship development of the stakeholders. These stakeholders eventually   become the virtual team who manage the project. In particular the development of   trust, commitment and mutual goals in alliance projects form a close parallel with   similar constructs in RM. Four themes were discovered to make a difference in   relationship development in construction. They were the process of the relationship   development workshop; the underlying attributes associated with the development process, in particular trust, trust building, commitment and communication; the   outcome for the team; and organisational issues associated with individuals in the   relationship development workshops.   The particular contribution that the research identifies is in the various models   of relationship development that have been constructed throughout the research   period. The first, an interim model, identifies a marketing continuum that forms a   framework and provides an insight into the ways in which RM may reduce stress and   reasons for conflict in a construction project team. At the same time the model shows   how increased trust, commitment and satisfaction for the stakeholders, together with   value adding potential in the supply chain, may be attained with the use and   application of RM principles. The second interim model builds on the first model and   applies an organisational focus to the original project based model described earlier.   Ongoing relationships based on project success are identified. A third and final   interim model identifies the association between process (project) and product success   with transactional and relationship marketing. The model identifies how a RM   approach provides a long term project success that may be translated to marketing   success in a particular industry sector through ongoing relationships. Finally, building   on the aforementioned interim models a construction relationship development model   is proposed. It is suggested that these models develop and contribute to emerging   theory on RM in a project environment and its application to construction. The   models also contribute to relationship development theory applied to project driven   and temporary organisations. These temporary organisations are particular to the   construction industry and they stand to benefit greatly from this research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">relationship marketing</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">Alliance</field><field name="subject">procurement</field><field name="subject">relationship development</field><field name="subject">trust</field><field name="subject">commitment</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20061010.122434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Windtunnel modelling of vehicle aerodynamics: with emphasis on turbulent wind effects on commercial vehicle drag.</field><field name="creator">Watkins, Simon</field><field name="description">Fuel represents a major proportion of road transport expenditure and it is likely   that this proportion will increase. At typical road speeds approximately half of   the total fuel used is consumed in overcoming aerodynamic drag, hence the   determination and reduction of aerodynamic drag is of considerable importance.   This is normally performed by scale testing in wind tunnels with relatively   smooth flow.   When modelling an atmospheric crosswind in the tunnel the relative air direction   is generated by yawing the model at an angle to the oncoming flow. This   procedure does not reproduce the inherent turbulence in atmospheric winds. A   review of the literature showed a poor correlation between road and wind-tunnel   results often attributed to the lack of tunnel turbulence. The work presented   herein involves road and wind-tunnel tests to investigate these discrepancies and   aims to improve the accuracy of wind-tunnel modelling for commercial vehicles.   Wind-tunnel and on-road tests which determine drag coefficient reductions from   aerodynamic devices fitted to commercial vehicles are described. Two series of   road tests utilised pairs of commercial vehicles: International Harvester Australia   low-forward-entry articulated vehicles with maximum road-legal size containers   and Isuzu rigid (box-van) vehicles fitted with cuboid containers. Drag   coefficient reductions were calculated from fuel meter readings in the trucks and   measurements of yaw angle and relative velocity from an instrumented chase car.   Tunnel testing was performed on scale vehicles in the Royal Melbourne Institute   of Technology (RMIT) Industrial Wind Tunnel in relatively smooth flow   (longitudinal intensity = 1.7%). Large differences between road and tunnel drag   coefficients at high yaw angles were found.   The on-road turbulent wind environment was measured utilising a vehcle   instrumented with mast-mounted cross-wire and propeller-vane anemometers.   Atmospheric mean wind speeds of 1 m/s to 9 m/s, aligned at various angles to   .the road direction, were encountered and data were taken with the vehicle   stationary and moving at 27.8 m/s (100 km/h). Longitudinal and lateral   intensities and spectra were calculated thus providing new information on the   wind environment for vehicles. A mathematical model of the turbulence   intensities perceived by a moving vehicle was developed. This utilised   atmospheric wind data obtained whilst the vehicle was stationary to predict   moving vehicle data. Measured and predicted intensities for the moving vehicle   were in good agreement for roads with no local roadside obstructions (eg. trees)   thus validating the model, but the obstructions increased data scatter and augmented the lateral intensities by typically 30%) with little change in the   longitudinal intensities. Peaks in the longitudinal and lateral spectra for the   moving vehicle were at approximately 1.0 Hz and most of the energy was   contained between 0.1 Hz and 10 Hz.   Subsequent tunnel tests were performed using five levels of grid-generated   turbulence and the mathematical model was used to predict the on-road data   from tunnel tests. Better agreement was found at high yaw angles when the   correct longitudinal intensities were used. However the scales of turbulence in   the tunnel were too short for correct modelling. Flow visualisation studies over   the model and full-size cab roofs indicated differences in flow patterns that were   attributed to Reynolds number differences.   The mathematical model and measurements described in this thesis showed that   high yaw giigles are always accompanied by relatively high turbulence intensities   and it was concluded that the modelling of turbulence characteristics for   commercial vehicles is more important than other modelling parameters such as   a moving ground. Most major vehicle aerodynamics tunnels have very low   turbulence levels (longitudinal rms intensities commonly less than 0.5%) whereas measured on-road values of 2% to 5% are typical (with higher values of lateral   intensities). It is therefore recommended that for vehicle aerodynamic generally   more attention be paid to correctly modelling the intensities and scales of   turbulence in wind tunnels and understanding the effects of typical turbulence   characteristics on vehicle drag.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aerodynamics</field><field name="subject">vehicle</field><field name="subject">drag</field><field name="subject">wind</field><field name="subject">truck</field><field name="subject">turbulent</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20061016.122635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Research training and national innovation systems in Australia, Finland and the United States: a policy and systems study supported by 30 case studies of research students in the fields of geospatial science, wireless communication, biosciences, and materials science and engineering.</field><field name="creator">Haukka, Sandra</field><field name="description">Reforms to the national research and research training system by the Commonwealth Government of   Australia sought to effectively connect research conducted in universities to Australia's national   innovation system. Research training has a key role in ensuring an adequate supply of highly skilled people   for the national innovation system. During their studies, research students produce and disseminate a   massive amount of new knowledge.   Prior to this study, there was no research that examined the contribution of research training to Australia's   national innovation system despite the existence of policy initiatives aiming to enhance this contribution.   Given Australia's below average (but improving) innovation performance compared to other OECD   countries, the inclusion of Finland and the United States provided further insights into the key research   question. This study examined three obvious ways that research training contributes to the national   innovation systems in the three countries: the international mobility and migration of research students   and graduates, knowledge production and distribution by research students, and the impact of research   training as advanced human capital formation on economic growth.   Findings have informed the concept of a research training culture of innovation that aims to enhance the   contribution of research training to Australia's national innovation system. Key features include   internationally competitive research and research training environments; research training programs that   equip students with economically-relevant knowledge and the capabilities required by employers operating   in knowledge-based economies; attractive research careers in different sectors; a national commitment to   R&amp;D as indicated by high levels of gross and business R&amp;D expenditure; high private and social rates of   return from research training; and the horizontal coordination of key organisations that create policy for,   and/or invest in research training.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">research training</field><field name="subject">research careers</field><field name="subject">innovation</field><field name="subject">national innovation systems</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20061109.120913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CFD analysis of air flow interactions in vehicle platoons.</field><field name="creator">Rajamani, Gokul Krishnan</field><field name="description">The increasing use of Intelligent Transport System (ITS) can enable very close   vehicle spacings which generally results in a net drag reduction for the resulting   convoys. The majority of vehicle development has, to date, been for vehicles in   isolation, thus the study of interaction effects is becoming increasingly important.   The main objective of this research is to investigate the use of Computational   Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for understanding convoy aerodynamics and to further the   understanding of airflow interaction between vehicles via CFD.   In this study, time-averaged characteristics of a simplified, generic passenger   vehicle, called the Ahmed car model, after Ahmed et.al (1984) is investigated   computationally using the available commercial CFD code, Fluent version 6.1.22.   Three different platoon combinations were analysed for the current study which   includes a two, three and six model platoons for various rear end configurations of the   Ahmed model geometry.   Experiments were conducted in RMIT University Industrial Wind Tunnel for   analysing the effects of drafting on drag coefficients using two different scales of   Ahmed car models. This is an extension to the previous study performed on two   100% scales of Ahmed models (Vino and Watkins, 2004) and the results for both the   current and previous experiments were compared using CFD. The CFD proved to be a   useful technique since its results compared reasonably well for both the current and   the previous experiments on drafting, using Ahmed models of identical (30&#176;) rear   slant configurations. However, near critical rear slant angles (~30&#176;) for isolated   vehicles some discrepancies were noted.   The reasonable validation of experimental results enabled the study to be   extended further computationally using CFD, to analyse the effects of inter-vehicle   spacing on a platoon of 3 and 6 models for various rear end configurations (between   0&#176; and 40&#176;), in an attempt to provide useful information on vehicle-wake interaction   for the Future Generation Intelligent Transport System (FGITS).   Critical gaps were identified via CFD for the case of a two, three and six   model platoons and the simulations clearly exposed the reasons for these critical gaps.   At extremely close proximity, the models experienced more pressure recovery at their   rear vertical base, which reduced the drag coefficient. Surprisingly, at some of the   close vehicle spacings, the drag coefficients reached values that were higher than that   of a vehicle in isolation. This was found due to the high momentum flow   impingement to the fore body of the model and was similar to results found in   physical experiments.   Thus the current CFD analysis revealed that rear slant angle of the model and   the inter-vehicle spacing greatly influences the wake structures and ultimately the   vehicles aerodynamic drag coefficients in platoons.   Even though the current CFD model (Realizable k-B turbulence model) predicted the basic flow structures such as the C-pillar vortices from the rear slant and   2D horse shoe vortices in the model's vertical rear base, the separation bubble on the   rear slant that supplies energy to the strong C-pillar vortices was not replicated   accurately, which is evidenced from the flow structure analysis. Hence it is   recommended for further work, that the study should be extended using the Reynold's   stress models or the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence models for flow   structure observation and analysing vortex interactions between the models.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">future generation intelligent transport system</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">airflow</field><field name="subject">vortex interactions</field><field name="subject">large eddy simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20061114.122130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy making and the Ministerial Review of Postcompulsory Education Pathways in Victoria 2000-2004.</field><field name="creator">Montague, Alan John</field><field name="description">In January 2000 the Victorian government established a 'Ministerial Review of Postcompulsory   Education Pathways in Victoria'.

Today, the concept of sustainable development has   not been fully operationalised into plans; market and political forces still play a predominant   role in planning practice. Nevertheless, some authors believe that the concept of sustainable   development has reinvigorated planning. For example, there is an extensive literature on this   topic within planning theory, although in practice, sustainable development has been difficult   to implement.   This thesis after acknowledging the relevance of economy and politics, provides an   alternative approach to operationalise sustainable development in plans through a technical perspective. This perspective is based on the examination, from literature, of several   techniques which deal with sustainable development.

Many of these activities have been identified.   However, we still lack a clear understanding of the causal relationships between human   activities and the pressures they place on the environment and biodiversity. We need to   know how ecosystems and individual species respond to changes in human activities and   therefore how best to moderate our actions and reduce the rate of loss of biodiversity. One   of the ways to detect these changes is to use indicators of ecosystem conditions.   Indicators are statistics following changes in a particular factor usually over time. These   indicators are used to summarise a complex set of data, and are seen as being   representative of the wider situation in that field. So it can be assumed that if that particular   factor is declining or improving, then the situation in general is also declining or improving.   They are used to check the status and trends of biodiversity by both the public and policy   makers. Indicators are also used to assess national performance and can be used to   identify the actions required at the policy level. In this manner, they provide an important   link between policy-makers and scientists collecting the data.   The current thesis investigates the possibility of using bird species as indicators of   biodiversity for better management of natural terrestrial ecosystems, by identifying their   habitats according to various environmental factors. The study is established by drawing   upon three main scientific areas: ecology, geographical information system (GIS), and   statistical modelling.   The Mornington Peninsula and Western Port Biosphere Reserve (MPWPBR) (Victoria,   Australia) was chosen for the study area because of the combination of suburban and   natural environments that made it optimum for this type of study. Once the study area was   defined, the necessary data for the research were obtained from various sources.   Birds Australia provided data on recorded observation of 271 bird species within the study   area. Based on the nature of this study, seven species were selected for the study. The   criteria for this selection are discussed in Chapter 3. Most literature state that the primary   determinant for bird abundance is vegetation and land cover. Because of this, Ecological   Vegetation Class (EVC) layer was used to determine which type(s) of vegetation have the   greatest impact on habitat selection. Each species showed a relationship to a number of   v   vegetation types. These EVCs were combined to produce vegetation patches, and were   considered as potentially suitable habitats of corresponding bird species.   For each of the species, these habitat patches were analysed for the different aspects of   patch characteristics (such as the level of patchiness, connectivity, size, shape, weighted   distance between patches, etc.) by using the Landscape Context Tool (a GIS add-on).   This process assisted the understanding of the importance of patch quality in habitat   selection among different bird species by analysing the location of bird observation sites   relative to habitat patches. In this way, the association between bird presence and the   conditions of a habitat patch was identified by performing a discriminant function analysis.   To investigate the probability of a species presence according to different environmental   factors, a model of species distribution was created. Binary logistic regression was used to   indicate the level of effect of each variable. The model was then successfully validated in   the field.   To define the indicators of environmental factors, it was essential to separate bird species   based on their dependency on one or more of the studied variables. For this purpose,   One-Way ANOVA was used. This analysis showed that some bird species can be   considered as indicators of urban areas, while others could be good indicators of wellpreserved   large forests.   Finally, it must be mentioned that the type and quality of the datasets are crucial to this   type of study, because some species have a higher degree of sensitivity to certain types of   vegetation or land cover. Therefore, the vegetation data must be produced as detailed as   possible. At the same time, the species data needs to be collected based on the presence   and absence (versus presence-only) of the birds.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Habitat suitability model</field><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="subject">ecological vegetation classes</field><field name="subject">Mornington Peninsula</field><field name="subject">habitat predictive model</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20061116.161912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the effects of external stresses on protein conformation.</field><field name="creator">Budi, Bunarta Hendra (Akin)</field><field name="description">The use of electromagnetic devices such as microwave ovens and mobile phones has certainly brought convenience to our lives. At the same time, the proliferation of said devices has increased public awareness of the potential health hazards. It is generally assumed that there is little or no risk associated with the use of electromagnetic devices, based on the small amount of power associated with those devices. However, case studies on animals indicate that the risk cannot be entirely ruled out.      It has long been known that proteins are sensitive to stress, arising from various sources such as temperature, chemical, pressure, and changes in pH condition. In all of these cases, the protein exhibits clear signs of damage and distress, which range from slight unfolding to complete loss of structure. Frequently, the damage to the protein is alleviated by refolding, either by itself or by the aid of molecular chaperones. However, if the damage to the protein is too great, the protein will generally undergo proteolysis.      Opinion has been divided over the implication of prolonged use of electromagnetic devices to human health. Studies conducted on animals so far have given conflicting results. The studies on the separate components, electric and magnetic fields, also give inconclusive results. This indicates that our understanding on how electric and magnetic fields interact with biological matter is incomplete.      In this project, we use molecular dynamics to explore the behaviour of two forms of insulin chain-B, isolated and monomeric (in the presence of chain-A with all disulfide bonds intact), at ambient conditions and under the influence of various stress. Specifically, we focus our attention to thermal stress and electric field stress. The electric field stress considered in this study takes several forms: static and oscillating with three different frequencies. These fields have strength ranging from 1806 V/m to 109 V/m.      By performing molecular dynamics simulations totalling over 500 ns, we have gained valuable insights into the effects of elevated temperature and electric field on insulin chain-B. We observed differences in the damage mechanisms by the application of static electric field and oscillating field. The application of static fields restricts the conformational freedom of a protein, whereas the application of oscillating fields increases the mobility and flexibility of the protein, similar to the effect of thermal stress. Both of these interfere with the normal behaviour of a protein. We have also observed frequency-dependent effects, with low frequency fields having static field-like characteristics in damage mechanism.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Molecular dynamics</field><field name="subject">stress response</field><field name="subject">insulin chain-B</field><field name="subject">protein simulation</field><field name="subject">protein conformation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20061116.123431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the invasion dynamics of Asparagus asparagoides at the habitat level using spatial analytical techniques.</field><field name="creator">Siderov, Kris</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on research that examines the early stage invasion process of Asparagus   asparagoides (L.) W. Wight (bridal creeper), primarily a bird-dispersed weed, in a remnant   vegetation patch. The study site is on Phillip Island, approximately 100 kilometres south east   of Melbourne, Victoria. Asparagus asparagoides invasion of the remnant vegetation reserve   is a relatively recent phenomenon.   Landscape elements that affect bird dispersal and vegetation types that affect seedling   establishment may be important factors that limit or enhance the spread of A. asparagoides. A   systematic sampling strategy was adopted and data collected for a variety of landscape and   vegetative variables including cover and abundance of A. asparagoides and the data were   presented in a Geographic Information System (GIS).   Preliminary results show that the distribution of A. asparagoides within a remnant vegetation   patch is not random. It appears to have entered the reserve from two boundaries, spreading   toward the centre, which to date remains sparsely colonised despite the capacity of this weed   to spread rapidly over long distances by birds. A number of other outcomes are noted.   Asparagus asparagoides establishment is prevented in pasture where sheep and cattle graze,   and paddocks subjected to tillage practices. The exclusion of grazing in fenced off vegetation   in pastures demonstrates rapid weed establishment and colonisation several hundred metres   from main infestation.   Field observation and visual inspection of temporal progress of invasion (using above ground   weed density with tuber appearance to infer age) appear to suggest that invasion into remnant   is associated with the track network. This age/density assumption is strengthened when spatial   distribution is examined using a data set where low-density values for A. asparagoides are   removed and compared with a data set using all A. asparagoides density values. The mapping   of A. asparagoides in fenced off farm remnants suggests that velocity of spread at 191m/yr is   a considerable underestimate. Subsequent analysis shows that the spatial distribution of A.   asparagoides is not completely spatially random while intensity surface analysis highlights   regions of low and high intensity located near track network. Mapping a density surface   within GIS provided confirmatory evidence for the establishment of satellite clusters along   the track network. The change in the intensity surface observed using the two data sets (lowdensity   values and all density values) is also consistent with an expanding invasion occurring   between two time periods. Spatial point pattern analysis using K-function statistics shows that   xxii   the clustering observed using GIS appears to be occurring at two scales or distances (130m-   160m and 195m-205m).   The association between tracks and the invasion process observed in the initial stages of the   study is examined. There is a change in density as a function of distance from a track where   the density of A. asparagoides appears to reduce the further away from the track a site is and   this relationship holds regardless of track width.   The final stages of the study look at the development of a predictive model. Visual   exploration of the data through mapping in a GIS and field observation made during data   collection provide the starting point for the development of logistic models to estimate the   probability of A. asparagoides presence. Finally the best overall logistic model is applied to a   second independent site to determine the general applicability of the model. A number of   variables that impact on the presence of A. asparagoides, particularly during the initial stages   of the invasion process, are identified. While all the identified variables and the overall model   are statistically significant, the model is found to correctly predict presence/absence in only   67% of cases overall. The model however could be expected to correctly predict the presence   of A. asparagoides in 74% of cases and has a false positive rate of 40%. The model is applied   at a second independent site and found to have an overall percent correct rate of 80% and   correctly predicted A. asparagoides presence in 94% of cases. The variables identified as   influential in the early stage of invasion are relatively easy to acquire by simple field survey   that does not require specialist skills. When considering the model as a tool for the   management of remnant vegetation communities, high false positive rates may lead to limited   resources being spent on searching sites where there is no weed. However, a high false   negative rate would have a larger impact on the management of the weed since the undetected   infestations would form sources for new propagules. The model performs well from this point of view in that it provided low false negative rates at both sites.   The value of the predictive model is its ability to provide managers with information regarding specific areas to target for weed eradication and management can use the model to assess the effectiveness of any control measures by going back to obtain new cover density data, then using the model to examine the changes over time. The model also provides a starting point for the development of a generic model of A. asparagoides invasion at sites outside of Phillip Island and could also provide the starting point for developing models that   could be used for other bird-dispersed fleshy-fruited weed species.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asparagus asparagoides</field><field name="subject">bridal creeper</field><field name="subject">weed invasion</field><field name="subject">spatial analysis</field><field name="subject">remnant vegetation</field><field name="subject">bird-dispersed weed</field><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="subject">logisitic regression</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20061010.095929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Business planning by small owner managed enterprises in the Victorian forestry sector.</field><field name="creator">Shepherd, Peter James</field><field name="description">Planning by owner-managers of small business has not received the attention from researchers a sector of such importance deserves.

The study, with action research as the chosen methodology, and used both quantitative and qualitative methodology, was divided into two phases. The first phase of data collection aimed to inform the researcher of the needs of the MRS profession. The second phase of the study involved the design and development of an educational framework for CPD, based on current theories of learning and teaching using the framework and data collected from the first phase of the study, an online module was developed. The objectives of the module were to increase participants' knowledge in breast planning in radiation therapy by assisting participants to engage in reflective practice. The cyclical process of action research was used to pilot the module twice with two groups of volunteer radiation therapists.   The online module was evaluated using Kirkpatrick's four level evaluation model (Kirkpatrick, 1998; Guskey, 2000). Based on Boud et al.'s reflection model (1985), all participants showed evidence of action, affective and perspective outcomes. They also demonstrated successful development of lifelong learning attributes, were empowered and their learning had a positive impact in their workplace. They began to assume a more proactive role and increased clinical responsibilities, engaging colleagues in collaborative reflections and adopting evidence-based approaches in advancing workplace practices.   The study shows that it is possible to assist MRS practitioners to engage in reflective practice within a CPD educational framework online. The study also shows the importance of reflective practice, lifelong learning and transformative learning in CPD. Reflective practice liberates and empowers participants, lifelong learning equips them to continue learning and transformative learning facilitates perspective transformation. Thus, an effective educational framework is one that adopts a holistic approach towards CPD, by incorporating reflective practice, lifelong learning and transformative learning. The educational framework adopted in the present study may be extrapolated to CPD programs in other MRS disciplines and other healthcare professions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">continuing professional development</field><field name="subject">medical radiation science</field><field name="subject">online learning</field><field name="subject">reflective practice</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">educational framework</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20061201.102703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systems approach to model the conceptual design process of vertical take-off unmanned aerial vehicle.</field><field name="creator">Rathore, Ankush</field><field name="description">The development and induction in-service of Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV) systems in a   variety of civil, paramilitary and military roles have proven valuable on high-risk missions.

It investigates the conventional helicopter design methodology for application in   UAV design. It further develops a modified design process for VTUAV addressing the   requirements of unmanned missions by providing remote command-and-control capabilities.   The modified design methodology is automated to address the complex design evaluations   and optimisation process.   An illustration of the automated design process developed for VTUAVs is provided through a   series of inputs of the requirements and specifications, resulting in an output of a proposed VTUAV design configuration for</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">VTUAV</field><field name="subject">Rotary-wing UAV</field><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">Automation</field><field name="subject">Design Decision Support System</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20061114.103443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The diversification benefits and the risk and return relationships in the Chinese A-share market.</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yue Nan</field><field name="description">China's rapid economic growth and the development of its domestic stock market have attracted considerable attention from foreign investors. China's economic financial expansion, however, has emerged from an environment of state planning and radical socialist ideology. With a view of providing investors with a better understanding of the risk and return relationship in the Chinese A-share market over the past decade, this thesis adapts several empirical models to the circumstances in China and conducts four empirical analyses.            First, in order to rationalize foreign investors' entry into the A-share market, the thesis compares the diversification benefits in three China-related stock markets, namely the A-share, the B-share and the H-share markets in a mean-variance framework using daily, weekly and monthly data respectively. The results suggest that of the three stock markets, the B-share market generates the highest average annual returns while the A-share market has the most significant diversification benefits regardless of whether the analysis is undertaken implementing a traditional mean-variance framework or a downside risk framework.            Next, an empirical analysis using the Fama and MacBeth two-pass procedure is undertaken to test the relationship between beta, firm factors and stock returns. Similar to the findings in other stock markets, the results of this analysis show that the static betas for individual stocks fail to capture variation in stock returns in the A-share market. In contrast, the effects of book-to-market and trading volume are significant in the sample period. However, the fact that none of these factors have a persistent role in explaining stock returns suggests a possible change in the investment philosophy of Chinese domestic investors over the past decade. In the third analysis, two global betas are incorporated into the cross-sectional regressions in a bid to examine the integration or segmentation of the A-share market with the world and Hong Kong stock markets. Specifically, both time-varying betas and static betas are used in the analysis. The results suggest that there is no beta effect and the A-share marke t is totally segmented from both the world and Hong Kong stock markets.            Finally, when the segmentation and integration status of the A-share market is further examined using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation framework without beta estimation and the assumption of a linear relationship between beta and stock returns, the findings suggest that the A-share market is becoming increasing integrated with the B-share and the Hong Kong stock markets.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese A-share Market</field><field name="subject">B-share Market</field><field name="subject">H-share Market</field><field name="subject">Cross-sectional Regression</field><field name="subject">CAPM</field><field name="subject">Integration</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20061205.103325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cross cultural leadership.</field><field name="creator">Grisham, Tom</field><field name="description">Global markets are increasingly taking advantage of the strength and economic advantages of a diverse global workforce. It is common on international projects to find multi-cultural teams located in multiple countries. It is also common to find such projects led by Project Managers who come from many different countries. So having a person raised in India managing a project in China, with a design team in the USA, procurement procurement teams in Japan and Mexico, and a drafting team in Albania is not unusual. Even in historically monolithic markets like the USA, it is far more common to have mulit-cultural teams and foreign competition. In addition, the pressure on the industry to increase productivity and reduce costs is unrelenting. This leads to flatter project structures, and the need for leadership at multiple levels.   My experience in such markets, and the glaring need for a Cross-Cultural Leadership model that could be used to improve leadership skills in international markets were the reasons for undertaking this thesis. The hypothesis of this thesis is that there are of cross-cultural leadership dimensions that are effective and essential, regardless of culture. Those dimensions are Trust, Empathy, Transformation, Power, and Communication.   The thesis first explores the cultural and leadership aspects of Cross-Cultural Leadership through a review of the published literature. The literature research was then subjected to an exegetical review of the themes that emerged, and used to construct the Descriptors, and Sub-Descriptors for each of the leadership dimensions.   The thesis also explored the transfer of cultural knowledge with metaphors and storytelling. In a fast paced business environment, developing a richer understanding and sensitivity to other coulters, in general and specific, is a skill that Leaders must possess.   Lastly, the thesis explored the connections between conflict management and Cross-Cultural Leadership. Conflict management skills are becoming ever more important due to the rapid changes that are common in the current business environment. Change, cultural mis-information, scarce resources, poor communication skills, contractual ambiguity and complexity are but a few of the reasons that managing conflict is a critical skill for leaders.   IV   The design of the testing protocols was bifurcated. One track evaluated the hypothesis, the other track evaluated the connection between the Leadership Dimensions hypothesized, and the GLOBE survey. The GLOBE survey was utilized to investigate if a viable connection existed between the Leadership Dimensions and a broad based international survey of cultural dimensions.   The testing of the hypothesis was performed using a Delphi panel of experts in international cross-cultural leadership, through two sessions of questions with feedback after the end of the first session. Subsequently, the results were analyzed, studied, and evaluated with an eye toward my practical experience in the field - sense making.   The results were that the hypothesis was confirmed, and the connection to the GLOBE Survey cultural dimensions was also confirmed. A model is presented to summarize the findings of the thesis, called the Cross-Cultural Leadership Intelligence (XLQ) Model.   As discussed in the thesis, Project Management has not emphasized leadership in the current body of knowledge (PMBOK), and it only makes general reference to cultural considerations. Recognizing this, The Project Management Institute (PMI) has funded a study that recommends more research in the area of cross-cultural leadership, and a new grant to study the question of how global the PMBOK really is. Both of these issues are addressed by this thesis. The XLQ model provides a framework for assessing and training Project Managers in cross-cultural leadership skills. The model is a global one that can be used across cultures, business models, and markets.   The model also points towards the need for further research into metrics, education, training techniques, and of course, further empirical testing of the model itself.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cross-Cultural Leadership</field><field name="subject">XLQ</field><field name="subject">Metaphor</field><field name="subject">Conflict</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20061116.125205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The characterisation of Australian freshwater fish immune systems and their response to immunomodulators</field><field name="creator">Harford, Andrew James</field><field name="description">The Murray-Darling basin is the largest river system in Australia with significant economic,   social, recreational and cultural value. It supplies water for drinking and agriculture to a large inland area of the eastern and southern states of Australia. It is also the ultimate sink for many environmental contaminants that result from human activities within the catchment.      Aquatic organisms live intimately with their environment and may be continuously exposed   to these contaminants through the water column or the food chain. Some chemicals are   bioaccumulated and biomagnified in tissue to reach high body burdens. Populations of native   fish species within the Murray-Darling basin have been in decline since human settlement, yet   little is known about the lethal and sublethal effects of environmental pollutants on native   freshwater fish and many of the Australian water quality guidelines are based on data from   exotic fish species.      Researchers have correlated levels of pollution with immune dysfunction and an increased   incidence of disease amongst wildlife populations. Many of the pollutants of the Murray-Darling basin have known immunotoxicity in both mammals and exotic fish species. The   immune system is a sensitive target organ because, in order to maintain integrity, it requires constant renewal through the rapid proliferation and differentiation of cells.   Efforts to increase numbers of native fish in the wild have led to an aquaculture industry that   produces fingerlings for the restocking of waterways. In more recent years, this industry has matured and now produces table-size native freshwater fish for local and international   markets. Although the industry has researched areas of reproduction, nutrition and stocking,   there is little understanding of the immunology or immunotoxicology of Australian freshwater   fish. This research project investigated the immunology of three large native fish species (i.e. 2 Murray cod, golden perch and silver perch), which are the basis of the native freshwater aquaculture industry. Additionally, a small fish species native to the basin (i.e. crimsonspotted rainbowfish) was studied as an alternative to the use of large fish. Of the four species, Murray cod possessed characteristics that made it an excellent candidate for ecoimmunotoxicity   testing.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">native Australian freshwater fish</field><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="subject">immunotoxicity</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20060307.171411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parental monitoring of adolescent free time: a theoretical model of parent-adolescent interactions</field><field name="creator">Hayes, Louise</field><field name="description">Parental monitoring is a widely researched hypothetical construct.  Patterson and colleagues (Capaldi &amp; Patterson, 1989; Patterson, Reid, &amp; Dishion, 1992) originally developed the construct in their seminal work with the Oregon Youth Study. Adopting a broad theoretical framework, monitoring was defined as parental awareness of adolescent activities, and communication to the child that the parent is concerned about and aware of adolescent free-time (Dishion &amp; McMahon, 1998). Recent research (Kerr &amp; Stattin, 2000; Kerr, Stattin, &amp; Trost, 1999; Stattin &amp; Kerr, 2000) has proposed a narrower definition, where monitoring is perceived to be parental knowledge of adolescent free-time, which is acquired primarily through adolescent disclosure of their activities. Recent debates have been present in the literature proposing either the multi-dimensional view of monitoring, or the latter uni-dimensional view.    A model of monitoring interactions was developed that is based on social learning and behavioural principles. The process-monitoring model contends that monitoring is an interactive process between parents, their adolescents, and the ecology of the family. In the model it is proposed that monitoring occurs in discrete episodes that change over the course of adolescent development. To explain monitoring interactions, it is essential to consider the sequence of behaviours that occur within a monitoring interaction at two stages, before the adolescent goes out, and also when they return home. Using the process-monitoring model as a framework, this research examined monitoring across four studies.    Study 1 was a qualitative study that explored adolescent perceptions of monitoring interactions. Forty-nine adolescents aged from 12 through to 16 years      (M = 13.2) were interviewed about their monitoring interactions with parents. This study found correspondence between the constructs in the process-monitoring model and adolescent perceptions of monitoring interactions. Two new themes that emerged in this study were parental trust and adolescent deceit. For typically developing adolescents there were marked differences in how adolescents perceive parental monitoring across adolescent development.    Study 2 involved the analysis of data collected as part of a population based self-report survey of 1285 adolescents aged 14 to 15 years. The hypothesised relationship between monitoring behaviours was examined using structured equation modelling. A model with the constructs of rules, supervision, conflict, and adolescent problem behaviour was found to be an adequate fit of the data, accounting for 40% of the variance in problem behaviour. Specifically, lax rules predicted poor supervision and high conflict. High conflict and low supervision were predictors of the adolescent problem behaviour construct, which encompassed conduct problems, rebelliousness, and sensation seeking. Adequate rules appear to form the foundation for better supervision and less conflict, and hence, lower levels of adolescent problem behaviours.   Study 3 involved data collected for the purpose of further testing the process-monitoring model. The associations between parent-adolescent relationship quality, rules, solicitation, disclosure, and tracking were tested using linear path modelling on self-report data from a sample of 210 parents and 202 adolescents aged 11 to 18 years (M = 15.29). Separate statistical models were required for the parent and adolescent data. For the adolescent data the model was an adequate fit, accounting for 27% of the variance in tracking behaviours. In the adolescent model, high rule-setting predicted higher solicitation and tracking, while poor relationship quality predicted lower disclosure and lower tracking. For the parent data, the model was an adequate fit accounting for 34% of the variance in tracking behaviours. In the parent model, high rule-setting predicted higher solicitation, disclosure, and tracking, while poor relationship quality predicted lower disclosure, lower solicitation, and poorer tracking scores. T he tracking construct was found to adequately predict adolescent deviant behaviours including alcohol use, smoking, and deviant peer associations.     Study 4 was an exploratory study. In this study the monitoring scale constructed in Study 3 was examined alongside behavioural observations made whilst conducting an intervention with two families who were experiencing parent-adolescent conflict. Some correspondence was found between parent and adolescent measures of monitoring and conflict and the behaviour seen between parent-adolescent dyads; however, the self-report monitoring measures were only able to reveal substantial problems in monitoring. Problem Solving and Communication Training (Robin &amp; Foster, 1989) showed some improvement in parent-adolescent relationships, as measured by the Issues Checklist (Robin &amp; Foster, 1989) and Conflict Behaviour Questionnaire (Prinz, Foster, Kent, &amp; O'Leary, 1979), but there was no impact on monitoring interactions.    This series of studies supported the claims that monitoring is a multi-dimensional construct, and that it has bi-directional effects. There was support for the existing research, which has shown that poor parental monitoring is consistently associated with adolescent problem behaviour. The process model was found to provide an adequate framework for examining the temporal sequence in monitoring interactions and the evolution of monitoring across the adolescent developmental cycle. At this stage there is little experimental or intervention research showing how families might improve their monitoring. It is argued that behavioural observations and functional analyses of monitoring episodes are needed to provide an understanding of the action-reaction sequence across monitoring episodes.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parental monitoring</field><field name="subject">adolescence</field><field name="subject">parenting</field><field name="subject">adolescent adjustment</field><field name="subject">parent-adolescent relatinships</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20060316.154143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exegesis: Strategy and Learning: a path to organisational change</field><field name="creator">Kenny, John Daniel</field><field name="description">This Exegesis and the Portfolio document referred to herein report on the outcomes of my research towards a PhD in education (by Project) between mid 2001 and July 2005.

Similar studies for the range of differentiated roles that characterise the newly managerialised university are not available. The first stage of the research, therefore, was to develop a categorisation of the ways in which senior managers, line managers, support staff and academic staff construct their identities at work. This categorisation was created by bringing together the experiences of change of fifty three staff from five similar Australian universities, reported in interviews, with a review of the discourses widely available within the university sector (Deetz 1992; du Gay 1996a; Knights &amp; Morgan 1991; Marginson 2000; Readings 1996) to produce thirteen different classifications associated with different roles. These categories described as case study one provide an initial framework for making sense of the different viewpoints expressed by staff in interviews and a language for understanding w hat particular actions might mean to the organisational members making them. As such it provides a starting point or tool for analysis and makes an original contribution to understanding change within universities.   The second stage of this research examined the dynamics of a teaching change project and   the interactions between differently constructed work identities it entailed. This was undertaken through an ethnographic study of a change project in process. The ethnography was supplemented by interviews with participants at the conclusion of the project. The analysis of the ethnography combined the first theoretical focus on constructed identity with concepts of power and their forms within organisations (Foucault 1998; Clegg 1989a; Callon 1986) to take account of the hierarchical organisation of the university and the differentiated organisational roles of participants in the change project.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">constructed work identities</field><field name="subject">university teaching change</field><field name="subject">organisational power relations</field><field name="subject">critical management research</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20060308.102930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical examination of building contracts in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gatley, David</field><field name="description">Toward the end of 1999 and during the early part of 2000, the commercial construction sector in the Auckland area of New Zealand was affected as a result of liquidations of a number of major commercial construction companies.       The aim of the research is to investigate the employment of building contracts, their administration, and into the incidence, nature and resolution of disputes executed during the calendar years of 1999 and 2000. This research was undertaken by surveying 100 commercial and 60 residential projects undertaken in the Auckland region of New Zealand to determine if the problems being experienced by the commercial contractors who were liquidated was incidental and limited to the commercial sector. Projects surveyed ranged in value between NZ$10,000 and NZ$700,000 for residential projects and between NZ$150,000 and NZ$99,000,000 for commercial projects. The literature review identifies, analyses and discusses:      (i)	To what extent are 'standard' forms of building contracts used by the construction industry including who was responsible for the drafting of those contracts?   (ii)	What provision was made in these building contracts for the resolution of disputes?   (iii)	Who was responsible for the independent administration of those building contracts?   (iv)	What was the incidence of disputes that resulted as a consequence of the usage of these building contracts and what was the nature of the disputes and how were they resolved? and    (v)	Would the construction industry in New Zealand benefit from legislation that would require that an independent third party be engaged for the administration of the building contract?      Gaps in the literature of all areas of the research were identified.             The following hypothesis was promoted:   The incidence of disputes is reduced in building contracts that are administered by an independent third party for both commercial and residential sectors of the construction industry in New Zealand.      A statistical analysis of the data collected was used to test the hypothesis as well as to determine whether the appointment of a third party to administer a contract between the client and contractor was of direct benefit and assisted in the avoidance or resolution of disputes. The results provided support for the hypothesis in both the commercial and residential sectors of the construction industry. Additionally, there was also qualitative endorsement for the propositions. The surveys provided evidence about the attitude adopted by those involved in the particular sectors to the independent administration of building contracts. 79% of the building contracts surveyed in the commercial projects were independently administered compared to 42% in the residential sector.       The data was also used to provide positive test results for a proposition known as the 'principle of remotivity' which states that: 'the further the architect (or designer) is from the independent administration of a building contract during its execution, the more likely it is that disputes will arise'.      The research confirmed that the culture of the construction industry in New Zealand; the legislation used to control the industry; and the decisions of local judiciaries in construction related matters are different to those adopted in Australia and the United Kingdom. These variations are not recognised by persons connected to and detached from the construction industry. The dissertation concludes by making 19 (nineteen) suggestions and recommendations.      The research was limited to projects undertaken in Auckland, New Zealand and replication of the study would provide a broader understanding of this area of inquiry and further data to qualify the 'principle of remotivity'.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">building contracts</field><field name="subject">administration</field><field name="subject">disputes</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20050209.150439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Issues in investment risk: a supply-side and demand-side analysis of the Australian managed fund industry.</field><field name="creator">Hallahan, Terrence Anthony</field><field name="description">The investment management industry has proven to be a fertile ground for theoretical and   empirical research over the past forty years, particularly in relation to the nature and   quantification of risk. However, the dominance of the U.S. industry has meant that much of   the academic research has focused on the U.S. market. This thesis investigates aspects of   investment risk using alternative data to that used in much of the prior published research.   This thesis contains an extensive analysis of aspects of risk related to both the demand side   and the supply side of the managed funds market in Australia. Among the demand side   characteristics, attitudes towards risk and their impact on asset allocation decisions will be an   important determinant of investors' financial well-being, particularly in retirement.   Accordingly, the first part of the thesis examines the financial risk tolerance of investors,   exploring the relationship between subjective financial risk tolerance and a range of   demographic characteristics that are widely used as a basis for heuristically derived estimates   of investors' attitudes towards financial risk.   The second part of the thesis contains an analysis of the supply side of the industry, focusing   on risk-shifting behavior by investment fund managers. Since the time when performance and   risk-shifting behavior of fund managers was first put under the spotlight 40 years ago, it is   possible to identify an evolving strand in the research where performance assessment is   examined within the framework of the principal-agent literature. One focus that has emerged   in this literature is the adaption of the tournament model to the analysis of investment   manager behavior, wherein it is hypothesized that fund managers who were interim losers   were likely to increase fund volatility in the latter part of the assessment period to a greater   extent than interim winners.      Against this background, the second part of the thesis examines risk-shifting behavior by   Australian fund managers.

Hemp fibres have been modified by various extraction, swelling, chemical and enzymatic treatments. The morphology and mechanical properties of the modified fibres have been measured. Biopolymer composites have been prepared using the modified fibres and matrices of cellulose acetate butyrate and cellulose solutions derived from hemp.   The first fibre treatment employed was acetone extraction and mercerization. A low pressure acrylonitrile grafting initiated by azo-bis-isobutylonitrile was performed using alkali treated fibre. The AN grafted fibres had no transformation of crystalline structure as observed after mercerization. The mechanical properties performed by a single fibre test method were strongly influenced by the cellulose structure, lateral index of crystallinity, and fraction of grafting. Bioscouring of hemp using pectate lyase (EC 4.2.2.2), Scourzyme L, was performed. Greater enzyme concentration and a longer treatment improved the removal of the low methoxy pectin component. Removal of pectate caused no crystalline transformation in the fibres, except for a slight decline in the X-ray crystalline order index. Smooth surfaces and separated fibres were evidence of successful treatment. The shortening of fibre by grinding and ball-milling was introduced to achieve a desired fibre size. An increase in the milling duration gradual ly destroyed the crystalline structure of the cellulose fibres. An increase in solvent polarity, solvent-fibre ratio, agitation speed and drying rate resulted in the rearrangement of the ball-milled cellulose crystalline structure to a greater order. The thermal degradation behaviour of hemp fibres was investigated by using TGA. The greater activation energy of treated hemp fibre compared with untreated fibre represented an increase in purity and improvement of structural order.    The all hemp cellulose composites were prepared by an introduction of fibres into 12% cellulose N-methyl-morpholine N-oxide (NMMO) solution and water-ethanol regeneration. A broadening of the scattering of the main crystalline plane, (002) and a depression of the maximum degradation temperature of the fibres were observed. These revealed a structural change in the fibres arising from the preparation. The mechanical properties of composites depended on size, surface area, crystallinity and the structural swelling of the fibres. Composites of cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) and modified hemp fibres were prepared. Composites containing pectate lyase enzyme treated fibres showed better mechanical property improvement than untreated and alkali treated fibres respectively.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cellulose fibre</field><field name="subject">hemp</field><field name="subject">mercerization</field><field name="subject">grafting</field><field name="subject">crystallinity</field><field name="subject">pectate lyase</field><field name="subject">scouring</field><field name="subject">ball-milling</field><field name="subject">N-methyl-morpholine N-oxide</field><field name="subject">composite</field><field name="subject">biopolymer</field><field name="subject">mechanical property</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20061222.111612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of Mobile Fading Channels with Fading Mitigation Techniques.</field><field name="creator">Shang, Lei</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to contribute to the developments of wireless communication   systems. The work generally consists of three parts: the first part is a discussion   on general digital communication systems, the second part focuses on   wireless channel modelling and fading mitigation techniques, and in the third   part we discuss the possible application of advanced digital signal processing,   especially time-frequency representation and blind source separation, to wireless   communication systems.   The first part considers general digital communication systems which will   be incorporated in later parts. Today's wireless communication system is a subbranch   of a general digital communication system that employs various techniques   of A/D (Analog to Digital) conversion, source coding, error correction,   coding, modulation, and synchronization, signal detection in noise, channel estimation,   and equalization. We study and develop the digital communication   algorithms to enhance the performance of wireless communication systems.   In the Second Part we focus on wireless channel modelling and fading mitigation   techniques. A modified Jakes' method is developed for Rayleigh fading   channels. We investigate the level-crossing rate (LCR), the average duration   of fades (ADF), the probability density function (PDF), the cumulative   distribution function (CDF) and the autocorrelation functions (ACF) of this   model. The simulated results are verified against the analytical Clarke's channel   model. We also construct frequency-selective geometrical-based hyperbolically   distributed scatterers (GBHDS) for a macro-cell mobile environment with the   proper statistical characteristics. The modified Clarke's model and the GBHDS   model may be readily expanded to a MIMO channel model thus we study the   MIMO fading channel, specifically we model the MIMO channel in the angular   domain.

Such cooling is generally provided by ensuring a sufficient supply of cooling air   to the heated components, hence the aerodynamics in the region of the brake components   is extremely important. The objective of the research was to develop an understanding of   how aerodynamics could be used to improve the cooling of automotive disc brakes.   Two separate sets of wind tunnel experiments were developed. Tests were performed on a   vented disc (rotor) to measure the internal flow through the vents on a rotating vented disc   under various conditions, including an isolated disc in still air, the disc in still air with the   wheel on, the disc in moving air with the wheel on, and an on-road simulation using a &#188;   car. On vehicle tests were also performed in a wind tunnel using a purpose built brake test   rig. These tests measured the thermal performance of different brake discs under various   operating parameters; including constant load braking, and cooling from high temperature   under various speeds, wheels and disc types.   It was found that airflow through vented rotors was significantly reduced during simulated   on-road driving, compared to when measured in isolation, but not particularly affected by   the vehicles speed. In the situations tested, vented discs offered a 40+% improvement in   cooling over an equivalent sized solid rotors. However the research indicates that the   greatest benefit of vented rotors over solid will be in vehicles where air entering the wheel   cavity is limited, such as low drag vehicles. It was also found that the most significant   improvements in brake thermal performance could be achieved by maximising the airflow   into the region of the brake components; including increasing the open area of the wheel,   and increasing the vehicle velocity. Other improvements can be achieved by using a   wheel material with good conductive capability, and increasing the mass of the disc.   Evidence of vortex shedding was also discovered in the airflow at the exit of an internal   vented rotor, any reduction in this flow disturbance should lead to increased airflow with   associated improvements in thermal performance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aerodynamics</field><field name="subject">brake cooling</field><field name="subject">brake testing</field><field name="subject">disc brakes</field><field name="subject">airflow measurements</field><field name="subject">cobra probe</field><field name="subject">wind tunnel testing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070108.121737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Customer Loyalty in Web-based Retailing.</field><field name="creator">Van La, Khanh</field><field name="description">E-commerce is increasingly recognised as an integrated, rather than independent, part of the retail industry. As online competition grows and online marketing activities intensify, the importance of customer loyalty in e-retailing has also taken central stage in marketing research.   This study explores the nature and characteristics of e-loyalty and its direct and indirect antecedents. Drawing from the literature on customer loyalty in the traditional, offline business context, it contends that e-loyalty is determined primarily by the quality of the relationship between an Internet retailer and its customers, and the customers' overall satisfaction with the retailer. Relationship quality, in turn, is influenced by the levels of perceived safety, trust and commitment that customers have in relation to their retailer, while service quality, Web site quality and value perception contribute to overall customer satisfaction in this context. Thus, relationship quality and overall satisfaction mediate the relationship between e-loyalty and its indirect predictors.   To test these relationships, over 500 customers of four Australian Internet retailers were surveyed online. The questionnaire contains 92 indicators that have been either employed in prior research, or newly developed based on existing theory. These indicators were first factor analysed to determine the underlying dimensions of the research constructs. The relationships between these constructs were subsequently tested using structural equation modelling (SEM).    In general, most hypothesised relationships were well supported, suggesting a consistency in the relationships between these constructs across online and offline settings. To this extent, the results indicate that existing offline marketing theories can provide a platform to create a body of knowledge pertinent to Web-based marketing.   The results of the analysis, however, also show that not all hypothesised relationships could be upheld. Also, the findings indicate that the dimensionality of some constructs differs, to varying degrees, from what is reported in prior studies. These suggest that online consumer perception and behaviour are likely to differ, in some way, from those in the offline context, signalling a need for more context-specific research into this domain.   On the whole, the study confirms the existence and benefits of customer loyalty in online retailing. In addition, it identifies four underlying dimensions of e-loyalty. Dimension 1 comprises behaviours commonly cited as the most prominent and beneficial indicators of customer loyalty (such as repurchase behaviour and word-of-mouth communication). Dimension 2 reflects the level of attachment that loyal customers feel towards their retailers. Dimension 3 indicates customer willingness to adjust their consumption patterns in favour of the retailer's range of offerings. The last dimension is related to customer willingness to move beyond a pure buyer-seller relationship, and to engage in partner-like behaviours (e.g., tolerating mistakes and providing feedback).    With regard to relationships between the research constructs, the SEM results confirm that service quality, web site quality, and value perception are major predictors of overall satisfaction, while trust and commitment, but not safety perception, are antecedents of relationship quality. E-loyalty is not found to be significantly affected by overall satisfaction, whereas relationship quality only has a slightly noticeable impact on this construct. The findings thus fail to support the notion that customer satisfaction and relationship quality are two major antecedents of e-loyalty. The results also do not support the speculation that satisfaction and relationship quality are the main mediators of the relationship between e-loyalty and its primary antecedents. On the contrary, e-loyalty is found to be influenced directly by customer commitment, value perception and service quality, and indirectly by Web site quality, safety perception and trust.   With online shopping growing in popularity, insights into the dimensionality of e-loyalty, as well as the factors that engender e-loyalty, can provide a useful framework on which appropriate marketing strategies could be developed to enhance the loyalty of online shoppers. To this extent, findings from this research are meaningful not only for marketing academics but, also, for Internet retailers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">customer loyalty</field><field name="subject">internet retailing</field><field name="subject">consumer behaviour</field><field name="subject">consumer attitude</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070108.150426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dvelopment of a tourist personality inventory to evaluate parameters associated with tourist crime victimization.</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Mervyn Sydney</field><field name="description">#DEFAULT</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality</field><field name="subject">inventory</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">test development</field><field name="subject">crime</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070108.153236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Establishing fundamental theories for internet   atlas realisation with application in the Brazilian primary education system.</field><field name="creator">da Silva Ramos, Cristhiane</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses a research programme that aimed to provide an open standard methodology for publishing Brazilian local primary school atlases on the World Wide Web. It also aims to contribute to the use of computer laboratories provided to Brazilian primary schools by the Brazilian government. Using a local school atlas as the source of information, a Web-based prototype of the School Atlas of Rio Claro (SP) was developed in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). SVG is a vector-based standard for publishing interactive graphics on the Web validated by the Web Consortium. This prototype was tested with a group of Brazilian primary school teachers. The test was conducted with fourteen teachers, all of them were familiar with the paper version of the School Atlas. During weekly meetings, the participants took notes to discuss and reflect about the practices held in school with local maps. The main test carried out with teachers was to prepare a paper activity based  on the atlas content. The idea behind this activity was to foster teachers to leave a passive role as mere users and interact with the product in a more active fashion. In order to enable them to take full advantage of simple digital tools they were briefly trained to capture screen, use image editing software (they were instructed on the use of Paint, an image editing application available in Windows), and to copy text from the atlas. The results demonstrated that the teachers were keen to interact with the product and, although reproducing some common practices of paper atlas use, they revealed a deep interest on the use of the Internet as a medium for education and the prototype itself. A second test was carried out with a group of atlas developers. They were given a time frame of two weeks to develop an SVG-based atlas using the methodology proposed in this research. They completed the task within the time frame proposed however they indicated that more specific training should be desirable; this finding  indicates the need to introduce digital map publishing as a subject to be taught in geosciences undergraduate courses in Brazil. It is believed that open standard methodology proposed here can be applied to other cities also developing local atlases for early geographical education.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">internet cartography</field><field name="subject">cartography for children</field><field name="subject">SVG</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070109.100627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social and cultural realities.</field><field name="creator">Lee, Adam Norman</field><field name="description">This project involves the visual exploration of different social, cultural and spiritual experiences in both the Third World and the West, as a metaphor for the human condition.

We have   examined the influence of various numerical approximations on the   computed geometry and binding energies of a selection of   well-characterised hydrogen bonded systems. It was found that   numerical basis sets provided the efficiency required to study the   large hydrogen bonded dimer anions present in the organophosphonate   system, while also producing accurate geometries and binding   energies. We then calculated the relaxed structures and binding   energies of phenylphosphonic acid dimer in the two arrangements in   which it is present in the bulk crystal. The computed geometries   were in excellent agreement with the experimental structures and the   binding energies were consistent with those found for other ionic   hydrogen bonded systems. Electron density maps were used to gain   insight into the nature of the hydrogen bonding interaction between   phenylphosphonic acid dimers. We also examined the effect of   aromatic ring substituents on the geometry and energetics of the   hydrogen bonding interaction. The nitro-substituted dimer was   predicted to have a stronger binding energy than its unsubstituted   parent while the methyl-substituted dimer was predicted to have a   similar binding energy to its unsubstituted parent. An analysis of   crystal field effects showed that the structure of the   phenylphosphonic acid dimers in the organophosphonates is a complex   product of competing intra- and intermolecular forces and crystal   field effects. Cooperative effects in the organophosphonate system   were also investigated and it was found that the interactions were   mostly one-body (local) in nature.      We have examined the intramolecular charge-transfer interaction   between copper-halogen cations in the organophosphonate materials.   The origin of geometric differences between the Cu(I) starting   material and Cu(II) product cations was attributed to the electronic   configuration of the Cu ion, not crystal field effects. To gain   further insight into the difference in electronic structure between   the starting material and product, we attempted to simulate the   step-by-step dissociation of the [CuI]+ system. Although this   investigation was not successful, we were able to expose some of the   pitfalls of simulating dissociating odd-electron systems. We also   analysed and compared the charge-transfer interaction in the   chloro-, bromo- and iodo-forms of the organophosphonate family. The   charge-transfer interaction was predicted to increase on going from   the chloro- to the iodo-form, consistent with solid-state UV-visible   data.      Finally, we used the highly accurate Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)   method to investigate the hydrogen bonding interaction in water   dimer and to calculate the dissociation energy. The accuracy of the   experimental estimate for the dissociation energy has recently been   questioned and an alternative value has been put forward. Our   results lend support to the validity of the alternative value and   are also in excellent agreement with those from other high-level   calculations. Our results also indicate that QMC techniques are a   promising alternative to traditional wavefunction techniques in   situations where both high accuracy and efficiency are important.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Density Functional Theory</field><field name="subject">molecular materials</field><field name="subject">intermolecular interactions</field><field name="subject">Quantum Monte Carlo</field><field name="subject">water dimer</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070109.161440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of selected enzymes on the   quality and structural attributes of   white salted and yellow alkaline   Asian noodles.</field><field name="creator">Cato, Larisa</field><field name="description">Wheat and wheat products represent a major food staple consumed around the world.   Asian noodles account for the end-use of at least twelve percent of all wheat produced   globally. Whereas there has been extensive research into the role and significance of   enzymes in the utilisation of wheat flour in bread-making, less is known of their role in   Asian noodles. Accordingly, this study has been based on the hypothesis that some   enzymes will have a significant impact on the quality characteristics of at least some   styles of Asian noodle products.   Five enzymes were selected for study: &#225;-amylase, lipase, lipoxygenase, peroxidase and   ascorbic acid oxidase. The focus has been on the processing of white salted and yellow   alkaline styles of Asian noodles and the role of the enzymes in relation to the quality   attributes of these products has been systematically investigated. The quality aspects   encompass colour and colour stability, texture, cooking properties as well as structural   characteristics of the products. As a part of the preliminary phases of the investigation,   procedures for analysis and assessment of flours and noodles have been evaluated. In   particular, for the textural properties of noodles, results were obtained with the TA-XT2   Texture Analyser using both a flat cylinder probe, to measure noodle hardness, and also   a cutting blade measuring noodle firmness. In addition, various approaches were trialled   for sample preparation and presentation in the use of scanning electron microscopy for   the investigation of noodle structure.   In order to measure the activity of the enzymes in flours and noodle products, assay   procedures were set up and validated. These were then used for the analysis of a series   of commercial flours and the levels of activity in each of the flours was relatively low   indicating that they had been milled from wheat which had not been subjected to preharvest   sprouting.   &#225;-Amylase was measured using the Ceralpha method and two different sources of   exogenous &#225;-amylase (bacterial and barley) were added to noodle formulations. In   preliminary experiments various levels of &#225;-amylase incorporation were compared and   Abstract   viii   the impact on texture measured. Both sources of &#225;-amylase resulted in softer noodle   products. Adverse effects of the preparations on colour were observed in fresh noodles,   although the differences were less obvious when noodles were cooked or dried   immediately after preparation. Cooking losses were higher in noodles incorporating   amylase, particularly the bacterial preparation. These impacts were reflected in changes   in the appearance of starch granules in scanning electron micrographs of the noodles.   Three different lipase preparations were studied and their incorporation had only minor   effects on texture of noodles. Addition of wheat germ lipase resulted in slightly softer   noodles, fungal lipase caused slightly harder noodles, while addition of porcine   pancreas lipase gave harder noodles in the raw state and softer noodles after cooking.   Similarly variable results were observed when colour and colour stability were   evaluated, and there were no adverse effects upon cooking quality of Asian noodles.   Two different preparations of horseradish peroxidase were investigated and both   resulted in adverse effects on colour including at all stages of storage. One of the   preparations resulted in softer noodles when texture was measured using the cylinder   method and in firmer noodles when the blade attachment was applied. Neither the   surface appearance of noodles nor the cooking properties were altered by the addition of   peroxidase to the formulations.   Different levels of addition of ascorbic acid oxidase from Cucurbita species showed   only minor effects on characteristics for both styles of noodles. Incorporation of this   enzyme resulted in lower lightness values but there was little effect on yellowness.   Discolouration of noodle sheets was faster and more obvious at 25&#176;C and compared to   the storage of noodles at 4&#176;C. The cooking qualities of noodles did not change upon   addition of the oxidase.   Activity of the enzyme lipoxygenase was measured spectrophotometrically using   linoleic acid as substrate. Upon addition to the noodle formulations the enzyme   preparation from soy bean resulted in slightly harder and firmer noodles. Colour and   colour stability were not enhanced by the addition of lipoxygenase and significantly   higher yellowness values were measured in some samples. This enzyme did not   adversely impact upon the cooking or structural properties of either style of noodles.   Abstract   ix   Some of the enzymes studied here demonstrated undesirable impacts on one or another   aspect of noodle quality, particularly producing darkening or soft textural   characteristics. Enzymes that might usefully be considered at lower levels of addition   are ascorbic acid oxidase, porcine pancreas lipase and lipoxygenase. These three had no   negative effects upon texture, structure or cooking quality of noodles. Visually the   colour properties were not adversely impacted and instrumental assessment indicated   brighter noodle sheet colours. At lower levels of addition, these three enzymes provide   enhancement of noodle quality. On the other hand peroxidase, the two amylases and   lipases affected the colour and colour stability of noodles. It was observed that the   amylase preparations did result in pronounced softening of noodles. However, the data   indicate that the adverse impact attributed to this enzyme when flour from sprouted   wheat is used in noodle processing, are probably due to enzyme activities other than a-   amylase.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asian noodles</field><field name="subject">noodle quality</field><field name="subject">wheat sprouting</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070111.123042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Mechanical Properties and Failure Mechanisms of Z-Pinned Composites.</field><field name="creator">Chang, Paul</field><field name="description">Z-pinning is a through-thickness reinforcement technology for polymer composite materials that has been developed and commercialised over the past fifteen years.  The through-thickness reinforcement of composites with thin metallic or fibrous pins aids in suppressing delamination, improving impact damage tolerance and increasing joint strength.  Z-pins are applied to the composite part during its manufacture. Pins are embedded within sheets of foam and placed over the unconsolidated part. Subsequently, the foam is compacted and the pins transferred into the part, which is usually an uncured prepreg. In this manner, large numbers of pins can be inserted quickly and easily. The pinned composite is then cured using conventional processes.  The use of z-pins is currently limited to several high performance composite structures, most notably Formula One racing cars and F/A-18 E/F (Superhornet) fighter aircraft, although the technology has potential applications in a d iverse variety of aerospace and non-aerospace composite structures.  A limited understanding of the mechanical performance of z-pinned parts under high load and fatigue loading conditions currently hinders the application of z-pinned composites.        The aim of this PhD project is to investigate the mechanical properties, strengthening mechanics and failure mechanisms of z-pinned carbon/epoxy laminates and joints. The effect of z-pin reinforcement on the tensile and flexural properties of laminates under monotonic and fatigue loading is studied. The sensitivity of these properties to the volume content and diameter of the z-pins is systematically studied by experimentation and analytical modelling.  This PhD also evaluates the efficacy of z-pins in improving the load-bearing properties of carbon/epoxy lap joints. Improvements to the room temperature and elevated temperature properties of z-pinned lap joints under monotonic and fatigue tensile loading were determined. The effect of strain rate on the load-bearing properties of z-pinned lap joints was also evaluated.  A further aim of the PhD project was to assess the z-pin manufacturing process and the microstructural damage caused by that process. The outcome of this study augments the analysis of the me chanical properties of z-pinned laminates and joints.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">composite</field><field name="subject">reinforcement</field><field name="subject">through-thickness</field><field name="subject">z-pin</field><field name="subject">z-fiber</field><field name="subject">tension</field><field name="subject">fatigue</field><field name="subject">cyclic</field><field name="subject">lap joints</field><field name="subject">flexure</field><field name="subject">microstructure</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070111.145714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A mapping approach to investigating Information and Communication Technology implementation during the building design process.</field><field name="creator">Choong, Yi Li</field><field name="description">Building design is a complex process that involves multi-disciplinary professionals working   together throughout the multi-processes of a project.

The   crimes included murder, accessory to murder after the fact, manslaughter, child   sexual and physical assaults, grievous bodily harm, stalking and threats to kill. The   narratives of the seven women form the central focus of the study and these stories   contribute to our understanding of the lives of individual women who perpetrate   violence. I also include the narratives of one hundred and twenty workers, analyse   relevant sentencing comments, and draw on key insights from other research.   I began the study believing that I would discover a single truth as to why women hurt   other people. My original hypothesis was that women perpetrate violence because of   their previous experiences of violence perpetrated by men and/or disadvantage due   to structural oppression. In part this assumption has been borne out, with all of the   women who participated in the study disclosing that they have been victims of   serious violence as both children and adults. However, during the course of the   study, I discovered that women's lives and their choices to perpetrate or participate in   violent crimes are more complex and contradictory than my simple original   hypothesis suggested. I found that the women whom I interviewed and the women   whom the workers worked with, were active agents in their own lives, they made   choices and engaged in activities that met some of their own needs. Sometimes   these choices meant another person suffered extreme pain, injury or death.   I came to the conclusion that all of us have the potential to seriously assault others.   Drawing on a feminist analysis of male violence, I believe that women's, like men's,   violence is also 'individually willed' and 'socially constructed' (Dankwort and Rausch,   2000: 937). I locate women's behaviour in an analytical framework that views   violence as a deeply embedded part of our shared ideology, beliefs and social   activities. This social fabric contributes to, and fundamentally influences, the choices   of individual women who perpetrate violence. The familial, social, cultural and   individual factors that contribute to women choosing to perpetrate violence against   others are complex and challenging. The study critically examines these factors and   describes how different factors intersect with each other.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">violence</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">power relations</field><field name="subject">feminist theory</field><field name="subject">violent crime</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070112.093740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vaccination Strategies for the Prevention of   Swine Dysentery.</field><field name="creator">Holden, James Anthony</field><field name="description">The SmpA outer membrane lipoprotein of B. hyodysenteriae has several characteristics that indicate the potential to protect against swine dysentery (SD). It localises to the outer membrane and antibodies directed against SmpA can prevent the growth of B. hyodysenteriae in vitro. There is some variation observed in the distribution and expression of the SmpA lipoprotein, suggesting that vaccination with SmpA may not provide protection against challenge with a heterologous B. hyodysenteriae strain.   This study has characterised the variation at the smpA locus, and in the process has identified a novel gene, smpB. There is very low similarity between smpB and smpA, with the exception of an identical lipoprotein signal sequence. This suggests that SmpB may be translocated to the outer membrane of B. hyodysenteriae in a similar fashion to SmpA. The results described in this thesis indicate that strains of B. hyodysenteriae harbour either smpA or smpB, but not both, explaining the earlier results of Turner et al. (1991). The presumed outer membrane location of SmpB lead to further investigations into its potential to protect mice from infection with B. hyodysenteriae.   Swine Dysentery is a inflammatory disease of the swine colon. Therefore it is believed that a mucosal immune response may provide increased protection against challenge. In this study, vaccination of mice with recombinant SmpB elicited high levels of serum antibodies, induced the production of Interleukin-4 producing T lymphocytes and decreased the observed histological effects after challenge with virulent B. hyodysenteriae. In efforts to increase the protected conferred by vaccination with SmpB, recombinant Salmonella typhimurium STM-1 vaccines were created to express SmpB or deliver DNA vaccines encoding SmpB. Vaccination with these recombinant Salmonella vectors did not induce a measurable SmpB specific immune response. Macrophage survival and plasmid stability studies indicated that this was due to instability of the expression plasmids in STM-1. Although SmpB will only ever protect against strains of B. hyodysenteriae harbouring smpB,   these results indicate that with further research, SmpB (and SmpA) may contribute to protection from SD.   Toxin production is an important aspect of the pathogenesis of many pathogenic bacteria. Vaccination with attenuated toxins is commonly used to prevent disease. In this study, the B. hyodysenteriae &#226;-haemolysin HlyA was used to vaccinate mice to determine the protection induced after challenge. Vaccination of mice with recombinant HlyA induced significant levels of serum antibodies and lowered the observed pathological effects after challenge of vaccinated mice with virulent B. hyodysenteriae. In an attempt to increase the mucosal immune response and therefore the protection afforded after vaccination with HlyA, recombinant S. typhimurium STM-1 strains were created to express HlyA or deliver DNA vaccines encoding HlyA. Similar to the recombinant STM-1 vaccines expressing SmpB, a HlyA specific immune response was not observed by ELISA or ELISPOT analysis. Plasmid stability trials revealed that the inability to induce a detectable HlyA specific immune response by recombinant STM-1 vaccination may be due to ins tability of the plasmids.   Outer membrane proteins are often important components of vaccines against bacterial and viral pathogens. Considering the variation observed in the smpA locus in this study resulting in the identification of smpB, further investigation into the distribution and conservation of outer membrane encoding genes in B. hyodysenteriae strains was undertaken. In particular, the blpAEFG, vspABCD and vspEFGH clusters were analysed for their distribution. It was demonstrated that genes that are B. hyodysenteriae specific (vspABCD and vspEFGH) displayed higher levels of polymorphism than those that are distributed amongst non-pathogenic species, such as B. innocens (which contains blpAEFG). This suggests that the variation in the vspABCD and vspEFGH clusters amongst B. hyodysenteriae strains may be a result of the exposure to the host immune system. Further investigation was undertaken by PFGE analysis and 2D-gel electrophoresis, to analyse genomic and proteomic variation at a global level. Although strains of B. hyodyse nteriae produced several different electrophoretic types (ET) upon PFGE analysis, only limited   correlation between the PFGE ET, the polymorphisms in vspABCD and vspEFGH and the presence of smpA/smpB were observed. 2D-gel electrophoresis analysis of outer membrane preparations of two B. hyodysenteriae strain revealed several distinct differences in the outer membrane between B. hyodysenteriae strains. The observed differences in the proteins contained in the outer membrane of B. hyodysenteriae is important for vaccine design, as the induction of cross protection between strains of B. hyodysenteriae is essential for a effective vaccine.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brachyspira hydodysenteriae</field><field name="subject">smpA</field><field name="subject">smpB</field><field name="subject">HlyA</field><field name="subject">recombinant Salmonella vaccine</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070112.122102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mean and Fluctuating Pressures on an Automotive   External Rear View Mirror.</field><field name="creator">Jaitlee, Rajneesh</field><field name="description">The primary function of an automobile rear View Mirror is to provide the driver with a clear   vision interpretation of all objects to the rear and side of the vehicle. The rear View Mirror is   a bluff body and there are several problems associated with the rear View Mirror. These   include buffeting, image distortion (due to aerodynamically induced and structural vibration),   aerodynamically induced noise (due to cavities and gaps) and water and dirt accumulation on   Mirror glass Surface. Due to excessive glass vibration, the rear View Mirror may not provide   a clear image. Thus, vibrations of Mirror can severely impair the driver's vision and safety of   the vehicle and its occupants. The rear View Mirrors are generally located close to the A-pillar   region on the side window. A conical vortex forms on the side window close to A-pillar   due to A-pillar geometry and the presence of side rear View Mirror and flow separation from   it makes the airflow even more complex.   The primary objective of this work is to study the aerodynamic pressures on Mirror Surface at   Various speeds to determine the effects of aerodynamics on to Mirror vibration. Additionally,   the Mirror was modified by Shrouding around the external periphery to determine the   possibility of minimisation of aerodynamic pressure fluctuations and thereby vibration. The   Shrouding length used for the analysis was of 24mm, 34mm and 44mm length. The mean and   fluctuating pressures were measured using a production rear side View Mirror fitted to a &#188;   quarter production passenger car in RMIT Industrial Wind Tunnel. The tests were also   conducted in semi-isolation condition to understand influence of the A-pillar geometry. The   mean and fluctuating pressures were converted into non-dimensional pressure coefficients   (Cp and Cprms) and the frequency content of the fluctuating pressure was analysed. The   results show that the fluctuating aerodynamic pressures are not uniformly distributed over an   automobile Mirror Surface. The highest magnitude of fluctuating pressure for the standard   Mirror was found at the central bottom part of the Mirror Surface. The highest magnitude of   fluctuating pressure for the modified Mirror was found at the central top part of the Mirror   Surface. As expected, the modification has significant effect on the magnitude of fluctuating   pressure. The results show that an increase of Shrouding length reduces the magnitude of the   fluctuating pressure. The frequency-based analysis was done to understand the energy   characteristics of the flow, particularly to its phase, since it is the out of phase components   that usually cause Mirror rotational vibration. The spectral analysis showed that the   magnitude of the energy distribution reduces with increase of shrouding length throughout the   frequency range. Flow visualisation was also used to supplement the pressure data.   The effects of yaw angles were not included in this study, however, are thought to be worthy   of further investigation. On road testing and the variation of mirror locations might have some   effects on the fluctuating pressures. These need to be investigated in the future work. The   quarter model used in this study was a car specific. However, for more generic results, a   simplified model with variable geometry can be used in future study.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">automotove side rear view mirrorr</field><field name="subject">vibration</field><field name="subject">aerodynamic pressure</field><field name="subject">pressure sensor</field><field name="subject">passenger car</field><field name="subject">wind tunnel</field><field name="subject">isolation</field><field name="subject">semi-isolation</field><field name="subject">phase angle</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070112.125531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Adaptively Controlled MEMS Triaxial   Angular Rate Sensor.</field><field name="creator">John, James Daniel</field><field name="description">Prohibitive cost and large size of conventional angular rate sensors have limited their use to   large scale aeronautical applications. However, the emergence of MEMS technology in the last   two decades has enabled angular rate sensors to be fabricated that are orders of magnitude   smaller in size and in cost. The reduction in size and cost has subsequently encouraged new   applications to emerge, but the accuracy and resolution of MEMS angular rate sensors will have   to be greatly improved before they can be successfully utilised for such high end applications as   inertial navigation.   MEMS angular rate sensors consist of a vibratory structure with two main resonant   modes and high Q factors. By means of an external excitation, the device is driven into a   constant amplitude sinusoidal vibration in the first mode, normally at resonance. When the   device is subject to an angular rate input, Coriolis acceleration causes a transfer of energy   between the two modes and results in a sinusoidal motion in the second mode, whose amplitude   is a measure of the input angular rate. Ideally the only coupling between the two modes is the   Coriolis acceleration, however fabrication imperfections always result in some cross stiffness and   cross damping effects between the two modes. Much of the previous research work has focussed   on improving the physical structure through advanced fabrication techniques and structural   design; however attention has been directed in recent years to the use of control strategies to   compensate for these structural imperfections. The performance of the MEMS angular rate   sensors is also hindered by the effects of time varying parameter values as well as noise sources   such as thermal-mechanical noise and sensing circuitry noise.   In this thesis, MEMS angular rate sensing literature is first reviewed to show the evolu-   tion of MEMS angular rate sensing from the basic principles of open-loop operation to the use of   complex control strategies designed to compensate for any fabrication imperfections and time-varying effects. Building on existing knowledge, a novel adaptively controlled MEMS triaxial   angular rate sensor that uses a single vibrating mass is then presented. Ability to sense all three   components of the angular rate vector with a single vibrating mass has advantages such as less   energy usage, smaller wafer footprint, avoidance of any mechanical interference between multiple   resonating masses and removal of the need for precise alignment of three separate devices.   The adaptive controller makes real-time estimates of the triaxial angular rates as well   as the device cross stiffness and cross damping terms. These estimates are then used to com-   pensate for their effects on the vibrating mass, resulting in the mass being controlled to follow   a predefined reference model trajectory. The estimates are updated using the error between   the reference model trajectory and the mass's real trajectory. The reference model trajectory is   designed to provide excitation to the system that is sufficiently rich to enable all parameter estimates to converge to their true values. Avenues for controller simplification and optimisation   are investigated through system simulations. The triaxial controller is analysed for stability,   averaged convergence rate and resolution. The convergence rate analysis is further utilised to   determine the ideal adaptation gains for the system that minimises the unwanted oscillatory   behaviour of the parameter estimates.   A physical structure for the triaxial device along with the sensing and actuation means is   synthesised. The device is realisable using MEMS fabrication techniques due to its planar nature   and the use of conventional MEMS sensing and actuation elements. Independent actuation and   sensing is achieved using a novel checkerboard electrode arrangement. The physical structure   is refined using a design automation process which utilises finite element analysis (FEA) and   design optimisation tools that adjust the design variables until suitable design requirements are   met.   Finally, processing steps are outlined for the fabrication of the device using a modified,   commercially available polysilicon MEMS process.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MEMS</field><field name="subject">single mass</field><field name="subject">triaxial</field><field name="subject">angular rate</field><field name="subject">sensor</field><field name="subject">adaptive control</field><field name="subject">finite element analysis</field><field name="subject">modal</field><field name="subject">fabrication</field><field name="subject">averaging</field><field name="subject">model reference</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070112.162019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the move: A longitudinal study of pathways in and out of homelessness.</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Guy Andrew Fraser</field><field name="description">In Australia the homeless population has become more diverse over the last 20 years with   more young people, women and families experiencing homelessness. It is also evident that   there is considerable variation in the length of time people remain homeless. How these   changes relate to movements into and out of the homeless population is not well understood.   This research asks: 'Is there a connection between how people become homeless, how long   they remain homeless and how they 'get out' of homelessness?'   A review of the literature identified two gaps directly relevant to the issue of   movement in and out of homelessness. First, it is not well understood why people   experience homelessness for different lengths of time when they face similar structural   conditions. Second, the prevalence of substance use and mental illness reported in the   homeless population has led some to conclude these factors cause homelessness.   However, researchers have generally been unclear about whether such problems precede or   are a consequence of homelessness.   In addition, research has generally presumed a relationship between the amount of   time a person is homeless and patterns of behavioural and cognitive adaptation to a   homeless way of life. Yet recent research suggests that people's biographies play a   significant role in the duration of homelessness. How these different findings relate to each   other remains unclear.   This thesis investigates these issues through a longitudinal study of homeless   households. Data was gathered in two rounds of semi-structured interviews. In the first   round 103 interviews were conducted. Approximately one year later 79 of these households   were re-interviewed. The process of, and connections between becoming, being and exiting   the homeless pathway are analysed using the 'pathways' concept. While on these pathways   homeless people actively produce and reproduce social structures including both embracing   and rejecting the stigma and subculture associated with homelessness. This complex world   of homelessness is then analysed by extending the pathways concept by distinguishing five   ideal type pathways based on the main reason for becoming homeless. They are a mental   health pathway, a domestic violence pathway, a substance use pathway, a housing crisis   pathway and a youth pathway.   The research indicates that people on each pathway respond to the experience of   homelessness differently and this has implications for the amount of time they spend in the   homeless population. People on the substance use and youth pathways commonly describe   themselves as 'homeless', focus on the 'here and now', use the welfare service system, are   very mobile, and over time, many start to sleep rough. Their embrace of the homeless   subculture commonly 'locks' them into the homeless population for long periods of time. In   contrast people on the domestic violence and housing crisis pathways generally do not   identify themselves as homeless and resist involvement with other homeless people. These   homeless careers tend to be shorter. Then there are those who enter homelessness on the   mental health pathway. They were frequently exploited in the early stages of their homeless   careers and most sought to avoid exploitation by isolating themselves which then increased   their marginalisation. These were the longest homeless careers.   The use of the pathways concept also helps to understand how the circumstances of   homeless people can change while they are homeless. The research found that some   homeless people changed pathways. In particular the study found that two thirds of the   people who reported substance use problems developed these problems after they became   homeless. Most of these people entered the homeless population on the youth pathway.   The research also found that three quarters of the people with mental health issues   developed these issues after they became homeless, and that for some this was also   connected to drug use.   Overcoming homelessness is never easy and individuals manage the process in   different ways. Again the pathways concept proved useful to understanding how homeless   people accomplished this. The findings show that people travelling the different pathways   require different levels and types of assistance to resolve their homelessness. The research   concludes that the process of re-integration can take a long time but, given the right social   and economic support, every homeless career can end.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Homelessness; homeless subculture</field><field name="subject">pathways</field><field name="subject">adaptation</field><field name="subject">stigma</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070116.121116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reducing the Complexity of Large Ecosystem Models.</field><field name="creator">Lawrie, Jock Sebastian</field><field name="description">During the 1990s a large-scale study of Port Phillip Bay, Australia, was undertaken by the CSIRO (the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia's national research body). A major outcome of the study was a complex ecosystem model intended to provide scientific input into management decisions concerning the nutrient load to the bay. However, its development was costly and time-consuming. Given this effort, it is natural to seek smaller models (reduced models) that reproduce the performance measures of the large model (the full model) that are of interest to decision makers. This thesis is concerned with identifying such models. More generally, this thesis is concerned with developing methods for identifying these smaller models.   Several methods are developed for this purpose, each simplifying the full model in different ways. In particular, methods are proposed for aggregating state variables, setting state variables to constants, simplifying links in the ecological network, and eliminating rates from the full model. Moreover, the methods can be implemented automatically, so that they are transferable to other ecological modelling situations, and so that the reduced models are obtained objectively.   In the case of the Port Phillip Bay model, significant reduction in model complexity is possible even when estimates of all the performance measures are of interest. Thus, this model is unnecessarily complex.   Furthermore, the most significant reductions in complexity occur when the methods are combined. With this in mind, a procedure for combining the methods is proposed that can be implemented for any ecological model with a large number of components.   Aside from generating reduced models, the process of applying the methods reveals insights into the mechanisms built into the system. Such insights highlight the extent to which the model simplification process can be applied.   Given the effectiveness of the model simplification process developed here, it is concluded that this process should be more routinely applied to large ecosystem models. In some cases, the full sequence of methods might prove too computationally expensive to justify its purpose. However, it is shown that even the application of a subset of the methods can yield both simpler models and insight into the structure and behaviour of the system being modelled.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Large ecosystem models</field><field name="subject">complexity</field><field name="subject">simplification</field><field name="subject">aggregation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070116.122707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Knowledge Management in Supporting Innovation and   Learning in Construction.</field><field name="creator">Maqsood, Tayyab</field><field name="description">The research investigates the role of Knowledge Management (KM) in supporting innovation and learning in the construction industry. The Construction industry is complex in nature and notoriously fragmented suffering high losses in productivity. Being a substantial part of the national economy, the construction industry greatly influences the country's GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Innovation has lately been regarded as the key to improve its productivity and to change traditional and fundamental thinking that has plagued the industry for a long time leading to new and more rational philosophies. The research demonstrates that KM may act as an enabler of such innovation by facilitating organisational learning.       The research is carried out in two phases. In Phase 1, the research employs grounded theory methodology to develop and map out the current state of knowledge related activities being undertaken in two leading Australian construction organisations. This results in the development of a model, the main depiction of which is a segregation between three crucial components (people, process &amp; technology) of an organisation required to successfully carry out the construction work. It also helps identify the gap between the organisation's internal and external knowledge sources that restricts the pull of knowledge from external knowledge sources. The culture of the organisation is considered to provide this resistance. An improvement in this state through KM is the main objective of the research which is realised in Phase 2. Soft System Methodology (SSM) is utilised as a KM tool to achieve this objective in this phase. As one of the systems approaches, it has the capacity to make sense of intricate systems like const ruction where a complex interaction between people, process and technology occurs all the time. A mission critical business process of pre-tendering of a leading Australian construction contractor organisation is selected to carry out the SSM investigation that resulted in four SSM case studies. This investigation helps explain how KM initiatives through SSM improve the integration of people, process and technology; increasing the capacity of the organisation to pull external knowledge and improve its own internal knowledge bank. All these improvements help an organisation to transform itself into a learning organisation that could continually innovate.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge Management</field><field name="subject">Organisational Learning</field><field name="subject">Soft Systems Methodology</field><field name="subject">Grounded Theory</field><field name="subject">Construction Industry</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070116.145205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Techniques in Secure Chaos Communication.</field><field name="creator">Lau, Yuu Seng</field><field name="description">In today's climate of increased criminal attacks on the privacy of   personal or confidential data over digital communication systems,   a more secure physical communication link is required. Chaotic signals which   have bifurcation behavior (depending on some initial condition) can readily   be exploited to enhance the security of communication systems. A chaotic   generator produces disordered sequences that provide very good auto- and cross-   correlation properties similar to those of random white noise. This would be an   important feature in multiple access environments. These sequences are used to   scramble data in spread spectrum systems as they can produce low co-channel   interference, hence improve the system capacity and performance. The chaotic   signal can be created from only a single mathematical relationship and is neither   restricted in length nor is repetitive/ cyclic.   On the other hand, with the progress in digital signal processing and digital   hardware, there has been an increased interest in using adaptive algorithms   to improve the performance of digital systems. Adaptive algorithms provide   the system with the ability to self-adjust its coefficients according to the signal   condition, and can be used with linear or non-linear systems; hence, they might   find application in chaos communication. There has been a lot of literature that   proposed the use of LMS adaptive algorithm in the communication arena for a   variety of applications such as (but not limited to): channel estimation, channel   equalization, demodulation, de-noising, and beamforming. In this thesis, we   conducted a study on the application of chaos theory in communication systems   as well as the application of adaptive algorithms in chaos communication.   The First Part of the thesis tackled the application of chaos theory in com-   munication. We examined different types of communication techniques utilizing   chaos theory. In particular, we considered chaos shift keying (CSK) and mod-   ified kind of logistic map. Then, we applied space-time processing and eigen-   beamforming technique to enhance the performance of chaos communication.   Following on, we conducted a study on CSK and Chaos-CDMA in conjunction   with multi-carrier modulation (MCM) techniques such as OFDM (FFT/ IFFT)   and wavelet-OFDM.   In the Second Part of the thesis, we tried to apply adaptivity to chaos com-   munication. Initially, we presented a study of multi-user detection utilizing an   adaptive algorithm in a chaotic CDMA multi-user environment, followed by   a study of adaptive beamforming and modified weight-vector adaptive beam-   forming over CSK communication. At last, a study of modified time-varying   adaptive filtering is presented and a conventional adaptive filtering technique is   applied in chaotic signal environment.   Twelve papers have been published during the PhD candidature, include   two journal papers and ten refereed conference papers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CSK</field><field name="subject">chaos</field><field name="subject">adaptive algorithm</field><field name="subject">OFDM</field><field name="subject">MIMO</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070116.151025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AAS27 and accountability with emphasis on   depreciation as the critical test.</field><field name="creator">Molland, Allan</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to investigate how senior accounting staff in Victorian local   councils are recording and reporting infrastructure assets (IAs) with their relevant   depreciation in General Purpose Financial Reports (GPFRs). Infrastructure assets are   long-lived assets such as roads, drains and bridges.   Historically, the purpose of public sector accounting in Western countries has been to   demonstrate that funds have been raised and expended strictly within the authority of   the annual budget. This short-term charge/discharge objective, involving the use of a cash-based system of accounting, has effectively prevented the provision of information   for long-term decision making and the assessment of those decisions. The major   disadvantage for management purposes is the loss of information relating to the longterm   benefits of expenditures with one of the major issues being the failure to record IAs   and their relevant depreciation.   The introduction of Australian Accounting Standard No. 27 Financial Reporting by Local   Governments (AAS27), which applies to all Australian local authorities and the   Statements of Accounting Concepts (SACs) require IAs to be reported in the Statement of   Financial Position and depreciation to be charged in the Statement of Financial   Performance in order to reflect the loss of service potential in the operating period   concerned. It is anticipated that the study will report the implications for the   accountability of the implementation of IA accounting and the utility and relevance of IA   information and depreciation for decision-making by both internal and external users.

External optical modulation is commonly used in high performance RF-photonic links. The practical use of optical fiber to transport RF signals is still limited due to high RF signal loss. In order to reduce the RF signal loss, highly efficient modulators are needed. For many applications, modulators with broad bandwidths are required. However, there are applications that require only a narrow bandwidth. For these narrow-band applications, the modulation efficiency can be improved through the resonant enhancement technique at the expense of reduced bandwidth.      The aim of this thesis is to investigate highly efficient Mach-Zehnder optical modulators (MZMs) on Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3) with resonant enhancement techniques for narrow-band RF-photonic applications. This work focuses in particular on analyzing the factors that affect the modulation efficiency through resonant enhancement so that the modulator electrode structure can be optimized for maximum modulation efficiency.      A parameter study of the effects of the electrode characteristics on the modulation efficiency of resonantly enhanced modulators (RE-MZM) is provided. From this study, optimum design objectives are identified. Numerical optimization is employed to explore the design trade-offs so that optimal configurations can be found. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to assess the performance of optimal RE-MZMs with respect to the variations of fabrication conditions. The results of these investigations indicate that the RE-MZM with a large electrode gap is the optimal design since it provides high modulation efficiency although the inherent switching voltage is high, and is the most tolerant to the fabrication fluctuations. A highly efficient RE-MZM on X-cut LiNbO3 is practically demonstrated with the resonant enhancement factor of 5 dB when comparing to the unenhanced modulator with the same electrode structure and effective switching voltage of 2 V at 1.8 GHz. The performance of the RF-photonic link using the fabr icated RE-MZM is evaluated.       Optimization of RE-MZMs for operating at millimeter-wave frequencies is also reported. Factors that limit the modulation efficiency of an RE-MZM at millimeter-wave frequencies are identified. Novel resonant structures that can overcome these limitations are proposed. Preliminary designs indicate that greatly improved modulation efficiency could be expected.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optical communication</field><field name="subject">electro-optical modulation</field><field name="subject">Mach-Zehnder modulators</field><field name="subject">electrodes</field><field name="subject">lithium niobate</field><field name="subject">resonance</field><field name="subject">resonantly enhanced modulators</field><field name="subject">numerical optimisation</field><field name="subject">optical design techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070118.162330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the dynamics of cultural policy formation : the states' patronage of film production in Australia 1970-1988</field><field name="creator">O'Donnell, Thomas Vincent</field><field name="description">In Australia, the decades of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s were times of a great nationalist revival and cultural self-discovery. In the visual arts, theatre, popular and classical music, and especially in cinema and television, a distinct Australian voice could be heard that was accepted as culturally valid and nationally relevant.   The renaissance of local production for cinema and television was reliant on the patronage of the state, first the Commonwealth government with the establishment of the Australian Film Development Corporation and the Experimental Film and Television Fund in 1970 and, later, the Australian Film and Television School. Then from 1972 to 1978 each Australian state established a film support agency to extend that patronage and assure the state of a role in the burgeoning film industry.   This thesis relates the stories of the creation and development-and in some cases demise-of those six state film agencies over the period 1970 to 1988. It identifies the influences that directed the creation of each state agency and proposes a qualitative model of the relationships between the influences. It then argues the applicability of the model to the formation of cultural policy in general in a pluralistic democratic society. It also argues that the state film agencies were more influential on national film industry policy than has hitherto been recognised.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">film production</field><field name="subject">cultural policy</field><field name="subject">government assistance to the arts</field><field name="subject">nationalism</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070119.110944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of Prefabricated Modular Housing Systems in Promoting Sustainable Housing Practices</field><field name="creator">Oxley, David Richard III</field><field name="description">The use of modular construction systems for residential purposes currently represents a very small proportion of all housing construction. The focus of these systems is on niche markets typified as cheap alternatives, homeowner involvement in construction or adaptations to construction constraints (build time availability, site access, etc.).   Governments, regulatory bodies and industrial members are progressively moving towards increased environmentally sustainable practice. This progression is evidenced by the development of design and construction rating tools and the introduction of statutes and regulations governing construction and design.   This work investigates the improvement of residential construction practice in terms of environmental sustainability outcomes through the use of modular housing systems. Two key aspects of environmental sustainability identified are embodied energy and material waste reduction. A modular system has been investigated because methods and procedures that directly relate to these two areas are well addressed by such systems.   In order to validate the potential of modular systems in this environmental regard, three main areas have been addressed. The first is the ability for modular systems to generate the type of floor plans currently offered by Australian high-volume builders. Second, the environmental improvement potential offered by modular systems is addressed. Lastly are the issues of structural performance and the means of the tailoring of prefabricated modular systems to residential construction standards.   Through the treatment of these three areas, potential benefits of modular systems are identified, with future work necessary to implement such benefits highlighted. The need for such improvements is noted, and a framework for evaluating future developments in this area of research is presented.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Embodied Energy</field><field name="subject">Modular Housing</field><field name="subject">Prefabrication</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Topology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070119.150328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of stearoyl-CoA desaturase1 in fatty acid-induced insulin resistance</field><field name="creator">Pinnameneni, Srijan Kumar</field><field name="description">Recent investigations suggest that reducing stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD) 1   expression confers protection against obesity and insulin resistance, whereas others   show that increasing SCD1 expression protects cells from lipotoxicity. The overall aim   of this thesis was to establish the role of SCD1 expression in fatty acid metabolism and   insulin stimulated glucose disposal in skeletal muscle.   In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to investigate the relationship between fatty   acid subtype, SCD1 expression and fuel metabolism. The role of fatty acid subtype on   fatty acid metabolite accumulation and insulin resistance was initially examined in rats.   Rats were provided with a low fat diet or a high fat diet consisting of predominantly   saturated (SAT) or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Rats fed a SAT diet were   insulin resistant and had increased skeletal muscle diacylglycerol content whereas rats   fed a PUFA diet retained insulin sensitivity and accumulated triacylglycerol rather than   diacylglycerol. Interestingly, SCD1 mRNA and protein content were elevated in SAT   rats compared with PUFA fed and control fed rats, indicating a possible involvement of   SCD1 in the aetiology of insulin resistance. Subsequently, SCD1 expression was   examined in the skeletal muscle of various rodent models of genetic and diet-induced   obesity. SCD1 content was consistently upregulated in the skeletal muscle of obese   rodents.   To determine whether SCD1 contributes to or protects from fatty-acid induced insulin   resistance, SCD1 levels were transiently altered in L6 skeletal muscle myotubes. Short   interfering (si) RNA was used to decrease SCD1 content and a pcDNA3.1/HygromSCD1   vector was introduced to increase SCD1 content. Reducing SCD1 protein   resulted in marked esterification of exogenous fatty acids into diacylglycerol and   ceramide. Insulin-stimulated Akt (acute transforming retrovirus thymoma)   phosphorylation and 2-deoxyglucose uptake were reduced with SCD1 siRNA.   Exposure of L6 myotubes to palmitate abolished insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in   both control and SCD1 siRNA myotubes. Transient overexpression of SCD1 resulted   in triacylglycerol esterification but attenuated ceramide and diacylglycerol accumulation   and protected myotubes from fatty acid-induced insulin resistance. Further, these   changes were associated with reduced phosphorylation of c-Jun Amino-Terminal   Kinase (JNK) and the inhibitor of I&#234;B kinase (IKK), both of which impair insulin   signalling. These studies indicated that SCD1 protects from cellular toxicity in L6   myotubes by preventing excessive accumulation of bioactive lipid metabolites.   Collectively, these experiments indicate that increasing SCD1 expression may be a   protective mechanism designed to prevent insulin resistance in obese phenotypes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stearoyl CoA desaturase</field><field name="subject">insulin resistance</field><field name="subject">SCD1</field><field name="subject">fatty acid metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070119.162450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australia's Changing Workplace:   A Generational Perspective</field><field name="creator">Sayers, Roslyn</field><field name="description">This research investigates generational differences in Australian workers.   In particular it focuses on changing trends and influences in the workplace and how different generations view and deal with these changes.   The study focuses on Baby Boomers (born 1945-1963), Generation X (born 1964-1977) and Generation Y (born 1978 - 1994) across four industry sectors: Corporate, Education, Government and Not for Profit.         The Australian workforce currently consists of four generations - all having distinct characteristics, working styles, needs and expectations.   These differences pose challenges and opportunities to workforce management.  The first step in managing the generations and their differences is to identify where the differences lie and to understand how best to cope with and exploit these differences.  This research, in taking a generational cohort perspective towards analysing the modern workplace, seeks to explore how the different generations view the trends and influences that impact their work; and their attitudes towards technology, communication, work/life balance, organisational loyalty, attraction, engagement and retention.       The study uses a multi-phase qualitative approach and includes in-depth interviews with a range of Australian industry experts; discussion groups held with Gen Ys, Gen Xers and Baby Boomer employees, in four organisations across four industry sectors; and in-depth interviews with senior executives in the same four organisations.        This research will have significance to all organisations especially those that employ workers from across the generations and who are managing a multigenerational workforce.   The findings will have practical application to organisational policy development in areas such as, work/life balance, attraction, engagement and retention of employees, reward and recognition systems, technology in the workplace and training and development.      The study adds to the body of knowledge in workforce management, and in particular to the emerging body of knowledge on generational cohort analysis of the workplace in the Australian context.  The study found significant generational differences that when harnessed and managed effectively, can contribute to the output and performance of the organisation as a whole.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Generational Diversity</field><field name="subject">Baby Boomer; Generation X</field><field name="subject">Generation Y</field><field name="subject">Workplace diversity</field><field name="subject">Australian Workplace</field><field name="subject">Organisational Policy</field><field name="subject">Aging Workforce</field><field name="subject">Workplace Change</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070122.102821</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Extended Role-based Access Control Model for   Enterprise Systems and Web Services</field><field name="creator">Shi, Wei</field><field name="description">This thesis intends to develop application-level access control models to address several major   security issues in enterprise environments. The first goal is to provide simple and efficient   authorization specifications to reduce the complexity of security management. The second goal is   to provide dynamic access control for Web service applications. The third goal is to provide an   access control framework for Semantic Web services.   In this thesis, an Authorization-Function-Based Role-based Access Control (FB-RBAC)   model is proposed for controlling enterprise systems at the application level. The unique features   of the proposed model are authorization-function-based access control and constraint-based finegrained   access control. This model significantly simplifies the management of an access control   system by adopting roles and authorization-functions in authorization specifications. An   extension of FB-RBAC, Extended FB-RBAC (ERBAC), is applied to Web service applications.   New features such as credential-based access control and dynamic role assignment are added to   FB-RBAC in order to address user heterogeneity and dynamicity in the Web environment. The   proposed ERBAC model is then extended to support Semantic Web services. Each component of   the ERBAC model is described by security ontologies. These correlated security ontologies are   integrated with Semantic Web services to form a complete ontology network. Ontology-based   role assignment is facilitated so that security information can be queries and discovered through a   network of ontologies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">access control</field><field name="subject">RBAC</field><field name="subject">ontology</field><field name="subject">enterprise system</field><field name="subject">web service</field><field name="subject">semantic web</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070122.122429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Compatibility and structural interaction in passenger vehicle collisions</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Gareth</field><field name="description">This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge relating to crash   compatibility (the minimisation of injury risk faced by all participants involved   in a collision in traffic). The research focuses on the topic of structural interaction   in collisions involving passenger vehicles, a phenomenon describing the   efficiency of energy dissipation within existing deformation-zones of a passenger   vehicle during a collision. A new definition for structural interaction was   developed and several metrics to evaluate structural interaction and compatibility   in car-to-car collisions were proposed, based on the commonly known   Equivalent Energy Speed (EES) metric. The new EES metrics describe equivalent   closing velocities for a given collision based on the energy dissipated   within the front-ends (EESFF) and the entire structure (EESVV) of both vehicles   involved in a head-on collision. These metrics form the basis of the new   knowledge generated by this research.   Additionally, a new method was developed to measure the amount of energy   dissipated through structural deformation in a collision, based on accelerometer   readings. This method was applied to several experimental and simulationbased   car-to-car collisions and the validity of the method was proven. Based   on the energy dissipation which occurred in the car-to-car collisions analysed,   the degree of compatibility reached and the level of structural interaction which   occurred in each collision was evaluated by applying the newly developed   EESFF and EESVV metrics.   Thie research also investigates the assessment of vehicles' structures in a standardized procedure with a view to improving structural interaction in the real-world. Several fixed barrier crash tests have been proposed in different configurations and with different assessment criteria. All assessments aim to evaluate the geometrical characteristics of the front-ends of passenger vehicles. A set of factors required from a compatilibility assessment focused on assessing vehicle geometry were identified. The proposed compatibility assessment procedures were evaluated based on their ability to predict the potential for structural interaction offered by passenger vehicles.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">compatibility</field><field name="subject">passive safety. structural interaction</field><field name="subject">vehicle safety</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070122.125652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the Coordinated Use of a Sleep   Mode in Wireless Sensor Networks:   Ripple Rendezvous</field><field name="creator">van Coppenhagen, Robert Lindenberg</field><field name="description">It is widely accepted that low energy consumption is the most important   requirement when designing components and systems for a wireless sensor   network (WSN). The greatest energy consumer of each node within a WSN   is the radio transceiver and as such, it is important that this component be   used in an extremely energy e&#177;cient manner. One method of reducing the   amount of energy consumed by the radio transceiver is to turn it off and   allow nodes to enter a sleep mode. The algorithms that directly control the   radio transceiver are traditionally grouped into the Medium Access Control   (MAC) layer of a communication protocol stack.   This thesis introduces the emerging field of wireless sensor networks   and outlines the requirements of a MAC protocol for such a network. Current MAC protocols are reviewed in detail with a focus on how they utilize   this energy saving sleep mode as well as performance problems that they   suffer from. A proposed new method of coordinating the use of this sleep   mode between nodes in the network is specifed and described. The proposed new protocol is analytically compared with existing protocols as well   as with some fundamental performance limits. The thesis concludes with an   analysis of the results as well as some recommendations for future work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wireless sensor networks</field><field name="subject">low energy</field><field name="subject">low latency</field><field name="subject">medium access controls (MAC) protocols</field><field name="subject">sleep mode</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070122.145741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aerodynamic Analysis of a Blended-Wing-Body Aircraft   Configuration</field><field name="creator">Ikeda, Toshihiro</field><field name="description">In recent years unconventional aircraft configurations, such as Blended-Wing-Body (BWB) aircraft,   are being investigated and researched with the aim to develop more efficient aircraft configurations, in   particular for very large transport aircraft that are more efficient and environmentally-friendly. The   BWB configuration designates an alternative aircraft configuration where the wing and fuselage are   integrated which results essentially in a hybrid flying wing shape.   The first example of a BWB design was researched at the Loughead Company in the United States of   America in 1917. The Junkers G. 38, the largest land plane in the world at the time, was produced in   1929 for Luft Hansa (present day; Lufthansa). Since 1939 Northrop Aircraft Inc. (USA), currently   Northrop Grumman Corporation and the Horten brothers (Germany) investigated and developed   BWB aircraft for military purposes. At present, the major aircraft industries and several universities   has been researching the BWB concept aircraft for civil and military activities, although the BWB   design concept has not been adapted for civil transport yet. The B-2 Spirit, (produced by the Northrop   Corporation) has been used in military service since the late 1980s. The BWB design seems to show   greater potential for very large passenger transport aircraft. A NASA BWB research team found an   800 passenger BWB concept consumed 27 percent less fuel per passenger per flight operation than an   equivalent conventional configuration (Leiebeck 2005).   The purpose of this research is to assess the aerodynamic efficiency of a BWB aircraft with respect to   a conventional configuration, and to identify design issues that determine the effectiveness of BWB   performance as a function of aircraft payload capacity. The approach was undertaken to develop a   new conceptual design of a BWB aircraft using Computational Aided Design (CAD) tools and   Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. An existing high-capacity aircraft, the Airbus A380   Contents RMIT University, Australia   was modelled, and its aerodynamic characteristics assessed using CFD to enable comparison with the   BWB design.   The BWB design had to be compatible with airports that took conventional aircraft, meaning a   wingspan of not more than 80 meters for what the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)   regulation calls class 7 airports (Amano 2001).   From the literature review, five contentions were addressed;   i. Is a BWB aircraft design more aerodynamically efficient than a conventional aircraft   configuration?   ii. How does the BWB compare overall with a conventional design configuration?   iii. What is the trade-off between conventional designs and a BWB arrangement?   iv. What mission requirements, such as payload and endurance, will a BWB design   concept become attractive for?   v. What are the practical issues associated with the BWB design that need to be   addressed?   In an aircraft multidisciplinary design environment, there are two major branches of engineering   science; CFD analysis and structural analysis; which is required to commence producing an aircraft.   In this research, conceptual BWB designs and CFD simulations were iterated to evaluate the   aerodynamic performance of an optimal BWB design, and a theoretical calculation of structural   analysis was done based on the CFD results.   The following hypothesis was prompted;   A BWB configuration has superior in flight performance due to a higher Lift-to-Drag (L/D) ratio, and   could improve upon existing conventional aircraft, in the areas of noise emission, fuel consumption    and Direct Operation Cost (DOC) on service. However, a BWB configuration needs to employ a new   structural system for passenger safety procedures, such as passenger ingress/egress.   The research confirmed that the BWB configuration achieves higher aerodynamic performance with   an achievement of the current airport compatibility issue. The beneficial results of the BWB design   were that the parasite drag was decreased and the spanwise body as a whole can generate lift. In a   BWB design environment, several advanced computational techniques were required to compute a   CFD simulation with the CAD model using pre-processing and CFD software.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">blended-wing-body aircraft</field><field name="subject">BWB</field><field name="subject">flying wing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070122.163030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of Layered Surface AcousticWave   Resonators for Liquid Media Sensing   Applications</field><field name="creator">Powell, David Anthony</field><field name="description">In this thesis a model is developed to characterise the behaviour of layered SAW 2-   port resonator sensors operating in liquid media. In the critical review of literature, it   is found that methods based on the periodic Green's function combined with the COM   model are best suited to this task. However, an important deficiency of this approach   is the lack of a good model for electrodes buried within layered media. This deficiency   is resolved in this thesis by the formulation of a periodic matrix eigen-operator, using   a phase-shifted Fourier series representation. This model is then utilised in the study   of resonator behaviour as a function of guiding layer thickness, including the mass   sensitivity.   Based on this modelling work, a SAW resonator structure is designed, and its frequency   response is found to be in generally good agreement with theoretical predictions.   The mass sensitivity of this device is then analysed using both theoretical and   experimental means. In contrast to the sensitivity analyses found in the literature, sensitivity   variation across the device surface is considered in this work. For the resonator   structure it is found that sensitivity is greatest at the device centre, with the ends of the   device making negligible contribution to the complete device response. The result is   that the sensitive material may be deposited only in a small region in the centre of the   device, with minimal reduction in device response.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Layered Surface AcousticWave</field><field name="subject">SAW</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070122.164018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemistry and Morphology of Polymer Thin Films for Electro-Optical Application</field><field name="creator">Simon, Darren</field><field name="description">Thin polymer films and their properties have been investigated. The characteristics of crystalline polymers according to film thickness have been improved using polycaprolactone (PCL). The melting enthalpy of PCL has increased when the film thickness decreased and the peak melting temperature showed no significant changes with film thickness. Film thickness variation influenced surface roughness and crystal size. Optical microscope images showed the rougher surface of thicker films. The spinning time has shown no influence on film thickness and no significant changes to surface roughness.      Thin films of block copolymers were used in the surface modification study; films studied included poly(styrene-b-butadiene-b-styrene) (SBS) and poly(styrene-b-isoprene-b-styrene) (SIS) and their surface modifications have been controlled using different methods of treatment. Films of SIS heated at different temperatures have shown different surface texture and roughness. Films treated at low temperature (45 &#176;C) had smooth surfaces when compared with films heated at high temperature (120 &#176;C and 160 &#176;C). Phase separation of SIS heated at (120 &#176;C and 160 &#176;C) caused bulges of different sizes to cover the surface. The height and width of the bulges showed variation with film thickness and heating. Substrate interaction with SBS and SIS block copolymer films showed different surface texture when using the same type of substrate and different texture were obtained when SBS solutions were spun onto different substrates. It has been demonstrated that using different solvents in copolymer preparation caused different  texture.      Thermal and surface property variations with film thickness have been improved using amorphous polymers. Surface roughness of poly(methyl methacrylate) PMMA and disperse red 1-poly(methyl methacrylate) DR1-PMMA, PMMA has improved using thickness variation. Glass transition temperature measurement has increased when film thickness was increased.      The glass transition temperature (Tg) and surface roughness of UV15 UV - curable coating polymer has been modified using UV curing and heating methods. Tg variation was observed when curing time and curing intensity were changed causing the optical properties of the polymer to be more variable. A plasma etcher caused wrinkles to occur on the surface of unheated UV15. Tg of UV15 increased when curing time increased. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of cured UV15 film have shown peak variations of the ester and carbon double bond regions over the range of 1850-1700 cm-1.      Urethane-Urea (UU) Polymer thin films were used to investigate optical properties and develop an optical waveguide. Absorption and transmission properties of light using non-linear optical (NLO) polymer was investigated and used in optical waveguide fabrication. Refractive indices were measured to examine UU films at two different wavelengths. A UU film of 1 &#181;m thickness caused a maximum absorption at &#61548;max = 471 nm also obtained at 810 nm wavelength. Many methods of fabrication were used; photolithography, plasma etching in a barrel reactor and thin film deposition using sputtering and evaporation.  Etched depths from 1 &#956;m to 100 &#956;m were obtained. An optical waveguide has been prepared using plasma etching of a cured UV15 as a cladding layer on a silicon substrate.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polymers</field><field name="subject">film thickness</field><field name="subject">film roughness</field><field name="subject">thermal prroperties</field><field name="subject">glass transition temperature</field><field name="subject">crystals size</field><field name="subject">enthalpy</field><field name="subject">optical properties</field><field name="subject">UV curing</field><field name="subject">plasma etching</field><field name="subject">waveguide</field><field name="subject">spin coating</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070123.122707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between newspaper   credibility and reader attitude   toward Korea and Koreans</field><field name="creator">Stockwell, Esther Seong Hee</field><field name="description">As receivers of information from the media, we are faced with the constant problem of   determining what sources are and are not credible. Given that much of what we know   of the world around us comes directly from the media (Lippman, 1922), as receivers of   messages from the media we realise how important the credibility of a news source is.   Many of the attitudes that we form about a wide range of issues in society are formed as   a direct result of the coverage we receive through the media, although there are   numerous other factors involved such as issue involvement, intensity and closure (e.g.,   Guttman, 1954). Traditionally a large number of studies have argued that a high   credibility source is more effective in causing attitude change than a low credibility   source (Hovland &amp; Weiss, 1951; Kelman &amp; Hovland, 1953; Bochner &amp; Insko, 1966;   McGuire, 1973), while other experimental research examining the interaction between   source credibility and other variables have indicated that there are other factors which   have an important mediating effect on the impact of source credibility.   To further complicate the issue, researchers have argued that credibility is not a stable   attribute that a person assigns consistently to a source. Instead, credibility is highly   situational and is a changeable perception by a receiver (Berlo, Lemert, &amp; Mertz, 1969;   Smith, 1970; Hayes, 1971; Chaffe, 1982). Also, individual differences of receivers   such as age, education, gender, and knowledge about the media and the topic could   contribute to the evaluation of source credibility (Westley &amp; Serverin, 1964; Lewis,   1981). In addition, the importance of the issue in the media, the controversiality of the   issue, receiver bias, the receiver's involvement with the issue and so on have also been    shown to have a relationship with the evaluation of source credibility (Stone &amp; Bell,   1975; Robert &amp; Leifer, 1975; Gunther &amp; Lasorsa, 1986).   This thesis thus explores the various complexities involved in the relationship between   media credibility and attitude formation by examining the characteristics that play a role   in making a news source credible to readers, and then considering those factors that   affect attitude change in the receivers of a news message. To achieve this, university   students in south-east Queensland were examined in order to investigate attitude change   regarding the issue of South Korea as a result of coverage in sources they perceive to be   of high and low credibility. The study consisted of three stages: a survey of the   university students to determine which newspapers they find to be of high and low   credibility, a content analysis of their high and low credibility sources for articles of   positive, neutral and negative tone, and finally an experiment which measured subjects'   attitude change through reading articles of different tones in high and low credibility   sources.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">media credibility</field><field name="subject">attittude change</field><field name="subject">foreign news</field><field name="subject">Korea</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">national images</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070125.160936</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Model based wheel slip control via constrained optimal algorithm</field><field name="creator">Yoo, Dae Keun</field><field name="description">In a near future, it is imminent that passenger vehicles will soon be introduced with a new revolutionary brake by wire system which replaces all the mechanical linkages and the conventional hydraulic brake systems with complete 'dry' electrical components. One of the many potential benefits of a brake by wire system is the increased brake dynamic performances due to a more accurate and continuous operation of the EMB actuators which leads to the increased amount of possibilities for control in antilock brake system. The main focus of this thesis is on the application of a model predictive control (MPC) method to devise an antilock brake control system for a brake by wire vehicle. Unlike the traditional ABS control algorithms which are based on a trial and error method, the MPC based ABS algorithm aims to utilizes the behaviour of the model to optimize the wheel slip dynamics subject to system constraints. The final implementation of the wheel slip controller emb races decentralized control architecture to independently control the brake torque at each four wheel. Performance of the wheel slip controller is validated through Software-in-the-Loop and Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation. In order to support the high demands of the computational power and the real time constraints of the Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation, a novel multi processor real-time simulation system is developed using the reflective memory network and the off-the-shelf hardware components.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ABS</field><field name="subject">BBW</field><field name="subject">MPC</field><field name="subject">Hardware-in-the-Loop</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070125.163142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A laboratory scale study of infiltration from   Pervious Pavements</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Jie</field><field name="description">Increased urbanization causes pervious greenfields to be converted to impervious areas increasing stormwater runoff. Most of the urban floods occur because existing drainage systems are unable to handle peak flows during rainfall events. During a storm event, flood runoff will carry contaminants to receiving waters such as rivers and creeks. Engineers and scientists have combined their knowledge to introduce innovative thinking to manage the quality of urban runoff and harvest stormwater for productive purposes.   The introduction of pervious pavements addresses all the principles in Water Sensitive Urban Design. A pervious pavement is a load bearing pavement structure that is permeable to water. The pervious layer sits on the top of a reservoir storage layer. Pervious pavements reduce the flood peak as well as improve the quality of stormwater at source before it is transported to receiving waters or reused productively.   To be accepted as a viable solution, understanding of the influence of design parameters on the infiltration rate (both from the bedding and the sub-base) as well as strength of the pavement requires to be established. The design of a particular pavement will need to be customized for different properties of sub layer materials present in different sites. In addition, the designs will have to meet local government stormwater discharge standards. The design of drainage systems underneath pervious pavements will need to be based on the permeability of the whole pervious system.   The objectives of the research project are to:   &#149; Understand the factors influencing infiltration capacities and percolation rates through the pervious surface as well as the whole pavement structure including the bedding and the sub-base using a laboratory experimental setup.   &#149; Obtain relationships between rainfall intensity, infiltration rate and runoff   quantity based on the sub-grade material using a computational model to assist the design of pervious pavements.   A laboratory scale pavement was constructed to develop relationships between the surface runoff and the infiltration volume from a pervious pavement with an Eco-Pavement surface. 2 to 5mm crushed gravel and 5 to 20mm open graded gravel were chosen as the bedding and sub-base material. Initial tests such as dry and wet density, crushing values, hydraulic conductivity, California Bearing Ratio tests for aggregate material were conducted before designing and constructing the pavement model. A rainfall simulator with evenly spaced 24 sprays was set up above the pervious pavement surface.   The thesis presents design aspects of the laboratory scale pavement and the tests carried out in designing the pavement and the experimental procedure. The Green and Ampt model parameters to calculate infiltration were obtained from the laboratory test results from aggregate properties. Runoff results obtained from rainfall simulator tests were compared with the Green and Ampt infiltration model results to demonstrate that the Green and Ampt parameters could be successfully calculated from aggregate properties. The final infiltration rate and the cumulative infiltration volume of water were independent of the rainfall intensity once the surface is saturated. The model parameters were shown to be insensitive to the final infiltration capacity and to the total amount of infiltrated water.   The Green and Ampt infiltration parameters are the most important parameters in designing pervious pavements using the PCSWMMPP model. The PCSWMMPP model is a Canadian model built specially for designing pervious pavements. This is independent of the type of sub-grade (sand or clay) determining whether the water is diverted to the urban drainage system (clay sub-grade) or deep percolation into the groundwater system (sand sub-grade). The percolation parameter in Darcy's law is important only if the infiltrated water recharges the groundwater. However, this   parameter is also insensitive to the final discharge through the subgrade to the groundwater.   The study concludes by presenting the design characteristics influencing runoff from a pervious pavement depending on the rainfall intensity, pavement structure and sub-grade material and a step-by step actions to follow in the design.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pervious pavement</field><field name="subject">infiltratin</field><field name="subject">infiltration capacity</field><field name="subject">PCSWMMP</field><field name="subject">Green and Ampt</field><field name="subject">rainfall intensity</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070125.164003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of computerised methods of   design optimisation and its application to   engineering practice</field><field name="creator">Adams, Ryan</field><field name="description">The ongoing drive for lighter and more efficient structural components by the   commercial engineering industry has resulted in the rapid adoption of the finite   element method (FE) for design analysis. Satisfied with the success of finite elements   in reducing prototyping costs and overall production times, the industry has begun to   look at other areas where the finite element method can save time, and in particular,   improve designs.   First, the mathematical methods of optimisation, on which the methods of structural   design improvement are based, are presented.

Each method is demonstrated with the solution of a sample structural improvement   problem for various objectives (frequency, stress and weight reduction, for example).   The practical application of the individual methods has been tested by solving three   structural engineering problems sourced from the automotive engineering industry:   the redesign of two different front suspension control arms, and the cost-reduction of   an automatic brake tubing system. All three problems were solved successfully,   resulting in improved designs.

Although the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is not fully   understood, growing evidence links this disease to a state of chronic inflammation, which   occurs in metabolically active tissue such as the liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle and   results in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, of which interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one. It is   generally accepted that elevations in the plasma and/or tissue of this family of cytokines have   a negative effect on whole body glucose homeostasis. While there is compelling evidence for   the negative effects of resistin and TNF-&#225; on insulin sensitivity, the role of IL-6 in the   etiology of insulin resistance is not fully understood. The notion of negative effects of IL-6 in   metabolic processes is further confounded by the marked elevations of IL-6 which occur in   conjunction with the beneficial activity of exercise. We firstly sought to examine the effect of   the lipolytic hormone adrenaline on IL-6 expression and release in order to establish whether   IL-6 acts independently of adrenaline in the regulation of fat metabolism. Reporting the   absence of an effect of adrenaline on IL-6, we then investigated the role of IL-6 on metabolic   processes in humans at rest and during exercise in circumstances where lipolysis was   inhibited. Marked increases in IL-6 circulating protein and tissue gene expression were   observed with exercise and further so with fatty acid suppression. In a mouse model of IL-6   depletion marked insulin sensitivity was observed, which was reversed with IL-6 treatment.   In a mouse model with normal endogenous IL-6 levels IL-6 treatment also impaired glucose   tolerance. Contrastingly, in a rat model both chronic and acute IL-6 treatment improved   glucose tolerance   In summary, studies from this thesis suggest that, rather than being causally related to insulin   resistance, the cytokine IL-6 increases lipolysis, fat oxidation, and glucose metabolism in   insulin sensitive tissues in humans. This does not appear to be the case in the mouse, where   contrasting actions are observed, perhaps due to differences in the reliance of various   parameters for metabolic processes between the species.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IL-6</field><field name="subject">insulin</field><field name="subject">glucose</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="subject">fat metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070131.121620</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Molecular Bases of Training Adaptation</field><field name="creator">Coffey, Vernon Glenn</field><field name="description">The molecular events that promote or inhibit specific training adaptations (i.e. skeletal muscle   hypertrophy or mitochondrial biogenesis) are not completely understood. Accordingly, there   is a need to better define both the acute and chronic responses to divergent exercise stimuli in   order to elucidate the specific molecular mechanisms that ultimately determine skeletal   muscle phenotype. Therefore, the primary aims of the studies undertaken for this thesis were to   examine the acute molecular adaptation responses in skeletal muscle following resistance and   endurance training.   In order to determine the acute molecular events following repeated bouts of exercise,   the study described in Chapter Two compared a high-frequency stacked training regimen   designed to generate a summation of transient exercise-induced signalling responses with a   conventional-frequency resistance training protocol. Groups (n= 6) of Sprague-Dawley rats   performed either high-frequency training (four exercise bouts consisting of 3 - 10 repetitions   separated by 3 h) or conventional-frequency training (three exercise bouts consisting of 4 - 10   repetitions with 48 h between sessions). Protocols were matched for total work, and   repetitions were performed at 75% one-repetition maximum with 3 min recovery between   sets. White quadriceps muscle was extracted 3 h after every training bout, and 24 and 48 h   following the final exercise session of each protocol. AKT phosphorylation was significantly   decreased 3 h following the 2nd bout of high-frequency training, an effect that persisted until   48 h after the final exercise bout (P less than 0.05), while the phosphorylation state of this kinase was   unchanged with conventional training. These results suggest that high-frequency training   suppressed IGF-1 mediated signalling. Furthermore, high-frequency training generated   sustained and coordinated increases in TNF&#225; and IKK phosphorylation (P less than 0.05), indicating   an extended response of inflammatory signalling pathways. Conversely, and irrespective of an   initial increase after the first bout of exercise, TNF&#225; signalling ultimately returned to control   Abstract   values by DAY 5 of conventional-frequency training, indicative of a rapid adaptation to the   exercise stimulus. Notably, despite differential AKT activation there were similar increases in   p70 S6K phosphorylation with both training protocols. These results indicate high-frequency   resistance training extends the transient activation of inflammatory cytokine-mediated   signalling and results in a persistent suppression of AKT phosphorylation, but these events do   not appear to inhibit kinase activity proximal to translation initiation.   The aim of the study described in Chapter Three was to determine the effect of prior   training history on selected signalling responses after an acute bout of resistance and   endurance exercise. Following 24 h diet / exercise control 13 male subjects (7 strength-trained   and 6 endurance-trained) performed a random order of either resistance (8 x 5 maximal leg   extensions) or endurance exercise (1 h cycling at 70% peak O2 uptake). Muscle biopsies were   taken from the vastus lateralis at rest, immediately and 3 h post-exercise. AMPK   phosphorylation increased after cycling in strength-trained, but not endurance-trained subjects   (P less than 0.05). Conversely, AMPK was elevated following resistance exercise in endurance-, but   not strength-trained subjects (P less than 0.05). Thus, AMPK was elevated only when subjects   undertook a bout of exercise in a mode of training to which they were unaccustomed.   Surprisingly, there was no change in AKT phosphorylation following resistance exercise   regardless of the training background of the subjects. In the absence of increased AKT   phosphorylation, resistance exercise induced an increase in p70 S6K and ribosomal S6 protein   phosphorylation in endurance-trained but not strength-trained subjects (Pless than 0.05). AKT   phosphorylation was increased in endurance-trained, but not strength-trained subjects after   cycling (P less than 0.05).

While both these fields provide a rich source of general information, it is difficult to find research texts that specifically deal with teaching adults in a seminar environment, that is, a planned, one-off learning event ranging in length from three hours to two days. While some research has focused on Thai culture in general and the nature of Thai university teaching in particular, very little has been published concerning the teaching of Thai adults, whether in a formal setting such as a university or college, or in a non-formal, work-place or work-related setting. This research reflects an effort to compensate for this pronounced lack of research in teaching adults in a short course environment and the paucity of research on teaching Thai  adults.   Using a case-study method, fifteen Western or Western-educated Thai trainers in the Thai short-course market were interviewed to determine the characteristics of an effective short-course trainer instructing courses in English. Based on a semi-structured interview format, with questions framed from the literature review, eight key characteristics were determined that reflect the qualities of an effective trainer in the Thai market.   Centered on the vital role played by trainers' knowledge of the participants and their culture, the characteristics identified by the research highlight the need to foreground key aspects of participant culture when planning and presenting a short course in the Thai business community. While content expertise and teaching skills remain important, the key to effectiveness lies in acquiring and skillfully applying a knowledge of participants that goes beyond needs analysis to include a generic knowledge of the social norms that identify Thais as a cultural group throughout the training process.   The eight characteristics are discussed in detail, and while some aspects of these are consistent with the conventional wisdom discussed in the literature review, most arose from the analyses of comments provided by the interviewees. This discussion leads into a number of recommendations for new trainers in this market and concludes with insights into further areas of study that could prove useful in Thai and other cultures, and for educators involved in short- or long-course events.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adult education</field><field name="subject">seminar environment</field><field name="subject">teaching Thai adults</field><field name="subject">Thai culture</field><field name="subject">effective trainer qualities</field><field name="subject">short courses</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070201.162658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forecasting Urban Residential Water   Demand</field><field name="creator">Gato, Shirley</field><field name="description">The city of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia has been recognised as having high quality   drinking water, but like other urban cities in the world, its growing population means   increasing water demand. Melbourne is also already on its eight year of dry climatic   conditions and is currently experiencing a drought that forced water authorities to impose   water restrictions after 20 years of unrestricted supply. The current drought, dwindling   supplies and possible impact of climate change highlight the importance of making better use   of this precious resource.   The Water Resources Strategy has been developed for Melbourne, which serve as the basis   for the Victorian Government to set per capita consumption reduction targets of 15%, 25%   and 30% by 2010, 2015 and 2020 respectively. The strategy was developed to ensure a   continuation of a safe, reliable and cost effective water supply that is environmentally   sustainable in the long term. This is in recognition that population growth and water   consumption will eventually require additional supplies of water (Water Resources Strategy   Committee for the Melbourne Area 2002).

However, to initially determine the existence of lasting affects of parental separation (occurring during childhood and adolescence), an exploratory study used a sample of 272 young adults (aged between 18 and 30 years) from intact families and 78 young adults from separated families. This study investigated the impact of parental marital status on young adult psychological adjustment, interpersonal relationships, attitudes toward divorce, and interpersonal behaviour problems. Results indicated that the effects of parental separation on father-child relationships persist into adulthood for men and women. Further, young women from separated families also reported more accepting attitudes toward divorce, and earlier age at entering into de facto or marital relationships. Young men reported more di fficulties in their relationships with mothers, moving out of the family home at a younger age, and higher levels of verbal attack behaviours in romantic relationships compared to their peers from intact families. Importantly, results suggested that both young children and adolescents experience adverse consequences of parental separation, albeit in different adjustment domains. Given these results, the need for intervention was established. While considerable efforts have gone into the development of intervention programs for young children from separated families, few efforts have focused on adolescents whose parents have separated. To redress this situation, this thesis describes the development and evaluation of three forms of delivery of a parenting program for separated families with adolescent children - group, individual, and telephone-assisted. Study 2 investigated the efficacy and acceptability of the Youth Adjustment to Parental Separation (YAPS) program - an empirically-based group cognitive-beha vioural parenting program for separated families with adolescent children. Overall, the results from this initial trial with four mothers suggested that the program was implemented as planned and that the program was acceptable to mothers. Further, the program lead to improvements in mothers' perceptions of adolescent symptomatology and their own symptomatology. However, there was limited or inconsistent change in mothers' perceptions of family relationships, the coparenting relationship, and their parenting practises, and in adolescents' perceptions of interparental conflict, coping, negative separation-related events, and problematic beliefs. Furthermore, adolescents reported   deterioration in family communication and their own symptomatology. Based on the results of Study 2 and the limitations identified, recommendations were made regarding improvements to the YAPS program and to the procedures used to evaluate program effectiveness. According to the recommendations made in Study 2, the efficacy and acceptability of the YAPS program delivered as a therapist-administered individual program was evaluated with six families in Study 3. Results indicated that the program is acceptable to mothers, and that it leads to improvements in adolescent adjustment, parent adjustment, mother-adolescent relationships, father-contact, adolescent exposure to interparental conflict and other negative-separation-related events, and mothers' perceptions of family relationships. Less consistent changes were observed for adolescent ratings of family relationships, and the father-adolescent relationship, however improvements in the father-adolescent relationship were associated with increased levels of f ather-contact. Consistent improvements in adolescents' coping and their appraisal of parental separation were not observed. However, there appeared to be a relationship between parental utilisation of coping strategies and adolescent coping, suggesting that promoting adolescent coping indirectly through parental modelling and parental encouragement is an appropriate intervention strategy. Study 4 evaluated the efficacy and acceptability of the YAPS program delivered as a telephone-assisted program. Results indicated that the program is acceptable to mothers, and that it improves adolescent perceptions of family communication, their own coping, and their relationship with their father. However, mothers' ratings of their own and their child's adjustment, and adolescent ratings of their own adjustment did not change. Further, expected improvements in mothers' parenting practises, the mother-adolescent relationship, separation-related negative-events, separation-related beliefs, and the coparenting relationship  were not observed. Overall, improvements observed in the evaluation of the minimal-contact, telephone-assisted YAPS program (Study 4) were considerably less than those observed in the evaluation of the individual therapist-assisted, face-to-face program (Study 3). Future evaluations of the YAPS program need to address the limitations of the current series of studies, particularly, comparison to a wait-list control group is required so that threats to internal validity can be minimised.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">postdivorce adjustment</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">intervention</field><field name="subject">parental separation</field><field name="subject">parenting</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070202.124553</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The intention to notice: the collection, the tour and ordinary landscapes</field><field name="creator">Lee, Virginia</field><field name="description">The Intention to Notice: the collection, the tour and ordinary landscapes is concerned with how ordinary landscapes and places are enabled and conserved through making itineraries that are framed around the ephemera encountered by chance, and the practices that make possible the endurance of these material traces.       Through observing and then examining the material and temporal aspects of a variety of sites/places, the museum and the expanded garden are identified as spaces where the expression of contemporary political, ecological and social attitudes to cultural landscapes can be realised through a curatorial approach to design, to effect minimal intervention. Three notions are proposed to encourage investigation into contemporary cultural landscapes: To traverse slowly to allow space for speculations framed by the topographies and artefacts encountered; to [re]make/[re]write cultural landscapes as discursive landscapes that provoke the intention to notice; and to reveal and conserve the fabric of everyday places.      A series of walking, recording and making projects undertaken across a variety of cultural landscapes in remote South Australia, Melbourne, Sydney, London, Los Angeles, Chandigarh, Padova and Istanbul, investigate how communities of practice are facilitated through the invitation to notice and intervene in ordinary landscapes, informed by the theory and practice of postproduction and the reticent auteur.  This community of practice approach draws upon chance encounters and it seeks to encourage creative investigation into places. The Intention to Notice is a practice of facilitating that also leads to recording traces and events; large and small, material and immaterial, that encourages both conjecture and archive. Most importantly, there is an open-ended invitation to commit and exchange through design interaction.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">COLLECTION</field><field name="subject">CURATION</field><field name="subject">CULTURAL LANDSCAPE</field><field name="subject">MUSEUM</field><field name="subject">GARDEN</field><field name="subject">SUBLIME</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070202.153732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Additives on the Curing of Phenolic Novolak   Composites</field><field name="creator">Lele, Stephen</field><field name="description">The research programme studied the cure reaction of a phenolic novolak resin and the effects of   various additives and fillers on the reaction. The programme utilised the recently developed   thermal analysis technique of temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimetry (TMDSC)   performed in conjunction with other available thermal analysis techniques. TMDSC enables the   signal for the heat of reaction to be separated from the underlying specific heat change in the   resin. This meant that the reaction could be studied without interference from any physical   changes in the resin.   The manufacture of composite brake materials required the use of numerous additives and fillers   to produce the desired properties. The influence of such additives on the cure rate and final   properties of the resin was known to occur but had not previously been measured due to the   difficulties presented by the presence of opaque additives. Some additives also underwent   thermally induced physical changes in the temperature range of the cure.   The final properties and the processing of new brake materials undergoing development often   required trial and error adjustments to compensate for changes in cure rate. An understanding of   the influence of additives would enable more rapid commercial development of brake materials   through an improvement in the ability to predict both the properties of the product and the   optimal processing parameters.   Processing efficiency could also be improved through detailed knowledge of the kinetics.   Moulding cycle times and post-baking times and temperatures were longer than necessary in   order to ensure adequate cure at the end of each stage because of the lack of kinetic data.   The cure of phenolic resin has been shown to be highly complicated with numerous alternate and   competing reactions. For the manufacture of composite materials, knowledge of the kinetic   parameters of individual reactions is not considered to be important; rather the overall kinetic   parameters are required for prediction. Therefore the kinetic model parameters that best described   the observed behaviour were chosen even though the model had no basis in the molecular   interaction theory of reaction. Rather it served as a convenient tool for predictions.   Characterisation of the resin proved to be difficult due to the presence of overlapping peaks, and   volatile reaction products.   TMDSC was successfully used to determine the reaction kinetics of the pure resin and the   influence of certain additives on the reaction kinetics. The determination of the kinetic   parameters using TMDSC agreed well with the traditional Differential Scanning Calorimetry   isothermal and non-isothermal techniques.   Both the Perkin-Elmer and TA Instruments were utilised for the research and were found to   provide reasonably good agreement with each other. The capabilities and limitations of the   individual instruments were critically examined, frequently beyond the manufacturers'   specifications. TMDSC suffers from a limitation in the heating rate of the sample compared to   DSC. However, it was observed that valuable information could still be obtained from TMDSC   despite using heating rates that were higher than specified by manufacturers.   Hot Stage Microscopy and thermogravimetry were additional experimental techniques used to aid   in the characterisation of the resin. Some inhomogeneity of the resin was identified as well as   differences in the behaviour of the cure between open (constant pressure) and closed (constant   volume) environments were observed.   A novel method of determining the orders of the cure reactions and their kinetic parameters was   utilised. Reaction models for the overall cure reactions were postulated and tested by fitment to   sections of experimental data in temperature regions which appeared to be free of interference   from overlapping peaks. Once an individual peak was reasonably well modelled, adjacent   overlapping peaks were able to be modelled both individually and in combinations by fitment to   experimental data.   The Solver function in Microsoft Excel was utilised to find the best fitting model parameters for   the experimental data. The model parameters were able to be refined as overlapping peaks were   progressively incorporated into the calculations. This method produced results that agreed well   with the traditional method of analysing reaction peak temperatures at multiple scanning rates.   Model fitment was shown to be of benefit where overlapping reactions occur. Various model   scenarios could be tested and optimised to particular sections of experimental data. This enabled   the researcher to easily identify areas of possible anomalies and postulate alternative scenarios.   The accuracy of the postulated model was able to be determined by its successful fitment to   experimental data from experiments run under different conditions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimetry</field><field name="subject">MDSC</field><field name="subject">Hot Stage Optical Microscopy</field><field name="subject">thermogravimetry</field><field name="subject">phanolic</field><field name="subject">novolak</field><field name="subject">kinetic</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="subject">composite</field><field name="subject">cure</field><field name="subject">brake</field><field name="subject">thermal analysis</field><field name="subject">characterisation</field><field name="subject">activation energy</field><field name="subject">prediction</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070205.095402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Therapeutic interventions for lipidinduced   insulin resistance in skeletal   muscle: mechanisms of action</field><field name="creator">Lessard, Sarah</field><field name="description">It has long been known that in addition to disruptions in glucose homeostasis, individuals   with insulin resistance have a breakdown in lipid dynamics, often manifested by elevated levels   of circulating fatty acids (FA) together with accumulation of lipids in insulin-sensitive tissues,   including skeletal muscle. However, little is known about how common therapies used to treat   insulin resistant individuals (such as Rosiglitazone and exercise training) improve skeletal   muscle lipid and glucose metabolism. Thus, the primary aim of the studies undertaken for this   thesis was to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which Rosiglitazone and   exercise training improve skeletal muscle lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity in two distinct   models of insulin resistance. The first investigation determined the effect of chronic   Rosiglitazone treatment on the accumulation of lipid metabolites and enzymatic regulators of   lipid metabolism in the skeletal muscle of obese Zucker rats. The observation that   Rosiglitazone treatment exacerbated the accumulation of muscle ceramide and diacylglycerol in   skeletal muscle, while improving glucose tolerance led to the conclusion that this insulin   sensitising drug improves insulin sensitivity by mechanisms other than reduction of fatty acid   metabolites in this tissue. Accordingly, the second investigation sought to identify an alternative   mechanism by which Rosiglitazone treatment may improve skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity.

The microeconomic reforms aimed to find efficiencies in government and industry sectors, and with respect to the latter, facilitate the development of competitive trade structures across national and global markets. The research provides a critical narrative account of the development and outcomes of the microeconomic reform of building regulation between 1990 and 2003. The microeconomic reform process is examined in the context of the vastly differing approaches of two Australian states, Victoria and New South Wales, with respect to the national reform agenda which was initiated and led by the Commonwealth government in response to the increasing globalization of the national economy. An understanding of what happened and why and how t he states differed with respect to the national reform agenda enabled the outcomes of the reforms to be examined for their impact upon government, industry and the community. The regulation of building construction is a constitutional responsibility of the state governments and has traditionally been controlled by local government. However, control is increasingly being centralized at the national level, in response to international pressures to adopt performance-based regulations, standards and governance systems that accord to neoliberal ideology. This has resulted in a reduction of state and local government involvement in certain building control functions with a commensurate increased role for the private sector; an increase in the complexity and quantity of regulatory instruments; a reduction in government accountability for the standard of building construction; the development of structures to facilitate competitive intranational and international trade in construction-related goods and services and  a reduction in the quality and standard of buildings. The principal benefits of the reforms have accrued to industry and to government and the least benefits have accrued to the community/consumer.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microeconomic reform</field><field name="subject">building regulation</field><field name="subject">construction standards</field><field name="subject">Building Code of Australia</field><field name="subject">performance-based standards</field><field name="subject">deregulation</field><field name="subject">building codes</field><field name="subject">housing quality.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070205.123414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Telling the Stories:   Art Making as a Process of    Recovery, Healing and Celebration</field><field name="creator">Charles, Craig</field><field name="description">I am a Latje Latje man born and raised in Mildura. I am a contemporary artist, a dancer and a father. I began dancing with the Latje Latje dance group when I was four. I come from river country. I spent the first six years of my life on the banks of the Murray River. The river runs right through my work.       During the course of my Masters, I have been spending time in the north of Victoria, in central Victoria and in South Gippsland by the sea in Boonerwrung country. I a man of the river, but since the birth of my son, I have been developing a relationship with the sea. My relationship to the sea changed when my son moved to the sea. My spiritual connection to the sea has grown the more time I have spent there and the more spiritual knowledge I have gained of my ancestral country of the Boonerwrung.      Within this research project, I explore the question:    How can art-making generate a process of recovery, healing and celebration?      In my Masters I have developed two series of paintings, one from the river and one from the sea. The first group of paintings were shown in a nine-month solo exhibition, 'City Style - Country Youth' at Bunjilaka, the Aboriginal Section of the Melbourne Museum. The second group were shown at another solo exhibition  called 'Mungo Stories' held at the Australia Dreaming Art gallery in Fitzroy, Melbourne.          Artefacts      My Master of Arts includes the following artefacts:      &#149;	An Exhibition of Paintings selected from the 63 artworks I have undertaken during the course of my Masters   &#149;	An Exegesis in which I tell the story of my paintings and my research and in which I give an overview of the paintings I have done during my research degree   &#149;	A Digital Story which combines didgeridoo music with a selection of my images    &#149;	Two Audio Tracks, 'Paintings Talk' and 'Grinding the Ochre'   &#149;	A Short Film in which I describe my experience as a contemporary Indigenous artist.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">indigenous art</field><field name="subject">recovery</field><field name="subject">healing and celebration</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070205.150934</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The practical application of McCloud's horizontal 'Infinite canvas' through the design, composition and creation of an online comic.</field><field name="creator">Slack-Smith, Amanda Jennifer</field><field name="description">This research examines the application of Scott McCloud's theory of the Infinite canvas, specifically the horizontal example outlined in Reinventing Comics (McCloud, 2000). It focuses on the useability and effectiveness of the Infinite canvas theory when applied as a practical example of a comic outcome for the Internet. This practical application of McCloud's horizontal Infinite canvas model has been achieved by creating a digital comic entitled Sad Reflections; a continuous horizontal narrative that is 20cm in height and 828cm in length and was designed to be viewed in a digital environment. This comic incorporates traditional comic techniques of gutters, time frames, line, with combining words and pictures, as outlined by McCloud (1993) in his first theoretical text Understanding Comics. These techniques are used to ensure that the project fulfilled the technical criteria used by the comic book industry to create comics. The project also incorporates McCloud's  personally devised Infinite canvas techniques of trails, distance pacing, narrative subdivision, sustained rhythm and gradualism as outlined on his website. These new techniques are applied to assess their effectiveness in the creation of the horizontal Infinite canvas and ability to be integrated with traditional comic techniques.      The focus of this project is to examine the strengths and weaknesses of McCloud's Infinite canvas theory when applied to the practical comic outcome of the Sad Reflections. Three key questions are used to guide this research. These questions are:   1.	Does the application of traditional comic techniques affect the effectiveness of the Infinite canvas when implemented to a horizontal format?   2.	Are the new Infinite canvas techniques as outlined by McCloud able to be applied to a horizontal format and what impact do these techniques have on the process?   3.	Is the application of a horizontal Infinite canvas of benefit to future developers of web comics?      Based on the outcomes of the above questions, this paper nominates strategies, considerations and suitable production processes for future developers of web comics.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scott McCloud</field><field name="subject">Infinite</field><field name="subject">canvas</field><field name="subject">Reinventing</field><field name="subject">Comics</field><field name="subject">Understanding</field><field name="subject">techniques</field><field name="subject">Online</field><field name="subject">Web</field><field name="subject">digital</field><field name="subject">horizontal</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070205.162540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Regional Distribution and   Significance of Stream Turbidity in   Victoria</field><field name="creator">Watson, Dale</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the distribution and significance of stream turbidity in   Victoria; specifically exploring the factors that may have influenced the pattern   of regional variation in turbidity, and factors that give it significance in the   regional, social, cultural and environmental context.   The limits to water availability are set, not only by the quantity of water in   storages or streams but, more fundamentally, by acceptable levels of water   quality and catchment health. To make effective judgements of water   availability managers of water resources need to know the significance of   measured natural resource condition in the regional context.   Stream turbidity can be considered by the agricultural community as a sign of   soil erosion and a loss of agricultural potential, while from the ecological   perspective it can be considered a sign of deteriorating river health.   Fundamentally, levels of turbidity are closely bound with land use practice   and, in the Australian context, turbidity can be considered a measure of the   consequences of land management practices on soil erosion and run-off.   Measured levels of turbidity in Victoria should be interpreted within the context   of a unique history and geography. The spread of European colonisation and   the introduction of massive land use change to the Victorian landscape have   meant that over most of Victoria current levels of turbidity reflect the effects of   over a hundred and fifty years of large scale intervention with its controlling   factors.   In Victoria current levels of turbidity are interpreted in a cultural context far   different from that of early colonists or even of a few decades ago. The   concept of Ecologically Sustainable Development which has dominated   natural resource management in recent times brings new responsibilities to   resource managers. Ecologically sustainable management means that   resources must be considered in a more inclusive spatial and temporal   context.   In the early stage of Victoria's history sustainable management of water   meant having enough water left from winter rains to supplement summer   supply. However, in recent years, it has begun to have more complex   associations; sustainable water use is now, almost universally considered to   include maintenance of the environmental health of waterways, and by   implication, the environmental health of the whole catchment. In this context,   stream turbidity can be considered a useful indicator of catchment health, in   particular, because levels of turbidity bear a direct physical relationship to   catchment processes.   New tools are needed to explore the relationship between land use and water   quality at the regional scale. The results of this current research include a   regional statistical model of stream turbidity, which is conceptually designed to   offer useful predictions of stream turbidity and underpin sustainable resource   management. The statistical model was used as input to the development of a   unique map display using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The GIS is   used to display the distribution of model predictions over a large region of   south-eastern Australia.   The practical advantage of this modelling approach is that it provides   managers with the ability to identify locations in Victoria where measured   water quality differs significantly from modelled water quality and flag them for   further investigation.   The major project outputs are a map of Victorian Water Quality Monitoring   Network (VWQMN) catchments showing catchments in Victoria where   measured turbidity differs from model predictions and a raster representation   of the state of Victoria in which cell values indicate predicted stream turbidity.   Important to this project was the novel use of GIS technology to process large   national and regional scale digital data sets using tools developed for   catchment scale hydrological models.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="subject">turbidity</field><field name="subject">stream health</field><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="subject">Geographic Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070206.150045</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creative embroidery in New South Wales, 1960 - 1975</field><field name="creator">Wood, Susan</field><field name="description">In the years between 1960 and 1975 in NSW there emerged a loosely connected network of women interested in modern or creative embroidery. The Embroiderers' Guild of NSW served as a focus for many of these women, providing opportunities for them to exhibit their work, and to engage in embroidery education as teachers or as learners. Others worked independently, exhibited in commercial galleries and endeavoured to establish reputations as professional artists. Some of these women were trained artists and wanted embroidery to be seen as 'art'; others were enthusiastic amateurs, engaged in embroidery as a form of 'serious leisure'. They played a significant role in the development of creative embroidery and textile art in NSW and yet, for the most part, their story is absent from the narratives of Australian art and craft history. These women were involved in a network of interactions which displayed many of the characteristics of more organised art worlds, as posite d by sociologist Howard Becker. They produced work according to shared conventions, they established co-operative links with each other and with other organisations, they organised educational opportunities to encourage others to take up creative embroidery and they mounted exhibitions to facilitate engagement with a public audience. Although their absence from the literature suggests that they operated in isolation, my research indicates that there were many points of contact between the embroidery world, the broader craft world and the fine art community in NSW. This thesis examines the context in which creative embroiderers worked, discusses the careers of key individuals working at this time, explores the interactions between them, and evaluates the influence that they had on later practice in embroidery and textiles in NSW.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian embroidery</field><field name="subject">creative embroidery</field><field name="subject">embroidery history</field><field name="subject">women's art and craft</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070206.160246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Use of Suggestion   as a Classroom Learning Strategy   in China and Australia: An Assessment Scale with   Structural Equation Explanatory Models in Terms of Stress, Depression,   Learning Styles and Academic Grades</field><field name="creator">Mou, Dai</field><field name="description">This study is innovative in that it draws together the concepts of suggestion   from several cultural groups and develops an inventory to account for   variations the occurrence of scale to studies the relatively new area of the   effects of suggestion in classrooms and compares effect on personality and   academic variables. As new ideas and knowledge become more widespread   and accepted by the community and teaching profession, precision in the   applications of suggestion in the classroom is being seen as more important.   Although new to education, suggestion and similar variations has always been   central to influencing behaviour and learning among pastoral, counseling and   hypnotherapy fields. Teachers who had experience or influence from those   fields or the ideas of Lozanov (1978) or accelerated learning groups were and   are more the exception than the rule. However, as new ideas become more   influential, the influence of suggestion in is becoming increasingly important in   progressive, modern education.   A major goal of the study was to provide a valid instrument to compare   Chinese and Australian differences and similarities in use of suggestion in   learning. It was hoped that such a comparison would provide increased   mutual understanding of values, strategies, practices and preferences by   teachers and students. A second goal was to develop a causative model that   explained the relationships between the measured variables of personality   and learning behaviour and suggestion in teaching and learning.. A third aim   was to make a comparison on effects and performance of suggestion in   teaching and learning in Australian, Chinese and Australian accelerative   learning classes.   This study examined differences between Australian and Chinese high school   Science classrooms in their use of suggestion in teaching and learning. To   ascertain the prevalence and types of suggestion in the classroom the 39-item   suggestion in teaching and learning (STL) scale was developed and validated   v   in Year 7, 9, and 11 high school classes in China and Australia. The STL   scale categorized suggestion into the following types or subscales: Selfsuggestion,   metaphor, indirect non-verbal suggestion, general spoken   suggestion, negative suggestion, intuitive suggestion, direct verbal   suggestion, relaxation, and de-suggestion.   The study involved surveying 344 participants (n=182 female, n=162 male)   from four high schools in Australia and China. A further 374 participants   (n=108 teachers, n=266 students) from six high schools were surveyed for   selecting a Chinese sample in a pilot study. About 284 participants (China:   200 students; Australia: 84 students [includes 8 adults]) were observed for   validation of the STL instrument. All subjects and classes were randomly   selected and were surveyed and observed for the purpose of scale and model   development.   The STL scale was found to be capable of distinguishing different types of   suggestion within Chinese, Australian, and Australian Accelerative Learning   classes. The STL scale was significant as a first scale to measure suggestion   in teaching and learning in Australian and Chinese classrooms. Items in the   scale were strongly and significantly correlated with other items within the   subscales and with the overall scale.   Path analytic techniques were used to explain relationships between the STL   scale, its subscales, nation, gender and high school students profiles on   stress, depression, learning styles and academic grades. Limitations of the   study included problems arising from language and cultural differences as   well as newness of the scale and the field of study. Recommendations for   further study included strengthening aspects of the scale with new items and   further qualitative and quantitative studies on the uses of suggestion in   academic learning and other forms of change in childhood and adolescence.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">suggestion</field><field name="subject">de-suggestion</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">accelerative learning</field><field name="subject">Australian Chinese</field><field name="subject">scale</field><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">learning styles</field><field name="subject">academic grades</field><field name="subject">cultural differences</field><field name="subject">structural equation modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070207.152256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human rights - education and implementation    in a commercial organisation</field><field name="creator">Chambers, Angela</field><field name="description">This case study explored the process of incorporating human rights into the operation of an international commercial organisation. Constructing a dialogue to bridge the gap between human rights discourse and commercial realities, this case study identified the unique roles required to develop dialogue and created a model as a diagnostic and educational tool.      The roles specific to human rights consulting, of interpreter, Champoin and Enabler afforded effective penetration into the participating industry partner's operational levels. These roles emerged from the process of constructing a human rights discourse and tensions therein where the existing theory of organisational change and consulting was found to be inadequate for human rights intervention.      Based on the data of industry partner's existing practices and human rights concerns and on the process of collecting and analysing this data, the model for education and implementation was constructed. It is a flexible tool for examining human rights practices from bottom up as well as top down of an organisation. This research showed that having a comprehensive picture of the complexities involved sas an effective method of exploration and making sense of human rights education and implementation in a multinational industrial setting.      The construction of the roles and of the model relied on the central premise of willingness of a multinational corporation to examine its practices and take an autonomous position of corporate citizenship and responsibility. This was consistent with the participatory research design of the study.      Theretically this research challenges the appropriateness of traditional organisational change concepts when dealing with human rights; provides a diagnostic and educational tool for human rights consulting; and points to further research in this area.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human rights</field><field name="subject">international commercial organisation</field><field name="subject">human rights dialgue</field><field name="subject">diagnostic and educational mode</field><field name="subject">corporate social responsibility</field><field name="subject">corporate citizenship</field><field name="subject">tools for human rights discourse</field><field name="subject">autonomous stance</field><field name="subject">passionate participant  role</field><field name="subject">champoining human rights discourse</field><field name="subject">human rights consulting</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070207.163032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving results of project   portfolio management in the public   sector using a balanced strategic   scoring model</field><field name="creator">Norrie, James</field><field name="description">This thesis suggests improvements, from a strategic perspective, to the practice of scoring projects in public sector organisations. It is argues that current approaches, notably project portfolio managing (PPM), are inadequate for many such organisations, and in fact prone to problems and failure. In particular, present scoring/prioritization approaches in such contexts, largely tend to focus on financial risk/return logic. It is argued that the end result of such a ranking approach is often a non-strategic portfolio project.   To address these problems, the candidate proposed the refinement of the scoring approach for project portfolios via the incorporation of Kaplan &amp; Norton's ideas in their Balanced Scorecard (BSC). BSC introduces, apart from  purely financial considerations, other 'softer' perspectives (customer, internal business processes, learning and growth) which in combination place a more inclusive emphasis on the vision and strategy of the organisation. In this thesis, it is proposed that the combined PPM and BSC scoring approach amounts to more strategic project selection. Several case studies are conducted to illustrate the merits of the combined PPM/BSC logic. These include case studies in both private and public sector organisations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Performance Measurement</field><field name="subject">Strategy</field><field name="subject">Project Management</field><field name="subject">Public Sector</field><field name="subject">Balanced Score Card</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070208.152804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Virgin and the Temptress: Scintillae.</field><field name="creator">Dinas, Heather</field><field name="description">'The virgin, the temptress and the godess' is a visual exploration of love, longing and beauty from the carnal though to the sublime.

These difficulties occur particularly in large geographically dispersed, hierarchical organizations. The management of developing, identifying successful practices, building up and maintaining tacit knowledge, requires an understanding of how these ideas have emerged within the organization through a Tacit Knowledge Exchange (TKE) process. Identification and understanding of TKE characteristics is difficult as they are invisible (tacit).   The TKE process in action requires the adoption of multiple methods and approaches employed simultaneously. A series of cases study instances were used as a basis for the methodology, each contributing specific aspects of the methodology. The initial three case study instances, each yielded specific characteristics regarding tacit knowledge exchange and networking. The findings from the initial three case study instances were tested in a large hierarchical, complex engineering organization. This final case study instance, prototyped a methodology to graphically codify, index and build up in-house tacit knowledge abilities through mapping staff knowledge. The final case study instance allowed for investigations into what these TKE characteristics of a complex organization would utilize To date, specific TKE characteristics have not been well understood. This research contributed to specific understanding of the identification TKE characteristics and network structures.

Judder   is usually perceived by the driver as minor to severe vibrations transferred   through the chassis during braking [1-9].   In this research, DTV is investigated via the use of a Smart Brake Pad (SBP).   The SBP is a tool that will enable engineers to better understand the processes   which occur in the harsh and confined environment that exists between   the brake pad and disc whilst braking. It is also a tool that will enable engineers   to better understand the causes of DTV and stick-slip the initiators of   low and high frequency vibration in motor vehicle brakes. Furthermore, the   technology can equally be used to solve many other still remaining mysteries   in automotive, aerospace, rail or anywhere where two surfaces may come in   contact.   The SBP consists of sensors embedded into an automotive brake pad enabling   it to measure pressure between the brake pad and disc whilst braking. The   two sensor technologies investigated were Thick Film (TF) and Fibre Optic   (FO) technologies. Each type was tested individually using a Material Testing   System (MTS) at room and elevated temperatures. The chosen SBP was then   successfully tested in simulated driving conditions.   A preliminary mathematical model was developed and tested for the TF sensor   and a novel Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model for the FO sensor.   A new method called the Total Expected Error (TEE) method was also developed   to simplify the sensor specification process to ensure consistent comparisons   are made between sensors.

There remain outstanding issues concerning the dynamics and control of ATC systems that are inhibiting the near-term demonstration of these applications. The development of simplified representations of ATC systems that retain the important dynamics, yet are simple enough for use in control system development is limited. Likewise, little research exists into the development of controllers for ATC systems, especially the development of towing strategies and cable-based control techniques for rendezvous and payload transportation. Thus, this thesis presents novel research into the development of control strategies and simulation facilities that redress these two major anomalies, thereby overcoming a number of hitherto unresolved issues.        The primary objective of this thesis is to develop innovative non-linear optimal control systems to manoeuvre a cable towed beneath an aircraft to transport payloads both to and from surface locations. To appropriately satisfy this objective, accurate and efficient modelling capabilities are proposed, yielding the equations of motion for numerous models of the ATC system. A series of techniques for improving the representativeness of simple dynamical models were developed. The benefits of using these procedures were shown to be significant and possible without undue complexity or computational expense. Use of such techniques result in accurate simulations and allow representative control systems to be designed.       A series of single and multi-phase non-linear optimal control problems for ATC systems are then formally proposed, which were converted into non-linear programming problems using direct transcription for expedient solution. The possibility of achieving accurate, numerous instantaneous rendezvous of the cable tip with desired surface locations on the ground, in two and three-dimensions, is successfully demonstrated. This was achieved through the use of deployment and retrieval control of the cable and/or aircraft manoeuvring. The capability of the system to safely and accurately transport payloads to and from the surface via control of the cable and/or aircraft manoeuvring is also established. A series of parametric studies were conducted to establish the impact that various parameters have on the ability of the system to perform various rendezvous and payload transportation operations.  This allowed important insights into to the nature of the system to be examined.       In order for the system to perform rendezvous and payload transportation operations in the presence of wind gusts, a number of simple closed loop optimal feedback controllers were developed. These feedback controllers are based on the linear quadratic regulator control methodology. A preliminary indication of the robustness of ATC systems to wind gusts is provided for through a succession of parametric investigations. The performance of the closed-loop system demonstrates that precise and robust control of the ATC system can be achieved for a wide variety of operating conditions. The research presented in this thesis will provide a solid foundation for further advancing the development of aerial tether payload transportation technology.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aerial tethers</field><field name="subject">nonlinear optimal control</field><field name="subject">dynamic modelling</field><field name="subject">payload transportation operations</field><field name="subject">feedback control</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070209.144754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Composite Reinforcement for Naval Ships: Concept Design, Analysis and Demonstration</field><field name="creator">Grabovac, Ivan</field><field name="description">This thesis outlines the development of composite reinforcement technology for a ship's aluminium alloy superstructure. The work objective aimed to alleviate stress   concentration in parts of the superstructure prone to fatigue-induced cracking. This is a   novel approach to ship repair, which promises reduction in the cost of maintenance   primarily due to greater efficiency and lower cost of repair.   The work was conducted over approximately 12 years. It commenced in the late 80s   with laboratory research and development and concluded in 2000 after completion of a seven-year trial on board a navy ship. Two carbon fibre composites, (5 m x 1 m   consisting of a 25-ply laminate), were adhesively bonded to the 02-deck on the port and   starboard sides. It was found that upgrading the structure using composites was   effective, making it able to withstand service fatigue stresses. Finite element modelling and strain measurements on board the ship showed that critical stress concentration   could be alleviated through stress redistribution. For the duration of the trial, no   cracking of aluminium alloy deck in the vicinity of the reinforcements was reported.   Both composite reinforcements exhibited good performance and remained in service after the end of the trial.   However, the marine environment did cause some non-structural, edge debonding of the   glass fibre reinforced overlay at the composite-metal interface. This overlay was   designed to provide surface protection to the underlaying carbon reinforcement. Bond   degradation was patchy. It occurred after about three years in service, most probably   due to a combination of thermal cycling (solar heating/cooling) and water ingress at the   interface. A new edge sealing method restored its durability and it required no further   attention.   This experiment was successfully demonstrated on board an active navy ship. The work   proved that an effective and durable repair of a ship structure using non-metallic repair   technology is feasible. Composite reinforcements prevented deck cracking and removed   any need for welded repairs, thereby reducing the cost of ship maintenance.

While large resources are allocated   for well designed spaces with the right choices of colour and lighting conditions, there is little   scientific evidence that supports these choices.   Although the literature on light and colour is extensive, it does not present a uniform set of   findings for a consistent perspective on the influence of colour and light. Most of the research   reported in this field uses subjective measures to study the emotional effects of light and colour   on people. It has been reported in literature that emotion manifests itself in three separate   sections; (i) physiological (i.e. objective measures), (ii) psychological (subjective measures),   (iii) behavioral, and it is necessary that studies not be limited to the assessment of a single   response but include sample measures from each of the three manifestations.   This research is built on the current body of knowledge that there is a need for a study on the   emotional effects of light and colour on people using physiological and psychological measures,   to ensure the objectivity and reproductivity of the experiments.   It is well documented in literature that there is close correlation between emotions, heart   rate (HR), and skin conductance (SC). Hence HR and SC are expected to be good physiological   measures of environmental conditions on people. Thus this thesis reports changes in the HR, SC   and self-assessment reports of arousal and valence (SAM) for people when exposed to different   colour and intensity lights. The aim is to help provide an objective rationale for the choice for   light intensity and colour by architects, interior designers and other professionals.      The experiments were conducted on 15 participants who were exposed to 8 different colour   and intensity light conditions. The participants' HR and SC were recorded under each colour   and intensity light, and they were asked to complete SAM.   The research demonstrates that there is a change in HR, SC, arousal and valence of participants   due to change in the colour and intensity of lights. However, the direction of change   was subject dependent, where the same colour and intensity light can have different effects   on people. The research suggests that architects and designers of any space must take into   account the individual differences of the predicted users when designing the lights and colours.   It is also seen from the results that some colour and intensity lights have greater impact on   the emotions of participants than others. Although it is not possible to correlate the colour and   lighting conditions to a specific effect on all participants, general effects for some colour lights   were drawn from the results.   It is well documented in literature that HR and SC are a good measure of emotion. However   the results of this study show very high inter subject variation in HR and SC. This is due to   people having different HR and SC in normal conditions. This research demonstrates that the   use of HR and SC to measure the effect of a stimulus on a group of people is unreliable because   it is hard to compare the results.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Colour</field><field name="subject">Electrocardiogram</field><field name="subject">Emotion</field><field name="subject">Heart Rate</field><field name="subject">Heart Rate Variability</field><field name="subject">Light</field><field name="subject">Lighting</field><field name="subject">Self</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070213.160424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient Index Maintenance for Text Databases</field><field name="creator">Lester, Nicholas</field><field name="description">All practical text search systems use inverted indexes to quickly resolve user queries. Offline   index construction algorithms, where queries are not accepted during construction, have   been the subject of much prior research. As a result, current techniques can invert virtually   unlimited amounts of text in limited main memory, making efficient use of both time and   disk space. However, these algorithms assume that the collection does not change during the   use of the index.   This thesis examines the task of index maintenance, the problem of adapting an inverted   index to reflect changes in the collection it describes. Existing approaches to index   maintenance are discussed, including proposed optimisations. We present analysis and empirical   evidence suggesting that existing maintenance algorithms either scale poorly to large   collections, or significantly degrade query resolution speed. In addition, we propose a new   strategy for index maintenance that trades a strictly controlled amount of querying efficiency   for greatly increased maintenance speed and scalability. Analysis and empirical results are   presented that show that this new algorithm is a useful trade-off between indexing and querying   efficiency. In scenarios described in Chapter 7, the use of the new maintenance algorithm   reduces the time required to construct an index to under one sixth of the time taken by   algorithms that maintain contiguous inverted lists.   In addition to work on index maintenance, we present a new technique for accumulator   pruning during ranked query evaluation, as well as providing evidence that existing   approaches are unsatisfactory for collections of large size. Accumulator pruning is a key   problem in both querying efficiency and overall text search system efficiency. Existing approaches   either fail to bound the memory footprint required for query evaluation, or suffer   loss of retrieval accuracy. In contrast, the new pruning algorithm can be used to limit the   memory footprint of ranked query evaluation, and in our experiments gives retrieval accuracy   not worse than previous alternatives.   The results presented in this thesis are validated with robust experiments, which utilise   collections of significant size, containing real data, and tested using appropriate numbers   of real queries. The techniques presented in this thesis allow information retrieval applications   to efficiently index and search changing collections, a task that has been historically   problematic.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">text indexing</field><field name="subject">search engines</field><field name="subject">index construction</field><field name="subject">index update</field><field name="subject">accumulator pruning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070214.154933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Property Valuation Model for Rural Victoria</field><field name="creator">Hayles, Kelly</field><field name="description">Licensed valuers in the State of Victoria, Australia currently appraise rural land using manual techniques.  Manual techniques typically involve site visits to the property, liaison with property owners through interview, and require a valuer experienced in agricultural properties to determine a value.  The use of manual techniques typically takes longer to determine a property value than for valuations performed using automated techniques, providing appropriate data are available.  Manual methods of valuation can be subjective and lead to bias in valuation estimates, especially where valuers have varying levels of experience within a specific regional area.  Automation may lend itself to more accurate valuation estimates by providing greater consistency between valuations.  Automated techniques presently in use for valuation include artificial neural networks, expert systems, case based reasoning and multiple regression analysis.  The latter technique appears mo st widely used for valuation.       The research aimed to develop a conceptual rural property valuation model, and to develop and evaluate quantitative models for rural property valuation based on the variables identified in the conceptual model.  The conceptual model was developed by examining peer research, Valuation Best Practice Standards, a standard in use throughout Victoria for rating valuations, and rural property valuation texts.   Using data that are only available digitally and publicly, the research assessed this conceptualisation using properties from four LGAs in the Wellington and Wimmera Catchment Management Authority (CMAs) areas in Victoria.  Cluster analysis was undertaken to assess if the use of sub-markets, that are determined statistically, can lead to models that are more accurate than sub-markets that have been determined using geographically defined areas.        The research is divided into two phases; the 'available data phase' and the 'restricted data phase'.  The 'available data phase' used publicly available digital data to build quantitative models to estimate the value of rural properties.  The 'restricted data phase' used data that became available near the completion of the research.      The research examined the effect of using statistically derived sub-markets as opposed to geographically derived ones for property valuation.  Cluster analysis was used during both phases of model development and showed that one of the clusters developed in the available data phase was superior in its model prediction compared to the models produced using geographically derived regions.        A number of limitations with the digital property data available for Victoria were found.  Although GIS analysis can enable more property characteristics to be derived and measured from existing data, it is reliant on having access to suitable digital data.  The research also identified limitations with the metadata elements in use in Victoria (ANZMETA DTD version 1).      It is hypothesised that to further refine the models and achieve greater levels of price estimation, additional properties would need to be sourced and added to the current property database.  It is suggested that additional research needs to address issues associated with sub-market identification. If results of additional modelling indicated significantly different levels of price estimation, then these models could be used with manual techniques to evaluate manually derived valuation estimates.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="subject">data integration</field><field name="subject">regression analysis</field><field name="subject">cluster analysis</field><field name="subject">property valuation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070221.150256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of Multilayered Surface Acoustic Wave Devices for Gas Sensing Applications: Employing piezoelectric intermediate and nanocrystalline metal oxide sensitive layers</field><field name="creator">Ippolito, Samuel James</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the author proposes and develops novel multilayered Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) devices with unique attributes for gas sensing applications. The design, simulation, fabrication and gas sensing performance of three multilayered SAW structures has been undertaken. The investigated structures are based on two substrates having high electromechanical coupling coefficient: lithium niobate (LiNbO3) and lithium tantalate (LiTaO3), with a piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) intermediate layer. Sensitivity towards target gas analytes is provided by thin film indium oxide (InOx) or tungsten trioxide (WO3). The high performance of the gas sensors is achieved by adjusting the intermediate ZnO layer thickness. Sensitivity calculations, undertaken with perturbation theory illustrate how the intermediate ZnO layer can be employed to modify the velocity-permittivity product of the supported SAW modes, resulting in highly sensitive conductometric SAW gas sensors.       The work contained within this thesis addresses a broad spectrum of issues relating to multilayered SAW gas sensors. Topics include finite-element modelling, perturbation theory, micro-fabrication, metal oxide deposition, material characterisation and experiential evaluation of the layered SAW sensors towards nitrogen dioxide (NO2), hydrogen (H2) and ethanol gas phase analytes. The development of two-dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) finite-element models provides a deep insight and understanding of acoustic wave propagation in layered anisotropic media, whilst also illustrating that the entire surface of the device can and should be used as the active sensing area. Additionally, the unique and distinctive surface morphology of the layered structures are examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The crystalline structure and orientation of the ZnO and WO3 layers are also examined by X-ray Diffraction Spectroscopy (XRD). The novel multilayered SAW structures a re shown to be highly sensitive, capable of sensing NO2 and ethanol concentration levels in the parts-per-billion and parts-per-million range, respectively, and H2 concentrations below 1.00% in air. The addition of platinum or gold catalyst activator layers on the WO3 sensitive layer is shown to improve sensitivity and dynamic performance, with response magnitudes up to 50 times larger than bare WO3. The gas sensing performance of the investigated structures provide strong evidence that high sensitivity can be achieved utilising multilayered SAW structures for conductometric gas sensing applications.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surface Acoustic Wave</field><field name="subject">SAW</field><field name="subject">layered</field><field name="subject">gas</field><field name="subject">sensor</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070227.123029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acute and long term interventions to assess the   adaptability of the cardiovascular responses to   orthostatic stress</field><field name="creator">Berry, Narelle Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis comprises of four experiments from which related but independent analyses were   undertaken. The interventions employed were designed to investigate the effect of   cardiovascular adaptation, both in the short and long term on the cardiovascular responses to   orthostatic stress.   The first study, described in Chapter 3, tested the hypothesis that the cardiovascular system   (CVS) could adapt to repeated orthostatic challenges in a single session. 14 subjects were   exposed to ten +75&#176; head-up tilts (HUT) over 70 mins. Each tilt involved a 5 min supine   period (SUPINE) followed by 2 min HUT (TILT). Various indices of cardiovascular function   were determined non-invasively. Cardiovascular responses to HUT10 for the final 30s of   SUPINE and the first 30s of TILT were compared with those of HUT1. Integrated cardiac   baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was assessed using the Valsalva Manoeuvre (VM). Results   showed MAP and DBP increased in both SUPINE (MAP p=0.009, DBP p=0.002) and TILT   (MAP p=0.003, DBP p=0.009) for HUT10 compared with HUT1. TPR increased during   TILT only (p=0.001) during HUT10 compared with HUT1. CO and SV were decreased   during SUPINE at HUT10 relative to HUT1, however, there were no differences in TILT at   HUT10 for either CO or SV. There was no change in the response of BRS, HR or SBP from   HUT1 to HUT10. This study indicated that 10 repetitive HUTs can elicit changes in the   cardiovascular responses to orthostasis, reflected by an increased TPR.   The second study, described in Chapter 4, investigated the effect of the repeated HUT   protocol outlined above on the cardiovascular responses to the squat-stand test (SST). 16   subjects were randomly allocated into either a tilting group that underwent ten +75&#176; HUTs in   70 min (TILTING) or a control group that underwent 70 min of rest (CONTROL). Before and   after the 70 min of either HUT or rest, subjects performed a SST (SST1 and SST2   respectively). The same cardiovascular parameters as those used in Chapter 3 were   determined during both SSTs. The final 30s of SQUAT and the first 30s of STAND (divided   into three 10-sec blocks termed STAND10, STAND20 and STAND30) were compared   between SST1 and SST2, results were as follows. TILTING: during the SQUAT phase of   SST2, SBP, MAP, DBP and TPR were significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) and HR was   significantly decreased (p=0.032) compared with SST1; at STAND10, DBP and MAP were   significantly increased (p less than 0.05); at STAND20, SBP was increased (p=0.03); and, at   STAND30, DBP, SBP and MAP (p less than 0.05) were increased. There were no differences   observed between SST1 and SST2 in the CONTROL group. Results indicated that ten   consecutive +75&#176; HUTs can improve the CVS responses to the SST. This is predominantly   due to an increase in DBP, indicative of a change in vascular resistance.   The third study, outlined in Chapter 5, investigated the effect of lower limb unilateral and   bilateral resistance exercise on the blood pressure (BP) and HR responses in young males. 12   normotensive, sedentary young males were divided into 2 groups; one group exercised   unilaterally and the other bilaterally. Thirty seconds of resting data were collected before   subjects performed 4 SETs of 10-12 reps on a seated leg press. SET 1 was performed at 50%   of 10-12RM, SET 2 was performed at 75% and SET 3 and SET 4 were performed at 10-   12RM. Bilateral resistance exercise elicited greater increases in SBP than unilateral exercise   at SETs 2, 3 and 4 (p less than 0.05). DBP was only greater with bilateral exercise relative to unilateral   exercise at SET 2 (p=0.036). There were no differences between the groups for the HR   response. This study demonstrated that the BP response to bilateral lower limb resistance   exercise was significantly greater than that of unilateral exercise in young sedentary males.   This information could be beneficial to many populations for whom lower BP responses to   exercise would be an advantage.   Following on from this, to investigate long term improvements in cardiovascular responses to   orthostasis the study outlined in Chapter 6, investigated the effect of acute (10 weeks) and   chronic (more than 4 years) resistance training (RT) on the cardiovascular responses to both HUT and   SST. 22 young males were allocated into three groups. The UNILATERAL (N=7) and the   BILATERAL (N=7) groups performed baseline testing followed by 10 weeks of lower limb   RT (performed unilaterally or bilaterally), followed by repeats of the tests performed at   baseline. The CONTROL group (N=8) followed the same protocol except they were asked to   perform no resistance training during the 10 weeks between testing sessions. An additional 7   subjects were allocated to a CHRONIC group consisting of individuals who had been training   for more than 4 years. These subjects only performed the baseline testing. Baseline testing consisted of   a number of cardiovascular tests, ultrasound for vein diameter, BRS via VM, and tests for calf   ejection fraction and venous elasticity. Results demonstrated that neither unilateral nor   bilateral RT caused an alteration in the cardiovascular response to the HUT or SST. There   were no changes in any cardiovascular variable in response to acute RT relative to the control   group. The CHRONIC group had a decreased cardiovascular response to both orthostatic   challenges, with a decrease in SV in response to HUT being greater in the chronic group   relative to the other groups (p less than 0.05) and the TPR response to SST being significantly less   than the control group (p less than 0.05). The CHRONIC group also had a smaller elastic modulus for   the right leg in comparison to the other groups (p less than 0.05). Results indicate that heavy resistance   exercise may cause a decreased cardiovascular response to orthostatic stress and that these   decreases may be controlled by a decreased venous elasticity.   Collectively, these results demonstrate that the CVS is highly adaptable to repeated   orthostatic stress and the dominant underlying feature of this protective adaptation is   increased vascular resistance. Following the repeated HUT the CVS is in a more protected   state and has become better able to defend itself against the adverse consequences of rapidly   applied hydrostatic force. However lower limb RT performed bilaterally (with large increases   in BP) or unilaterally (with lower increases in BP) does not improve CVS response to   orthostatic stress, in fact chronic RT (more than 4 yrs) appears to impair the CVS response to   orthostasis, potentially due to decreased venous elasticity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cardiovascular regulation</field><field name="subject">orthostatic stress</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070228.123618</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mobility prediction and Multicasting in Wireless Networks:   Performance and Analysis</field><field name="creator">Venkatachalaiah, Suresh</field><field name="description">Handoff is a call handling mechanism that is invoked when a mobile node moves from one cell to another. Such movement may lead to degradation in performance for wireless networks as a result of packet losses. A promising technique proposed in this thesis is to apply multicasting techniques aided by mobility prediction in order to improve handoff performance. In this thesis, we present a method that uses a Grey model for mobility prediction and a fuzzy logic controller that has been fine-tuned using evolutionary algorithms in order to improve prediction accuracy. We also compare the self-tuning algorithm with two evolutionary algorithms in terms of accuracy and their convergence times.      Our proposed method takes into account signal strengths from the base stations and predicts the signal strength of the next candidate base station in order to provide improved handover performance. The primary decision for mobility prediction is the accurate prediction of signal strengths obtained from the base stations and remove any unwanted errors in the prediction using suitable optimisation techniques. Furthermore, the model includes the procedures of fine-tuning the predicted data using fuzzy parameters. We also propose suitable multicasting algorithms to minimise the reservation of overall network resource requirements during handoff with the mobility prediction information. To be able to efficiently solve the problem, the situation is modelled using a multicast tree that is defined to maintain connectivity with the mobile node, whilst ensuring bandwidth guarantees and a minimum hop-count. In this approach, we have tried to solve the problem by balancing two objectives through putting a weight on each  of two costs.       We provide a detailed description of an algorithm to implement join and prune mechanisms, which will help to build an optimal multicast tree with QoS requirements during handoff as well as incorporating dynamic changes in the positions of mobile nodes. An analysis of how mobility prediction helps in the selection of potential Access Routers (AR) with QoS requirements - which affects the multicast group size and bandwidth cost of the multicast tree -- is presented. The proposed technique tries to minimise the number of multicast tree join and prune operations. Our results show that the expected size of the multicast group increases linearly with an increase in the number of selected destination AR's for multicast during handoff. We observe that the expected number of joins and prunes from the multicast tree increases with group size.       A special simulation model was developed to demonstrate both homogeneous and heterogeneous handoff which is an emerging requirement for fourth generation mobile networks. The model incorporates our mobility prediction model for heterogeneous handoff between the Wireless LAN and a cellular network. The results presented in this thesis for mobility prediction, multicasting techniques and heterogeneous handoff include proposed algorithms and models which aid in the understanding, analysing and reducing of overheads during handoff.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobility prediction</field><field name="subject">Multicasting techniques</field><field name="subject">3rd generation wireless networks</field><field name="subject">Layer-2 and Layer-3 handoff</field><field name="subject">homogeneous and heterogeneous handoff</field><field name="subject">simulation tools.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070301.130037</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Channelling Behaviour in Batch Sedimentation.</field><field name="creator">Kurt, Nilufer</field><field name="description">Batch sedimentation is a method that enables us to understand the mechanism of compaction and compression of sedimenting slurry. However, batch settling behaviour is a very complex phenomenon that is not easily described fully by a mathematical model. This causes unrealistically large empirical calculations when the thickener size estimations are required.   Channelling, reverse concentration gradients and the initial concentration of the slurry have large effects on batch settling. Existing procedures do not provide clear relationships involving these three significant variables. In this study, batch sedimentation phenomena are examined in detail and possible explanations are given to clarify the   complex behaviour using recent theories. Modern research has shown that channelling is an unwanted formation because channels can change the concentration at the bottom and top of the bed by carrying a great amount of flocs upwards.   Batch sedimentation tests were performed using flocculated slurry of Calcium Carbonate at various initial concentrations such as 250 g/l, 500 g/l, 750 g/l and 1000 g/l to observe channelling and reverse concentration gradients. Flux plots for the batch system reveal behaviour which can be attributed to the upward flow of solids. In addition, photographic methods were used to observe settling processes, channelling mechanisms and flocs in the channels.   One of the purposes of this work was to examine the phenomenological solid-liquid separation theory of Buscall and White (1987), which employs the material properties of the local volume fraction, compressive yield stress Py ()&#246; and hindered settling function R()&#246; to identify the material behaviour in batch sedimentation. Stepped-pressure filtration and batch settling tests were used to measure the material characteristics for the flocculated CaCO3 suspension.   Experimental data were demonstrated using Height versus Time and Height versus Concentration graphs and displayed the possible region of reverse concentration gradients and channelling in the settling bed. Mathematical predictions adopted from Usher (2002) were performed employing material characteristics of the material and graphical documentations were presented. The results of mathematical predictions were compared to the experimental results and the modes of sedimentation explained by Lester et al. (2005).   Fundamental theoretical models and experimental observations highlight that the main driving force for channelling is the high-pressure gradient at the bottom of the bed and the most important factors that cause channelling are high initial concentration of slurry and settling time. The predictions also show that the material and flocculant used for the batch settling tests demonstrate important effect on the settling process. The knowledge and information gained from this study is valuable to maximize the thickening process.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sedimentation</field><field name="subject">batch settling</field><field name="subject">hindered settling function</field><field name="subject">flocculated suspension</field><field name="subject">channelling</field><field name="subject">stepped pressure filtration</field><field name="subject">sedimentation modes</field><field name="subject">floc</field><field name="subject">concentration gradients</field><field name="subject">compressible sediment.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20061220.120258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Empathy and the space between: investigating the role of digitally enhanced apparel in promoting   remote empathetic connection.</field><field name="creator">Heiss, Leah Rose Laurel</field><field name="description">This body of work is the culmination of a two year investigation into the   role of electronically enhanced apparel and artefacts in providing   empathetic linkage between people who do not share physical space.   The research draws from the diverse fields of philosophy,   communications theory, neuropsychology, presence technologies and   technologically advanced textiles, and proposes that a nexus of these   disciplines may provide significant opportunities for enhancing the user   interactivity of garments and artefacts. Remote emotional connection is   investigated through the creation of sensor embedded garments and   artefacts that have been developed in collaboration with a fashion   designer and an electronics engineer. The prototypes encourage remote   empathetic connection through the real-time transference of heartbeat. The exegesis is structured into five chapters which consider remote presence, flexible consciousness, the architecture of empathy, plasticity in sense perception and the development of prototypes. The project chapter focuses in the development of and testing of a rnage of garments and artefacts thatt conduct presence information between remotely located people. The garments sense, process, transmit and receive the heartbeat signal (ECG). They are enabled with ECG sensors, signal processing equipment, small vibration motors and radio transceivers which allow users to 'feel' the heartbeat of a remote friend/lover/relative as vibration through their garment. The prototypes aim to enrich the remote communications experience through reintroducing an embodied, tactile dimension that is present in face-to-face communication. A range of user testing trials are discussed in the thesis which have been undertaken to assess the impact of the garments  at a conscious and a non-conscious level. Conscious experiences were gauged through qualitative testing by way of interviews and unsolicited written reactions. Non-conscious physiological ractions were assessed by recording ECG throughout user-testing periods. This data has been processed by using HRV (heart rate variability) analysis software, running on MatLab.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wearable technology</field><field name="subject">remote presence</field><field name="subject">HRV analysis</field><field name="subject">extended consciousness</field><field name="subject">empathy</field><field name="subject">sensory plasticity</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070112.101632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Uncertainty in Aquatic Toxicological Exposure-Effect   Models: the Toxicity of 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic   Acid and 4-Chlorophenol to Daphnia carinata</field><field name="creator">Dixon, William J.</field><field name="description">Uncertainty is pervasive in risk assessment. In ecotoxicological risk assessments, it arises   from such sources as a lack of data, the simplification and abstraction of complex situations,   and ambiguities in assessment endpoints (Burgman 2005; Suter 1993). When evaluating and   managing risks, uncertainty needs to be explicitly considered in order to avoid erroneous   decisions and to be able to make statements about the confidence that we can place in risk   estimates. Although informative, previous approaches to dealing with uncertainty in   ecotoxicological modelling have been found to be limited, inconsistent and often based on   assumptions that may be false (Ferson &amp; Ginzburg 1996; Suter 1998; Suter et al. 2002; van   der Hoeven 2004; van Straalen 2002a; Verdonck et al. 2003a).   In this thesis a Generalised Linear Modelling approach is proposed as an alternative,   congruous framework for the analysis and prediction of a wide range of ecotoxicological   effects. This approach was used to investigate the results of toxicity experiments on the effect   of 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid (2,4-D) formulations and 4-Chlorophenol (4-CP, an   associated breakdown product) on Daphnia carinata.   Differences between frequentist Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Markov-Chain   Monte-Carlo (MCMC) approaches to statistical reasoning and model estimation were also   investigated. These approaches are inferentially disparate and place different emphasis on   aleatory and epistemic uncertainty (O'Hagan 2004). Bayesian MCMC and Probability Bounds   Analysis methods for propagating uncertainty in risk models are also compared for the first   time.   For simple models, Bayesian and frequentist approaches to Generalised Linear Model (GLM)   estimation were found to produce very similar results when non-informative prior   distributions were used for the Bayesian models. Potency estimates and regression parameters   were found to be similar for identical models, signifying that Bayesian MCMC techniques are   at least a suitable and objective replacement for frequentist ML for the analysis of exposureresponse   data. Applications of these techniques demonstrated that Amicide formulations of   2,4-D are more toxic to Daphnia than their unformulated, Technical Acid parent.   Different results were obtained from Bayesian MCMC and ML methods when more complex   models and data structures were considered. In the analysis of 4-CP toxicity, the treatment of   2   different factors as fixed or random in standard and Mixed-Effect models was found to affect   variance estimates to the degree that different conclusions would be drawn from the same   model, fit to the same data. Associated discrepancies in the treatment of overdispersion   between ML and Bayesian MCMC analyses were also found to affect results. Bayesian   MCMC techniques were found to be superior to the ML ones employed for the analysis of   complex models because they enabled the correct formulation of hierarchical (nested) datastructures   within a binomial logistic GLM.   Application of these techniques to the analysis of results from 4-CP toxicity testing on two   strains of Daphnia carinata found that between-experiment variability was greater than that   within-experiments or between-strains. Perhaps surprisingly, this indicated that long-term   laboratory culture had not significantly affected the sensitivity of one strain when compared   to cultures of another strain that had recently been established from field populations. The   results from this analysis highlighted the need for repetition of experiments, proper model   formulation in complex analyses and careful consideration of the effects of pooling data on   characterising variability and uncertainty.   The GLM framework was used to develop three dimensional surface models of the effects of   different length pulse exposures, and subsequent delayed toxicity, of 4-CP on Daphnia. These   models described the relationship between exposure duration and intensity (concentration) on   toxicity, and were constructed for both pulse and delayed effects. Statistical analysis of these   models found that significant delayed effects occurred following the full range of pulse   exposure durations, and that both exposure duration and intensity interacted significantly and   concurrently with the delayed effect. These results indicated that failure to consider delayed   toxicity could lead to significant underestimation of the effects of pulse exposure, and   therefore increase uncertainty in risk assessments.   A number of new approaches to modelling ecotoxicological risk and to propagating   uncertainty were also developed and applied in this thesis. In the first of these, a method for   describing and propagating uncertainty in conventional Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD)   models was described. This utilised Probability Bounds Analysis to construct a nonparametric   'probability box' on an SSD based on EC05 estimates and their confidence   intervals. Predictions from this uncertain SSD and the confidence interval extrapolation   methods described by Aldenberg and colleagues (2000; 2002a) were compared. It was found   that the extrapolation techniques underestimated the width of uncertainty (confidence)   intervals by 63% and the upper bound by 65%, when compared to the Probability Bounds (P3   Bounds) approach, which was based on actual confidence estimates derived from the original   data.   An alternative approach to formulating ecotoxicological risk modelling was also proposed   and was based on a Binomial GLM. In this formulation, the model is first fit to the available   data in order to derive mean and uncertainty estimates for the parameters. This 'uncertain'   GLM model is then used to predict the risk of effect from possible or observed exposure   distributions. This risk is described as a whole distribution, with a central tendency and   uncertainty bounds derived from the original data and the exposure distribution (if this is also   'uncertain'). Bayesian and P-Bounds approaches to propagating uncertainty in this model   were compared using an example of the risk of exposure to a hypothetical (uncertain)   distribution of 4-CP for the two Daphnia strains studied. This comparison found that the   Bayesian and P-Bounds approaches produced very similar mean and uncertainty estimates,   with the P-bounds intervals always being wider than the Bayesian ones. This difference is due   to the different methods for dealing with dependencies between model parameters by the two   approaches, and is confirmation that the P-bounds approach is better suited to situations   where data and knowledge are scarce. The advantages of the Bayesian risk assessment and   uncertainty propagation method developed are that it allows calculation of the likelihood of   any effect occurring, not just the (probability)bounds, and that the same software (WinBugs)   and model construction may be used to fit regression models and predict risks simultaneously.   The GLM risk modelling approaches developed here are able to explain a wide range of   response shapes (including hormesis) and underlying (non-normal) distributions, and do not   involve expression of the exposure-response as a probability distribution, hence solving a   number of problems found with previous formulations of ecotoxicological risk. The   approaches developed can also be easily extended to describe communities, include   modifying factors, mixed-effects, population growth, carrying capacity and a range of other   variables of interest in ecotoxicological risk assessments.   While the lack of data on the toxicological effects of chemicals is the most significant source   of uncertainty in ecotoxicological risk assessments today, methods such as those described   here can assist by quantifying that uncertainty so that it can be communicated to stakeholders   and decision makers. As new information becomes available, these techniques can be used to   develop more complex models that will help to bridge the gap between the bioassay and the   ecosystem.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ecological risk assessment</field><field name="subject">risk modelling</field><field name="subject">species sensitivity distributions (SSD)</field><field name="subject">probability bounds analysis</field><field name="subject">generalised linear modelling (GLM)</field><field name="subject">Bayesian analysis</field><field name="subject">Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)</field><field name="subject">aquatic toxicology</field><field name="subject">Daphnia carinata</field><field name="subject">2</field><field name="subject">4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid (2</field><field name="subject">4-D)</field><field name="subject">4-Chlorophenol (4-CP)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070119.163720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Employment problems of recent Sri Lankan skilled immigrants in Australia</field><field name="creator">Liyanaratchi, Karunatissa Hal</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to examine the employment situation of recent Sri   Lankan skilled immigrants in Victoria and whether they need further education and   re-training in order to face emerging technological changes or to update their skills.   The underemployment and unemployment problem faced by the Sri Lankan skilled   immigrants is an issue for both the Australian economy and the migrants.   The following set of premises has been used for the study; a) the migrants'   educational qualifications, training and skills are recognised by the Department of   Immigration Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) of Australia, b) they are   having difficulties in finding and keeping suitable jobs, although some have found   employment commensurate with their qualifications, and c) the reason for their   difficulties are many and complex. The essential format of the research is to identify   and explain the many and complex reasons for such unemployment or   underemployment.   This study is based upon a survey of three contrasting Sri Lankan immigrant   groups: a) trade persons and related workers with certificates or no qualifications b)   technical or associate professionals with diploma or associate diploma level   qualifications and c) professionals (engineers) with university degrees or their   equivalent. Subjects for the surveys were through three relevant alumni organisations   based in Melbourne, and through personal contact. The survey was supplemented   with some applying qualitative methods that involved unstructured interviews, and   small case studies.   Recommendations have been proposed to assist in solving the issues that were   identified through the study. Although the recommendations mentioned in the study   provide a starting point, it is stressed that further research is needed to be undertaken   before implementing such suggested solutions. Therefore, this thesis serves as a   foundation in highlighting the loss of services of skilled immigrants within the labour   market in Australia, particularly among the Sri Lankan community, and proposing   recommendations to address this issue.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">employment</field><field name="subject">problems of recent Sri Lankan</field><field name="subject">skilled</field><field name="subject">immigrants</field><field name="subject">in australia</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070214.163019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection and management of redundancy for   information retrieval</field><field name="creator">Bernstein, Yaniv</field><field name="description">The growth of the web, authoring software, and electronic publishing has led to the emergence   of a new type of document collection that is decentralised, amorphous, dynamic, and anarchic.   In such collections, redundancy is a significant issue. Documents can spread and propagate   across such collections without any control or moderation. Redundancy can interfere with   the information retrieval process, leading to decreased user amenity in accessing information   from these collections, and thus must be effectively managed.   The precise definition of redundancy varies with the application. We restrict ourselves   to documents that are co-derivative: those that share a common heritage, and hence contain   passages of common text. We explore document fingerprinting, a well-known technique for   the detection of co-derivative document pairs. Our new lossless fingerprinting algorithm   improves the effectiveness of a range of document fingerprinting approaches. We empirically   show that our algorithm can be highly effective at discovering co-derivative document pairs   in large collections.   We study the occurrence and management of redundancy in a range of application domains.   On the web, we find that document fingerprinting is able to identify widespread   redundancy, and that this redundancy has a significant detrimental effect on the quality of   search results. Based on user studies, we suggest that redundancy is most appropriately   managed as a postprocessing step on the ranked list and explain how and why this should   be done.   In the genomic area of sequence homology search, we explain why the existing techniques   for redundancy discovery are increasingly inefficient, and present a critique of the current   approaches to redundancy management. We show how document fingerprinting with a modified   version of our algorithm provides significant efficiency improvements, and propose a new   approach to redundancy management based on wildcards. We demonstrate that our scheme   provides the benefits of existing techniques but does not have their deficiencies.   Redundancy in distributed information retrieval systems - where different parts of the   collection are searched by autonomous servers - cannot be effectively managed using traditional   fingerprinting techniques. We thus propose a new data structure, the grainy hash   vector, for redundancy detection and management in this environment. We show in preliminary   tests that the grainy hash vector is able to accurately detect a good proportion of   redundant document pairs while maintaining low resource usage.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information retrieval</field><field name="subject">redundancy</field><field name="subject">shingling</field><field name="subject">bioinformatics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070417.160526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a poetics of light: the conceits of light</field><field name="creator">Evans, Megan</field><field name="description">Towards a Poetics of Light; The Conceits of Light is a critical quest to map associations between rhetorical figures, psychological defences and spatial tropes in an attempt to conceive a poetic design that enacts conceit.

Due to the   increase in urbanisation, indoor recreation and indoor schooling many young children have   become isolated from the natural environment. A love for nature and a sense of wonder in   nature is being lost in the hurried childhood. This loss of access to nature impacts on the child's   health and wellbeing, sense of connection and environmental literacy.   This research study explores how Melbourne preschool children experience and use nature   through the environments provided to them in the preschool program. The main environment is   naturally the preschool play yard; however, as excursions also form part of the curriculum, the   child's visit to the Royal Botanic Gardens and the Ian Potter Foundation Children's Garden   forms part of this experience.   Six case studies of Melburnian preschool children have been developed as a means to capture   and communicate the interactions of individual children. Each of the six case studies present a   child or pair of children 'in the moment,' as a snap shot of ecological learning and play   behaviour and are presented as six stories, which allow the child's individual character and   unique experience of nature to be expressed. Issues and behaviours evident in the children's   interactions are then discussed through a framework of the seven ways of interacting in nature,   which emerges from the demonstrations of these children.   This information was collected using research techniques in observation; structured   observations using time sampling and behaviour mapping; participating in conversations with   children and collecting anecdotal observations and children's artwork.   The case studies provide insight into childhood interactions with the natural environment and   the levels of engagement experienced by children, with nature. The six stories, alongside   topical literature, form the basis for deep discussion on the observed ways of interacting with   nature.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">childhood</field><field name="subject">experience of nature</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">botanic gardens</field><field name="subject">preschool</field><field name="subject">play grounds</field><field name="subject">outdoors</field><field name="subject">play</field><field name="subject">sense of wonder</field><field name="subject">exploration</field><field name="subject">memorable experiences</field><field name="subject">environmental education</field><field name="subject">ecological literacy</field><field name="subject">ecoliteracy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070418.102156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Systems Approach to Compliance with Australian   Airworthiness Regulations for Uninhabited Aircraft Systems.</field><field name="creator">Schnellbeck, Anthony</field><field name="description">A considerable amount of research effort has, and continues to be invested into   technologies and algorithms for capabilities which are forecast to be needed in future   uninhabited vehicles.

A homology search algorithm compares   a protein or nucleotide query sequence to each entry in a large sequence database and reports   alignments with highly similar sequences. The exponential growth of public data banks such   as GenBank has necessitated the development of fast, heuristic approaches to homology   search. The versatile and popular blast algorithm, developed by researchers at the US   National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), uses a four-stage heuristic approach   to efficiently search large collections for analogous sequences while retaining a high degree of   accuracy. Despite an abundance of alternative approaches to homology search, blast remains   the only method to offer fast, sensitive search of large genomic collections on modern desktop   hardware. As a result, the tool has found widespread use with millions of queries posed each   day. A significant investment of computing resources is required to process this large volume   of genomic searches and a cluster of over 200 workstations is employed by the NCBI to   handle queries posed through the organisation's website. As the growth of sequence databases   continues to outpace improvements in modern hardware, blast searches are becoming slower   each year and novel, faster methods for sequence comparison are required.   In this thesis we propose new techniques for fast yet accurate homology search that result   in significantly faster blast searches. First, we describe improvements to the final, gapped   alignment stages where the query and sequences from the collection are aligned to provide a   fine-grain measure of similarity. We describe three new methods for aligning sequences that   roughly halve the time required to perform this computationally expensive stage.   Next, we investigate improvements to the first stage of search, where short regions of   similarity between a pair of sequences are identified. We propose a novel deterministic   finite automaton data structure that is significantly smaller than the codeword lookup table   employed by ncbi-blast, resulting in improved cache performance and faster search times.      We also discuss fast methods for nucleotide sequence comparison. We describe novel   approaches for processing sequences that are compressed using the byte packed format already   utilised by blast, where four nucleotide bases from a strand of DNA are stored in a single   byte. Rather than decompress sequences to perform pairwise comparisons, our innovations   permit sequences to be processed in their compressed form, four bases at a time. Our   techniques roughly halve average query evaluation times for nucleotide searches with no   effect on the sensitivity of blast.   Finally, we present a new scheme for managing the high degree of redundancy that is   prevalent in genomic collections. Near-duplicate entries in sequence data banks are highly   detrimental to retrieval performance, however existing methods for managing redundancy are   both slow, requiring almost ten hours to process the GenBank database, and crude, because   they simply purge highly-similar sequences to reduce the level of internal redundancy. We   describe a new approach for identifying near-duplicate entries that is roughly six times faster   than the most successful existing approaches, and a novel approach to managing redundancy   that reduces collection size and search times but still provides accurate and comprehensive   search results.   Our improvements to blast have been integrated into our own version of the tool. We find that our innovations more than halve average search times for nucleotide and protein   searches, and have no signifcant effect on search accuracy. Given the enormous popularity   of blast, this represents a very significant advance in computational methods to aid life   science research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">computational biology</field><field name="subject">sequence alignment</field><field name="subject">genomic search</field><field name="subject">homology search</field><field name="subject">BLAST</field><field name="subject">Basic Local Alignment Search Tool</field><field name="subject">clustering</field><field name="subject">managing redundancy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070509.162443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Correctness-Aware High-Level Functional Matching Approaches For Semantic Web Services</field><field name="creator">Elgedawy, Islam  Moukhtar</field><field name="description">Existing service matching approaches trade precision for recall, creating the need for humans to choose the correct services, which is a major obstacle for automating the service matching and the service aggregation processes. To overcome this problem, the matchmaker must automatically determine the correctness of the matching results according to the defined users' goals. That is, only service(s)-achieving users' goals are considered correct. This requires the high-level functional semantics of services, users, and application domains to be captured in a machine-understandable format. Also this   requires the matchmaker to determine the achievement of users' goals without invoking the services. We propose the G+ model to capture the high-level functional specifications of services and users (namely goals, achievement contexts and external   behaviors) providing the basis for automated goal achievement determination; also we propose the concepts substitutability graph to capture the application domains' semantics. To avoid the false negatives resulting from adopting existing constraint and behavior matching approaches during service matching, we also propose new constraint and behavior matching approaches to match constraints with different scopes, and behavior models with different number of state transitions. Finally, we propose two correctness-aware matching approaches (direct and aggregate) that semantically match and aggregate semantic web services according to their G+ models, providing the required theoretical proofs and the corresponding verifying simulation experiments.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Semantic Web Services</field><field name="subject">Functional Matching</field><field name="subject">Matching Schemes</field><field name="subject">Substitution Semantics.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070511.162143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of Two Planning Methods for Heterogeneity Correction in Planning Total Body Irradiation</field><field name="creator">Flower, Emily Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Total body irradiation (TBI) is often used as part of the conditioning process prior to bone marrow transplants for diseases such as leukemia. By delivering radiation to the entire body, together with chemotherapy, tumour cells are killed and the patient is also immunosupressed. This reduces the risk of disease relapse and increases the chances of a successful implant respectively.   TBI requires a large flat field of radiation to cover the entire body with a uniform dose. However, dose uniformity is a major challenge in TBI. (AAPM Report 17) The ICRU report 50 recommends that the dose range within the target volume remain in the range of -5% to +7%. Whilst it is generally accepted that this is not possible for TBI, it is normally clinically acceptable that &#177;10% of the prescribed dose to the whole body is sufficiently uniform, unless critical structures are being shielded.   TBI involves complex dosimetry due to the large source to treatment axis distance (SAD), dose uniformity and flatness over the large field, bolus requirements, extra scatter from the bunker walls and floor and large field overshoot. There is also a lack of specialised treatment planning systems for TBI planning at extended SAD.   TBI doses at Westmead Hospital are prescribed to midline. Corrections are made for variations in body contour and tissue density heterogeneity in the lungs using bolus material to increase dose uniformity along midline.   Computed tomography (CT) data is imported into a treatment planning system. The CT gives information regarding tissue heterogeneity and patient contour. The treatment planning system uses this information to determine the dose distribution. Using the dose ratio between plans with and without heterogeneity correction the effective chest width can be calculated. The effective chest width is then used for calculating the treatment monitor units and bolus requirements.   In this project the tissue heterogeneity corrections from two different treatment planning systems are compared for calculating the effective chest width. The treatment planning systems used were PinnacleTM, a 3D system that uses a convolution method to correct for tissue heterogeneity and calculate dose. The other   system, RadplanTM, is a 2D algorithm that corrects for tissue heterogeneity using a modified Batho method and calculates dose using the Bentley - Milan Algorithm. Other possible differences between the treatment planning systems are also discussed.   An anthropomorphic phantom was modified during this project. The chest slices were replaced with PerspexTM slices that had different sized cork and PerspexTM inserts to simulate different lung sizes. This allowed the effects of different lung size on the heterogeneity correction to be analysed. The phantom was CT scanned and the information used for the treatment plans.   For each treatment planning system and each phantom plans were made with and without heterogeneity corrections. For each phantom the ratio between the plans from each system was used to calculate the effective chest width. The effective chest width was then used to calculate the number of monitor units to be delivered.   The calculated dose per monitor unit at the extended TBI distance for the effective chest width from each planning system is then verified using thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) in the unmodified phantom. The original phantom was used for the verification measurements as it had special slots for TLDs.   The isodose distributions produced by each planning system are then verified using measurements from Kodak EDR2 radiographic film in the anthropomorphic phantom at isocentre. Further film measurements are made at the extended TBI treatment SAD.   It was found that only the width of the lungs made any significant difference to the heterogeneity correction for each treatment planning system. The height and depth of the lungs will affect the dose at the calculation point from changes to the scattered radiation within the volume. However, since the dose from scattered radiation is only a fraction of that from the primary beam, the change in dose was not found to be significant.   This is because the calculation point was positioned in the middle of the lungs, so the height and depth of the lungs didn't affect the dose at the calculation point.   The dose per monitor unit calculated using the heterogeneity correction for each treatment planning system varied less than the accuracy of the TLD measurements. The isodose distributions measured by film showed reasonable agreement with those calculated by both treatment planning systems at isocentre and a more uniform distribution at the extended TBI treatment distance.   The verification measurements showed that either treatment planning system could be used to calculate the heterogeneity correction and hence effective chest width for TBI treatment planning.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">total body radiation</field><field name="subject">treatment planning</field><field name="subject">plan verification</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070511.163728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an Active Magnetic Attitude   Determination and Control System for Picosatellites   on highly inclined circular Low Earth Orbits</field><field name="creator">Giesselmann, Jens Uwe Michael</field><field name="description">Small satellites are becoming increasingly important to the aerospace industry mainly due to their significantly reduced development and launch cost as well as shorter development time frames. In order to meet the requirements imposed by critically limited resources of very small satellites, e.g. picosatellites, innovative approaches have to be taken in the design of effective subsystem technologies. This thesis presents the design of an active attitude determination and control system for flight testing on-board the picosatellite 'Compass-1' of the University of Applied Sciences Aachen, Germany. The spacecraft of the CubeSat class with a net spacecraft mass of only 1kg uses magnetic coils as the only means of actuation in order to satisfy operational requirements imposed by its imagery payload placed on a circular and polar Low Earth Orbit. The control system is capable of autonomously dissipating the tumbling rates of the spacecraft after launch interface separ ation and aligning the boresight of the payload into the desired nadir direction within a pointing error of approximately 10&#176;. This nadir-pointing control is achieved by a full-state feedback Linear Quadratic Regulator which drives the attitude quaternion and their respective rates of change into the desired reference. The state of the spacecraft is determined by a static statistical QUEST attitude estimator processing readings of a three-axis magnetometer and a set of five sun sensors. Linear Floquet theory is applied to quantify the stability of the controller and a non-linear dynamics simulation is used to confirm that the attitude asymptotically converges to the reference in the absence of environmental disturbances. In the presence of disturbances the system under control suffers from fundamental underactuaction typical for purely magnetic attitude control but maintains satisfactory alignment accuracies within operational boundaries.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CubeSat</field><field name="subject">Compass-1</field><field name="subject">picosatellite</field><field name="subject">active magnetic attitude control</field><field name="subject">attitude determination</field><field name="subject">Linear Quadratic Regulator</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070514.162516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Achieving a Sustainable Water Future for Ho Chi   Minh City, Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Ho, Xuyen</field><field name="description">The current population in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is more than 7 million. Due to pressures of increasing population, the developing economy and climate change, the future security of water supply is far from satisfactory. There is also pressure to connect a large number of customers currently not connected to the HCMC water supply reticulation grid. Current water resources management tends to be fragmented and focused purely on supply side management. It is not economically and environmentally sustainable to focus purely on augmenting supply to meet increasing demand. Sustainable water resources management requires a broader more holistic approach. Government's plans to improve current and future water management issues are examined in the context of two case studies, one from Australia (a developed country) and one from the Philippines (a developing country). The sustainable water management approaches adopted by these two case studies sit at either end of the s pectrum of options. One is closer to a centralized government planning model and the other is a more radical privatisation flavoured model. The thesis investigates the current water demand and supply balance for residential, commercial and industry; and propose a balanced strategy to meet the HCMC's demand until year 2020. The amount of water savings are calculated by implementing a suite of water conservation initiatives.

Maritime operations are often associated with Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) procedures, even though the advantages of conventional fixed-wing aircraft over VTOL aircraft in terms of flight speed, range and endurance are well known.   In this work, current methods of shipboard recovery are analysed and the problems associated with recovery in adverse weather conditions are identified. Based on this analysis, a novel recovery method is proposed. This method, named Cable Hook Recovery, is intended to recover small to medium-size fixed-wing UAVs on frigate-size vessels. It is expected to have greater operational capabilities than the Recovery Net technique, which is currently the most widely employed method of recovery for similar class of UAVs, potentially providing safe recovery even in very rough sea and allowing the choice of approach directions.   The recovery method is supported by the development of a UAV controller that realises the most demanding stage of recovery, the final approach. The controller provides both flight control and guidance strategy that allow fully autonomous recovery of a fixed-wing UAV.   The development process involves extensive use of specially tailored Evolutionary Algorithms and represents the major contribution of this work. The Evolutionary Design algorithm developed in this work combines the power of Evolutionary Strategies and Genetic Programming, enabling automatic evolution of both the structure and parameters of the controller. The controller is evolved using a fully coupled nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom UAV model, making linearisation and trimming of the model unnecessary. The developed algorithm is applied to both flight control and guidance problems with several variations, from optimisation of a routine PID controller to automatic control laws synthesis where no a priori data available.   It is demonstrated that Evolutionary Design is capable of not only optimising, but also solving automatically the real-world problems, producing human-competitive solutions.

In reality, the risk of breaching or failing to meet a standard   of practice, with resultant harm to patients is ever present. Such variations to the   expected standard may result in harm to the patient and be viewed as   unprofessional conduct within the legislative context. The phenomenon of   unprofessional conduct can have significant and sometimes dire outcomes for   patients and nurses and provides challenges to understand antecedents to its   occurrence and the impact on the nurse. From this realisation, the significance of   this study is twofold. Firstly, the literature revealed that an allegation of   unprofessional conduct and the associated experience of being reported to a   regulatory authority can have significant psycho-social and professional impact on   the nurse. Secondly, the phenomenon has received little formal analysis.   The purpose of this grounded theory study was to explore the phenomenon   of alleged unprofessional conduct, and to develop a theory that provided   understanding of the phenomenon and a framework for action. Data was obtained   from in-depth interviews of a specialised sample of 21 nurses in any state or   territory of Australia who had been the subject of notification by a nursing   regulatory authority of alleged unprofessional conduct. Data analysis occurred   simultaneously using the constant comparative method. This resulted in the   generation of a substantive theory, explaining how nurses dealt with an allegation   of unprofessional conduct.   This study found that nurses experienced varying degrees and   combinations of personal and professional vulnerability. This put them at risk of   either making an error, breaching a practice standard, and/or at risk of being   reported to a nurse regulatory authority for an allegation of unprofessional   conduct.   The core social process, a transformation of the personal and professional   self is a process that the nurse both 'engages in' and 'goes through', in response to   the social problem, being reported to a nurse regulatory authority for alleged   unprofessional conduct, and its aftermath. The social process is made up of two   categories: loss of the assumptive world: the experience of deconstruction and   relearning the world. Loss of the assumptive world is comprised of being   confronted, deconstruction of the personal self and deconstruction of the   professional self. The category Relearning the world: the experience of   reconstruction is constructed of the sub-categories, preserving the self:   minimising the unravelling; reconstructing the personal self; reconstructing the   professional self; and living within the world. Consequences of the category   relearning the world are dynamic and influenced by a number of factors. The   ability to transact the deconstructed self and move through the reconstructive   processes and experience can be viewed in the following states, stymied, evolving   or transacted. The personal and professional transformation of the individual   nurse is influenced by the degree of deconstruction initially experienced, the   interplay with the influencing factors internal and external support processes;   resilience; time; and the constant of vulnerability.   The findings of this study have implications for clinical, management,   education and research practices in nursing. It also exposes problems with the   use of nurse regulatory authorities as a punitive strategy for nurses who err. The   uncovering of this substantive theory articulates a process whereby nurses are   transformed personally and professionally in response to a traumatic or   challenging life event. This substantive theory has value in providing a decision   making framework for managing breaches of nursing standards, as a learning tool   to identifying and managing risk in nursing and providing a framework for self   and external support to nurses who may find themselves in this situation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">nurses board</field><field name="subject">unprofessional conduct</field><field name="subject">personal vulnerability</field><field name="subject">professional vulnerability</field><field name="subject">transofrmation of the self</field><field name="subject">deconstruction of the self</field><field name="subject">reconstruction of the self dealing with</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070523.120244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching multimodal literacy using the learning by design approach to pedgogy: case studies from selected Queensland schools.</field><field name="creator">Neville, Mary</field><field name="description">This study uses qualitative research methodologies to explore the ways in which the Learning by Design framework facilitated the introduction of Multiliteracies and multimodal learning into the classrooms of three Queensland middle schooling teachers as they participated in a professional learning project during the second half of 2004. Recent Queensland education policy initiatives recognise the need for students to espand their 'lilterate' repertoires in this increasingly diverse cultural, linguistic, techno, and global-economic based society; an outcome that has drawn attention to the crucial role of professional learning in giving teachers the skills to produce curriculum and pedagogical designs in line with such a goal. While the documentation of conscious pedagogical choices in teachers' approaches to teaching and learning about Multiliteracies and subsequent classroom practice in Queensland has varied according to teachers' individual preferences and conte xts, this study aimed to investigate what differences occurred when teachers deployed the Learning by Design pedagogy to produce a deliberate articulation of the micro teaching and learning conditions necessary for multimodal learning. From the cross-case analysis and interpretation of the research data, five propositions have emerged: the relationahip between the depth and breadth of teacher expertise in multimodality and its effect on instruction/design, learner engagement and performance; the alignment of pedagogical choices to learning goals, pedagogical alignment to learner goals; pedagogical alignment to learner needs and dispositions; consideration of flexibility in preparation of learners in transition points during the middle years of schooling; and the importance of quality multi-supportive professional learning environments to produce reflective practitioners with genuine and purposeful new knowledge. In this research the effectivity of the Learning by Design pedagogical framework was found to be  directly related to the extent of professional learning and expertise that teachers had developed in both multimodality and the theory and principles informing the Learning by Design framework itself. The teaching of multimodal literacy creates an enormous pedagogical challenge for teachers as well as students. The research raises important considerations, therefore, not only about pedagogy but about the importance of developing professional learning initiatives to euip teachers to achieve the policy goals set out in recent initiatives. The highlights the need for the development of an in-depth and wide-ranging approach to the issue of professional learning. It is clear from this research that the Learning by Design framework can be used to transform classroom practice. However, it is equally clear that there must be a greater emphasis on professional learning and more resources channelled into building the groundwork for these new teaching initiatives.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Learning by Design</field><field name="subject">multimodal literacy</field><field name="subject">pedagogy</field><field name="subject">Multiliteracies</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">middle schooling teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070524.142437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Signal Processing Using Short   Word-Length.</field><field name="creator">Sadik, Amin</field><field name="description">Recently short word-length (normally 1 bit or bits) processing has become a promising technique. However, there are unresolved issues in sigma-delta modulation, which is the basis for 1b/2b systems. These issues hindered the full adoption of single-bit techniues in industry. Among these problems is the stability of high-order modulators and the limit cycle behaviour. More importantly, there is no adaptive LMS structure of any kind in 1b/2b domain. The challenge in this problem is the harsh quantization that prevents straightforward LMS application. In this thesis, the focus has been made on three axes: designing new single-bit DSP applications, proposing novel approaches for stability analysis, and tacking the unresolved problems of 1b/2b adaptive filtering. Two structures for 1b digital comb filtering are proposed. A ternary DC blocker structure is also presented and performance is tested. We also proposed a single-bit multiplierless DC-blocking structure. The s tability of a single-bit high-order signma-delta modulator is studied under dc inputs. A new approach for stability analysis is proposed based on analogy with PLL analysis. Finally we succeeded in designing 1b/2b Wiener-like filtering and introduced (for the first time) three 1b/2b adaptive schemes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ternary filtering</field><field name="subject">single-bit sigma-delta modulator</field><field name="subject">comb filtering</field><field name="subject">DC blocker.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070523.163613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The albatross voyage : a study on the effect of the Internet on Expedition   Communication</field><field name="creator">Grainger, Nicholas Vere</field><field name="description">Since the advent of the Internet expeditioners travelling alone or in small groups to remote locations have been using   email and websites to communicate with sponsors, supporters, friends and family. This brings new communication   opportunities to expeditioners and at the same time may be changing the expedition experience.   The author used the experience of participating in an 11-month sailing voyage around the world as a platform for   this research by project. The purpose of the voyage was to raise awareness of the plight of the albatross. The author   examined how the Internet shaped this expedition, the purpose of expedition communication and how meaning was   constructed for a remote audience. Using a constructionist epistemology, a phenomenological approach is used in the   development and analysis of a narrative account of the voyage, its preparation and aftermath.   The Exegesis contains a detailed account of one Leg of the Voyage, from Cape Town to Melbourne, with a particular   focus on the online communications. A full account of the voyage, again with a particular emphasis on   communications, is contained in the Durable Record.   The potential availability of Internet communication was found to have been intrinsic to the design of the expedition   and enabled the Voyage to forgo traditional media sponsorship and yet still attract and engage a worldwide audience   through an institutional community website. The lack of use of the Internet's capability to support online discussion   and build communities on this Voyage and other expedition websites sampled, is explored and it is proposed to be an   expression of these expeditioners' possible disinterest in feedback. The building of online communities around an   expedition website is suggested to be an area of opportunity with the potential to engage site visitors, to enable new   insights to be gained into the life of expeditioners, and to provide greater exposure for sponsors.   A simple classification of expeditions by their leadership, organisation, purpose and membership is proposed and the   differing purposes of communication in each considered.   The use of email on the voyage was found to facilitate and improve contact with supporters, family and friends.   Whilst adding a sense of security it was also found to be time consuming, stressful, power hungry and to build a   sense of obligation to communicate. Its general reliability led to exchanges on non-critical matters and to a reduction   in the feeling of remoteness that some expeditioners may be seeking.   Whilst on this voyage technical and budgetary constraints limited the full use of the Internet's capability to utilise   text, images and sound to construct meaning, the effective and timely use of a short daily narrative, aimed at a   known audience is demonstrated.   The author justifies drawing learning from his participation in the Voyage through the use of experiential learning and   reflective learning theory arguing that the preparation for expeditions, participation in them and mediated reflection   following them, are rich learning environments provided that good records are kept, particularly a frequently written   personal journal.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">expedition</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">albatross</field><field name="subject">phenomenology</field><field name="subject">narrative</field><field name="subject">adventure</field><field name="subject">blogging</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070620.084723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Goose at Goldie's Milk Bar: The Nature of Human Animal Relationships in Three Modern Literary Fairy Tales.</field><field name="creator">Teasdale, Dion</field><field name="description">The Goose at Goldie's Milk Bar is a modern literary fairy tale written in the form of a novel for adult readers. Set in the fictional Australian small country town of Baxters Creek, it tells the story of Goldie Sullivan, an elderly former milk bar proprietor who has an affair with a gigantic cognisant gander.    Goldie lives out the back of the town's old milk bar, hiding from the surrounding narrow-minded community, until late one night she witnesses a bolt of lightning strike the bell tower on the nearby church. When she goes to investigate, Goldie finds the body of a large bird buried in the debris and, believing it is an omen, she carries the half-dead bird home on her back.   As she rehabilitates the bird, Goldie discovers there is more to the feathered creature than she first thought. The bird, a giant gander blown off course and struck down in the middle of migration, reveals an advanced awareness of humanity and the profound ability to comprehend the sorrow in Goldie's life.   Through a shared appreciation of jazz music, Goldie and the goose learn to communicate and a close friendship ensues. Goldie teaches the goose to dance, the pair share baths and the goose moves into Goldie's bedroom. Before too long, Goldie finds herself in the midst of a most indecent affair.   Goldie's relationship with the gander unfolds against a backdrop of other unconventional relationships. Kevin Dwyer, the new reporter in town finds himself drawn to the shire maintenance worker, Travis Handley. Real estate agent Alexander Bourke has taken Lynne Fontaine, the chef at the local Chinese restaurant, as his oriental mistress, and recently windowed farmer, Mary Peddley, sets tongues wagging with the one-legged publican, Jack Diamond.    The novel uses the human animal narrative to explore the premise that fate is driven by unseen, sometimes magical forces that manifest in inexplicable ways to reveal the hidden truths of people.   The writing of the novel has been supported by research conducted for an exegesis titled, The Nature of Human Animal Relationships in Three Modern Literary Fairy Tales. The exegesis identifies and discusses the nature of the central human animal relationships in three novels: Yann Martel's Life of Pi, Peter Hoeg's Woman and the Ape and the writing project, The Goose at Goldie's Milk Bar.   The exegesis identifies and discusses the roles and functions the human and animal characters perform in the three novels through a comparative analysis of the narrative theories of early Russian Structuralist, Vladimir Propp. The exegesis also identifies and discusses the types of transformation the human and animal characters undergo, and conducts a comparative analysis of the theories of English academic and fairy tale historian, Jack Zipes. Finally, the exegesis analyses and discusses the multi-dimensional nature of the bonds formed by the human and animal characters and demonstrates how writers of modern literary fairy tales seek to awaken the reader to the possibilities of relationships with animals beyond usual human understanding or experience.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human animal relationships</field><field name="subject">modern literary fairy tales</field><field name="subject">goose</field><field name="subject">geese</field><field name="subject">milk bar</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20071219.100227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arts'Codes: A New Methodology for the Development of Real-Time Embedded Applications for Control Systems</field><field name="creator">Teitelbaum, Aryeh Roberto</field><field name="description">Embedded real-time applications have to allow interaction between the control computer and the controlled environment. Controlling the environment requires in particular to take into account its time constraints and critical logical conditions.   One of the main programmer efforts in real-time application's development is to trace the incoming events, and to perform reactions based on the current system status, according to the application requirements.  All this have to be handled, although external events may come in the middle of a critical reaction, which may disturb it.   This problem involves two difficulties:   &#132;X	The cognitive efforts to percept the problem, and consequently to express the solution.   &#132;X	The correct translation of this solution to code.   Two requirements were defined in this research in order to achieve high-quality performance: clearness and robustness, clearness in the design, and robustness in the execution.   In this work the author proposes a methodology and a tool for real-time application's development that uses or implies an innovated form of design based on natural-cognitive researches. This design method has clear compilation's rules to produce an Object-Oriented light-code, suitable for embedded platforms.   These compilation's rules introduce to the code implicit security and synchronization's elements, to support robust execution.   In this methodology, clear development phases were defined, using a high-degree of reuse and even polymorphism, which were emphasized in the research.    Several existing ideas were improved/adapted and synthesized together with the author's innovation, creating the Arts'Codes method for real-time application development.   The work includes cognitive evaluations, assuring the natural skills of the design.     Arts'Codes method proposes a natural VPL (Visual Programming Language) for real-time applications, based on hierarchic components. This VPL is built on a minimum of diagrams: one for the static architecture and one for the dynamic behaviour, with a similar restricted notation at all levels. These two diagrams (static architecture and dynamic behaviour) are interleaved in a unified view.  This method was implemented by building a suitable graphic editor, which automatically compiles the applications diagrams in a light and robust Object-Oriented code (based on Parallel Automata FSM), and by building an execution compact software platform.   Furthermore, the parallel automata FSM are translated automatically in PTL temporal formula defining the goals and the behaviours of the components, permitting to prove a-priory that the components behaviours are consistent to their goals.   The execution platform is based on a restricted implementation of the synchrony hypothesis and on a powerful model of execution: the parallel automata FSM.  These Parallel Automata describe the dynamic behaviours of the components and allows implementing run-time exceptions handling too.   In addition, the research proposes a tri-processor execution hardware platform, which supports a hybrid synchronous/multi-threading execution.   This method will contribute to versatile, clear and robust real-time application's development.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Real-time</field><field name="subject">Synchrony Hypothesis</field><field name="subject">VPL</field><field name="subject">Cognitive Factors</field><field name="subject">Compilation Rules</field><field name="subject">OOP</field><field name="subject">Component Design</field><field name="subject">Parallel Automata</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20071219.094115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">adidas's sponsorship of the New   Zealand All Blacks: The relationship   between brand image and brand   equity in sports sponsorship</field><field name="creator">Bibby, David N</field><field name="description">This study explores the relationship between two theoretical constructs: brand image and brand   equity in the context sports sponsorship.

The essay and the collection of papers are placed in the context of development and application of time series econometric models in a temporal-axis from 1970s through 2005, with particular focus in the Marketing discipline.   The main aim of the integrative essay is on modelling the effects of marketing actions on performance variables, such as sales and market share in competitive markets. Such research required the estimation of two kinds of time series econometric models: multivariate and multiple time series models. I use Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention models and the Pierce and Haugh statistical test to model the impact of a single marketing instrument, mainly price promotions, to measure own and cross-short term sales effects, and to study asymmetric marketing competition. I develop and apply Vector AutoRegressive (VAR) and Bayesian Vector AutoRegressive (BVAR) models to estimate dynamic relationships in the market and to forecast market share. Especially, BVAR models are advantageous because they contain all relevant dynamic and interactive effects. They accommodate not only classical competitive reaction effects, but also own and cross-market share brand feedback effects and internal decision  rules and provided substantively useful insights into the dynamics of demand.   The integrative essay is structured in four main parts. The introduction sets the basic ideas behind the published papers, with particular focus on the motivation of the essay, the types of competitive reaction effects analysed, an overview of the time series econometric models in marketing, a short discussion of the basic methodology used in the research and a brief description of the inter-relationships across the published papers and structure of the essay.   The discussion is centred on how to model the effects of marketing actions at the selective demand or brand level and at the primary demand or product level. At the brand level I discuss the research contribution of my work on (i) modelling promotional short-term effects of price and non-price actions on sales and market share for consumer packaged goods, with no competition, (ii) how to measure own and cross short-term sales effects of advertising and price, in particular, cross-lead and lag effects, asymmetric sales behaviour and competition without retaliatory actions, in an automobile market, (iii) how to model the marketing-mix effectiveness at the short and long-term on market shares in a car market, (iv) what is the best method to forecast market share, and (v) the study of causal linkages at different time horizons between sales and marketing activity for a particular brand. At the product or commodity level, I propose a way to model the flows of tourists that come from different origins (countries)  to the same country-destination as market segments defining the primary demand of a commodity - the product</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bayesian VAR</field><field name="subject">Co-integration</field><field name="subject">Cross-correlation analysis</field><field name="subject">Forecasting accuracy</field><field name="subject">Granger causality</field><field name="subject">Marketing dynamics</field><field name="subject">VAR</field><field name="subject">VEC.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20071220.144516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coloured light</field><field name="creator">Dracoulis, Wendy Fay</field><field name="description">This project involves the examination of abstract, geometric paintings, kinetic sculptures, electronic art and installations that use opticality, perspectival space and colour relationships that destabilise compositional cohesion. Works made between 1964 and 1980, particularly those by Victor Vasarely and Bridget Riley are referenced in the determination of how geometric forms, colour transitions, interactions and juxtapositions have been used to suggest movement. This enquiry includes a review of the usage of planar space and the creation of optical effects. Artworks such as Bridget Riley's Chant 2, (1967) inform new works in which  available digital technological processes are utilised. These new works consist mainly of compositions of line and coloured forms and are created in response to the outcomes of the research into the selected works. For example, static works that create movement through the use of colour and geometric form inform the creation of new w ork in media that uses motion. The artworks produced are installation-based works. The works include digital projections and static images that use painting processes as well as digital media.   The objective of the project is to produce artworks that reference painting processes and extend explorations into colour usage designed to maximise optical effects and spatial disorientation.

Cogeneration or 'combined heat and power', in this particular case, involves the simultaneous production of heat and electricity using a single fuel, that is, natural gas. The heat generated is then used to produce steam to meet the customers' requirements as well as boost the production of electricity. Therefore, cogeneration provides greater efficiencies compared to traditional electricity generation methods because it utilizes heat that would otherwise be wasted. In addition, greenhouse gases emissions can be reduced substantially.       The approach taken in this research is to assess whether an improvement in the energy efficiency of the cogeneration plant can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gases emissions. An improvement in energy efficiency means that either:   &#149;	less gas is consumed, thus leading to cost savings; or   &#149;	more electricity is generated for the same quantity of gas consumed, which leads to an increase in income and consequently profit.      Therefore, an improvement in energy efficiency means an improvement in the financial performance.       In addition, a reduction in the quantity of gas consumed or generating as much electricity as possible from a given quantity of gas can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gases emissions which means an improvement in the company's environmental performance.       A case study method, which involves an Australian cogeneration company, is adopted because this would provide valuable in-depth practical insight into the operations and mechanisms of a company that is involved in combined heat and power generation.      A review of the literature and the evidence collected indicated that a cogeneration plant's efficiency can be improved at least back to near the plant's designed efficiency. And, further improvements may be achieved by utilizing the latest technology although this involves capital investment. It is also established that an improvement in plant efficiency can reduce greenhouse gases emissions.       This research then concludes that Environmental Management Accounting can help the case study company improve its financial and environmental performances. An Environmental Management Accounting system can provide the physical information that is not available in the existing management accounting system. Physical information such as the physical quantities of gas consumed, electricity and steam produced, and greenhouse gases emitted, can help the company in decision-making relating to improving plant efficiency as well as reducing greenhouse gases emissions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental management accounting</field><field name="subject">cogeneration</field><field name="subject">efficiency</field><field name="subject">greenhouse gases</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080102.102723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular markers of ecotoxicological interest in the rainbowfish Melanotaenia fluviatilis</field><field name="creator">Ponza, Pattareeya</field><field name="description">The Crimson-spotted rainbowfish (Melanotaenia fluviatilis) from the Murray-Darling basin of Australia is a common indicator species in Australian ecotoxicology. Biochemical changes have been investigated in this species, but not molecular markers of ecotoxicological interest. In this study genes of M. fluviatilis were isolated using a cDNA library and sequences analysed. Of 345 randomly selected clones, 94 shared similarity with 26 different genes in other organisms in public databases. Amongst these, reproductive genes coding for vitellogenin, retinol binding protein, sialyltransferase and zona pellucida protein were considered of interest in ecotoxicology. The vitellogenin gene was selected for study as it has been widely used as a molecular marker of exposure to 17&#226;-estradiol (E2) in teleosts. Gene expression was examined via northern blot, RT-PCR and Real-Time PCR relative to the housekeeping gene (18S rRNA). The expression of vitellogenin mRNA was observed a t 12 hours post-exposure, peaked at 48 hours according to northern blot analysis; and cleared within 4 days, partly consistent with RT-PCR. However, Real-time PCR yielded an inconclusive result, probably due to differences between pooled and individual samples. Vitellogenin in blood plasma was confirmed by western blot, found to be significantly increased and retained in the plasma in fish treated with E2 compared to controls. It was concluded that vitellogenin mRNA is a molecular marker of exposure to 17&#226;-estradiol in the rainbowfish, and could potentially be used as a marker of exposure to environmental estrogenic chemicals. Further investigations of the expression of genes in the cDNA library, could establish other molecular markers of ecotoxicological interest in M. fluviatilis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Melanotaenia fluviatilis</field><field name="subject">estrogenization</field><field name="subject">vitellogenin induction</field><field name="subject">molecular marker</field><field name="subject">cDNA library construction</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080102.121231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self-Orienting Individuals: Subjectivity and Contemporary Liberal Individualism</field><field name="creator">Scerri, Andrew Joseph</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses both theories and practices of subjectivity in Anglo-American societies into the twenty-first century. The central argument is that one dominant subjectivity that has emerged in these societies centres on a deep-seated, almost irreconcilable tension. On the one hand, persons experience relatively heightened desires for unbounded lifestyles amidst relatively high levels of affluence and consumption. Meanwhile, on the other hand, the education, skills, and dispositions that persons assume in social worlds make desiring problematic. For example, high-level consumption or workplace flexibility are not necessarily seen as desirable things, yet appear to envelop contemporary lifestyles. Individuated desires form key aspects of an Anglo-American 'way-of-life', but a liberal individualism that emphasizes personal capacities and responsibilities, 'self-improvement' and 'well-being' has arisen, and this makes resolving ethical and existential dilemmas  difficult. That is, many worldly dilemmas - concerns with material security, social justice, the environment, or nutrition, for example - seem irreconcilable to the liberal individualism that is 'lived' as subjectivity 'on the ground'. The thesis synthesizes social anthropology and social theory to ground its claims about the empirical world that sees subjectivity as 'being' human for particular social worlds. The approach is designed to look at situations that call upon self-orienting individuals, in order to explain how these represent the form of life that an 'immediate' self-projecting and orienting, self-asserting and 'creative' dominant subjectivity takes in Anglo-American societies. The argument develops a number of examples in the context of a theory-based approach in two registers: normative and ontological. Inquiry over an ontological register discusses the social formation of subjectivity in relation to the 'categories' of spatiality, temporality, embodiment, and institutionality, and the social  constitution of subjectivity over coeval somatic, practical-ethological, and reflexive 'layers of affect'. Inquiry over a normative register discusses practical and discursive conditions, and relates the overall argument to a critique of normativity based in the claim that 'being' requires that norm-based and relational contexts can affectively 'legitimate' ongoing sociality. In summary, the thesis has two dimensions. It argues that this dominant subjectivity moves between sovereign desires for satisfactions and their atomized dissatisfactions, and turns on a sustained deferral of worldly dilemmas irreconcilable to the liberal individualism that is seen to both anchor and impel ongoing sociality. Secondly, it suggests that we need to rethink theories of subjectivity in order to understand better this new dominant form of life.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">subjectivity</field><field name="subject">individualism</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">consumption</field><field name="subject">work</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080102.122048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineering your own soul: theory and practice in communist biography and autobiography   &amp;   Communism: a love story</field><field name="creator">Sparrow, Jeffrey William</field><field name="description">The creative project Communism: a love story is a piece of literary non-fiction: a biography of the communist intellectual Guido Carlo Luigi Baracchi (1887-1975). It investigates Baracchi's privileged childhood as the son of the government astronomer and a wealthy heiress, his career as a university activist, his immersion in Melbourne's radical and artistic milieu during the First World War, his role in the formation of the Communist Party of Australia, his changing attitudes to communism during the 1920s and 1930s while in Australia and overseas and his eventual identification with the Trotskyist movement. The project explores the different strands of thought within Australian communism, the impact of Stalinisation on the movement both in Australia and overseas, and the personal and political difficulties confronting facing anti-Stalinist radicals. It examines the tensions between Baracchi's political commitments and his upbringing, and situates Baracchi's tumu ltuous romantic relationships (with Katharine Susannah Prichard, Lesbia Harford, Betty Roland and others) in the context of his times and political beliefs.

It is an area of law that impacts upon a number of stakeholders such as children, parents, law enforcement agencies, the Government and judicial officers.      The research took a small facet of the operation of the Family Law Act 1975, namely the enforcement of parenting orders by police services.  The focus of the research was to unfold the process and difficulties encountered by police services when executing a recovery order issued by the Courts under s. 67 of the Family Law Act 1975.  It further explored police perspective, training and organisational service delivery, in carrying out their duties.      Two qualitative methodological approaches were used in this research.  The main approach used was Grounded Theory.      Narrative Inquiry was also incorporated into the research.  The objective of Narrative Inquiry is to create social context from story telling.  Participants were asked to describe their experiences when executing recovery orders.      Interviews were undertaken with members from the Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) who have had experience with the execution of recovery orders.  These participants were also asked to construct the process when a recovery order is executed and to describe the atmosphere.      In addition, journaling and observations were used.  These observations took place in the Family Court and Federal Magistrates' Court in Victoria.      The findings and relevant literature indicated that police disliked becoming involved in executing recovery orders.  The Police perceived family law in general not to be a central area of policing.  These findings parallel earlier findings from an Australian Parliamentary report in 1992.  Furthermore, the findings indicated that little organisational commitment was placed on the function of enforcing recovery orders.  This was indicated by the limited and inconsistent resources provided by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to fulfil their obligations, and the lack of training offered to police members.      The findings indicated that the Police would take initial steps prior to executing the order.  They would contact the applicant parent to assist with inquiries to locate a child, assess variables such as the potential for violence and arrange with the applicant parent where the child would be delivered.  In addition, even though the findings outlined that recovery orders were fairly non-complex to execute, at times there would be difficulties in locating a child and finalising arrangements for a child to be returned to a parent.      The findings also indicated that there was no clear practice as to which section of the Victoria Police would execute a recovery order if requested by the AFP.        Whilst the findings need to be considered carefully in light of the small sample group, it did indicate that there are some difficulties with the process and value placed by police services within Australia on the execution of recovery orders.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Family Law</field><field name="subject">policing</field><field name="subject">parenting orders</field><field name="subject">recovery orders</field><field name="subject">enforcement</field><field name="subject">family violence</field><field name="subject">domestic violence.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080102.130653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biomonitoring of Trace Metals in the Saigon River</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Ngoc Trang</field><field name="description">This study investigated trace essential metals (Cu, Zn and Cr) and non-essential metals (Pb, Cd and Hg) in water, sediment and tissues of water spinach, snake head fish and swamp eel from the Saigon River. Sampling was conducted from January to December 2004 at three sites. Three water and sediment samples, edible parts of twenty water spinach (Ipomea aquatica) samples (leaves and stems), twenty snake head fish (Channa striata) and twenty swamp eels (Monopterus albus) were collected at each site. Water, sediment and biota tissues were analysed for Cu, Zn, Cr, Pb, Cd and Hg following the method of USEPA, AOAC and NFTA.    Results showed that Cu, Zn, Cr, Cd and Hg in water from the river was not higher than the maximum permitted level for protection of aquatic life by the national standards while the average Cu concentration in sediment was found to be close to the Effects range- low value and within the slightly polluted range (25- 50 &#236;g.g-1 dry weight). The results also showed that the river sediment was considered to be contaminated by Zn and Hg in comparison with contaminated sites in Australia and in Thailand.    In water spinach, no Cu deficiency was found but Zn was accumulated. No accumulation of Cr, Cd and Hg was revealed but Pb was detectable. The results indicated that snake head and eel may have Cu deficiencies.  Pb and Hg were found to be bioaccumulated in the muscle of snake head and eel at some sites on some occasions, but the levels were small. The results showed that metal in sediment liver of snake head muscle of snake head and eel water. The metals in water spinach decreased in the order Zn Cu Cr Pb Cd and Hg; in snake head the metal concentrations decreased in the order  Zn Cu Cr PbHgCd and in eel as Zn Cu Cr PbCd and Hg.   The ANOVA test showed no significant relationship between metals in the water and sediment and biota. Therefore it was concluded that the metals in the selected biota samples did not reflect the metals in the environment.   The essential metals Cu, Zn and Cr were found to decrease at the end of the dry season and then increase at the end of the rainy season.  The seasonal variations of metals in the river and biota maybe a result of the change of temperature in the area and the need for essential metals in the reproduction of fish.   The results of this study clearly demonstrates that water spinach, snake head fish and swamp eel are not potential bio-indicators for metals in the Saigon River since they did not reflect concentrations of metals in their environment. It was also concluded based on consumption rates that water spinach, snake headfish and eel from the Saigon River do not present any potential health risk to consumers. However, attention should be paid to controlling the load of pollutants entering the river to avoid such risks and future problems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomonitoring</field><field name="subject">Saigon River</field><field name="subject">trace metals</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080102.144317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of Gender-Emotion Stereotypes on Emotional Communication of Affective Agents</field><field name="creator">Tan, Boon Kuang</field><field name="description">With the rapid advancement of affective agents, there is an increasing interest in enhancing agent's emotional communication and maximizing social response from users. This thesis investigates the influence of gender-emotion stereotypes on the communicating of emotional events by affective agents.               One hundred and twenty-eight undergraduates with equal number of males and females, successfully participated in a 2 (affective agent's gender: male vs. female) x 2 (participant's gender: male and female) between-subjects experiment with twenty emotional events conveying four gender-stereotypic emotions presented by affective agents as within-subject factors. Significant main effects demonstrated that participants perceived affective agents to be exhibiting greater emotional intensity in stereotypic emotional events that were gender-consistent compared to those that were gender-inconsistent. On the other hand, participants experienced a higher level of message involvement and perceived affective agents to be exhibiting greater social presence and trustworthiness in stereotypic emotional events that were gender- inconsistent compared to those that were gender-consistent. In addition, female participants were found to possess greater sensitivity in the perception of emotional intensity and social pre sence than male participants in all stereotypic emotional events communicated by affective agents.             The findings of the thesis suggest that appropriate matching of affective agent's gender with the stereotypic emotional events that it is communicating is critical in enhancing human-agent communication.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agents</field><field name="subject">human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">emotions</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080102.144955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The diversification benefits and the risk and return relationships in the Chinese A-share market</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yuenan</field><field name="description">China's rapid economic growth and the development of its domestic stock market have attracted considerable attention from foreign investors. China's economic financial expansion, however, has emerged from an environment of state planning and radical socialist ideology. With a view of providing investors with a better understanding of the risk and return relationship in the Chinese A-share market over the past decade, this thesis adapts several empirical models to the circumstances in China and conducts four empirical analyses.            First, in order to rationalize foreign investors' entry into the A-share market, the thesis compares the diversification benefits in three China-related stock markets, namely the A-share, the B-share and the H-share markets in a mean-variance framework using daily, weekly and monthly data respectively. The results suggest that of the three stock markets, the B-share market generates the highest average annual returns while the A-share market has the most significant diversification benefits regardless of whether the analysis is undertaken implementing a traditional mean-variance framework or a downside risk framework.            Next, an empirical analysis using the Fama and MacBeth two-pass procedure is undertaken to test the relationship between beta, firm factors and stock returns. Similar to the findings in other stock markets, the results of this analysis show that the static betas for individual stocks fail to capture variation in stock returns in the A-share market. In contrast, the effects of book-to-market and trading volume are significant in the sample period. However, the fact that none of these factors have a persistent role in explaining stock returns suggests a possible change in the investment philosophy of Chinese domestic investors over the past decade. In the third analysis, two global betas are incorporated into the cross-sectional regressions in a bid to examine the integration or segmentation of the A-share market with the world and Hong Kong stock markets. Specifically, both time-varying betas and static betas are used in the analysis. The results suggest that there is no beta effect and the A-share marke t is totally segmented from both the world and Hong Kong stock markets.            Finally, when the segmentation and integration status of the A-share market is further examined using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation framework without beta estimation and the assumption of a linear relationship between beta and stock returns, the findings suggest that the A-share market is becoming increasing integrated with the B-share and the Hong Kong stock markets.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese A-share Market</field><field name="subject">B-share Market</field><field name="subject">H-share Market</field><field name="subject">Cross-sectional Regression</field><field name="subject">CAPM</field><field name="subject">Integration</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080103.093949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inn Housing. The Delights of the Private Sector</field><field name="creator">Bomb&#237; Lam&#250;a, Elisa</field><field name="description">The masters by research project was titled Inn Housing: The Delights of the Private Sector. It was a space for exploring my practice with the development of a  conceptual piece about the shifting condition of the community housing produced in inner cities.      The research aim was to develop an argument that inquired into the productive meaning of the application of glass walls on the city's housing fa&#231;ades; being these elements that represented a mode of living unknown to my experience and that challenged the way I perceive the relation between the  interior intimate and private space of the house  with the public city.    A confrontation with a different proposal of housing that gave me enough room to speculate about a significant change that may influence the treatment of the private-intimate space of the housing with the public realm. Since the importance acquired by the glass surface seems to encourage (or put emphasis) on the visual experience by way these hermetic fa&#231;ades visually link the interior space of the house with the exterior, exposing views of either one side or the other of the glass skin.      Thus the central research questions raised by this research were:  what might be the conception that has shaped this housing where the interior appears connected to the exterior through the glass fa&#231;ade? And significantly, does the visual relation with the glass potentially influences individual behaviour and therefore constitutes different modes for dwelling?      The method involved in the development of my argument was primary based on a theoretical framework in conjunction with a practice: the construction of visual material that respond to the stimuli generated by the readings.    Whereas the selection of theory and readings was based on the obvious need for material that could help me understand and develop certain aspects of my research, images were used to explore my own thinking responses in states of uncertainty, as these offer me a more clear access to my own thinking material once are projected outside my mind.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Housing</field><field name="subject">Private</field><field name="subject">Public</field><field name="subject">Interior</field><field name="subject">Exterior</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080104.134543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Barium Strontium Titanate Thin Films for Tunable Microwave Applications</field><field name="creator">Fardin, Ernest Anthony</field><field name="description">There has been unprecedented growth in wireless technologies in recent years; wireless devices such as cellular telephones and wireless local area network (WLAN) transceivers are becoming ubiquitous. It is now common for a single hardware device, such as a cellular telephone, to be capable of multi-band operation. Implementing a dedicated radio frequency (RF) front-end for each frequency band increases the component count and therefore the cost of the device. Consequently, there is now a requirement to design RF and microwave circuits that can be reconfigured to operate at different frequency bands, as opposed to switching between several fixed-frequency circuits.      Barium strontium titanate (BST) thin films show great promise for application in reconfigurable microwave circuits. The material has a high dielectric constant which can be controlled by the application of a quasi-static electric field, combined with relatively low losses at microwave frequencies. Tunable microwave components based on BST-thin films have the potential to replace several fixed components, thereby achieving useful size and cost reductions.      This thesis is concerned with the growth and microwave circuit applications of BST thin films on c- and r-plane sapphire substrates. Sapphire is an ideal substrate for microwave integrated circuit fabrication due to its low cost and low loss. Electronically tunable capacitors (varactors) were fabricated by patterning interdigital electrode structures on top of the BST films. High capacitance tunabilities of 56% and 64% were achieved for the films grown on c-plane and r-plane sapphire, respectively, at 40 V bias.      A novel electronically tunable 3 dB quadrature hybrid circuit was also developed. Prototypes of this circuit were initially implemented using commercial varactor diodes, in order to validate the design. An integrated version of the coupler was then fabricated using BST varactors on c-plane sapphire. The results achieved demonstrate the potential of sapphire-based BST thin films in practical microwave circuits.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Barium Strontium Titanate</field><field name="subject">Varactors</field><field name="subject">Tunable Microwave Circuits</field><field name="subject">Ferroelectrics</field><field name="subject">Dielectrics</field><field name="subject">Frequency Agile Circuits</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080104.135507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spacing OUT: the architecture of an inner</field><field name="creator">Mac Gregor, Arcelia Er&#233;ndira</field><field name="description">In psychoanalytic literature, psychoanalyst D.W.

Converged around spatial design and psychological concepts, and developing an understanding of the importance between both, I intend to explore the possibility of bringing the 'potential space' notion into the constructed environment. Highlighting, thus, the human condition of architecture where the designer is not a separate entity from the built environment but an intimate part of it through the design process.

Accordingly, there is a need for content-oriented XML retrieval systems that can efficiently and effectively store, search and retrieve information from XML document collections. Unlike traditional information retrieval systems where whole documents are usually indexed and retrieved as information units, XML retrieval systems typically index and retrieve document components of varying granularity. To evaluate the effectiveness of such systems, test collections where relevance assessments are provided according to an XML-specific definition of relevance are necessary. Such test collections have been built during four rounds of the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX).      There are many different approaches to XML retrieval; most approaches either extend full-text information retrieval systems to handle XML retrieval, or use database technologies that incorporate existing XML standards to handle both XML presentation and retrieval. We present a hybrid approach to XML retrieval that combines text information retrieval features with XML-specific features found in a native XML database. Results from our experiments on the INEX 2003 and 2004 test collections demonstrate the usefulness of applying our hybrid approach to different XML retrieval tasks.       A realistic definition of relevance is necessary for meaningful comparison of alternative XML retrieval approaches. The three relevance definitions used by INEX since 2002 comprise two relevance dimensions, each based on topical relevance. We perform an extensive analysis of the two INEX 2004 and 2005 relevance definitions, and show that assessors and users find them difficult to understand. We propose a new definition of relevance for XML retrieval, and demonstrate that a relevance scale based on this definition is useful for XML retrieval experiments.      Finding the appropriate approach to evaluate XML retrieval effectiveness is the subject of ongoing debate within the XML information retrieval research community. We present an overview of the evaluation methodologies implemented in the current INEX metrics, which reveals that the metrics follow different assumptions and measure different XML retrieval behaviours. We propose a new evaluation metric for XML retrieval and conduct an extensive analysis of the retrieval performance of simulated runs to show what is measured. We compare the evaluation behaviour obtained with the new metric to the behaviours obtained with two of the official INEX 2005 metrics, and demonstrate that the new metric can be used to reliably evaluate XML retrieval effectiveness.      To analyse the effectiveness of XML retrieval in different application scenarios, we use evaluation measures in our new metric to investigate the behaviour of XML retrieval approaches under the following two scenarios: the ad-hoc retrieval scenario, exploring the activities carried out as part of the INEX 2005 Ad-hoc track; and the multimedia retrieval scenario, exploring the activities carried out as part of the INEX 2005 Multimedia track. For both application scenarios we show that, although different values for retrieval parameters are needed to achieve the optimal performance, the desired textual or multimedia information can be effectively located using a combination of XML retrieval approaches.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">XML</field><field name="subject">information retrieval</field><field name="subject">native XML database</field><field name="subject">hybrid XML retrieval</field><field name="subject">relevance</field><field name="subject">evaluation of XML retrieval effectiveness</field><field name="subject">application scenarios</field><field name="subject">INEX</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080104.142709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Treatment Dose Accuracy in Radiation Therapy</field><field name="creator">Wong, Tony Po Yin</field><field name="description">The thesis aims to improve treatment dose accuracy in brachytherapy using a high dose rate (HDR) Ir-192 stepping source and in external beam therapy using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). For HDR brachytherapy, this has been achieved by investigating dose errors in the near field and the transit dose of the HDR brachytherapy stepping source. For IMRT, this study investigates the volume effect of detectors in the dosimetry of small fields, and the clinical implementation and dosimetric verification of a 6MV photon beam for IMRT.      For the study of dose errors in the near field of an HDR brachytherapy stepping source, the dose rate at point P at 0.25 cm in water from the transverse bisector of a straight catheter was calculated with Monte Carlo code MCNP 4.A. The Monte Carlo (MC) results were used to compare with the results calculated with the Nucletron Brachytherapy Planning System (BPS) formalism. Using the MC calculated radial dose function and anisotropy function with the BPS formalism, 1% dose calculation accuracy can be achieved even in the near field with negligible extra demand on computation time.      A video method was used to analyse the entrance, exit and the inter-dwell transit speed of the HDR stepping source for different path lengths and step sizes ranging from 2.5 mm to 995 mm. The transit speeds were found to be ranging from 54 to 467 mm/s. The results also show that the manufacturer has attempted to compensate for the effects of inter-dwell transit dose by reducing the actual dwell time of the source. A well-type chamber was used to determine the transit doses. Most of the measured dose differences between stationary and stationary plus inter-dwell source movement were within 2%.      The small-field dosimetry study investigates the effect of detector size in the dosimetry of small fields and steep dose gradients with a particular emphasis on IMRT measurements.

A digital image profilometry technique was developed to measure the washboarding profiles of corrugated board. This technique was used to measure the washboarding depth and profiles for a range of corrugated boards, some constructed manually and some machine manufactured. This enabled a study into how a change in the mechanical properties of paper and glue affect washboarding depth. The effect that the speed of machine manufacturing had upon the degree of washboarding was also determined. A study of how environmental conditions affect washboarding geometry was undertaken.       The effects of the extent of washboarding upon a range of board performance measures were tested empirically and modelled using Finite Element Analysis. These were edgewise compression testing (ECT), three-point bend, and MD-Shear (an Amcor Ltd. proprietary test).

The study investigates the Creative Multimedia Music Project, a module of the Associate of Arts (Music) Degree where students are using computers as music workstations. The aims of the study are (a) to evaluate the use of music technology for composing; (b) to describe the creative process of composing and investigate how the students comprehend this; and (c) to analyze the relationship between the creative process of the musical treatment and the visual image in multimedia composition.      The study is conducted in an exploratory, self-directed environment where the students make musical decisions about their compositions. From the preliminary survey, 10 out of 45 music-major students (Year Two) from the Associate Degree Music Program at the Hong Kong Institute of Education (HKIEd) were selected.      Composition activities took place over 15 sessions. The first phase focused on computer-assisted composition and the second phase focused on multimedia composition. The students attended lectures on alternate weeks. This gave them enough time to compose in the laboratory or at home, allowing them to explore, make decisions, and evaluate decisions. Data were collected from four sources: (1) written reports including a musical analysis of the creative process, (2) one-to-one interviews conducted during and after the creative process (15 questions were asked in each phase), (3) self-reflective journals that students maintained during their creative process, and (4) MIDI file observations after the creative process had occurred. After data collection, commonalities between each of these data sources were analyzed. This highlighted that during the creative process, a developmental pattern emerged that extends Webster's model (2003) of creative thinking in music. The relationships between the findings and the lite rature review were articulated to reinforce the creative thinking model, trends, and perspectives from different sources.      Through an analysis of these students' creative processes and the strategies they adopted while composing with music technology, research projects such as this one may provide composers, music technologists, and music educators with insights into how students approach the task of composing using music technology. The findings might prove as a useful guidance to music educators on how to structure computer-assisted composition and multimedia composition programs for different age groups from school to university.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music</field><field name="subject">Music education</field><field name="subject">Music composition</field><field name="subject">Music technology</field><field name="subject">Creativity</field><field name="subject">Creative process and product</field><field name="subject">Computer-assisted composition</field><field name="subject">Multimedia composition</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080107.115525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Case for Political Decentralisation in Nigeria</field><field name="creator">Umaroho, Bowstock</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the process of gradual political centralisation in Nigeria from the colonial period until today. It argues that since the formation of Nigeria in 1914, there has not been an effective state administrative structure in the governing of the nation. Pre-independence Nigeria (1888-1960) was characterised by a flawed structure put in place by the British colonial administration and the changes implemented by the successive military regimes and associated constitutional developments that followed independence have not changed the underlying problems established during this period. Traditional approaches to political decentralisation in developing countries generally involve delegation, devolution and deconcentration. However, the role of traditional institutions in a decentralised governance structure is not always made explicit. Rather the potential roles of traditional institutions are assumed to be part of the local administrative system (e.g. l ocal governments). As a result, they are defined as part of the governance process. This limits applicability of these models to a country as ethnically diverse as Nigeria. The central argument put forward in this thesis is that an ideal decentralised administrative system is practicable in Nigeria only if the traditional institutions actively participate in the governance of the country. However, a review of the administrative system for the period 1914-2005 shows that the powers of the traditional institutions have been eroded over time. The thesis concludes by proposing a model for decentralising the complex administrative structure of Nigeria through 'institutional reconciliation'. The model follows previous approaches, but proposes a separation of the traditional institutions from both the administrative and governmental units (federal, state and local government). The thesis argues that the legitimacy of policies undertaken by any of the government units rests on these policies being consistent with et hnic, religious and cultural beliefs. It proposes one means of putting in place such a form of 'institutional reconciliation' while highlighting the potential problems that may also result.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nigeria</field><field name="subject">federalism</field><field name="subject">governance</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080107.121116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Technology Acquisition Modes: The Choice between 'Making' and 'Buying' Technology</field><field name="creator">Simatupang, Tota</field><field name="description">An enterprise can acquire technology either through 'making' (the pursuit of new technology development through internal R&amp;D) or 'buying' (acquisition from external sources).

However, attention to environmental duty of this industry has come to light only recently. There is an apparent increase in government attention and community awareness regarding the sustainability aspect of this growing industry and a greater emphasis is now being given to its environmental duty. The present pattern of metropolitan development in major Australian cities is one of spreading low-density suburbs. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics the current trend indicates that there is a 30% increase in average dwelling size and material consumption and also a decline in the number of people per dwelling. This means the energy consumption per capital, both embodied and operational energy is on the rise in the domestic sector. In relative terms the emphasis on the conservation of embodi ed energy component is far less than the operational energy component. This research dissertation discusses the importance and needs in addressing this existing gap.     Housing is an essential amenity. However the impact, due to current trend of increasing embodied energy consumption per capital should be minimised. This may even require major cultural shift to traditional construction processes, practices and home owner perceptions.

Therefore, responsibility for HIV risks should be shifted upstream from the level of individuals toward institutional processes that manufacture environments of harm. At the global level, the UN Milennium Development Goals do not provide the required level of leadership on HIV prevention for drug injectors. Association between globalisation, opiates and blood-born disease in Vietnam is not new and is inseparable from historical transportation, migration and trade processes. As a key locale in the Cold War, after 1975, and 1979 in particular, Vietnam was 'at distance' from increasing intra-regional trade flows across its western frontiers and northern border. As a consequence, it was hermetically sealed to nearby HIV sub-epidemics unfolding among heroin cons umers. A latent HIV risk environment awaited Vietnam should geopolitical grievances be resolved and it became re-integrated among Mekong sub-regional flows. Neo-liberal financial flows returned to Vietnam in 1993 and the Mekong was spanned in 1994. In 1995 it normalised relations with the United States, joined ASEAN and announced the resurrection of transportation linkages across the northern border with China. Mid-decade, its borders were made more porous at the same time as local opium production was reduced as part of the UN global programme against drugs. Exploiting enhanced trans-boundary mobilities intended for goods, opiate traffickers quickly transformed Vietnam into a transit nation and a marke for high-quality heroin well suited to a youthful population experiencing socio-economic change including new consumerism. Following traditional pathways, a radical transformation in the fluidity of drug consumption environs ensued, enabling more widespread and efficient flows of blood across complex boundari es. Analysis reveals that a spatio-temporal confluence of structural factors has created conditions which enabled this process. These factors are overlapping and they range from global influences, such as the collapse of the USSR, to micro-economic reform such as privatisation and modernisation of the domestic pharmaceutical sector. The transformation in opiate consumption from injecting opium to heroin injecting occurred faster than expert-driven prevention systems responded, even in time and space where this was most forseeable. Although the opiate transformation was highly predictable, there has been a time-lag of almost a decade between risk transformations and policy responses equated with harm reduction principles. The thesis shows that blame for HIV sub-epidemics in Vietnam should not be attributed to vulnerable youths and young adults. Expert-driven economic transition associated with global inegration has manufactured circumstances in which drug availability has risen dramatically at a time when emp loyment growth has been insufficient and a commercial sex industry has expanded. This research confirms the cimportance of new methods of risk environment analyses, particularly in relation to trans-boundary hazards associated with global flows, including trade and human mobilities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">heroin</field><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="subject">risk environments</field><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS</field><field name="subject">South East Asia</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">drugs</field><field name="subject">Beck</field><field name="subject">Urry</field><field name="subject">Giddens</field><field name="subject">Rhodes</field><field name="subject">harm reduction</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070626.162522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Canonical and Perturbed Quantum Potential-Well Problems: A Universal Function Approach</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Istiaque</field><field name="description">The limits of the current micro-scale electronics technology have been approaching rapidly.

Over the past two decades researchers in the area have found many performance enhancement opportunities by applying these techniques. These are most evident in large operational plants with hundreds of controllers being monitored at the same time.       Early performance measures were based on minimum variance control as a benchmark for controller performance. Many other procedures have since emerged that have improved the level of accuracy in these performance measures. In addition, these improvements made it easier to implement control loop performance monitoring in large industrial settings.        This thesis looks at the performance measures in use for single input single output controllers. The work here looks at incorporating these different measures for a specific manufacturing plant. Ways of identifying the goals and objectives of controllers in a system are presented. Furthermore, measures are proposed that most accurately indicate if these goals and objectives are being met.       The concept is demonstrated on a distillation system in a gas plant. It is shown how using these objective driven techniques can provide the user with sound results.

Data warehouse technology is inherently complex, requires significant   capital investment and development time. Many organizations fail to realize the full benefits   from it. While failure to realize benefits has been attributed to numerous causes, ranging from   technical to organizational reasons, the underlying strategic alignment issues have not been   studied.   This research confirms, through two case studies, that the successful adoption of the data   warehouse depends on its alignment to the business plans and strategy. The research found   that the factors that are critical to the alignment of data warehouses to business strategy and   plans are (a) joint responsibility between data warehouse and business managers, (b)   alignment between data warehouse plan and business plan, (c) business user satisfaction, (d)   flexibility in data warehouse planning and (e) technical integration of the data warehouse.   In the case studies, the impact of strategic alignment was visible both at implementation and   use levels. The key findings from the case studies are that   a) Senior management commitment and involvement are necessary for the initiation of   the data warehouse project. The awareness and involvement of data warehouse   managers in corporate strategies and a high level of joint responsibility between   business and data warehouse managers is critical to strategic alignment and successful   adoption of the data warehouse.   b) Communication of the strategic direction between the business and data warehouse   managers is important for the strategic alignment of the data warehouse. Significant   knowledge sharing among the stakeholders and frequent communication between the   iv   data warehouse managers and users facilitates better understanding of the data   warehouse and its successful adoption.   c) User participation in the data warehouse project, perceived usefulness of the data   warehouse, ease of use and data quality (accuracy, consistency, reliability and   timelines) were significant factors in strategic alignment of the data warehouse.   d) Technology selection based on its ability to address business and user requirements,   and the skills and response of the data warehousing team led to better alignment of the   data warehouse to business plans and strategies.   e) The flexibility to respond to changes in business needs and flexibility in data   warehouse planning is critical to strategic alignment and successful adoption of the   data warehouse. Alignment is seen as a process requiring continuous adaptation and   coordination of plans and goals.   This research provides a pathway for facilitating successful adoption of data warehouse. The   model developed in this research allows data warehouse professionals to ensure that their   project when implemented, achieve the strategic goals and business objectives of the   organization.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">data warehouse</field><field name="subject">strategic alignment</field><field name="subject">strategic alignment factors</field><field name="subject">case study</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080108.150431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Vision as a Critical Success Element in Project Management</field><field name="creator">Christenson, Dale</field><field name="description">Dr. Christenson determined that the current project critical success factors identified in the literature are necessary but not sufficient to explain all project success.       He explored the construct of 'project vision' as a critical success factor impacting project success.  The findings of the multiple case studies strongly suggest that a project's 'vision' is a critical success factor to successful project outcomes. As such, the projects examined represented a continuum of change projects from changes to business practices to holistic cultural change (where the desired end state was not fully known). The project vision was found to be instrumental in signalling change to all stakeholders. Similarly, the project vision was found to be critical in knowledge management projects where the purpose is to share new, best or next best practices.        The research also shows that the maintenance of a project vision has significant impacts on the successful completion of the project, especially on its timeliness for completion due to enhanced decision making.  A project vision needs to be a shared vision of all stakeholders and the project champion, sponsor, and manager all have a role in communicating and maintaining the project vision throughout the lifecycle of the project.        A multiple case study method was conducted within a public service organization.

The Agenda 21 report from the Rio Earth   Summit (1992) determined that sustainable consumption is an issue to be addressed in terms of   resource conservation, waste reduction and a reduction of production pollutants. To date, in   Australia, there are no policies or strategies in place to reduce wasteful consumption from the   consumer's perspective and it is this research and policy deficit that this thesis research   addresses.   According to a recent national study of wasteful consumption, Australians spent approximately   1.7 billion dollars in 2004 on fashion garments and accessories that they did not wear (Hamilton   et al. 2005). However, landfill statistics revealed that only a small proportion of textile waste (of   which clothing is a subsidiary category) contributes to landfill (ABS, 1998). This discrepancy   between the annual expenditure and the contribution of clothing to landfill informed the research   hypothesis; that the greater majority of these inactive fashion garments are hoarded in   wardrobes rather than disposed of. This hypothesis was tested through an action research case   study in the form of a clothing exchange event and related data collection and analysis (part 2 of   the thesis).

For this research data was taken from the International Follow-On Structural Test Project (IFOSTP) F/A-18 fatigue test conducted by the Royal Australian Air Force and Canadian Forces. This fatigue test involved the simultaneous application of both manouevre and buffet loads using airbag actuators and shakers. The applied loads were representative of the actual loads experienced by an FA/18 during flight tests. Following an evaluation of different ANN types an Ellman network with three linear layers was selected. The Elman back-propagation network was tested with various parameters and structures. The network was trained using the MATLAB 'traingdx' function with is a gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate back-propagation algorithm. The ANN was able to provide a good approximation of the actual manoeuvre or buffet loads at the location where the training loads data were recorded even for input values which differ from the  training input values. In further tests the ability to estimate distributed loading at locations not included in the training data was also demonstrated. The ANN was then modified to incorporate various methods for the calculation and prediction of output error and reliability Used in combination and in appropriate circumstances, the addition of these capabilities significantly increase the reliability, accuracy and therefore usefulness of the ANN system's ability to estimate aircraft loading.To demonstrate the ANN system's usefulness as a fatigue monitoring tool it was combined with a formulae for crack growth analysis.

Although the Web is international, the majority of research on finding of information has a focus on languages such as English and Chinese. In this thesis, we investigate information retrieval techniques for Indonesian. Although Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world, little attention has been given to search of Indonesian documents.      Stemming is the process of reducing morphological variants of a word to a common stem form. Previous research has shown that stemming is language-dependent. Although several stemming algorithms have been proposed for Indonesian, there is no consensus on which gives better performance. We empirically explore these algorithms, showing that even the best algorithm still has scope for improvement. We propose novel extensions to this algorithm and develop a new Indonesian stemmer, and show that these can improve stemming correctness by up to three percentage points; our approach makes less than one error in thirty-eight words.      We propose a range of techniques to enhance the performance of Indonesian information retrieval. These techniques include: stopping; sub-word tokenisation; and identification of proper nouns; and modifications to existing similarity functions. Our experiments show that many of these techniques can increase retrieval performance, with the highest increase achieved when we use grams of size five to tokenise words. We also present an effective method for identifying the language of a document; this allows various information retrieval techniques to be applied selectively depending on the language of target documents.      We also address the problem of automatic creation of parallel corpora --- collections of documents that are the direct translations of each other --- which are essential for cross-lingual information retrieval tasks. Well-curated parallel corpora are rare, and for many languages, such as Indonesian, do not exist at all. We describe algorithms that we have developed to automatically identify parallel documents for Indonesian and English. Unlike most current approaches, which consider only the context and structure of the documents, our approach is based on the document content itself. Our algorithms do not make any prior assumptions about the documents, and are based on the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global alignment of protein sequences. Our approach works well in identifying Indonesian-English parallel documents, especially when no translation is performed. It can increase the separation value, a measure to discriminate good matches of parallel documents from bad matches, by approximately ten percentage  points. We also investigate the applicability of our identification algorithms for other languages that use the Latin alphabet. Our experiments show that, with minor modifications, our alignment methods are effective for English-French, English-German, and French-German corpora, especially when the documents are not translated. Our technique can increase the separation value for the European corpus by up to twenty-eight percentage points. Together, these results provide a substantial advance in understanding techniques that can be applied for effective Indonesian text retrieval.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information retrieval</field><field name="subject">text retrieval</field><field name="subject">cross lingual information retrieval</field><field name="subject">Indonesian</field><field name="subject">stemming</field><field name="subject">stopping</field><field name="subject">tokenisation</field><field name="subject">proper noun identification</field><field name="subject">language identification</field><field name="subject">compound identification</field><field name="subject">parallel corpora identification</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080110.084651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental reporting and the impacts of mandatory reporting requirements</field><field name="creator">Cowan, Stacey Lynn</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the strategic and potentially legitimising nature of voluntary environmental reporting.  First, the thesis examines the relationship between emission levels on the National Pollutant Inventory and the quantity of total voluntary environmental disclosures, voluntary emission disclosures and positive voluntary environmental disclosures in annual reports.  Second, an examination of changes in the quantity of disclosures discussing compliance with the National Pollutant Inventory and/or disclosures concerning pollution emissions is undertaken.        Taking into consideration the findings relating to the strategic nature of voluntary disclosures, the thesis then examines the potential of such disclosures to impact upon the usefulness of mandatory annual report disclosure requirements.   This is undertaken by investigating whether significant differences exist between environmental disclosure practices in the voluntary sections of annual reports for corporations reporting non-compliance, and those not reporting non-compliance, in the directors' report pursuant with the requirements of s. 299(1)(f) of the Corporations Law.      The findings suggest that, for the sample corporations, a change in environmental regulation may have been an impetus for changes in voluntary environmental disclosure practices in annual reports.  Disclosures are identified as being discretionary, and potentially reactive to changes in environmental regulation, with a significant increase in the quantity of voluntary disclosures relating to the National Pollutant Inventory and in the number of corporations making voluntary emission disclosures during the period.  Hence, voluntary disclosures, although discretionary, may provide some indication of the corporation's actual environmental activities and provides some support for industry arguments to maintain a voluntary environmental disclosure system.      A comparison of the quantity and nature of voluntary disclosures for corporations required to report non-compliance with, and those reporting no non-compliance with, environmental regulations in the directors' report found no significant differences in disclosure practices between the two groups; that is, in contrast to the findings of previous research, those reporting non-compliance had no higher propensity for either greater quantities of voluntary environmental disclosures or positive voluntary environmental disclosures.  The findings suggest that the limitations faced by s. 299(1)(f) in its early years may have resulted in it not being perceived as a legitimacy threat by the sample corporations or as a lesser threat than others such as the NPI.        Therefore, questions remain as to whether the section is able to produce the outcomes proposed at its inception.   Overall, taking into consideration the discretionary nature of voluntary environmental disclosures, and the limitations of s. 299(1)(f), concern remains as to the quality of the Australian annual report environmental reporting system and the potential for the existence of voluntary environmental disclosures in the annual report to reduce the usefulness of a mandatory disclosure system to users.  These findings suggest a need for further research into the effect of both mandatory and voluntary environmental disclosures on users' perceptions of corporate environmental performance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental reporting</field><field name="subject">environmental disclosure</field><field name="subject">legitimacy theory</field><field name="subject">mandatory reporting</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080110.085951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Road trip home</field><field name="creator">Fabian, Bobbi</field><field name="description">The more we search outside of ourselves for answers, the less likely we are to be satisfied.

I acknowledge how and why our national identity evolved from the writing of the 1890s but I argue that most current artists, particularly novelists, have failed to incorporate the ongoing cultural, societal and industrial changes that have occurred since, particularly in the last thirty years. I assert that the majority of artists still refer to and draw inspiration from established, inaccurate myths and stereotypes rather than the bush and Australian characters of today. Through examining three texts, Kate Grenville's The Idea of Perfection (Picador, Sydney, 1999), Christos Tsiolkas's Loaded (Random House, Sydney, 1995) and Silences Long Gone (Picador, Sydney, 1998) by Anson Cameron, I also point out how most artists in general have failed to keep pace with changes in the bush city cross-culture. My exegesis attempts to give an account of some deficiencies  in contemporary Australian literature. In the creative component of this project, Summer at Mount Hope (Duffy and Snellgrove, Sydney, 2005), I write, as did Anson Cameron in his book, Silences Long Gone, (Pan Macmillan, 1998) of a bush (in 1894) where city and bush rely on each other and technology pushes into the bush uniting city and bush, thus enhancing the economy, the cross cultural interdependence and advancing the commonality between the two. I replace stereotypical characters with less predictable characters whose traits sit easily in either bush or city culture and skew the Traditionalist role of bush and city.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">City-bush cross culture</field><field name="subject">contemporary Australian fiction</field><field name="subject">cultural changes</field><field name="subject">inaccuracies</field><field name="subject">character misrepresentation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080110.100527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Broken Symmetries:    tensions and connections between art and science</field><field name="creator">Henschke, Chris</field><field name="description">In respect to the nature and development of scientific knowledge and issues of abstraction and irrationality in science, there is evidence that the fundamental forms of inspiration and origins of methodology are common to both scientific and artistic research. Also, the results of artistic practice, although far more culturally specific and subjective, are arguably complementary to those of scientific research. What are then the methods used and results obtained when one makes art about scientific theories, using technologies derived from the results of scientific research? Furthermore, how does this 'art about science' affect our understanding of the relationship between art and science? These are some of the issues and ideas which I explored in my MA research project works between 2000 and 2005, and which I discuss in this exegesis. Through my research, I constructed a series of works which focused increasingly upon theories in physics and mathematics not only  in an attempt to understand and communicate the theories to a wider audience, but also to communicate the historical and philosophical frameworks such theories were based upon. Through this I developed a working methodology which took inspiration from, but also subverted and critiqued the scientific theories and methodologies I was examining. The digital media tools I used, such as video, audio and programmed interactivity, opened up a line of communication between the disparate fields of artistic and scientific inquiry. The result was a series of interactive digital media and installation art pieces that explored various aspects of science, which were exhibited in both art and science spaces, and drew a wide range of responses from the scientific and general community.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art</field><field name="subject">science</field><field name="subject">media art</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080110.121930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utilising Restricted For-Loops in Genetic Programming</field><field name="creator">Li, Xiang</field><field name="description">Genetic programming is an approach that utilises the power of evolution to allow computers to evolve programs.  While loops are natural components of most programming languages and appear in every reasonably-sized application, they are rarely used in genetic programming. The work is to investigate a number of restricted looping constructs to determine whether any significant benefits can be obtained in genetic programming.  Possible benefits include:  Solving problems which cannot be solved without loops, evolving smaller sized solutions which can be more easily understood by human programmers and solving existing problems quicker by using fewer evaluations.  In this thesis, a number of explicit restricted loop formats were formulated and tested on the Santa Fe ant problem, a modified ant problem, a sorting problem, a visit-every-square problem and a difficult object classification problem.  The experimental results showed that these explicit loops can be success fully used in genetic programming.  The evolutionary process can decide when, where and how to use them.  Runs with these loops tended to generate smaller sized solutions in fewer evaluations.  Solutions with loops were found to some problems that could not be solved without loops.  The results and analysis of this thesis have established that there are significant benefits in using loops in genetic programming.  Restricted loops can avoid the difficulties of evolving consistent programs and the infinite iterations problem. Researchers and other users of genetic programming should not be afraid of loops.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetic Programming</field><field name="subject">Data mining</field><field name="subject">Data Classification</field><field name="subject">Restricted Loops</field><field name="subject">Loops</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080110.122751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations of light scattering by Australian natural waters for remote   sensing applications</field><field name="creator">O'Bree, Terry Adam</field><field name="description">Remote sensing is the collection of information about an object from a distance without   physically being in contact with it. The type of remote sensing of interest here is in the form   of digital images of water bodies acquired by satellite. The advantage over traditional   sampling techniques is that data can be gathered quickly over large ranges, and be available   for immediate analysis. Remote sensing is a powerful technique for the monitoring of water   bodies. To interpret the remotely sensed data, however, knowledge of the optical properties of   the water constituents is needed. One of the most important of these is the volume scattering   function, which describes the angular distribution of light scattered by a sample.   This thesis presents the first measurements of volume scattering functions for Australian   waters. Measurements were made on around 40 different samples taken from several locations   in the Gippsland lakes and the Great Barrier Reef. The measurements were made by   modifying an existing static light scattering spectrometer in order to accurately measure the   volume scattering functions. The development of the apparatus, its calibration and   automation, and the application of a complex series of post-acquisition data corrections, are   all discussed.   In order to extrapolate the data over the full angular range, the data was analysed using   theoretical curves calculated for multi-modal size distributions using Mie light scattering   theory applied to each data set. From the Mie fits the scattering and backscattering   coefficients were calculated. These were compared with scattering coefficients measured   using in situ sensors ac-9 and Hydroscat-6, and with values from the literature. The effect of   chlorophyll a concentrations on the scattering coefficients was examined, and a brief   investigation of the polarisation properties of the samples was also undertaken.   Finally the angular effects on the relationship between the backscattering coefficient and the   volume scattering function were investigated. This is important as in situ backscattering   sensors often assume that measuring at a single fixed-angle is a good approximation for   calculating the backscattering coefficient. This assumption is tested, and the optimal   measurement angle determined.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">volume scattering function</field><field name="subject">light scattering</field><field name="subject">remote sensing</field><field name="subject">oceanography</field><field name="subject">limnology</field><field name="subject">phase function</field><field name="subject">scattering coefficient</field><field name="subject">mie scattering</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080110.140055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the spatial-temporal movement of tourists</field><field name="creator">Xia, Jianhong</field><field name="description">Tourism is one of the most rapidly developing industries in the world. The study of spatio-temporal movement models of tourists are undertaken in variety of disciplines such as tourism, geography, mathematics, economics and artificial intelligence. Knowledge from these different fields has been difficult to integrate because tourist movement research has been conducted at different spatial and temporal scales. This thesis establishes a methodology for modelling the spatial-temporal movement of tourists and defines the spatial-temporal movement of tourists at both the macro and micro level.        At the macro level, the sequence of tourist movements is modelled and the trend for tourist movements is predicted based on Markov Chain theory (MC). Log-linear models are then adopted to test the significance of the movement patterns of tourists. Tourism market segmentation based on the significant movement patterns of tourists is implemented using the EM (Expectation-Maximisation) algorithm. At the micro level, this thesis investigates the wayfinding decision-making processes of tourists. Four wayfinding models are developed and the relationships between the roles of landmarks and wayfinding decision-making are also discussed for each type of the wayfinding processes. The transition of a tourist movement between the macro and micro levels was examined based on the spatio-temporal zooming theory.      A case study of Phillip Island, Victoria, Australia is undertaken to implement and evaluate the tourist movement models established in this thesis. Two surveys were conducted on Phillip Island to collect the macro and micro level movement data of tourists. As results show   particular groups of tourists travelling with the same movement patterns have unique characteristics such as age and travel behaviours such as mode of transport. Effective tour packages can be designed based on significant movement patterns and the corresponding target markets. Tourists with various age groups, residency, gender and different levels of familiarity with  physical environment have different wayfinding behaviours.       The results of this study have been applied to tourism management on Phillip Island and the novel methods developed in this thesis have proved to be useful in improving park facilities and services provided to tourists, in designing tour packages for tourism market promotion and in understanding tourist wayfinding behaviours.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wayfinding; spatial and temporal movements; tourism behaviour; GIS; GPS.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080110.161021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Endothelial dysfunction in insulin resistance: The role of EDHF and gap junction communication</field><field name="creator">Young, Elisa</field><field name="description">Background: Endothelial dysfunction is a key factor in the development of vascular complications in insulin resistance and diabetes and recent studies have established that endothelium-derived hyperpolarising factor (EDHF) plays an important physiological role in endothelium-derived relaxation responses, especially in small arteries and arterioles.     Objective: This project aimed to identify the role of, and characterise, EDHF in animal models of insulin resistance, including the obese Zucker rat (OZR) as well as the fructose-fed (FF) Sprague-Dawley rat.     Methods: Vascular function was studied in third-order mesenteric arteries from male and female Zucker rats using pressure myography, and in lobar arteries from male FF rats using wire myography.  Endothelial function was determined by studying responses to the endothelium-dependent dilator acetylcholine (ACh) and the endothelium-independent dilator levcromakalim in the presence of a variety of inhibitors to study the roles of NO, EDHF and gap junctions.  The effect of insulin resistance on gap junctions was further assessed by measuring the protein and mRNA expression of vascular connexins.  Protein levels were determined by western blotting followed by semi-quantitative analysis of band intensity, whilst mRNA levels were quantified using real-time PCR, in which beta-actin was used as the housekeeping gene.   Results: Metabolic parameter comparisons confirmed that male OZRs were type 2 diabetic, whilst female OZRs were insulin resistant.  Responses to ACh were reduced in both the male and female OZRs compared with their gender controls, with the male OZR showing a greater degree of endothelial dysfunction.  In all Zucker third-order mesenteric arteries, inhibition of NO had no effect; however inhibitors of EDHF abolished relaxation responses to ACh.  Inhibitors of gap junctions associated with connexin 40 significantly (p less than 0.05, Student's t-test) attenuated the maximal response to ACh in the LZR, but had no effect in the OZR.  Comparison of Western blot band intensity indicated that connexin 40 protein levels in mesenteric vascular homogenates in the OZR were significantly smaller (p less than 0.05, Student's t-test) than in the LZR, with no difference in connexin 43 protein levels.  mRNA levels showed a significant (p less than 0.05, Student's t-test) decrease in connexin 40 expression in the OZR compar ed with the LZR, with no change in connexin 43 mRNA expression.  Although FF rats did develop insulin resistance, responses to ACh were not altered in the FF rats as compared with their controls, and ACh responses were abolished by NO inhibitors.   Conclusion: The findings presented in this thesis demonstrate that endothelial dysfunction is present in third-order mesenteric arteries from insulin-resistant female and type 2 diabetic male OZRs, and is associated with a defect in EDHF.  However, endothelial function was not compromised in the insulin-resistant FF rats.  Furthermore, the reduction in EDHF-mediated vasodilatation in the mesenteric arteries from female OZRs was associated with the functional absence of connexin 40-related gap junctions as well as a reduction in connexin 40 protein and mRNA levels.  This novel finding suggests that gap junctions associated with connexin 40 may be a potential therapeutic target for diabetic vascular disease.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="subject">insulin resistance</field><field name="subject">EDHF</field><field name="subject">gap junctions</field><field name="subject">myography</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080110.162249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stabilizing control design of a motorcycle</field><field name="creator">Yuan, Fenge</field><field name="description">This thesis solves the stabilizing control of an autonomous motorcycle. The control of an autonomous motorcycle is a challenging and interesting problem in the field because the plant is under-actuated, unstable and nonlinear. Two major problems that have not been considered in the literature are explicitly solved in our work: (i) the robust control problem of the plant subject to uncertainty and exogenous disturbance; (ii) the non-local stabilization of the nonlinear plant. To achieve the first goal, we propose a robust H_infty controller based on the linearized system, which provides a significant improvement in dealing model uncertainty and disturbance attenuation in comparison with those controllers given by classical linear design tools. To achieve the second goal, we propose a nonlinear controller based on the combination of a nonlinear forwarding method with several other methods for the nonlinear plant through identifying an appropriate upper triangular s tructure of the nonlinear system. This yields a stability region, the whole upper space above the level ground, such that the trajectory starting from any position in the upper hemi-sphere with arbitrary initial velocities converges to the upright position. Both results are novel and first results of their kinds in control of an autonomous motorcycle. Computer simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motorcycle</field><field name="subject">robust</field><field name="subject">nonlinear</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080111.113637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategy Formation in Chinese Universities</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Ian</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the process by which Chinese universities carry out strategy   formation. It aims to provide an insight into the lives of the managers of Chinese   universities in the period 2002-2003 which was a time of transition from the regime of   President Jiang Zemin to that of President Hu Jintao. Chinese refer to this period as   the transition from the third to the fourth generation of leaders.   Strategy was defined as a course of action aimed at achieving an organization's   purpose and strategy formation was defined as including strategy development and   implementation.   Answers were sought to the following questions based on data from a small number   of universities using stakeholder theory to inform the data collection process:   &#183; What is the process by which strategy development and implementation   takes place in Chinese universities?   &#183; How is the process applied in different universities?   &#183; How can an understanding of strategy formation in Chinese universities   assist in the development of joint ventures in China by foreign educational   institutions?   The method of data collection involved interviewing three levels of management in   six different universities drawn from three major cities in China. In order to   guarantee confidentiality, the identities of the instutions and the individuals involved   has been concealed.   Background information collected included the history of Chinese universities to   2002 and important features of Chinese culture, society and politics.   Stakeholder theory was found to provide a useful framework for analysing the   process of strategy formation.   It was found that assumptions based on the operations of Australian universities did   not apply in China, particularly in the areas of work relationships, reporting and   performance management and in the conduct of research.   Findings included:   &#183; Three approaches to strategy emerged, including the President making   unilateral decisions, a consultative approach including stakeholders, and an   approach involving consultation with staff.   &#183; The process varies between universities depending on factors such as the   guanxi relationships of the President.   &#183; The learnings from this project can be applied to other joint ventures in   education in China.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategy development</field><field name="subject">strategy implementation</field><field name="subject">strategy formation</field><field name="subject">stakeholder</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080121.161858</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Framed by Legal Rationalism: Refugees and the Howard Government's Selective Use of Legal Rationality; 1999-2003</field><field name="creator">Rogalla, Barbara</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the power of framing practices in the context of Australian refugee policies between 1999 and 2003.

It is well known, that these bottlenecks are inherently due to the processing capabilities of mobile transmission systems, and the time-varying nature of wireless channel conditions and propagation environments. Therefore, new ways of processing and transmitting multimedia data over mobile radio channels have become essential which is the principal focus of this thesis.      In this work, the performance and suitability of various signal processing techniques and transmission strategies in the application of multimedia data over wireless/mobile radio links are investigated. The proposed transmission systems for multimedia communication employ different data encoding schemes which include source coding in the wavelet domain, transmit diversity coding (space-time coding), and adaptive antenna beamforming (eigenbeamforming). By integrating these techniques into a robust communication system, the quality (SNR, etc) of multimedia signals received on mobile devices is maximised while mitigating the fast fading and multi-path effects of mobile channels. To support the transmission of high data-rate multimedia applications, a well known multi-carrier transmission technology known as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has been implemented. As shown in this study, this results in significant performance gains when combined with other signal-processing techniques such as spa ce-time block coding (STBC).      To optimise signal transmission, a novel unequal adaptive modulation scheme for the communication of multimedia data over MIMO-OFDM systems has been proposed. In this system, discrete wavelet transform/subband coding is used to compress data into their respective low-frequency and high-frequency components. Unlike traditional methods, however, data representing the low-frequency data are processed and modulated separately as they are more sensitive to the distortion effects of mobile radio channels. To make use of a desirable subchannel state, such that the quality (SNR) of the multimedia data recovered at the receiver is optimized, we employ a lookup matrix-adaptive bit and power allocation (LM-ABPA) algorithm. Apart from improving the spectral efficiency of OFDM, the modified LM-ABPA scheme, sorts and allocates subcarriers with the highest SNR to low-frequency data and the remaining to the least important data. To maintain a target system SNR, the LM-ABPA loading scheme assigns appropriate signal constella tion sizes and transmit power levels (modulation type) across all subcarriers and is adapted to the varying channel conditions such that the average system error-rate (SER/BER) is minimised. When configured for a constant data-rate load, simulation results show significant performance gains over non-adaptive systems.      In addition to the above studies, the simulation framework developed in this work is applied to investigate the performance of other signal processing techniques for multimedia communication such as blind channel equalization, and to examine the effectiveness of a secure communication system based on a logistic chaotic generator (LCG) for chaos shift-keying (CSK).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile Multimedia</field><field name="subject">Multimedia Signal Processing</field><field name="subject">Multimedia Communication</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080123.115457</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hybrid City</field><field name="creator">Shi, Qiong</field><field name="description">Based on the upcoming 2010 World Expo of Shanghai.

The phrase lends itself to a systems based agenda because the word 'infrastructure' implies that it performs some kind of function. It is through this functioning that we can understand the way landscape acts as a stage for activities to occur, not just background to the object.       The main question within the research is how landscape can precede housing development and set the parameters for its location, density, and relationship to the river. This is tested through four overriding themes which summarise the key ideas and methodologies for designing with landscape as infrastructure. The themes 'Catalyst', 'Time', 'Cause and Effect' and 'Experience' are tested on four different sites along the Maribyrnong River responding to different site conditions and the influence of geology and topography. The four sites have been named to reflect the primary function they perform within the overall strategy.      To establish a framework for this discourse the research has been filtered through seven principals, originally developed by Stan Allen as a series of propositions for infrastructure. These principals question issues of force, process, typology, scale, invisible form, structure, function and change and visible form and set up a mechanism enabling me to challenge the notion of landscape as infrastructure. If the landscape is infrastructure then Allen's principals will also apply for the design of housing developments.

The application of an action research model was central to the research and is reflected throughout this exegesis. The recurring steps of reflection, planning, analysis and action are witnessed throughout the life of the MYLO project on both micro and macro scales. The research methodology reflects action research principles of consultation and continual improvement whilst simultaneously catering for traditional academic principles of rigour and validity. Combined qualitative and quantitative data collection was supported by careful data reduction and display before the determination of findings and according actions.       The exegesis follows the creation and trial of an innovative youth learning model. In turn, the work explores the evaluation of the trial, the dissemination of project results, efforts at forward planning and the eventual piloting of the model. Throughout the document the reflections of the project team and, more particularly, the author (as primary researcher) are closely considered.

He identified several serious challenges associated with conventional EVM.and addressed the first issue by creating a new theoretical concept called Assured Value Analysis (AVA). This add-in process provides two new measures, permitting improvements to EVM that take into account the added certainty provided through procurement. Assured Value (AV) represents the budget for a future signed contract, and Expected Cost (EC) represents the agreed cost of that contract. Those measures permit the calculation of a Total Cost Variance that includes not only cost deviations to date, but also future ones to which the project team is already committed. AVA also allows conventional EVM formulae to take into account the Assured Value and Expected Cost of future signed agreements. A simple notional project is used to demonstrate the implementation of AVA.       He resolved the remaining challenges and issues through realising that the isolation of project phases would provide a simplified but more dependable methodology, one that also provides features not found in conventional EVM. Significant milestones are normally planned to occur at the end of a project phase. By assessing project performance only at the end of each completed phase, performance calculations are significantly simplified..       His new technique, Phase Earned Value Analysis (PEVA) simplifies the calculation of PV, EV and AC, and also provides benefits that are not possible with EVM. Since the planned and actual phase completion dates are known, an intuitively simple but accurate time-based schedule variance and schedule performance index (i.e. SVP and SPIP) can be measured. PEVA also permits the forecasting of future phase end cost figures and phase completion dates using the phase CPI and SPI ratios. Since PEVA employs data points having specific x axis and y-axis values, those can be readily plotted and trend lines identified with standard spreadsheet functions. This is a powerful feature, as it allows key project stakeholders to visualise emerging project performance trends as each phase is completed.       Finally, he successfully combined the AVA and PEVA concepts, resulting in a new EVM methodology - Phase Assured Value Analysis (PAVA) - which takes into account the assurance provided by procurement, simplifies the calculation of earned value through phases, and provides powerful forecasting and charting features.       He validated this new combined approach in multiple respects. The new AVA and PEVA formulae were rigorously established and confirmed through standard algebraic procedures. The formulae were tested in sample project situations, to clearly demonstrate their functions.

The major objective of this research program was to evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive behavioural (CBT) program in the treatment of adolescent overweight and obesity. Sixty three overweight or obese adolescents (28M, 35F) aged 11.5 to 18.9 years (M = 14.41, SD = 1.85) participated in a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a CBT weight loss intervention. This comprehensive intervention program incorporated a range of CBT techniques aimed at assisting adolescents to establish and maintain healthy eating and physical activity habits. Treatment resulted in improved body composition post treatment and sustained or improved body composition following maintenance. Participation in a motivational interview (MI) prior to this CBT intervention  did not influence treatment outcomes. Despite reductions in weight and body fat, lean body mass was not affected by the intervention, thus, treatment did not detrimentally effect linear growth and lean body tissue. Poor compliance with measurement protocols limits conclusions that can be drawn regarding the impact of treatment on eating and activity habits. However, results suggest that treatment resulted in a reduction in fat consumption, reduced saturated fat intake, and reduced time spent in sedentary activities. Increases in physical activity were not evident. The treatment seeking sample did not report elevated psychopathology levels and treatment did not impact on adolescent depression, anxiety, or stress. Adolescents receiving treatment reported improvements in disordered eating relative to those in the control condition. A secondary aim of this research program was to redress the limited information available on the behavioural and psychosocial factors associated with adolescent overweight and obesit y. These factors were explored in community samples of adolescents (n = 161, M = 16.3, SD = I .8) and their parents, and young adults (n = 292, M = 19.7, SD = 2.0). In comparison to both normal and overweight adolescents, treatment seeking adolescents reported greater body dissatisfaction and weight. discontent. Body weight was not associated with psychopathology in the community samples and treatment seeking adolescents did not differ from normal or overweight adolescents from the community sample in terms of psychopathology. However, young adults who reported being overweight during childhood reported greater psychopathology as young adults. These findings suggest that excess weight in adolescence may have longer term rather than immediate effects on psychopathology. A number of family factors were associated with body weight in both adolescents and young adults. Combined, results indicated that CBT is efficacious in the treatment of overweight and obesity in adolescents and MI does not improve the efficac y of CBT. The current findings suggest that the impact of excess weight on psychosocial functioning is limited to body discontent and dissatisfaction in adolescence but is associated with increased psychopathology in early adulthood. Results also highlighted the importance of parents and family in the treatment of overweight and obesity in adolescents.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">overweight</field><field name="subject">obesity</field><field name="subject">weight management</field><field name="subject">adolescent</field><field name="subject">adolescence</field><field name="subject">parents</field><field name="subject">intervention</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">maintenance</field><field name="subject">pyschology</field><field name="subject">Cognitive behavioural therapy</field><field name="subject">motivational interviewing</field><field name="subject">body composition</field><field name="subject">psychosocial</field><field name="subject">psychopathology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080130.141227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Quest of Australian Public Universities for Competitive Advantage in a Global Higher Education Environment</field><field name="creator">Bradmore, Donald James</field><field name="description">Adopting a triangulated approach, this thesis consists of three separate but related qualitative studies, the collective objectives of which are to (i) gauge current levels of concern of Australian public universities with rapid intensification of the higher education sector globally; (ii) evaluate strategies developed by universities in response to increasing competition; and (iii) develop a conceptual framework to guide competitive behaviour of universities.  Study 1 is a systematic content analysis of published strategic plans of universities using Leximancer (Version 2.20).  Relative prominence of concepts identified in this content analysis give rise to propositions relating both to levels of concern with competition and strategies being implemented to protect market position.  In Study 2, these propositions are tested in a sample of the universities by means of case studies based on face-to-face interviews with senior academics and administrators.  Study 3  draws upon findings of Studies 1 and 2 to develop a strategic model to guide future strategy development.   Overall, findings of the studies provide valuable insights into the management of higher education in a dynamic environment in which the intensity of competition is likely to escalate as the pace of globalisation and technological change quickens, as deregulation of the domestic higher education sector continues, as per capita funding is further reduced, as even greater elements of competition and contestability are introduced in the interests of productivity and efficiency, and as overseas student demand slackens in traditional markets.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategic management</field><field name="subject">competition</field><field name="subject">competitive advantage</field><field name="subject">higher education.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080130.144542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effective task assignment strategies for distributed systems under highly variable workloads</field><field name="creator">Broberg, James Andrew</field><field name="description">Heavy-tailed workload distributions are commonly experienced in many areas of distributed computing. Such workloads are highly variable, where a small number of very large tasks make up a large proportion of the workload, making the load very hard to distribute effectively. Traditional task assignment policies are ineffective under these conditions as they were formulated based on the assumption of an exponentially distributed workload. Size-based task assignment policies have    been proposed to handle heavy-tailed workloads, but their applications are limited by their static nature and assumption of prior knowledge of a task's service requirement. This thesis analyses existing approaches to load distribution under heavy-tailed workloads, and presents a new generalised task assignment policy that significantly improves performance for many distributed applications, by intelligently addressing the negative effects on performance that highly variable workloads cause. Many problems associated with the modelling and optimisations of systems under highly variable workloads were then addressed by a novel technique that approximated these workloads with simpler mathematical representations, without losing any of their pertinent original properties. Finally, we obtain advance queuing metrics (such as the variance of key measurements like waiting time and slowdown that are difficult to obtain analytically) through rigorous simulation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scheduling policies</field><field name="subject">distributed systems</field><field name="subject">task assignment</field><field name="subject">heavy-tailed workloads</field><field name="subject">load balancing</field><field name="subject">load sharing</field><field name="subject">queuing theory</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080130.150130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community Foundations:  The Asset-based Development of an Australian Community Organisation as a Foundational Source for Sustainable Community Development.</field><field name="creator">Bryant, Sharon</field><field name="description">This study seeks to uncover the opportunities and challenges in building the foundations for sustainable community development at the local level, by enhancing the capacity of a community organisation.

Industrial waste heat provides a convenient source of concentrated LGH, while solar ponds and geothermal resources are examples of sustainable sources of this energy.  For a number of years RMIT has had two ongoing, parallel heat engine research projects aimed at the conversion of LGH into electricity.  The Thermosyphon Rankine Engine (TSR) is a heat engine that uses water under considerable vacuum.  The other research stream uses a hydrocarbon based working fluid in a heat engine employing the Trilateral Flash Cycle (TFC).        The TSR Mk V was designed and built as a low cost heat engine for the conversion of LGH into electricity.  Its main design advantages are its cost and the employment of only one moving part.  Using the data gained from the experimental rig, deviations from the expected results (those derived theoretically) were explored to gain insight for further development.  The results from the TSR rig were well below those expected from the design specifications.  Although the experimental apparatus was able to process the required heat energy, the efficiency of conversion fell well below the expected 3% and was approximately 0.2%.  The inefficiency was explained by a number of contributing factors, the major being form drag upon the rotor that contributed around 2/3 of the losses.  Although this was the major cause of the power loss, other factors such as the interference with the rotor by the condensate on its return path contributed to the overall poor performance of the TSR Mk V.       The RMIT TFC project came about from exploration of the available academic literature on the subject of LGH conversion.  Early work by researchers into applying Carnot's theory to finite heat sources led them to explore the merits of sensible heat transfer combined with a cycle that passes a liquid (instead of a gas) though an expander.  The results showed that it was theoretically possible to extract and convert more energy from a heat source of this type using this method than using any other alternative.  This previous research was targeted at heat sources above 80&#186;C and so exploration of the theoretical and empirical results for sources below this temperature was needed.  Computer models and an experimental rig using isopentane (with a 28&#186;C boiling point at atmospheric pressure) were produced to assess the outcomes of employing low temperature heat sources using a TFC.  The experimental results from the TFC research proved promising with the efficiency of conversion ranging from 0.8% to 2.4%.  Although s uch figures seem poor in isolation, it should be noted that the 2.4% efficiency represents an achievement of 47% of the theoretical ideal conversion efficiency in a rig that uses mainly off-the-shelf components.  It also confirms that the TFC shows promise when applied to heat sources less than 80&#186;C.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trilateral Flash Cycle</field><field name="subject">low grade heat</field><field name="subject">Thermosyphon Rankine Engine</field><field name="subject">low temperature heat engine</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080130.162927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Uncovering the well-springs of migrant womens' agency: connecting with Australian public infrastructure</field><field name="creator">Bursian, Olga</field><field name="description">The study sought to uncover the constitution of migrant women's agency as they rebuild their lives in Australia, and to explore how contact with any publicly funded services might influence the capacity to be self determining subjects.  The thesis used a framework of lifeworld theories (Bourdieu, Schutz, Giddens), materialist, trans-national feminist and post colonial writings, and a methodological approach based on critical hermeneutics (Ricoeur), feminist standpoint and decolonising theories.  Thirty in depth interviews were carried out with 6 women migrating from each of 5 regions: Vietnam, Lebanon, the Horn of Africa, the former Soviet Union and the Philippines.  Australian based immigration literature constituted the third corner of triangulation.      The interviews were carried out through an exploration of themes format, eliciting data about the different ontological and epistemological assumptions of the cultures of origin.  The findings revealed not only the women's remarkable tenacity and resilience as creative agents, but also the indispensability of Australia's publicly funded infrastructure or welfare state.      The women were mostly privileged in terms of class, education and affirming relationships with males.  Nevertheless, their self determination depended on contact with universal public policies, programs and with local community services.  The welfare state seems to be modernity's means for re-establishing human connectedness that is the crux of the human condition.  Connecting with fellow Australians in friendships and neighbourliness was also important in resettlement.      Conclusions include a policy discussion in agreement with Australian and international scholars proposing that there is no alternative but for governments to invest in a welfare state for the civil societies and knowledge based economies of the 21st Century.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Subjugated knowledges</field><field name="subject">feminist epistemology</field><field name="subject">cross cultural ontology</field><field name="subject">women's agency</field><field name="subject">migrant women</field><field name="subject">cross cultural feminism</field><field name="subject">trans-national feminism</field><field name="subject">feminist standpoint theory</field><field name="subject">community services</field><field name="subject">women's self determination</field><field name="subject">resettlement</field><field name="subject">hybridity</field><field name="subject">epistemic violence</field><field name="subject">women and diaspora</field><field name="subject">multicultural policy</field><field name="subject">multicultural citizenship</field><field name="subject">post colonial theory</field><field name="subject">Australian multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">Australian welfare state regimes</field><field name="subject">globalised welfare states</field><field name="subject">comparative welfare states</field><field name="subject">diversity and civil society</field><field name="subject">cultural theory</field><field name="subject">lifeworld theory</field><field name="subject">non-Western lifeworlds</field><field name="subject">non-Western societies</field><field name="subject">gender relations of domination</field><field name="subject">women and colonialism</field><field name="subject">public infrastructure</field><field name="subject">public services</field><field name="subject">Australian immigration policy</field><field name="subject">feminist methodology</field><field name="subject">de-colonising research methodologies</field><field name="subject">inter-subjective ethics.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080131.113605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Retrospective Reporting of Childhood Experiences and Borderline Personality Disorder Features in a Non-Clinical Sample: A Cognitive-Behavioural Perspective</field><field name="creator">Carr, Steven</field><field name="description">The purpose of the current study was to investigate the relationship between Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) symptoms and childhood experiences, and to explore the role of Early Maladaptive Schemas and core beliefs as variables possibly mediating this relationship. Previous research with clinical samples has established a strong link between childhood maltreatment and adult BPD (&amp; other PD) symptoms in clinical samples. However, difficulties with these studies limit the specificity of results.    For example, BPD has been shown to be highly comorbid with other axis I and axis II psychiatric conditions. Given that studies examining the relationship between BPD and childhood maltreatment generally fail to control for these comorbid conditions, the specificity of their results must be questioned. Furthermore, it has been well established that childhood familial environment is strongly related to childhood maltreatment. Again studies examining the relationship between BPD and childhood maltreatment have generally failed to concurrently assess childhood familial environments, hence opening the possibility that the relationship between BPD and childhood maltreatment may be due to family functioning rather than childhood maltreatment per se. Finally, studies linking childhood maltreatment with adult BPD have primarily utilized clinical samples. However, the primary use of clinical samples to examine the aetiology of disorders in this context ignores the vast literature showing adequate psychological functio ning for the majority of individuals exposed to childhood maltreatment. Hence, the primary aim of the current study was to examine the relationship between childhood maltreatment and adult BPD symptoms in a primarily non-clinical sample whilst statistically controlling for commonly comorbid axis I and axis II symptomatology and concurrently measuring childhood familial functioning.   It was a secondary aim of the current study to examine the mediating effects of beliefs on the relationship between childhood factors (i.e., childhood maltreatment &amp; childhood familial functioning) and adult BPD symptomatology. That is, cognitive-behavioural theorists argue that personality disorders may be triggered by adverse childhood experiences leading to maladaptive beliefs (or schemas) related to the self, others, and the world, and it is these beliefs which lead to the behavioural disturbances evident in personality disorders.   One hundred and eighty-five primarily non-clinical participants completed questionnaires measuring a variety of axis I and axis II symptoms, early maladaptive schemas and core beliefs, as well as retrospective reports of family functioning and childhood maltreatment. Results showed a significant relationship between childhood factors and adult BPD symptomatology. For example, the largest correlation between BPD symptoms and a childhood factor was .27 (for childhood emotional abuse). Furthermore, early maladaptive schemas and core beliefs were found to mediate the relationship between childhood factors and adult BPD symptomatology thus supporting cognitive-behavioural theories of personality disorders. However, early maladaptive schemas and core beliefs were also found to mediate the relationship between childhood factors and other Axis I and Axis II symptoms.    Hence, it was concluded that while there was some support for a cognitive mediation hypothesis for BPD symptoms, future research is needed in exploring the specificity of the cognitive mediation hypothesis for BPD.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD); Schema Theory; Early Maladaptive Schemas (EMSs); Cognitive-Behavioural Theory; Retrospective Reporting; Childhood Maltreatment; Childhood Emotional Abuse; Childhood Physical Abuse; Childhood Sexual Abuse (CSA); Childhood Emotional Neglect; Childhood Physical Neglect; Young Schema Questionnaire; Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire (PDQ4+)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080205.101748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrical and Thermal Modelling of Low Power Metallised Polypropylene Capacitors.</field><field name="creator">Brown, Robert Winston</field><field name="description">Metallised polypropylene (MPP) capacitors, the dominant capacitor type used in a wide range of power and electronic circuit applications, offer high volumetric capacitor density, low cost, excellent frequency characteristics and a unique ability to recover from point failures in the dielectric film.   However MPP capacitors have a generic weakness that is not well understood, failure of the self-healing process leading to ongoing catastrophic failure.    The work described in this thesis includes the derivation of an improved electrical model of a capacitor and the uncovering of a mechanism for the catastrophic failure mode.  Corrosion of the thin metallic field is firmly linked to drastic increases in metal film current densities and generation of hot spots in capacitors.     In the work, novel formulae were derived relating capacitor parameters such as equivalent series resistance and equivalent series capacitance to frequency and physical characteristics such as metal film resistivity and physical dimensions of multiple layer capacitors.   Modelling using numerical methods and diffusion equation showed that capacitors with double-end connection topology have more uniform voltage and power distribution than single-end connected capacitors.  External characteristics of both connection topologies were shown to be virtually identical up to frequencies well above typical self-resonance.   The aggregate spatial distribution of power from both layers and the voltage across the dielectric were found to be fundamentally different in the two circuit connection topologies.    In this work it was shown that above singularity frequencies defined by distributed capacitance and metal film spreading resistance, equivalent series resistance and capacitance both fall with the square root of frequency   Analysis of the  inductance of typical MPP capacitors for single-end and double-end connected topologies and for circumferentially connected capacitor metallization showed that the magnitude and effect of distributed inductance in typical MPP power capacitors was insignificant compared to packaging inductance.     Thermal and electrical modelling and experimental measurements showed that corrosion effects could readily account for the generic catastrophic failure mode of metallised polypropylene capacitors.   Modelling showed that remnant vestiges of metal bridging corrosion gaps between the schooping and the metallic film could also pose serious thermal danger to the affected capacitor.  Fusing current modelling and experimental measurement showed that fusing in metallic films typically occurred for current densities of several hundred thousand amperes per square centimetre.     The partial disconnection of the metallic layers from the schooping edge by corrosion for example, was shown to result in large increases in dissipation factor and power loss in a capacitor readily explaining how capacitors</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Capacitor</field><field name="subject">polypropylene</field><field name="subject">failure</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="subject">thin film</field><field name="subject">thermal</field><field name="subject">empirical equation.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080130.155318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance Evaluation of Perceptually Lossless Medical Image Coder</field><field name="creator">Chai, Shan</field><field name="description">Medical imaging technologies offer the benefits of faster and accurate diagnosis. When the medical imaging combined with the digitization, they offer the advantage of permanent storage and fast transmission to any geographical location. However, there is a need for efficient compression algorithms that alleviate the taxing burden of both large storage space and transmission bandwidth requirements. The Perceptually Lossless Medical Image Coder is a new image compression technique. It provides a solution to challenge of delivering clinically critical information in the shortest time possible. It embeds the visual pruning into the JPEG 2000 coding framework to achieve the optimal compression without losing the visual integrity of medical images. However, the performance of the PLMIC under certain medical image operation is still unknown. In this thesis, we investigate the performance of the PLMIC by applying linear, quadratic and cubic standard and centered B-spline  interpolation filters. In order to evaluate the visual performance, a subjective assessment consisting of 30 medical images and 6 image processing experts was conducted. The perceptually lossless medical image coder was compared to the state-of-the-art JPEG-LS compliant LOCO and NLOCO image coders. The results have shown overall, there were no perceivable differences of statistical significance when the medical images were enlarged by a factor of 2. The findings of the thesis may help the researchers to further improve the coder. Additionally, it may also notify the radiologists the performance of the PLMIC coder to help them with correct diagnosis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">medical</field><field name="subject">compression</field><field name="subject">PLMIC</field><field name="subject">interpolation</field><field name="subject">B-spline</field><field name="subject">subject test</field><field name="subject">statistical significance.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080205.120648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Support and recovery in a therapeutic community</field><field name="creator">Macfarlane, Selma Ingeborg</field><field name="description">This research project began from an interest in 'what happened' at a residential psychiatric disability support service (therapeutic community) where I had previously worked as a social worker, or, as it was termed in the program, support worker.  Residents used the program in various ways, to get back on track with their lives, and workers aimed to support them in that process. My approach to data collection was, as for many social work researchers, qualitative.  As my work on the project developed over time, I was consistently informed and re-informed not only by ideas arising from my engagement with participants and relevant literature, but also by new concepts and areas of interest that opened up as a result of my teaching in a progressive Bachelor of Social Work course.  Gradually, as my understanding of critical and reflective postmodern social work theory evolved, new interpretations crept into my writing.  Some of the tensions that arose as a result of th is overlaying of new conceptual frameworks are evident in the thesis.  While I have tried to create internal cohesion, the layers of different approaches that informed me are sometimes evident, like the sides of a canyon that display evidence of its historical and ongoing formation.  This may not be dissimilar to social work itself in the new millennium, as new ideas variously challenge, consolidate, destabilise and/or reshape theory and practice.  While this thesis began as an exploration of the experiences of individuals in a therapeutic community and the role of support workers in that process, it became, additionally, an exploration of ways in which the role and practice of social work is constructed.  However, the stories of participants remain a central feature.  Chapters include:  the professional gaze and the construction of subjects; problematising worker power and professionalism; boundaries, vulnerability and authority; therapeutic community; sensemaking, meaning ascription and the creation of cul ture; change and turning points; and problematising and exploring outcomes in mental health.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">residential psychiatric disability support service</field><field name="subject">therapeutic community</field><field name="subject">social work</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080205.152052</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outside-Singapore: A Practice of Writing:   Making Subjects and Spaces yet to come</field><field name="creator">Chan, Patrick Foong</field><field name="description">This thesis highlights the practice of writing as a way to engage with the amorphous thing-space-State-city-nation-citizens that is</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">Post-Colonial Studies</field><field name="subject">Writing</field><field name="subject">Absolute Potentiality</field><field name="subject">In-Between</field><field name="subject">Overman</field><field name="subject">Urbanism</field><field name="subject">Globalization</field><field name="subject">Art</field><field name="subject">Architecture</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Guattari</field><field name="subject">Spinoza</field><field name="subject">Nietzsche</field><field name="subject">Hardt</field><field name="subject">Agamben</field><field name="subject">Negri</field><field name="subject">Blanchot</field><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="subject">Bhabha</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080205.164909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of The Intracellular Signalling Pathway for Interleukin-6 Gene Expression in Skeletal Muscle</field><field name="creator">Chan, Ming Hang (Stanley)</field><field name="description">It has been recently demonstrated that the cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 is unique among the so called</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cytokine</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="subject">skeletal muscle</field><field name="subject">IL-6</field><field name="subject">signal transduction</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080206.091026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measuring the Impact of Financial Deregulation</field><field name="creator">Risman, Sveta</field><field name="description">Extensive deregulation of the Australian financial system officially began in the early   1980s.

In the study, a Mixed Methods design,   incorporating both quantitative and qualitative research design features, was   employed within a Case Study approach. Questionnaires and interviews were used as   research techniques to examine and identify what constitute the influences on the   teaching and learning of English in the RTAFA and the factors that affect the limitation   of the English proficiency of the RTAFA graduates.   The quantitative methods included a pilot questionnaire for cadets (N = 35),   questionnaires for every Year level of cadets in training (N = 517) and questionnaires   for the English instructors (N = 9). The Quest software program (Adams &amp; Khoo,   1993) was applied to analyse the questionnaires and group means and standard   deviations were used to calculate effect sizes between students of different Year   levels. In relation to the student questionnaire, some category items were also   examined and analysed separately. In relation to the qualitative analysis, semistructured   interviews with a small number of the RTAFA cadets in all five years of   training (N = 25), the English instructors (N = 9) and the senior administrators of the   RTAFA (N = 4) were conducted to complement and triangulate the data gathered   from the questionnaires.   The results from the questionnaires and interviews suggest that the English   curriculum influenced the teaching and learning of English in the RTAFA, followed by   issues in relation to cadets' attitudes and motivations for studying English and cadets'   English educational background. Factors that affected the limitation of the English   proficiency of the RTAFA graduates were a lack of realization by the cadets of the   importance of English, the very structure of the English curriculum and the content of   the English syllabus, the perceived low status of English as evidenced by the lack of   academic credits given to the subject, the poor facilities of the language laboratories,   the perceived lack of current teaching methods and techniques of the instructors, the   varying experiences of the cadets' background knowledge of English, the rigid military   system and the need for more native speaking English instructors to develop the oral   language skills of cadets. Based on the findings of all the data, suggested   recommendations for improving the teaching and learning of English in the RTAFA   include a revision of the English curriculum, an improvement of the content of English   with an emphasis on listening, speaking and conversation skills, an update of the   English language laboratories, smaller English classes and a constant professional   development for instructors in relation to techniques in English teaching and learning.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Investigates</field><field name="subject">influences</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">English</field><field name="subject">Royal Thai Air Force Academy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080206.102937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermo-Optical Properties of Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystals</field><field name="creator">Chen, Lu Guang</field><field name="description">Polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) films, consisting of micro-sized domains of a liquid crystal dispersing in a polymer matrix, serve as the basis of a variety of high-efficiency electro-optical effects. The thermo-optical properties of the PDLCs were investigated in this thesis.   The thermal properties and the morphologies of four low molar mass mesogens were studied by DSC and polarized optical microscope (POM). There were significant super cooling/heating effects on the first order phase transitions but not on the mesophase transitions. The structural effects on the transition temperature were investigated. Between the two 4-alkoxybenzoic acids mesogens, the clearing temperature of 4-(octyloxy)benzoic acid was higher than 4-(decyloxy)benzoic acid because of the increasing chain length. Trans-4-methoxycinnamic acid had the highest melting temperature among the four mesogens despite the molar mass because the carboxylic acid termini of trans-4-methoxycinnamic acid gave rise to strong intermolecular attractions. The smectic phases of 4-(octyloxy)benzoic acid were classified as head-to-head bilayer orientational smectic structures, SmA2 and SmC2, respectively, by wide angle X-ray diffraction through measuring the d spacing of the liquid crystal.   The total solubility parameter was used to evaluate matching a polymer-LC-solvent combination. PDLC films were prepared by the solvent induced phase separation method and suitable morphologies were achieved by thermal induced phase separation. The phase transition temperatures of PDLCs were shifted to a lower temperature due to the polymer dispersion effects. Different mesophases were observed in PDLC films when LC exhibited different mesophases. The LC fractions in the droplets were calculated from the nematic to isotropic enthalpies through the Smith equation. Two factors, thermal cooling rate and the LC concentration, which affect the size of the droplet dispersed in the polymer matrix, were investigated in the PVC dispersed 4,4'-azoxyanisole.   The phase transitions of pHEMA dispersed 4-(octyloxy)benzoic acid and PVC dispersed 4,4'-azoxyanisole were investigated by TMDSC and quasi-isothermal TMDSC. The TMDSC results were analysed by the two approaches, reversing and non-reversing heat flow and complex heat capacity. The results of the phase transitions of the two PDLCs illustrated that in the PDLCs it involved both non-reversing, melting, and reversing, clearing and the transition between two mesophases. In the non-reversing transition, the transition temperature would be affected by super cooling/heating and the results obtained in the experiments were dependent on the experimental conditions, such as the heating or cooling rate, sample size and purge gas flow rate. However, in the reversing transition process, there were no super cooling/heating effects observed and it seemed that the experimental conditions were not so critical. Results could be monitored by Lissajous figures obtained from the quasi-isothermal TMDSC. The plots of modulated heat  flow versus the derivative of modulated temperature can be used to alert to unfavorable experimental conditions where loss of system linearity could be seen.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liquid crystal</field><field name="subject">dispersed phase</field><field name="subject">thermo-optical property</field><field name="subject">DSC</field><field name="subject">POM</field><field name="subject">temperature-modulated DSC</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080206.114823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cyclooxygenase Expression in Human Diabetes</field><field name="creator">Chen, Suzi Su-Hsin</field><field name="description">Cyclooxygenase (COX) is the rate limiting enzyme that catalyses the production of prostanoids, which are crucial to vascular homeostasis. Evidence suggests that endothelial dysfunction and inflammation play a role in vascular complications in aging and diabetes. Previous animal studies by our laboratory at RMIT University reported enhanced COX expression with aging in rat aortas, platelets and monocytes. Potentially, alteration in COX expression may result in an imbalanced prostanoid production favoring the synthesis of vasoconstrictors and hence increase the risk of cardiovascular events in the aging population. The regulation of altered COX expression in aging, however, is not clear. It has been suggested that histone hyperacetylation may be an important mechanism that regulates COX levels during the aging process as increased histone acetylation has been shown to occur with aging. Thus, we hypothesized that COX expression is modulated by histone hyperacetylati on. This was investigated by measuring COX expression in histone hyperacetylated cultured endothelial cells.      In the case of diabetes, studies have reported that the development of diabetes and its complications is associated with persistent inflammatory activity, evident with increased inflammatory markers in the circulation. COX-mediated pathways may be involved in this inflammatory process in diabetes. Furthermore, the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) is accelerated in diabetes. AGEs can bind to receptors for AGEs (RAGE), which has also been suggested to play a role in inflammation in diabetes.  We hypothesized that COX- and RAGE-mediated pathways contribute to increased inflammation in diabetes and potentiate the development of diabetic vascular complications. This was investigated by measuring changes in COX-mediated pathways in both rat and human diabetic models.      The current thesis reports:   1)	in cultured endothelial cells, histone hyperacetylation was associated with increased COX expression;   2)	an overall increase in inflammation was observed in diabetes involving COX- and RAGE-mediated pathways. This was supported by increased platelet COX-1 and monocyte COX-2 levels in Zucker rats, increased monocyte COX-2 in human Type 1 diabetes and elevated plasma TXB2 and PGE2 levels in both human Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic subjects. Up-regulation of RAGE expression was further found in platelets and monocytes in both human diabetes types. When treated with NSAIDs, plasma prostanoid levels, COX and RAGE expression were reduced significantly in both platelets and monocytes in human diabetic subjects.    3)	It is unclear how COX and RAGE expression was regulated, but histone modifications may be one of the mechanisms. Data from cultured cells indicated that increased COX expression was associated with increased histone acetylation levels induced by TSA. Concurrent increases in histone acetylation and COX-2 levels were also observed in human Type 1 diabetes, but similar findings were not observed in human Type 2 diabetes. In addition, we failed to find an age-dependent increase in monocyte histone H4 acetylation in human Type 2 diabetes despite an age-dependent increase in monocyte COX-2 expression. Thus, whether histone hyperacetylation modulates COX expression and in what conditions require further investigation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cyclooxygenase (COX)</field><field name="subject">prostaglandin</field><field name="subject">diabetes</field><field name="subject">histone acetylation</field><field name="subject">receptors for advanced glycation end product (RAGE)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080206.121439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining an urban water consumption model based on socio-demographic factors</field><field name="creator">Cheruseril, Jimmy Jose</field><field name="description">Water is a limited and essential resource for living and its importance is understood by all. Water is a scarce resource in Australia. Many of the river basins in Australia cover only a small area and the rivers that drain them are seasonal in flow. Climate change coupled with increasing population and a growing economy has put stress on the existing water resources.  In the period of drought between 2003 and 2005 the careful consumption of water was of high importance and there is a consequent need to develop new methods to use water wisely. The state and federal governments have initiated many campaigns over the past decade to reduce water consumption and conserve water. This thesis aims to identify the relationship between socio-demographic factors and water consumption using multivariate analysis techniques and geographic information systems (GIS).     This thesis has examined the water consumption patterns of Metropolitan Melbourne on a postcode level during the period 2000-2005. It has investigated how these patterns have altered with time and examined whether or not these changes are geographically linked. The effectiveness of the advertising campaigns and educational programs undertaken during the study period by The Victorian Government and its impact on Melbourne's water usage has been evaluated. Moran's I statistic was performed using water consumption to find spatial autocorrelation among postcodes.  Multivariate techniques of factor and regression analysis were used to develop a model based on socio-demographic predictors to estimate water consumption. The relationship between separate dwellings, business counts, distance from GPO, semi detached dwellings and academically less qualified residents has been identified in this study. The numbers of separate dwellings and businesses have a significant influence on water consumption. Water use and soci o-demographic data are visualised by the creation of thematic maps using GIS.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Water Consumption</field><field name="subject">Multivariate analysis</field><field name="subject">socio-demographics</field><field name="subject">GIS.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080206.123148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dance, Drama and Music - a Foundation for Education: A Study on Implementing the Performing Arts in the Early Years of Education</field><field name="creator">Crowe, Susan</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT   In the early years of education, the Performing Arts assume a particular significance as learning is both in and through the Arts. When appropriately managed, they are enjoyed in their own right, but also permeate other areas of the curriculum enabling greater relevance and meaning. The Performing Arts are an excellent means through which children, in their early years of schooling explore and express their feelings. Dance, drama and music are Arts disciplines through which children investigate ideas and exhibit opinions about their known and unknown world. The Performing Arts make an effective contribution to the personal and social development of children. The Performing Arts provide an interesting way for teaching young children the values which many adults believe are vital in today's society. Through the Arts children are able to develop social competencies. Participation in the Arts motivates and enhances young children's desire to learn. The Arts have an important role in inspiring and improving the w hole school environment.      This research investigated the teaching of the Performing Arts in primary schools in Catholic Education in the Northern Zone of the Diocese of Ballarat. Literature on curriculum development, education in early schooling, and delivery of the arts and education is examined, as well as the impact of the implementation of the Performing Arts stream of the Victorian Essential Learning Standards. Education of pre-service teachers and the continued professional development of experienced teachers is discussed as is the role of education systems in providing this teacher education.      Generalist (non-specialist) teachers from primary schools in the Northern Zone were surveyed and interviewed to establish the current situation regarding the Performing Arts in schools. Based on the literature and the data collected and analysed from the survey and interviews, a number of teaching for learning models were proposed. These models placed the child at the centre of the educational experience, linking the school to the community. The models were informed by current Government and Catholic Education policy. The various components included the current curriculum the Victorian Essential Learning Standards, the important roles played by the school, the teacher and parents. The importance of teacher education and further professional development to ensure the teacher has the knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to implement a quality program was also an important aspect of the models.       Findings from the research established that many teachers had basic skills in teaching the different areas of Performing Arts, but lacked confidence in their ability to do so. Therefore, in a number of schools, programs in Performing Arts were either based around the annual school concert or were non-existent. Many teachers used simple Performing Arts activities as a means to teaching knowledge and skills in other curriculum areas.       As a result of the research findings and the model development, a resource to enable and assist in the teaching of the Performing Arts was developed for the teachers to implement an appropriate Performing Arts program in the early years of education.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Performing Arts</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Teaching and Learning</field><field name="subject">Early Years (5 - 10 years).</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080207.135338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Values that you hold: Encountering Change in an Adult Community Education Program in Victoria</field><field name="creator">Curlewis, Margaret Judith</field><field name="description">This thesis research reports on the Adult Community Education (ACE) sector in the Australian State of Victoria. Although it concentrates on Moreland Adult Education Assoc. (MAE) as a case study, it places MAE in the wider context of ACE in the local area of the Northern Metropolitan region of Melbourne.    Although periodically referred to as the 'fourth educational sector' and funded by the same government departments as mainstream post-secondary sectors, ACE has always had a low profile and quasi-educational status due to the extreme variety of its venues, courses and locations, making it difficult to define and market as an entity.   This study uses a range of qualitative methodologies suited to historical, educational research to provide a framework based around the initial guiding questions: 'Is ACE becoming TAFE?' and 'Who uses ACE and Why?'   MAE  was used as a case study because it was created by its local community in 1982 after which it expanded and developed from one-to-one pairs of volunteer tutors and literacy students to being a nationally Registered Training Organisation delivering accredited courses up to Diploma level. This expansion placed great strain on the infrastructure and personnel of the organisation, particularly during the main period of this research (1994 to 2004).   Beginning with a review of the ACE sector, the thesis then describes the northern region of the Melbourne suburbs by using the data gained from a survey questionnaire. Further narrowing the research focus, the thesis analyses the development of the organisation over the ten year study period. The second half of the thesis emphasises the people of MAE through 18 interviews by analysing their opinions, life-experiences and perceptions of change to create a sense of their connectedness to the local community and MAE.   The primary aims of this thesis are to document an example of the development of an ACE centre and how it managed change during a ten year period. It records a sense of how and why people engaged in the sector and some of their lived-experiences and their responses to changes. Data analysis results in three sets of findings and propositions in the categories of sectoral, organisational and personal. These key findings involve a range of externally applied pressures being brought to bear on both ACE and MAE. This is counteracted by individual resistance to change, creating a tension which threatens MAE's long-term sustainability.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult Education</field><field name="subject">Community</field><field name="subject">Lifelong Learning</field><field name="subject">ACE</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080207.142645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Middle Years of Schooling: The pressures on rural adolescents to achieve academically</field><field name="creator">Demarte, Adele Louise</field><field name="description">Within a climate of continual change this study offers insights into the academic pressures experienced by rural adolescents to achieve at school. In the often challenging transition from childhood to adulthood expectations from others place additional pressures on adolescents' lives.   To better understand these pressures, I conducted a qualitative study of six students (ages nine to 15) and their teachers in the Middle Years of Schooling within rural Victoria, Australia. Students were studied prior to the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) in order to examine the pressures on students facing the Middle Years of Schooling. The study was carried out over a 6 month period using a Naturalistic Inquiry process with semi-structured interviews and participant observation. This allowed access into the participants' subjective insights. A Collective case study approach was employed to situate the information in its holistic environment and offer thick and information rich narratives depicting the experiences of these early adolescents. The case studies also involved examination of the school experiences of the early adolescents. Academic pressure was then broadly viewed in light of these experiences and recommendations offered.    The findings from this research revealed that the early adolescents in the study all experienced degrees of academic pressure and demonstrated varied abilities to cope with these pressures. External support provided by parents, the school, teachers and peers tended to provide support more than fostering resilience.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Middle Years</field><field name="subject">Middle Years of Schooling</field><field name="subject">Adolescence</field><field name="subject">Adolescents</field><field name="subject">Support</field><field name="subject">Academic Achievement</field><field name="subject">Achievement</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Pressure</field><field name="subject">Pressures</field><field name="subject">Expectations</field><field name="subject">Rural</field><field name="subject">Cope</field><field name="subject">Coping</field><field name="subject">External Support</field><field name="subject">Peers</field><field name="subject">Fostering Resilience</field><field name="subject">Resilience.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080208.145838</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling and Improving the Performance of Interactive TCP Traffic in Computer Networks</field><field name="creator">Dimopoulos, Peter</field><field name="description">The Internet has become one of the most widely used forms of communication   available. Many applications used on the Internet require the user to   interact constantly with the network. For example web browsing where the   user will expect the browser to respond quickly, to finish loading pages   quickly and to do all of this at an equal level for all users. The network's   performance is dependant on the protocols it uses and how the resources of   the network are distributed. This is why TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)   is one of the most important protocols, because it controls the amount of   data entering the network and provides reliability to most interactive   applications.      The thesis starts by introducing a basic TCP model which is later extended   to model the effects of burstiness produced by TCP. Burstiness can cause a   routers buffer to unnecessarily overflow. These overflows cause TCP   connections to under-utilise link bandwidth because of unnecessary packet   retransmissions. A model to define a quantitative measure of both burstiness   and throughput of a system of TCP connections is introduced. The model gives   insight into how the TCP protocol causes burstiness and can be used to find   scenarios where burstiness is decreased. This helps to improve the   utilization of links by reducing the burstiness of protocols.      An important performance metric for interactive traffic is user perceived   delay, the delay that an end user would encounter when using an application.   An example of user perceived delay is the time a user waits before a HTML   web page starts loading. The retransmission delays are the most important   type of delay for interactive traffic because they are usually very large. A   dynamic priority RED Queue (DPRQ) is introduced which changes the priority   of the queues based on the goodput (throughput of succesfully transmitted   packets) threshold of the interactive traffic. Using dynamic priority allows   packet loss to be reduced by up to eight times for interactive traffic,   which intern reduces retransmission delay.      Fairness measures how equally network resources are allocated amongst   different connections. When a link with TCP connections is overloaded each   connection on the link will reduce its throughput to allow all the   connections to have approximately equal load. This does not take into   account that other links may be under utilized. The fairness issue is   addressed by introducing Multipath TCP (MATCP) which allows path selection   to occur at the TCP layer. This allows each unique flow to take a different   path, instead of all the flows of one source using the same path. Using   MATCP, a finer grain of load-balancing can be achieved and the complexity   and state required in the network is greatly reduced.      Two analytic models are provided in chapters three and four, which   investigate slow start and TCP burstiness. In chapter five the DPRQ queue is   introduced to reduce user perceived delay. An analytic model of the DPRQ is   provided and verified through experimental simulation. In chapter six an   analytic model of Multipath TCP is provided, which is also verified by   simulation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TCP</field><field name="subject">Interactive</field><field name="subject">Model</field><field name="subject">Multipath</field><field name="subject">Dynamic Priority</field><field name="subject">Burstiness</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080208.150856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">re:Making, making as a continual remaking of space</field><field name="creator">Craig, Douglas</field><field name="description">The act of making challenges ideas through fabrication and the laws of reality that are part of becoming.      This research explores the making of physical models as a design process where that act of making 'models for'1 design intention is itself a rich field of speculation. These models for design intention are different to the models of design intention as they are less a finished and singular object, and more an instrument for thinking. The aim of this research is to explore the qualities of models for design intention through an engagement with the landscape in order to understand making as a transformative and emergent process of space, time, material, technique, and the role of the observer.      Making for design, the model as idea, seeks to both test and provide opportunities for the convergence of forces and relationships to be created and emergent. Fundamental to this notion is an understanding that the act of making is itself a continual re-making process. The reciprocity invoked by this action engages a rich field of criteria which are potent because of their schizophrenic nature.      This paper will discuss my research through a number of projects and esquisses that have been explored during the course of this research which demonstrate the development of my position of making as a continual re-making of space.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">making</field><field name="subject">representation</field><field name="subject">landscape architecture</field><field name="subject">models</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080208.151424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The factors that shape the valuing of textile education in secondary schools</field><field name="creator">DuVernet, Louise Frances</field><field name="description">Views on the valuing and revitalization of textiles education in secondary schools in New South Wales (NSW) vary widely. NSW is unique in that it is the only state in Australia to have a discrete textiles related subject offered for their senior secondary qualifications. The introduction of a new syllabus for the upper secondary schools in 1999 saw the Higher School Certificate (HSC) subject of Textiles and Design become the fastest growing HSC subject from 2000 - 2004. The fact that the subject survived the review of the New HSC was a testimony to the support it received from all sectors of textiles education from secondary to tertiary level and from the professional associations representing the textiles industry.  The main concern expressed by the teachers in the secondary schools was the ageing of the current teaching population and the inadequacy of the training institutions to train teachers in sufficient quantity and quality to replace those who are antici pated to retire over the next five years.      The study aimed to identify the perceived value of textiles education as a means of supporting the promotion of the subject and to uncover any negative perceptions of the subject and its future so strategies could be developed to overcome any barriers to the revival and maintenance of the subject beyond 2010. Of particular interest was the value of textiles education in bridging a cultural divide between migrant students and the schools and its importance to students of all abilities for its development and expression of creativity. The negative aspects of the cost of resources and perception of low status as an academic subject in schools are addressed.      The significance of the study is based in the inclusive nature of the participants represented in the study that include head teachers, secondary textiles teachers, student teachers and secondary textiles students. The diversity of perspectives gave richness to the data and provides some wonderful insights into the dynamic relationships that affect the effective presentation of textiles curriculum in secondary schools. Using models to analyse the historical influences on current perceptions of textiles, the study found evidence of the resilience and drive of new young teachers who are often not given the encouragement to develop their skills in preparation to support the future of textiles education in NSW.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textiles</field><field name="subject">secondary education</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="subject">connection</field><field name="subject">expression of creativity</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080208.162750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The phenomenon of resilience as described by people who have experienced mental illness</field><field name="creator">Edward, Karen-leigh</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to explore the phenomenon of resilience as described by consumers of mental health services in Australia who have experienced mental illness. In keeping with Colaizzi's (1978) approach to inquiry, information in this study was gathered through in-depth, semi-structured individual interviews. Information analysis was undertaken using Colaizzi's (1978) seven-step approach, with the inclusion of two additional steps- making this study's analysis a nine step process. Emergent themes were explicated from the findings of this study as follows: Universality; Acceptance; Naming and knowing; Faith, hope and being the fool; Striking a balance; Having meaning and meaningful relationships; and 'Just doing it'. The emergent concept which encapsulated the themes was 'viewing life from the ridge with eyes wide open'. In respect of this concept, participants described resilience was achieved by choosing to walk through the darkness all the while  knowing the risks and dangers ahead; Making a decision for life through the hardships. That is, following a moment of enlightenment through 'naming and knowing', participants said they were able to start making decisions and to process what was happening to them by having faith, hope, acceptance, and by 'just getting on with life'. It is suggested that resilient behaviours can be learned and interwoven with life experiences.  In this context, there is the potential to guide therapeutic interventions in various clinical and educational settings.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Colaizzi</field><field name="subject">Mental illness</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Resilience</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080212.094504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimisation of parametric equations for shock transmission through surface ships from underwater explosions</field><field name="creator">Elder, David James</field><field name="description">Currently shock effects on surface ships can be determined by full scale shock trials, Finite Element Analysis or semi empirical methods that reduce the analytical problem to a limited number of degrees of freedom and include hull configurations, construction methods and materials in an empirical way to determine any debilitating effects that an explosion may have on the ship.

This creates large volumes of tailings, which must be handled and stored responsibly to avoid potential environmental catastrophes.  The most common form of tailings storage facility is the impoundment, where tailings are contained within a basin, with beaches forming around the perimeter of the impoundment and a pond standing in the middle.  A relatively new method of tailings storage is to create a 'stack', whereby the tailings solids form a large heap, with the discharge of tailings slurry from the apex of the heap.  It is of significant value for mine operators and tailings engineers to be able to predict the shape of the beach that forms in either of these disposal scenarios.  The key to being able to do this relies on a method of prediction of the beach slope.       The aim of this work is to develop a method of tailings beach slope prediction for tailings slurries that are sub-aerially discharged from a pipe.      In this thesis a literature review is undertaken, investigating existing methods for the prediction of tailings beach slopes.  These methods are validated against relevant industrial and experimental data.      Two separate phases of experimental work have taken place in an effort to investigate tailings deposition behaviour, one at mine sites and the other in a laboratory on a small scale.        Three new tailings beach slope prediction models are presented; a simple empirical model enabling quick approximate predictions; an a priori tailings beach slope prediction model based on existing theories of open channel flow, sediment transport and rheology, which is more powerful due to the greater degree of theory in its foundation; and a new semi-empirical model that shares some of the theoretical aspects of the a priori model but offers better predictions due to its empirical calibration to the experimental data.        The experimental results, along with 3 other independently collected sets of relevant industrial and experimental data, are used to validate the beach slope prediction models found in the literature, as well as the new beach slope models presented in this thesis.   Statistical evaluation of the performance of all of these models is presented to enable comparison.      Finally, a new beach shape model is presented for the three dimensional geometric forecasting of the beach surface of a tailings stack.  Historic tailings discharge data is run through the beach shape model, and the shapes predicted by the model are compared with aerial survey data of a real tailings stack for validation of the shape model.  This work not only presents a new method of tailings stack shape prediction, but also a plausible theory for explaining the concavity of tailings beaches.  The stack shape model also has the potential to be developed further for the three dimensional modelling of tailings beaches formed in other types of storage facilities, such as impoundments or valleys.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tailings</field><field name="subject">beach slope</field><field name="subject">stack</field><field name="subject">rheology</field><field name="subject">open channel</field><field name="subject">non-Newtonian</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080212.120813</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monte Carlo Simulation of Large Angle Scattering Effects in Heavy Ion Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis and Ion Transmission Through Nanoapertures.</field><field name="creator">Franich, Rick</field><field name="description">Heavy Ion Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis (HIERDA) is a versatile Ion Beam Analysis technique well suited to multi-elemental depth profiling of thin layered structures and near-surface regions of materials. An existing limitation is the inability to accurately account for the pronounced broadening and tailing effects of multiple scattering typically seen in HIERDA spectra. This thesis investigates the role of multiple large angle scattering in heavy ion applications such as HIERDA, and seeks to quantify its contribution to experimental output. This is achieved primarily by the development of a computer simulation capable of predicting these contributions and using it to classify and quantify the interactions that cause them. Monte Carlo ion transport simulation is used to generate simulated HIERDA spectra and the results are compared to experimental data acquired using the Time of Flight HIERDA facility at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisat ion.      A Monte Carlo simulation code was adapted to the simulation of HIERDA spectra with considerable attention on improving the modelling efficiency to reduce processing time. Efficiency enhancements have achieved simulation time reductions of two to three orders of magnitude. The simulation is shown to satisfactorily reproduce the complex shape of HIERDA spectra. Some limitations are identified in the ability to accurately predict peak widths and the absolute magnitude of low energy tailing in some cases. The code is used to identify the plural scattering contribution to the spectral features under investigation, and the complexity of plurally scattered ion and recoil paths is demonstrated. The program is also shown to be useful in the interpretation of overlapped energy spectra of elements of similar mass whose signals cannot be reliably separated experimentally.      The effect of large angle scattering on the transmission of heavy ions through a nano-scale aperture mask, used to collimate an ion beam to a very small beam spot, is modelled using a version of the program adapted to handle the more complex geometry of the aperture mask. The effectiveness of nano-aperture collimation was studied for a variety of ion-energy combinations. Intensity, energy, and angular distributions of transmitted ions were calculated to quantify the degree to which scattering within the mask limits the spatial resolution achievable. The simulation successfully predicted the effect of misaligning the aperture and the beam, and the result has subsequently been observed experimentally.       Transmitted ion distributions showed that the higher energy heavier ions studied are more effectively collimated than are lower energy lighter ions. However, there is still a significant probability of transmission of heavy ions with substantial residual energy beyond the perimeter of the aperture. For the intended application, ion beam lithography, these ions are likely to be problematic. The results indicate that medium energy He ions are the more attractive option, as the residual energy of scattered transmitted ions can be more readily managed by customising the etching process. Continuing research by experimentalists working in this area is proceeding in this direction as a result of the conclusions from this work.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Monte Carlo Simulation</field><field name="subject">Multiple scattering</field><field name="subject">Plural Scattering</field><field name="subject">Ion Beam Analysis</field><field name="subject">Heavy Ion Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis</field><field name="subject">HIERDA</field><field name="subject">Nano-aperture</field><field name="subject">Ion Beam Lithography</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080212.121837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of live vectored vaccines targeting the alpha-toxin of Clostridium perfringens for the prevention of necrotic enteritis in poultry</field><field name="creator">Gatsos, Xenia</field><field name="description">The &#131;&#209;-toxin of Clostridium perfringens is a toxin involved in numerous diseases of humans and agriculturally important animals.  One of these diseases is necrotic enteritis (NE), a sporadic enteric disease which affects avian species world-wide.  This study involved the inactivation of alpha-toxin (&#131;&#209;-toxin) for use as a potential vaccine candidate to combat NE in chickens, and other diseases caused by C. perfringens type A.       During the course of this research a number of &#131;&#209;-toxin recombinant proteins were developed through molecular inactivation of the &#131;&#209;-toxin gene, plc.  Proteins plc316 and plc204 were developed by the deletion of the first three and seven &#131;&#209;-helices of the N-terminal domain respectively.  These deletions resulted in proteins which were unstable in solution, constantly aggregated into insoluble masses and elicited lower overall antibody responses when administered to mice.       A third protein, plcInv3 was developed from the deletion of part of the catalytic domain of the &#131;&#209;-toxin.  PlcInv3 was highly soluble and upon immunisation of mice elicited a significant antibody response which was also capable of protecting mice against a live challenge of C. perfringens.      The fourth and final protein developed was plc104.  The smallest of the recombinant &#131;&#209;-toxin proteins, it consisted entirely of the C-terminal domain of &#131;&#209;-toxin.  Its small size did not affect its ability to induce a strong antibody response when administered to mice, the antibodies of which were also protective during a challenge with C. perfringens.        STM1, an attenuated strain of S. Typhimurium was used in the development of a vectored vaccine for the expression and oral delivery of plcInv3 and plc104 within the mouse host.  The proteins were expressed within STM1 from expression plasmids containing the in vivo inducible promoters PhtrA and PpagC.        A measurable humoral immune response against &#131;&#209;-toxin was absent following three oral vaccinations with the vectored vaccines, although, cytokine profiling of splenocytes from vaccinated mice revealed an increase in the number of interleukin-4 (IL-4)secreting cells and the lack of interferon-gamma (IFN-&#131;&#215;) secreting cells.  This indicated the stimulation of a T-helper type 2 (TH2) immune response which also lead to partial protection against a live C. perfringens challenge.      This study demonstrates the feasibility of using STM1 as a carrier for the in vivo expression of the C. perfringens &#131;&#209;-toxin recombinant proteins plcInv3 and plc104.  It is the first study to express C. perfringens antigens within an attenuated strain of S. Typhimurium, STM1.The partial protection of mice immunised with these vaccines indicates there is potential for this vectored vaccine system to be used in the protection of diseases caused by the &#131;&#209;-toxin of C. perfringens.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clostridium perfringens</field><field name="subject">phospholipase C</field><field name="subject">alpha toxin</field><field name="subject">immunisation</field><field name="subject">gas gangrene</field><field name="subject">necrotic enteritis</field><field name="subject">Salmonella Typhimurium</field><field name="subject">STM1</field><field name="subject">antibodies</field><field name="subject">humoral immunity</field><field name="subject">TH2</field><field name="subject">toxoid</field><field name="subject">recombinant vaccine</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080212.142403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Censored Regression Techniques for Credit Scoring</field><field name="creator">Glasson, Samuel</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the use of newly-developed survival analysis tools for credit scoring. Credit scoring techniques are currently used by financial institutions to estimate the probability of a customer defaulting on a loan by a predetermined time in the future. While a number of classification techniques are currently used, banks are now becoming more concerned with estimating the lifetime of the loan rather than just the probability of default. Difficulties arise when using standard statistical techniques due to the presence of censoring in the data. Survival analysis, originating from medical and engineering fields, is an area of statistics that typically deals with censored lifetime data. The theoretical developments in this thesis revolve around linear regression for censored data, in particular the Buckley-James method. The Buckley-James method is analogous to linear regression and gives estimates of the mean expected lifetime given a set of explanato ry variables. The first development is a measure of fit for censored regression, similar to the classical r-squared of linear regression. Next, the variable-reduction technique of stepwise selection is extended to the Buckley-James method. For the last development, the Buckley-James algorithm is altered to incorporate non-linear regression methods such as neural networks and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). MARS shows promise in terms of predictive power and interpretability in both simulation and empirical studies. The practical section of the thesis involves using the new techniques to predict the time to default and time to repayment of unsecured personal loans from a database obtained from a major Australian bank. The analyses are unique, being the first published work on applying Buckley-James and related methods to a large-scale financial database.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Credit scoring</field><field name="subject">survival analysis</field><field name="subject">Buckley-James regression</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080212.151610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Trace Metals on the Australian Abalone, Haliotis rubra</field><field name="creator">Gorski, Jacquelle</field><field name="description">This thesis focussed on the effects of a range of trace metals on various stages of Haliotis rubra development.   The trace metals assessed in this thesis were the essential metals Cu, Zn and Fe; and, the non-essential metals Hg, Cd and Pb.  Copper and Hg proved to be the two most toxic metals to the life stages of H. rubra studied. The concentrations affecting normal development of the fertilised egg exposed for 48h showed a decreasing order of toxicity with 48hEC50 recorded at 7&#181;g Cu/L, 20&#181;g Hg/L, 42&#181;g Zn/L, 4,102&#181;g Fe/L, 4,515&#181;g Cd/L, and 5,111&#181;g Pb/L. Settlement and metamorphosis occur in normal larvae when aged 5 days, and exposure of the 5 day old larvae to the metals for 48h resulted in impaired crawling success at 128&#181;g/L Cu and Hg, and 1250&#181;g Cd/L.  Settlement was inhibited after exposure to 128&#181;g Cu/L, 32&#181;g Hg/L, and 1250 Cd/L.  Metamorphosis of larvae 96h after exposure was inhibited by 32&#181;g Cu/L, 512&#181;g Zn/L, 32&#181;g Hg/L and 625&#181;g Cd/L.  The rate of meta morphosis was enhanced after exposure to Cu and Hg at 0.5&#181;g/L and 64 - 256&#181;g Zn/L. Exposure to Zn at concentrations 64, 128 and 256 &#181;g Zn/L caused an increased rate of settlement and metamorphosis.  Juvenile H. rubra exposed to the six metals for 96h were most sensitive to Cu, which produced a 96hLC50 of 87&#181;g Cu/L compared to Hg with a 96hLC50 of 173&#181;g Hg/L.  Juvenile H. rubra were relatively insensitive to Zn and Cd with the 96h LC50 of 1730&#181;g Zn/L and 3700&#181;g Cd/L, respectively. Exposure to individual solutions of Cu, Zn, and Cd for 28 days resulted in juvenile H. rubra bioaccumulating significant concentrations of metals in the visceramantleedible foot muscle.  Accumulation of Hg was greater in the mantle-viscera-edible foot muscle.  Following exposure, depuration in clean seawater for 28 days produced varying decreases in metal concentrations for each tissue compartment.  Sodium-potassium activated ATPase (Na+,K+-ATPase) activity in the gills of juvenile H. rubra was significantly affected following expos ure to the trace metals for 28 days, with a decreasing order of effect on enzyme activity of Hg-Cu-Cd-Zn.  Depuration of H. rubra in clean seawater for 28 days resulted in the recovery of Na+,K+-ATPase activity to varying degrees.  The recovery of ATPase activity was more efficient following exposure to Cd-Zn-Cu-Hg.  The overall results of this thesis provide initial baseline information to evaluate the sensitivity of H. rubra to trace metal toxicants, and these results may be utilised by regulators for establishing marine water quality guidelines to protect H. rubra and other abalone species in their natural habitats.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Haliotis rubra</field><field name="subject">blacklip abalone</field><field name="subject">trace metals</field><field name="subject">larvae</field><field name="subject">fertilisation</field><field name="subject">morphology</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">settlement</field><field name="subject">metamorphosis</field><field name="subject">juvenile</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="subject">bioaccumulation</field><field name="subject">depuration</field><field name="subject">enzyme</field><field name="subject">ATPase</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080212.153333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flow-induced crystallization of polybutene-1 and effect of molecular parameters</field><field name="creator">Hadinata, Chitiur</field><field name="description">There are two main goals of this thesis: to investigate the flow-induced crystallization behaviour of Polybutene-1 (PB-1 samples, and to study the effects of molecular parameters on the crystallization behaviour While flow-induced crystallization is not a new area in polymer research, well-defined experimental methods that allow access to high flow rate range comparable to that encountered in real processing are still lacking. Two types of flow are considered: shear and uniaxial elongational. Regarding the second aim, several molecular parameters considered are: molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, isotacticity, presence of nucleating agents, and copolymer content. For this purpose an array of PB-1 samples were used. It is found that each of these parameters can have significant effect on the crystallization behaviour. Mainly rheological methods were utilized to conduct the flow-induced crystallization experiments. Crystallization onset time is define d from the change in viscosity or other related parameters. The experiments begin with low shear rate range, to ensure that the results are comparable with literature data. In this range we encounter the quasi-quiescent onset time at very small. shear rates, which draws an interesting comparison with another physical parameter, the gel time. Beyond a critical flow rate a decrease in the onset time is seen, and a plateau-and-slope trend is evident for a curve of onset time vs. shear rate. Using a combination of three experimental methods, shear rates ranging from Q0001 - 500 s-1 are successfully achieved, and a good agreement between these methods is observed. Furthermore, a normalization procedure is introduced, which yields temperature-invariant curves for the mentioned range of shear rate. For the uniaxial elongation flow, the Elongational Viscosity Fixture (EVF) is employed, with the strain rate ranging from 0.0001 - 10 s'. A greater reduction in onset time as compared to shear (at the same shear/strain r ate) is observed, and the difference in the onset times for shear and elongation already reaches more than one decade for a flow rate of 10 5. This quantitative comparison is particularly important; since not so many data on elongation-induced crystallization are available in the literature. Finally, the thesis compares several flow induced crystallization models that can be useful as prediction tools and selects one of these models to be compared with the experimental data. A qualitative agreement is found, however, for better quantitative prediction the model still needs to be.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flow-induced crystallization</field><field name="subject">shear flow</field><field name="subject">elongational flow</field><field name="subject">polybutene-1</field><field name="subject">molecular weight distribution</field><field name="subject">crystallization onset time</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080212.163803</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The practice and the community: a proposition for the possible contribution of communication design to public space</field><field name="creator">Haslem, Neal Ragnar</field><field name="description">The practice of communication design has developed from a visual-communication service industry into a multi-facetted profession, directly involved with the maintenance and creation of social and cultural capital. The ancestry of communication design has led to its continued perception as a neutral tool for the achievement of communication.       This research project aims to investigate the possible contributions of communication design as a practice, if it were to re-align its goals towards supporting and facilitating the community within which it is practiced.      This research project is about the communication designer and the communities within which they practice: clients; target markets; companies; managers; neighbourhood groups; groups in a particular place and time; communities of practitioners; and emergent or yet to emerge communities.      The project investigates designer agency and the ways for a communication designer to work holistically within communities: being or becoming part of them; working through and with them toward the achievement of communication goals. As much as it is about communicating, it is also about community.       It is about designers working as conduits, facilitating and enabling the communities of their practice to find expression. It is about a democratisation of communication design authorship and power.       It is about the design process as an educational process - all parts and participants within a design projects' community learning and teaching simultaneously.

The research was undertaken as a Masters degree by project. The project consists of a CD containing an online gallery showcasing works of art and an accompanying exegesis.      The exegesis is structured into seven chapters, which consider, analyse and define what the key characteristics of Interaction Design are, where it comes from, and how it improves the quality of interactive multimedia applications. The exegesis includes four case studies that look at how other practitioners in the digital realm have created systems for showcasing narrative or creative content online. I examine alternative artworks and how they have shaped the development of creative media. I investigate what experts in the field define as good Interaction Design and what guidelines and principles they recommend. I show how these guidelines conflict with more creative approaches and how good design and creativity can be merged to be usable and friendly to users. I also look at the history of opponents of guidelines and principles and how their contribution helps make design better.       By creating the example gallery I aim to help designers working within the field of ID to understand the principles behind good design in order that they may deliver higher-quality user experiences relevant to the content they are displaying. By creating this gallery I also hope to help artists understand the principles behind good design in order that they may showcase their artworks in ways appropriate to their artwork. By designing and building an example I aim to provide a better understanding of how to construct a feature-rich application in an easy to use and understandable environment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interaction Design</field><field name="subject">multimedia</field><field name="subject">gallery</field><field name="subject">interactive</field><field name="subject">interactive multimedia</field><field name="subject">on-line art</field><field name="subject">gallery</field><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">art gallery</field><field name="subject">navigation</field><field name="subject">digital</field><field name="subject">digital artworks</field><field name="subject">African safari</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080213.091808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Front Line is Everywhere: For a Critique of Radical Commodities</field><field name="creator">Haylock, Bradley John</field><field name="description">This dissertation addresses the phenomenon of 'radical commodities'-commercial products which advance an oppositional politics. Examples of such include the products of Rage Against The Machine, a 'revolutionary' rock band; Michael Moore, a best-selling author and award-winning documentary filmmaker; Naomi Klein, a journalist and author of the international bestseller No Logo; The Body Shop, a multinational manufacturer and retailer of 'natural' cosmetics and toiletries; Freitag, a company which manufactures bags, wallets and other fashionable accessories from recycled materials, and; the Adbusters Media Foundation, publisher of Adbusters magazine and producer of Blackspot shoes. Radical commodities are fundamentally paradoxical objects whose apparent ethic would appear to be at odds with the fact that they are commodities. This dissertation asks: can a commodity-object legitimately serve as a vehicle for social and political critique?   It is reasoned that the problem of radical commodities is principally structural. Marx's seminal writings on the commodity accordingly represent the logical point of departure. The Marxian analysis illuminates not only the commodity-structure, but also the political problematic which emerges from that structure-for Marx, the commodity is a mechanism of exploitation. From an orthodox Marxist perspective, the idea of a radical commodity would therefore be most contradictory, or indeed impossible. It is argued, however, that the Marxian analysis is inconclusive.   This dissertation traces a genealogy of analyses of the commodity, which variously advance or diverge from the orthodox Marxist position. From a perspective of the consumption of commodity-objects, the radical commodity would appear to be possible. Yet, the relationship between the commodity-structure and the capitalist ideology runs deep. The question of the radical commodity is therefore markedly more complex than it might initially appear. With regard to the ideological consequence of the commodity-structure, however, certain streams of post-Marxist analysis are themselves problematic, for they ultimately short-circuit historical critique and destabilise the very possibility of politics. In contrast, this dissertation seeks to reaffirm a place for politics and, in so doing, to establish the theoretical possibility of radical commodities.   To contend that the idea of a radical commodity is not fundamentally contradictory, however, says nothing of the political potency of such objects. These are undoubtedly complex objects, whose peculiarities cannot be ascertained by abstract theorisation alone. For this reason, this dissertation also employs empirical analyses of a number of radical commodities.   In sum, it is argued that the sphere of commodities should be admitted as a possible site for the expression or implementation of a radical politics, and thus that radical commodities should be understood as a legitimate vehicle for social and political critique, but that such objects are by no means free from contradiction, and that the political efficacy of these products is anything but guaranteed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="subject">Cultural Studies</field><field name="subject">Consumption</field><field name="subject">Consumer Society</field><field name="subject">Commodities</field><field name="subject">Radical Commodities</field><field name="subject">Marx</field><field name="subject">Baudrillard</field><field name="subject">Veblen</field><field name="subject">Fetishism</field><field name="subject">Ideology</field><field name="subject">Rage Against The Machine</field><field name="subject">The Body Shop</field><field name="subject">Naomi Klein</field><field name="subject">No Logo</field><field name="subject">Michael Moore</field><field name="subject">Freitag</field><field name="subject">Adbusters</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080213.095326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Animated proportional Venn diagrams: a study into their description, construction and business application</field><field name="creator">Hingston, Phillip Anthony</field><field name="description">Anecdotal observation of the way in which data visualisation techniques are utilised to present relationships in data to audiences informed the author's view that data visualisation had not evolved to utilise the capabilities of ubiquitous business computer equipment. In an information rich but attention poor business environment, a search for a new tool was undertaken to supplement those techniques available to help audiences understand statistical relationships in presentation data.      This search resulted in the development of a practical software tool based on animated Venn diagrams (Dvenn) that attempted to exploit the inherent human ability to perceive quantities visually, a faculty described herein as visual numeracy. The exploitation of this faculty is considered here to be a valuable aid for group understanding of business presentation data. The development of the tool was an essential part of the research that was undertaken and the resulting software forms a significant portion of this practise based research. The aim of the software development was to develop a readily accessible tool that could be utilised in a non-specialist business environment to better facilitate an honest shared meaning of numerical data between a presenter and their audience.      The development of the tool progressed through a number of iterations and the software that accompanies this work is an important component that needs to be viewed in conjunction with the text. The test of the final version was undertaken with undergraduate University students in an attempt to validate the efficacy of the data visualisation technique. The test of the Dvenn software was made against the mature yardstick of scatter-plots. Interestingly, the correlations presented by scatter-plot were not as readily identified as would have been assumed, however, the results for the Dvenn tests were not supportive of the technique for widespread adoption. Nevertheless, further research into the best method of harnessing visual numeracy would seem to be justified.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Data Visualisation</field><field name="subject">Semiotics</field><field name="subject">Venn Diagrams</field><field name="subject">Data Animation</field><field name="subject">Set Theory</field><field name="subject">Information Display</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080213.111255</field></doc><doc><field name="title" /><field name="creator">Horvat, Les</field><field name="description">Through a qualitative study of professional photographers who were born overseas, or whose parents were born overseas; this research aims to provide an analysis of factors brought about by cultural dislocation, and how these factors may affect the creative process.

Recognising the complex dynamics and range of actors in this diverse and emerging sector, this study chooses to document the external influences, use and impact of ICT on social enterprises.  The problem investigated is the potential gap between the rhetoric of the 'promise of e-business' versus the dynamics of enactment and impacts of ICT in practice in the social enterprise sector.      The methodology consists of a mixed-method data collection strategy to triangulate data sources from a diverse cross-section of organisations in the social enterprise sector in Cambodia.  These include a cross-sectional survey, interviews, observations, document analysis and review of artefacts.  It is unclear whether the Cambodian social enterprise sector represents a unique case or is representative of other countries.  Regardless, the rich dynamics of the sector and the current lack of understanding of ICT use by this sector in developing countries per se warrant such a study.  It fills a significant gap in the field of ICT and development by providing an in-depth overview of the social enterprise sector in one developing country, which may also be applicable in other developing country contexts.      The research maps the e-business status of Cambodian social enterprises along a continuum from precursor activity to fully integrated e-services.  It finds that Cambodian social enterprises believe ICT adds value to their operation; however access to affordable and reliable local ICT resources is an important factor determining long-term uptake.  It also shows that external support is seen as vital to the success of ICT uptake by social enterprises in Cambodia.  Donors have the most significant influence on social enterprises' framing of ICT, whilst NGOs, associations and the private sector are also important institutional players in shaping understanding and uptake of ICT.      The main contribution of the research is to identify the real development impact of ICT use by social enterprises by measuring the role of ICTs in achieving their goals.  Its major finding is that social and business missions are inextricably linked within these organisations, so to measure one in isolation of the other denies the new paradigm that social enterprises present.  The most active sub-sector explored that best reflects this unique value proposition is the emerging social outsourcing potential of the IT services sub-sector.  The handicraft and processing sub-sectors have yet to fully engage and use ICT to their maximum benefit.  The outlook for these sub-sectors is likely to require further support to best harness the potential that ICT can bring developing countries.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ICT and development</field><field name="subject">ICT4D</field><field name="subject">social enterprises</field><field name="subject">Cambodia</field><field name="subject">social outsourcing</field><field name="subject">international development</field><field name="subject">e-commerce</field><field name="subject">e-business</field><field name="subject">handicrafts</field><field name="subject">socially responsible tourism</field><field name="subject">Greater Mekong Subregion</field><field name="subject">donor relations</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080213.144134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling, Simulation and Optimisation of Asymmetric Rotor Profiles in Twin-screw Superchargers</field><field name="creator">Ilie, Katherine-Rodica</field><field name="description">There is a growing recognition worldwide of the need for more powerful, smaller petrol engines, capable of delivering the higher picking power of larger engines, yet still being economical and environmentally friendly when used for day-to-day driving. An engineering solution for more efficient engines has been considered by research so far. It has been identified that superchargers can potentially improve the performance of automotive engines; therefore research has focused on developing superchargers and supercharger components with higher efficiency. Of particular interest to the research presented in this thesis has been the twin-screw supercharging compressor with design adapted for automotive use (the twin-screw supercharger). The performance of this supercharger type depends on the volume and total losses of the air flow through the supercharger rotors more than on any other aspects of its behaviour. To accurately predict the efficiency of the twin-screw su percharger for matching a particular engine system, accurate supercharger design is required. The main objective of this research was the investigation of the existing limitations of twin-screw superchargers, in particular leakage and reduced efficiency, leading to the development of optimal asymmetric rotor profiles. This research has been completed in four stages defining an innovative rotor design method. The parametric three-dimensional geometric model of twin-screw supercharger rotors of any aspect ratio was developed. For model validation through visualisation, CAD rotor models with scalable data were generated in commercial CAD software and calibrated experimentally by Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) tests. Calibrated rotor profile data can be transferred into CAD-CFD interface for flow simulation and performance optimisation.   Through the application of this new rotor design method, new opportunities are created for the twin-screw supercharger design practice, making it a part of the engineering solution for more efficient engines.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Supercharger</field><field name="subject">Automotive</field><field name="subject">IC Engine</field><field name="subject">Parametric modelling</field><field name="subject">CAD</field><field name="subject">CFD</field><field name="subject">LDV.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080213.144857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mediating Pressure, Facilitating Exchange: 3 Architectural Projects in Pressured Urban Environments</field><field name="creator">Brewin, Ross</field><field name="description">The aim of the research is to demonstrate architectural design strategies and outcomes that provide alternative ways of considering the futures of areas under high developmental pressure. These areas are where the potential detrimental effects of unmediated, rapid change and development are at their most immediate and in need of consideration.       Urban environments are complex physical manifestations of economic, environmental, social, cultural and political pressures represented by the often competing desires of public and private interest groups. Given the enormity of scale and complexity of these pressures, it is problematic to think of architecture as something that can design everything (perhaps as seen in traditional master planning) and in doing so, solve the problem. What may be more constructive is the consideration of architecture having the potential to be involved strategically in these issues, over a number of scales to work towards positive outcomes for the public domain.      In recent years, both Victorian and Queensland state governments have released policy guiding the future growth of key regions within their borders. Each attempts to address accommodating large population increases over relatively short time periods by proposing consolidation in and around existing urban centres. This consolidation is seen as part of a strategy to limit urban sprawl and curtail its associated negative social, environmental and potential economic impacts.      These targeted 'Activity Centres' become places of immanent transformation, points of pressure within the disaggregated field of the contemporary Australian city. Left un-mediated, developmental pressure in locations such as these is likely to create the same detrimental physical and social effects evident in the general prevailing homogeneity, commercialisation and piecemeal nature of current urban development.       Through several architectural design projects, the research aims to explore the role of architecture as an urban mediator within these pressured locations. Through bridging scales from the broad metropolitan, to the finer grained specific, this mediation may begin to strategically 'set things up' for the public domain, towards facilitating valuable social exchange.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">urban</field><field name="subject">activity centres</field><field name="subject">mediation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080215.154127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Traffic Matrix Estimation in IP Networks</field><field name="creator">Eum, Suyong</field><field name="description">An Origin-Destination (OD) traffic matrix provides a major input to the design, planning and management of a telecommunications network. Since the Internet is being proposed as the principal delivery mechanism for telecommunications traffic at the present time, and this network is not owned or managed by a single entity, there are significant challenges for network planners and managers needing to determine equipment and topology configurations for the various sections of the Internet that are currently the responsibility of ISPs and traditional telcos. Planning of these sub-networks typically requires a traffic matrix of demands that is then used to infer the flows on the administrator's network. Unfortunately, computation of the traffic matrix from measurements of individual flows is extremely difficult due to the fact that the problem formulation generally leads to the need to solve an under-determined system of equations. Thus, there has been a major effort f rom among researchers to obtain the traffic matrix using various inference techniques.   The major contribution of this thesis is the development of inference techniques for traffic matrix estimation problem according to three different approaches, viz: (1) deterministic, (2) statistical, and (3) dynamic approaches. Firstly, for the deterministic approach, the traffic matrix estimation problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem based on the generalized Kruithof approach which uses the Kullback distance to measure the probabilistic distance between two traffic matrices.   In addition, an algorithm using the Affine scaling method is developed to solve the constrained optimization problem. Secondly, for the statistical approach, a series of traffic matrices are obtained by applying a standard deterministic approach. The components of these matrices represent estimates of the volumes of flows being exchanged between all pairs of nodes at the respective measurement points and they form a stochastic counting process. Then, a Markovian Arrival Process of order two (MAP-2) is applied to model the counting processes formed from this series of estimated traffic matrices. Thirdly, for the dynamic approach, the dual problem of the multi-commodity flow problem is formulated to obtain a set of link weights. The new weight set enables flows to be rerouted along new paths, which create new constraints to overcome the under-determined nature of traffic matrix estimation. Since a weight change disturbs a network, the impact of weight changes on the network is investigated by using simulation  based on the well-known ns2 simulator package. Finally, we introduce two network applications that make use of the deterministic and the statistical approaches to obtain a traffic matrix respectively and also describe a scenario for the use of the dynamic approach.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Traffic matrix</field><field name="subject">Markovian Arrival Process</field><field name="subject">estimation</field><field name="subject">network planning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080215.155526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Business of Academia: Challenges for university leadership as the knowledge industry becomes big business.</field><field name="creator">Fincher, Alison Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis examines leadership in universities, in the context of changing times, as community expectations broaden to require not only academic excellence, but also high standards of management accountability.  The impact of the volatile higher education environment on current university leaders, and the challenges they face, lies at the heart of the thesis.  The demands of this complex environment call for additional personal and professional skills.   Primary importance is given to the methods that university leaders are using to deal with the potentially conflicting demands of their academic and professional management roles.  The study is conducted in a context where conflicting demands are increasing in the higher education environment, where universities are now more dependent on private sources of income, and are increasingly managed as big businesses in response to developments in their size, complexity and annual budgets.   A selective review of the literature highlights the nature of generic business leadership theory.  Literature which addresses the higher education environment, universities as organisations, university management structures and university leadership is also reviewed.      The primary research was designed to explore ways in which the experience of individuals in the field supports the view of the literature with respect to changes in university leadership.  In addition, it was designed to provide new information from the interviewees, with respect to the challenges of their roles and the skills they employ to deal with the issues that confront them.  Eighteen interviews were conducted with university executives and other higher education experts.  A thematic review of the interview data and a further theoretical analysis, using the concept of dilemma reconciliation, revealed a broader and deeper picture of issues of higher education leadership, through first hand accounts.   Eleven dilemmas confronting contemporary university leaders emerged from the analysis of the interview transcripts. They generally relate to the transformation of universities from fully funded public institutions to largely privately funded institutions; a change which has forced them to act as commercial, competitive enterprises, while subjected to ever-increasing scrutiny of their professional management standards.    Some approaches being taken by the interviewees to reconcile their management dilemmas are noted.   The conclusion of the dissertation provides additional comment with respect to the key dilemma, that of changing university fund sources concurrent with an increase in public scrutiny and demands for business rigour; the steps that will be required to bring this dilemma closer to reconciliation, and the role university leaders will play in that reconciliation.   The results of this study indicate that, whilst the process of reconciliation of this dilemma is progressing, that progress appears to be in reaction to and as a result of the demanding higher education environment, with the necessary leadership skills being developed in response to the pressures being experienced.  In future, a more planned, systematic approach to the inclusion of appropriate skills in university leaders could see a stronger development of the management professionalism which is increasingly necessary in contemporary universities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">University</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="subject">business</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080215.160728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching Yoga in Addiction Recovery A Social Work Perspective</field><field name="creator">Griffiths, Mark</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the personal and social challenges of teaching yoga in addiction recovery from a social work perspective. It is informed by an action research perspective using interviews and focus groups with yoga teachers and allied health professionals and the personal experiences of the researcher teaching yoga in an addiction recovery centre as well as a  literature search on existing yoga and meditation programs used in addiction recovery and corrections.    The research explores whether yoga could be applied as a complementary therapy in social work and how yoga assists in addiction recovery. Further it explores what programmatic requirements are needed for a constructive yoga program that addresses the needs of yoga teachers in this field and the participants who are very marginalised.  The emerging themes and issues from the data and literature were explored and triangulation was used to draw one conclusion that was found consistently across all research methodologies. This was the importance of Kriya yoga. or the yoga of action, to achieve results with yoga as a complementary therapy.    Kriya yoga has three elements: a commitment to regular practice, allowing time to reflect on how this practice is affecting your life and having faith in the yoga process.       Undelying this notion of kriya yoga is the importance of the yoga teacher-student relationship and the value of a yoga community that supports the student in their commitment to practice. Recovery from addiction is viewed as a journey involving many stages in which the yoga student deals with relapses. The exemplary yoga programs are forms of karma yoga or the yoga of selfless action. The development of a karma yoga network that forms an on-line bridge between the yoga communities and addiction recovery services is suggested by the research as one way forward in promoting yoga as a complementary therapy in addiction recovery.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yoga</field><field name="subject">Addiction Recovery</field><field name="subject">Spirituality in social work practice</field><field name="subject">meditation</field><field name="subject">Corrections</field><field name="subject">Transpersonal social work.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080215.161527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning to Dance</field><field name="creator">Howard, Suzanne</field><field name="description">This research will examine the various techniques of writing stage directions for choreography or dance action within a feature film script. I will discuss and analyse two methodologies for annotating choreography, both developed by experts in dance notation.   I will also examine and interpret the observations made by film director, dancer and choreographer Bob Fosse about the purpose and objectives of dance action in feature film scripts.      I will examine two case studies of contemporary feature film scripts that contain dance action.  The selected scripts are Strictly Ballroom (Australia, 1992) and Flashdance (USA, 1983). These scripts do not use a published system of dance notation to write dance action. I will analyse and investigate the stage directions for choreography and dance action used within both scripts.       The exploration of these various approaches to film choreography may form the basis for writing stage directions for choreography or dance action in my own feature length screenplay titled Learning to Dance.      As a screenwriter with particular interest in dance I intend to employ dance sequences at different stages throughout my script as a story telling mechanism. It is important to me to be able to clearly communicate and translate choreographic direction into my script in a manner that ensures its eventual interpretation fulfils its original purpose in the story. Therefore I am seeking a methodology for translating and expressing dance sequences in an accurate and concise written form. One key outcome of my research may be the development of a structural and technical framework for providing choreographic direction appropriate to the conventions of screenplay writing.       I therefore intend to contribute to the screenwriting field by attempting to develop a framework for providing stage directions for choreography within a film script and then applying this framework within my own screenplay, Learning to Dance.        In addition to the study of choreographic notation I will explore the observations made by film theorists such as Adrian Martin, Jerome Delamater, Rick Altman, J.P Telotte and Steve Neal about genres that contain dance action as a defining characteristic.  It is my intention to write a screenplay that in part, borrows from the customs and codes of an established genre or subgenre.   Therefore my objective is to understand, appreciate and reflect upon the genre the best fits my vision of Learning to Dance.         Learning to Dance is the story of Giselle Williams (18) who aspires to be a professional dancer.  When Giselle's father is arrested for fraud Giselle is forced to abandon her wealthy surrounds to live and work in one of Melbourne's tough, inner city, high-rise public housing estates.  Here Giselle meets her key support roles, Muslim siblings Yasmina (21) a talented belly dancer and her handsome brother and Giselle's future love interest Ali (20) who welcome Giselle into their humble, tight knit and family oriented community.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dance action</field><field name="subject">dance movies</field><field name="subject">dance notation</field><field name="subject">screenwriting</field><field name="subject">Learning to Dance</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080215.163153</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Racist disinformation on the Web: the role of anti-racist sites in providing balance</field><field name="creator">Skinner, Sally Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the problem of racist disinformation on the World Wide Web and the role played by anti-racist sites in providing balance. The disinformation capacity of the Web is an important issue for those who provide access to the Web, for content providers, and for Web users. An understanding of the issues involved, including the characteristics of racist disinformation, is vital if these groups are to make informed decisions about how to deal with such Web content. However, in Australia especially, there has been limited research into racism in general and racism on the Web in particular.   To address this deficiency, the integration of perspectives from the fields of race relations and information science is facilitated utilising a critical realist methodology to provide new insights. Through an extensive examination of the literature, including Australian media reports, terms are delineated and the problem situated within an historical, cultural and political environment. Alternatives for tackling racist disinformation are evaluated and the issues involved in the provision and utilisation of balancing information are discussed.   The literature analysis underpins an assessment of anti-racist sites using three data collection methods to gain multiple perspectives on the balancing qualities of these sites. These methods are an assessment of anti-racist website longevity, an assessment of website reliability, and a questionnaire of content providers of anti-racist websites.   This thesis provides a synthesis of the academic literature and media coverage related to Australian racism and racist disinformation on the Web, leading to new insights about the range and depth of issues concerned. An analysis of the data collected concludes that while anti-racist websites take on diverse roles in tackling racism, few provide content directly to balance Web racist disinformation. Approaches that seek to control or censure the Web are ineffective and problematic, but balancing disinformation is not in itself an adequate solution.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Websites</field><field name="subject">Racism</field><field name="subject">Disinformation</field><field name="subject">Balance</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080215.165317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the identification of objective parameters correlating with the subjective functional performance of critical listening rooms</field><field name="creator">Watson, John Lawrence</field><field name="description">The link to subjective parameters and objective parameters in the field of room acoustics has been the source of much research.

Theories propounded by such figures as Alexander von Humboldt and George Perkins Marsh profoundly influenced land management around the world during this period, and by relating specific parkland developments to professional and popular ideas about the environment the study aims to place the parkland in an international context. Previous research has given little thought to the effect of environmental thought on Melbourne's parks, except for Ferdinand von Mueller's development of the Melbourne Botanic Garden where the influence is evident. Such influence has not been considered in Clement Hodgkinson's contemporaneous development of the city's other parks and gardens even though, like Mueller, Hodgkinson was  closely involved with environmental issues of the day. The Field Naturalists Club of Victoria, of which Mueller was a member, has long been credited with influencing Wattle Park's development early in the 20th century, although there is little critical analysis of the extent to which it was able to bring popular concerns about the environment to bear on park design. The relationship between Mueller's environmental views and actions and his development of the Botanic Garden is discussed first. Connections are then made between Hodgkinson's early experiences as a surveyor, his later work as Victoria's foremost land manager, his association with Mueller, and his design of Melbourne's first parks and gardens. Finally, the FNCV's involvement in park development is examined while exploring the changing nature of environmental thought. Clearly, environmental thought did influence the development of some parkland, but only those reserves administered by Mueller and Hodgkinson and only while the two men remained in  control. The success of the FNCV in influencing the future direction of any Melbourne park or garden is not so easily discernible, with little evidence that the Club played an important role in Wattle Park's development.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">parks</field><field name="subject">parkland</field><field name="subject">Melbourne</field><field name="subject">Field Naturalists Club</field><field name="subject">Wattle Park</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080218.093050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attitudes, perceptions, and experiences of casual relief teachers and permanent teachers in Victorian schools</field><field name="creator">Cleeland, Lara</field><field name="description">Four hundred and eight casual relief teachers (CRTs) and 670 permanent teachers from government, independent, and Catholic primary schools and secondary schools in and around metropolitan Melbourne were surveyed using the researcher-developed Issues in Teaching Questionnaire (ITQ) in order to assess their attitudes, perceptions, and experiences in relation to 10 areas of concern including: job security, provisions and facilities, information and communication, lesson management, status, relationships with the school community, relationships with students, student management, job satisfaction, and job stress. These 10 areas of concern were derived from the literature regarding casual relief teaching, which comprised of various anecdotal, published, and unpublished sources. Classical test theory methods (e.g., Cronbach&#161;&#166;s &#131;&#209; and exploratory factor analysis) were used to determine the psychometric properties of the survey instrument, which indicated that the ITQ pos sessed excellent internal reliability and construct validity, and confirmed the existence of an &#161;&#167;in-class&#161;&#168; factor and an &#161;&#167;out-of-class&#161;&#168; factor. Using descriptive and multivariate inferential statistics, the responses of the CRTs and the permanent teachers were analysed. By comparison with the other group characteristics, employment status (i.e., CRT or permanent teacher) was the best predictor of scores on the ITQ. The CRTs reported significantly more positive attitudes, perceptions, and experiences regarding job stress (i.e., less job stress) compared with the permanent teachers, whereas the permanent teachers reported significantly more positive attitudes, perceptions, and experiences across all other areas of concern compared with the CRTs. When the responses of the CRTs and the permanent teachers were compared on a scale of magnitude (i.e., effect size), much larger effects were observed for the &#161;&#167;out-of-class&#161;&#168; concerns (e.g., Information and Communication, Provisions and Facilities, Lesson Manageme nt, Relationships with the School Community, Status, Job Security, and Job Satisfaction subscales) compared with the &#161;&#167;in-class&#161;&#168; concerns (e.g., Relationships with Students, Student Management, and Job Stress subscales). Although many parallels were found between the CRTs and the permanent teachers in terms of their general classroom concerns, substantial differences existed between the two groups in relation to their concerns in the wider school context. Of particular importance were the considerable differences between the CRTs and the permanent teachers in terms of their employment conditions, and how they are currently being accommodated in schools and integrated into school communities. In these regards, CRTs are not receiving professional parity with their permanent counterparts. Overall, the results of this study (a) provide evidence of a psychometrically sound instrument for assessing the attitudes, perceptions, and experiences of CRTs and permanent teachers across a range of school settings, (b) hi ghlight the importance of employment status (i.e., CRT or permanent teacher) as a predictor of the ITQ subscales compared with the other group characteristics, and (c) present comprehensive and convincing evidence on the similarities and differences between the teaching experiences of CRTs and permanent teachers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Casual relief teaching</field><field name="subject">casual relief teachers</field><field name="subject">permanent teaching</field><field name="subject">permanent teachers</field><field name="subject">teaching experiences</field><field name="subject">work-related concerns</field><field name="subject">similarities</field><field name="subject">differences</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">perceptions</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080220.151230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maintaining Environmental Values in a Commercial Environment -   a Framework for Commercial Development in Victoria's National Parks</field><field name="creator">Cochrane, David Alan</field><field name="description">This research has focussed on the development of a commercial business model (CBM) for providing tourism and support service based commercial activities in Victoria's national parks which also allowed for the protection of the parks natural values.        National parks are vital if we as a nation are to retain our natural heritage - but the public sector land stewards of these important assets are facing increasing funding and user pressures.  The result is a growing focus on the commercialisation of our national parks to provide services and generate the revenue required to maintain these assets.  However, this has resulted in the exacerbation of a long existing conflict - these commercial operators are primarily focus on the achievement of a commercial return, while the land stewards' main responsibility is in the protection of the natural values of these assets.       In completing this project an abductive research approach (using grounded theory) has been adopted.  Specifically, the research activities undertaken included data collection via a number of techniques including stakeholder interviews, detailed examination of existing commercial arrangements, literature research on international approaches and models, development of a suggested commercial business model based on a synthesise of the research outcomes and, finally, obtaining user feedback.  The use of the various data sources, and subsequent sourcing of user feedback facilitated the triangulation of the research results.        The findings from this research challenge a number of the practices currently adopted in the structuring of commercial activities suggesting that these practices are inhibiting the quality of the service being provided to the national park visitor along with the level of protection being afforded to the parks natural values.  The resulting CBM provides park managers with a framework for identification and structuring of commercial business activities, practical guidance on the actions required in the completion of a concession process and identification of a number of the relevant issues which need to be considered and addressed in establishing and managing a national park concession.        The CBM has been developed specifically for application within Victoria's national parks (based on a public/private sector relationship).  The output will also provide guidance on methods for embedding natural values on public/private sector relationships in other settings.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">National parks</field><field name="subject">commercial business model</field><field name="subject">natural values</field><field name="subject">concessions</field><field name="subject">licences</field><field name="subject">concession process</field><field name="subject">commercial activities</field><field name="subject">environmental values</field><field name="subject">park managers</field><field name="subject">land stewardship</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080220.163331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Life Prediction Models for Rolling Contact Wear in Ceramic and Steel Ball Bearings.</field><field name="creator">Huq, Fazul</field><field name="description">The potential for significant performance increases, using ceramic materials in un-lubricated rolling element bearing applications,   has been the subject of research over the past two decades.  Practical advantages over steel include increased ability to withstand high loads, severe environments and high speeds. However, widespread acceptance has been limited by the inability to predict wear life for ceramic bearing applications.       In this thesis, the rolling contact wear of 52100 bearing steel and Over-aged Magnesia-Partially-Stabilised Zirconia (OA-Mg-PSZ) ceramic are examined using a newly developed rolling contact wear test rig. The new wear test rig simulates the system geometry of an un-lubricated hybrid (ceramic and steel) ball bearing. The new wear test rig is versatile in that it allows low cost samples to be utilised resulting in a larger number of samples that can be tested.       Wear samples of 52100 bearing steel and OA-Mg-PSZ produced by the new wear test rig were examined for mass loss and wear depth. The wear behavior of both the steel and ceramic material showed a dependence on operating variables time and load. Load was varied between 300N to 790N. Typical mass loss after 1 hour of testing 52100 bearing steel at 790N was 0.03 grams as compared to OA-Mg-PSZ which was 0.001 grams.  The rolling contact wear of the OA-Mg-PSZ was an order of magnitude lower than that of the 52100 bearing steel.      The wear mechanism for 52100 bearing steel was typical of plastic deformation and shearing near and below the surface of rolling contact. Once cracks extend to reach the surface, thin flat like sheets are produced. In OA-Mg-PSZ the wear mechanism initially is that of plastic deformation on the scale of the surface asperities with asperity polishing occurring followed by lateral cracks and fatigue spallation.       Results obtained using the new rolling contact wear test rig led to the establishment of a new equation for wear modeling of 52100 bearing steel and OA-Mg-PSZ ceramic materials.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wear</field><field name="subject">Rolling Contact</field><field name="subject">Ceramic</field><field name="subject">52100 Steel</field><field name="subject">Ball Bearings</field><field name="subject">Wear Test Rig</field><field name="subject">Life Prediction Model.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080215.145624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic Programming for Cephalometric Landmark Detection</field><field name="creator">Innes, Andrew</field><field name="description">The domain of medical imaging analysis has burgeoned in recent years due to the availability and affordability of digital radiographic imaging equipment and associated algorithms and, as such, there has been significant activity in the automation of the medical diagnostic process. One such process, cephalometric analysis, is manually intensive and it can take an experienced orthodontist thirty minutes to analyse one radiology image. This thesis describes an approach, based on genetic programming, neural networks and machine learning, to automate this process.  A cephalometric analysis involves locating a number of points in an X-ray and determining the linear and angular relationships between them. If the points can be located accurately enough, the rest of the analysis is straightforward.       The investigative steps undertaken were as follows:  Firstly, a previously published method, which was claimed to be domain independent, was implemented and tested on a selection of landmarks, ranging from easy to very difficult. These included the menton, upper lip, incisal upper incisor, nose tip and sella landmarks. The method used pixel values, and pixel statistics (mean and standard deviation) of pre-determined regions as inputs to a genetic programming detector.   This approach proved unsatisfactory and the second part of the investigation focused on alternative handcrafted features sets and fitness measures.  This proved to be much more successful and the third part of the investigation involved using pulse coupled neural networks to replace the handcrafted features with learned ones.  The fourth and final stage involved an analysis of the evolved programs to determine whether reasonable algorithms had been evolved and not just random artefacts learnt from the training images.      A significant finding from the investigative steps was that the new domain independent approach, using pulse coupled neural networks and genetic programming to evolve programs, was as good as or even better than one using the handcrafted features.  The advantage of this finding is that little domain knowledge is required, thus obviating the requirement to manually generate handcrafted features. The investigation revealed that some of the easy landmarks could be found with 100\% accuracy while the accuracy of finding the most difficult ones was around 78\%.       An extensive analysis of evolved programs revealed underlying regularities that were captured during the evolutionary process.  Even though the evolutionary process took different routes and a diverse range of programs was evolved, many of the programs with an acceptable detection rate implemented algorithms with similar characteristics.      The major outcome of this work is that the method described in this thesis could be used as the basis of an automated system.  The orthodontist would be required to manually correct a few errors before completing the analysis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetic Programming</field><field name="subject">Pulse-Coupled Neural Networks</field><field name="subject">Cephalometric Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080221.123310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Model Driven Component Agent Framework for Domain Experts</field><field name="creator">Jayatilleke, Gaya Buddhinath</field><field name="description">Industrial software systems are becoming more complex with a large number of interacting parts distributed over networks. Due to the inherent complexity in the problem domains, most such systems are modified over time to incorporate emerging requirements, making incremental development a suitable approach for building complex systems. In domain specific systems it is the domain experts as end users who identify improvements that better suit their needs. Examples include meteorologists who use weather modeling software, engineers who use control systems and business analysts in business process modeling. Most domain experts are not fluent in systems programming and changes are realised through software engineers. This process hinders the evolution of the system, making it time consuming and costly. We hypothesise that if domain experts are empowered to make some of the system changes, it would greatly ease the evolutionary process, thereby making the systems more  effective. Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) is seen as a natural fit for modeling and implementing distributed complex systems. With concepts such as goals and plans, agent systems support easy extension of functionality that facilitates incremental development. Further agents provide an intuitive metaphor that works at a higher level of abstraction compared to the object oriented model. However agent programming is not at a level accessible to domain experts to capitalise on its intuitiveness and appropriateness in building complex systems. We propose a model driven development approach for domain experts that uses visual modeling and automated code generation to simplify the development and evolution of agent systems. Our approach is called the Component Agent Framework for domain-Experts (CAFnE), which builds upon the concepts from Model Driven Development and the Prometheus agent software engineering methodology. CAFnE enables domain experts to work with a graphical representation of the system , which is easier to understand and work with than textual code. The model of the system, updated by domain experts, is then transformed to executable code using a transformation function. CAFnE is supported by a proof-of-concept toolkit that implements the visual modeling, model driven development and code generation. We used the CAFnE toolkit in a user study where five domain experts (weather forecasters) with no prior experience in agent programming were asked to make changes to an existing weather alerting system. Participants were able to rapidly become familiar with CAFnE concepts, comprehend the system's design, make design changes and implement them using the CAFnE toolkit.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Software Agents</field><field name="subject">Agent Oriented Software Engineering</field><field name="subject">Model Driven Development</field><field name="subject">Meta Models.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080222.162529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Valuation Models for Australian Biotechnology Companies</field><field name="creator">Jens, Paul Justin</field><field name="description">Biotechnology generated solutions have been hailed as potential cures to many of the problems facing the world today. New therapeutics will eradicate disease, new agricultural products will solve food shortages, and industrial application will improve productivity with reduced environmental impact.       Despite the much anticipated benefits of biotechnology, the industry faces significant challenges that must be overcome in the coming decades. Biotechnology is an inherently complex field with a high degree of uncertainty and associated risks. In addition to the risk associated with project development and delivery, businesses looking to extract an economic return from the provision of biotechnology products and services face significant financial risk. This is exacerbated by the long lead times in biotechnology product development and the expensive nature of research and development.      This thesis looks investigates the multi faceted problem of biotechnology valuation in Australia using a multi method approach designed to provide greater insight into the valuation challenges facing the industry and identify key value drivers. The approach incorporates a broad qualitative investigation, complimented by more focused quantitative studies into specific valuation issues surrounding IPO and project valuation.      Australian biotechnology firms face a significant challenge to raise sufficient capital in order to remain internationally competitive. The current industry structure and funding mechanisms encourage creation of small firms with narrow pipelines, exacerbating the risk of company failure and acting as an impediment to sustainability and, therefore, investment in the sector. Despite the challenges facing the Australian biotechnology industry, the nation possesses a competitive advantage in the strength of local science which, if fully leveraged, should see the development of an internationally competitive industry. Through improved funding mechanisms which encourage the creation of sustainable business models, increased investor participation in the industry should see a greater portion of the value generated through biotechnology retained by local participants.       An IPO is likely the largest single capital raising in a company's history. A quantitative investigation into the factors influencing the amount of underpricing and money left on the table for Australian biotechnology IPOs found that the amount of money left on the table was more critical than the level of underpricing. Additionally the impact of market sentiment on biotechnology IPOs was investigated with increased media coverage found to be positively related to the amount of money left on the table.       Using project valuation models, the drivers of value over the life of a typical biotechnology project were identified. Key drivers of biotechnology value are commercial viability, coupled with development cost and time. The ability of management to control these elements is crucial.       Analysis of project valuations using a traditional DCF model found value estimates exhibited a greater level of uncertainty than those calculated using more contemporary methods of decision tree and real option analysis. Additionally, incorporation of management flexibility into valuation assessment using real options techniques increased the perceived value of biotechnology projects. The value of management flexibility was found to be most relevant for early stage projects where the option to abandon was found to greatly influence values.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Valuation</field><field name="subject">IPO</field><field name="subject">Underpricing</field><field name="subject">Discounted Cash Flow</field><field name="subject">Real Option</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080226.120515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Embedded Intelligence In Structural Health Monitoring Using Artificial Neural Networks</field><field name="creator">Kesavan, Ajay</field><field name="description">The use of composite structures in engineering applications has proliferated over the past few decades due to its distinct advantages namely: high structural performance, corrosion resistance, and high strength/weight ratio. However, they also come with a set of disadvantages, i.e. they are prone to fibre breakage, matrix cracking and delaminations. These types of damage are often invisible and if undetected, could lead to catastrophic failures of structures. Although there are systems to detect such damage, the criticality assessment and prognosis of the damage is often much more difficult to achieve.  The research study conducted here resulted in the development of a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system for a 2D polymeric composite T-joint, used in maritime structures. The SHM system was found to be capable of not only detecting the presence of multiple delaminations in a composite structure, but also capable of determining the location and extent of all t he delaminations present in the T-joint structure, regardless of the load (angle and magnitude) acting on the structure. The system developed relies on the examination of the strain distribution of the structure under operational loading.       This SHM system necessitated the development of a novel pre-processing algorithm - Damage Relativity Assessment Technique (DRAT) along with a pattern recognition tool, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to predict and estimate the damage. Another program developed - the Global Neural network Algorithm for Sequential Processing of Internal sub Networks (GNAISPIN) uses multiple ANNs to render the SHM system independent to variations in structural loading and capable of estimating multiple delaminations in composite T-joint structures. Upto 82% improvement in detection accuracy was observed when GNAISPIN was invoked. The Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was also conducted by placing delaminations of different sizes at various locations in two structures, a composite beam and a T-joint. Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer T-joints were then manufactured and tested, thereby verifying the accuracy of the FEA results experimentally. The resulting strain distribution from the FEA was pre-processed by the DRAT and used to trai n the ANN to predict and estimate damage in the structures.        Finally, on testing the SHM system developed with strain signatures of composite T-joint structures, subjected to variable loading, embedded with all possible damage configurations (including multiple damage scenarios), an overall damage (location &amp; extent) prediction accuracy of 94.1% was achieved. These results are presented and discussed in detail in this study.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Structural Health Monitoring</field><field name="subject">Artificial Neural Networks</field><field name="subject">Delamination</field><field name="subject">Composites</field><field name="subject">Damage Detection</field><field name="subject">DRAT</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080226.122746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of phytoplankton dynamics using time-series analysis of biophysical parameters in Gippsland Lakes, South-eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Khanna, Neha</field><field name="description">There is a need for ecological modelling to help understand the dynamics in ecological systems, and thus aid management decisions to maintain or improve the quality of the ecological systems. This research focuses on non linear statistical modelling of observations from an estuarine system, Gippsland Lakes, on the south-eastern coast of Australia. Feed forward neural networks are used to model chlorophyll time series from a fixed monitoring station at Point King.      The research proposes a systematic approach to modelling in ecology using feed forward neural networks, to ensure: (a) that results are reliable, (b) to improve the understanding of dynamics in the ecological system, and (c) to obtain a prediction, if possible. An objective filtering algorithm to enable modelling is presented. Sensitivity analysis techniques are compared to select the most appropriate technique for ecological models.      The research generated a chronological profile of relationships between biophysical parameters and chlorophyll level for different seasons. A sensitivity analysis of the models was used to understand how the significance of the biophysical parameters changes as the time difference between the input and predicted value changes.       The results show that filtering improves modelling without introducing any noticeable bias. Partial derivative method is found to be the most appropriate technique for sensitivity analysis of ecological feed forward neural networks models. Feed forward neural networks show potential for prediction when modelled on an appropriate time series. Feed forward neural networks also show capability to increase understanding of the ecological environment. In this research, it can be seen that vertical gradient and temperature are important for chlorophyll levels at Point King at time scales from a few hours to a few days. The importance of chlorophyll level at any time to chlorophyll levels in the future reduces as the time difference between them increases.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecological Modelling</field><field name="subject">Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN)</field><field name="subject">Sensitivity Analysis</field><field name="subject">Chlorophyll</field><field name="subject">Phytoplankton</field><field name="subject">Gippsland Lakes</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080226.123435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a Proxy Response Instrument to Measure the Physical Activity Behaviours of Adults with an Intellectual Disability.</field><field name="creator">Lante, Kerrie</field><field name="description">It is well understood that substantial health inequality exists for adults with an intellectual disability (AWID).  In comparison to the general population AWID experience higher rates of morbidity and mortality associated with sedentary lifestyles, yet little is known about the role physical activity plays in preventing or mediating this outcome for this segment of society.  Without appropriate instrumentation, it is not possible to address the inadequacies that currently exist in the area of physical activity and AWID.      The primary aim of the series of studies in this thesis was to develop a psychometrically sound proxy-respondent measurement tool that could be used by researchers, epidemiologists and public health personnel to gather information on the physical activity behaviours of AWID.  The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) is an internationally published tool with good psychometric properties when used as a self-report tool with adults without a disability (AWOID), but no evidence exists as to the validity or reliability of this tool when used by proxy respondents to report on the physical activity behaviour of AWID.  Given little is known about the energy expenditure characteristics of AWID, nor the accuracy of tools developed for AWOID when applied to AWID, two secondary aims of this thesis were to measure the energy expended by AWID and AWOID during seven common activities of daily living (ADL) and to assess the accuracy of an objective physical activity measurement tool (Caltrac&#174; accelerometer)  for use with AWID.   Evidence gathered through the studies in this thesis found that as the energy demand of ADL increased there was an increase in the difference between energy expended by AWID and AWOID.  Results indicated that AWID achieved moderate-intensity physical activity when walking at a pace of 3.0 km/hr or more.  The proxy-respondent telephone questionnaire (IPAQ-ID) described in this thesis allows for universal assessment of the physical activity behaviours of AWID.  The IPAQ-ID was found to have measurement properties equivalent to measurement tools used among AWOID.  The IPAQ-ID was found to be suitable for use as a surveillance tool by researchers to collect comparable data on health-enhancing physical activity behaviours of AWID.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intellectual disability</field><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">IPAQ</field><field name="subject">Energy expenditure</field><field name="subject">Proxy respondent</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080227.123100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Confucian humanism as the foundation of human rights and economic ethics: a study of Korea, Japan and the Republic of China.</field><field name="creator">Lee, Calvin C</field><field name="description">This study is about Confucian humanism as the foundation of human rights and economic ethics. The study covers Korea, Japan and the Republic of China.  The main research question lies in how Confucian humanism emerged as an enduring tradition, and how it impacts upon human rights and economic ethics of the three nations on their individual paths towards globalizing civil societies.        Research elements are (i) literature review, (ii) focus group discussions and (iii) documentation corroborations.   Literature reviews covered scholarly works of East Asia and international scholars. Narrative data were obtained from the focus group discussions. Documentation corroboration complemented the focus group discussions.       The study explores the origin of Confucianism and proceeds to examine how the Confucian philosophical tradition gave naissance to Confucian humanism. From Confucian humanism, the thesis proceeds to Confucian governance (ching shih).  Alternative political views of more egalitarian Confucian schools such as of Mencius also take up a good part of the governance theme. The role of life long self-cultivation is seen as the foundation of character-building for respective societal roles within Confucian ethics and social ethos. The modern democratic institution of human rights is argued as having emerged from the fertile demo-centric Confucian social psychology, but benefited directly from the Western institutional models.       Discussions on the tradition of Confucianism and that of Confucian humanism progress through the important turning points throughout history, i.e., the Classic age of Confucius, the Neo-Confucian reformation, the Practical Learning sub-era of the Neo-Confucian era, and, finally, the contemporary Neo-Confucian.       The discussions highlight that the Confucian tradition of 'humanity' that Confucius and his disciples formulated in the Classical age endured through the ages to modernity.  They also point to the notion that Confucians pursued their intellectual, moral and aesthetic ideals to the highest possible level through the system of learning, philosophizing, and practicing in the tradition.        The Confucian cosmology of the 'human to nature' nexus and the Confucian spirituality of cosmic immanence in the 'self' provide clues to the multi-layer structure of Confucian consciousness of self, selves and the greater self, namely society or the Heaven itself.  The Neo-Confucian school of 'mind and heart' learning reinforced the inquiry into selves in nexus to nature and the universe.       Religious tolerance and the adaptability of Confucianism have stood out as important qualities in the globalization of East-Asian values and ethos, i.e., Confucian 'souls and decorum.'  Japan, as an island nation with a unique perception of its self-identity, employs Confucianism, still considered fundamentally as the philosophy of China, to reinforce the national identity without compromising the integrity of the Japanese tradition and sensitivity. Japanese aesthetic sensitivity would place aesthetic unity with nature on equal footing with that of moral unity with the world.  Secularism and spirituality of Confucianism benefited from the peaceful co-existence amongst the three great philosophical traditions of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism.       The thesis as an inquiry into Confucian humanism as a living tradition concludes by answering the main research question and its three associated postulates.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Confucian humanism</field><field name="subject">Confucian governance (ching shih).  human rights</field><field name="subject">economic ethics</field><field name="subject">globalizing civil societies</field><field name="subject">humanity</field><field name="subject">secularism</field><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="subject">inter-religious tolerance</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080228.121903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Molecular Investigation of Campylobacter jejuni Pathogenesis</field><field name="creator">Lodge, Karen</field><field name="description">Campylobacter jejuni is one of the leading bacterial causes of human gastroenteritis   world wide and has been linked to several severe complications including   autoimmune syndromes which can result in paralysis. Despite being the subject of   much study, C. jejuni remains a major public health burden in both developing and   developed nations. There is currently no vaccine available for protection against   this pathogen and the mechanisms important for C. jejuni pathogenesis are not fully   defined. This study has employed a range of experimental approaches to   investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in C. jejuni pathogenesis.   Lipooligosaccharides (LOSs) are surface structures and known virulence factors of   C. jejuni which are involved in serum resistance, resistance to phagocytic killing,   endotoxicity and adhesion. Mutagenesis studies targeting the putative LOS   biosynthesis genes wlaRF, wlaTA, wlaTB, wlaTC and waaV were performed in order   to characterise the proteins encoded by each of these six genes and assess their   potential role in C. jejuni pathogenesis in vitro. The gene product of wlaTA was   found to be essential for C. jejuni survival and therefore a knock out mutant could not   be generated. Phenotypic characterisation of four knock-out mutants confirmed that   each gene contributed to the construction of the LOS molecule as all four mutants   produced a truncated LOS moiety and altered their immunoreactivity. Further   analysis determined that the production of complete LOSs was important for C. jejuni   to invade and adhere to both human and chicken cells in vitro. This study identified   a link between the inactivation of two LOS biosynthesis genes and the loss of   motility, another important virulence factor.   A major source of human C. jejuni infection is contact with contaminated poultry.   However, C. jejuni exists as a commensal in chickens. It is currently not known why   C. jejuni is pathogenic to humans and not to chickens and the differences between   these two hosts represent pathogenic and non-pathogenic environments   respectively. These environmental differences were exploited in this study. The   four conditions investigated were temperature, blood, bile and host cells in vitro.   Five different C. jejuni strains (NCTC11168, 81116, HB93-13, a recent human   enteritis isolate and a recent chicken isolate) were subjected to modelled</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Campylobacter jejuni</field><field name="subject">lipooligosaccharide</field><field name="subject">mutagenesis</field><field name="subject">environmental regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080229.151747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Properties of Composites Containing Spherical Inclusions Surrounded by an Inhomogeneous Interphase Region</field><field name="creator">Lombardo, Nick</field><field name="description">The properties of composite materials in which spherical inclusions are embedded in a matrix of some kind, have been studied for many decades and many analytical models have been developed which measure these properties. There has been a steady progression in the complexity of models over the years, providing greater insight into the nature of these materials and improving the accuracy in the measurement of their properties. Some of the properties with which this thesis is concerned are, the elastic, thermal and electrical properties of such composites.      The size of the spherical inclusion which acts as the reinforcing phase, has a major effect on the overall properties of composite materials. Once an inclusion is embedded into a matrix, a third region of different properties between the inclusion and matrix is known to develop which is called the interphase. It is well known in the composite community that the smaller the inclusion is, the larger the interphase region which develops around it. Therefore, with the introduction of nanoparticles as the preferred reinforcing phase for some composites, the interphase has a major effect on its properties.      It is the aim of this thesis to consider the role of the interphase on the properties of composites by modeling it as an inhomogeneous region. There is much scientific evidence to support the fact that the interphase has an inhomogeneous nature and many papers throughout the thesis are cited which highlight this. By modeling the inhomogeneous properties by arbitrary mathematical functions, results are obtained for the various properties in terms of these general functions. Some specific profiles for the inhomogeneous region are considered for each property in order to demonstrate and test the models against some established results.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Particle-reinforced composites</field><field name="subject">Interphase</field><field name="subject">Bulk Modulus</field><field name="subject">Shear Modulus</field><field name="subject">Thermal Expansion Coefficient</field><field name="subject">Micromechanics</field><field name="subject">Dielectric Constant</field><field name="subject">Inhomogeneous</field><field name="subject">Functionally Graded.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080408.143315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the roles of Australian communication practitioners in organizational value setting : agents of conscience, control, and/or compliance?</field><field name="creator">Dayrit-Sison, Marianne</field><field name="description">This study examined whether Australian public relations and communication practitioners enact an organizational conscience role through their involvement in the organizational value-setting process. Thirty communication practitioners from 26 large organizations in Melbourne and Sydney were interviewed between May 2004 and May 2005 to ascertain and discuss their involvement in organizational value setting. Using semi-structured in-depth interviews to gather data and then applying a multiple perspective approach in its thematic data analysis, the research found that most respondents were involved in organizational value setting albeit at different stages of the process. In analysing the nature of the respondent's involvement in the process along with individual and organizational factors, three roles emerged namely, the agent of critical conscience, the agent of concertive control, and the agent of corporate compliance. However the results suggest that most respond ents enacted primarily the concertive control and corporate compliance agency roles. The study also found that the predominant managerial/functionalist perspective constrains practitioners from enacting the conscience leadership role.      In exploring the practitioners' ability to influence organizational members, findings support recent studies that membership in the dominant coalition does not necessarily give public relations/communication practitioners power and influence. Rather, direct access to the CEO, expertise, performance and personality were found to be the key ingredients to the individual communication practitioners' organizational influence. Findings also reveal that public relations/communication practitioners preferred to participate but not drive the organizational value-setting process.      In using a multiple perspective approach to study public relations roles, this study provides empirical basis for identifying potential leadership roles for public relations/communication practitioners and for suggesting an extension of the manager-technician role typology. The study calls for public relations/communication practitioners to enact a critical conscience agent role as part of finding a meaningful, ethical and socially responsible practice. This study proposes that critical thought and dialectical inquiry be embedded within the public relations/communication practitioner's role and public relations education.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public relations roles</field><field name="subject">organizational values</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">conscience</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080208.143226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of Single Ion Tracks for use in Ion Beam Lithography</field><field name="creator">Alves, Andrew David Charles</field><field name="description">To investigate the ultimate resolution in ion beam lithography (IBL) the resist material poly(methyl methacrylate) PMMA has been modified by single ion impacts. The latent damage tracks have been etched prior to imaging and characterisation. The interest in IBL comes from a unique advantage over more traditional electron beam or optical lithography. An ion with energy of the order of 1 MeV per nucleon evenly deposits its energy over a long range in a straight latent damage path. This gives IBL the ability to create high aspect ratio structures with a resolution in the order of 10 nm. Precise ion counting into a spin coated PMMA film on top of an active substrate enabled control over the exact fluence delivered to the PMMA from homogenously irradiated areas down to separated single ion tracks. Using the homogenous areas it was possible to macroscopically measure the sensitivity of the PMMA as a function of the developing parameters. Separated single ion tracks wer e created in the PMMA using 8 MeV F, 71 MeV Cu and 88 MeV I ions. These ion tracks were etched to create voids in the PMMA film. For characterisation the tracks were imaged primarily with atomic force microscopy (AFM) and also with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The series of studies presented here show that the sensitivity of the resist-developer combination can be tailored to allow the etching of specific single ion tracks. With the ability to etch only the damage track, and not the bulk material, one may experimentally characterise the damage track of any chosen ion. This offers the scientific community a useful tool in the study and fabrication of etched ion tracks. Finally work has been conducted to allow the precise locating of an ion beam using a nanoscale mask and piezoelectrically driven scanning stage. This method of beam locating has been trailed in conjunction with single ion detection in an effort to test the practical limits of ion beam lithography in the single ion realm.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ion Beam Lithography</field><field name="subject">Ion Tracks</field><field name="subject">Atomic Force Microscopy</field><field name="subject">Nanoapertures</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080414.135656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alternative Approaches In The Preparation And Growth Of Influenza B Vaccine Viruses</field><field name="creator">Audsley, Jennifer M</field><field name="description">Influenza B viruses are a significant cause of disease and influenza B antigens are present in all human vaccines. Achieving suitable yields of seed viruses is often difficult for vaccine manufacturers. With influenza A viruses increases in yields have been achieved by the preparation of reassortants between a high-yielding donor strain and an epidemic strain. However, reassortment of influenza B viruses for the preparation of seeds has not been usually undertaken due to the lack suitable donor strains. Such an approach, which formed the basis of this thesis, could improve vaccine yields, lower costs and introduce a further element of predictability to vaccine manufacture.      Potential donor strains were prepared from B/Lee/40 (B/Lee) by two approaches involving the selection of stable cold- and high- temperature mutants. Initial passaging was undertaken in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cultures and later passage in SPF embryonated chicken eggs. Both approaches were successful, although a smaller number of viable progeny could be isolated from plaques obtained at 38&#132;aC. Potential donor strains, isolated by selection at either 25 or 38&#132;aC and plaque-purified in SPF CEK cultures, were tested for haemagglutinin and infectious titre, in comparison with the original parental strain by three methods, and for differences in antigenicity by cross-haemagglutination-inhibition tests. Potential donor strains selected at temperatures of 25&#132;aC (C25) and 38&#132;aC (H38) produced haemagglutination titres of 320 units/50&#131;&#221;L and infectivities of 8.57 and 8.39 50% egg infectious doses, respectively, when grown in eggs at the permissive temperature (34&#132;aC).      Reassorting experiments using the B/Lee-derived potential donor strains C25 and H38 and the epidemic strain, B/Johannesburg/5/99 (B/Johannesburg), showed that the preparation of reassortant progeny with both epidemic strain HA and NA was difficult. Only 1/24 of the resulting reassortants possessed both the HA and NA of the epidemic strain. None of the reassortant progeny produced in reassorting experiments using C25 and H38 and the epidemic strain B/Panama/45/90 (B/Panama) possessed the desired 6:2 gene constellation (i.e. genes for the two surface antigens of the epidemic strain and the remainder from the donor strain). The infectious titre of selected progeny from the reassortment experiments were determined by three methods and compared with their respective epidemic parents.    Yields of several influenza B epidemic strains and potential donor strains were measured after growth in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells prepared in serum-containing (SC) and animal- and human-derived protein-free (AHPF) media. Optimal multiplicities of infection were determined for B/Panama, B/Johannesburg and C25 in MDCK cultures grown in SC medium.

A flow visualisation study showed that the bumper bar significantly influenced the cooling airflow, leading to three-dimensional vortices in its wake and generating an area of relatively low velocity across at least one third of the radiator core.      Since repeatability and accuracy of on-road testing are prejudiced by weather conditions, wind-tunnel testing is often preferred to solve cooling airflow problems. However, there are constraints that limit the accuracy of reproducing on-road cooling performance from wind-tunnel simulations. These constraints included inability to simulate atmospheric conditions, limited tunnel test section sizes (blockage effects) and lack of ground effect simulations.        The work presented in this thesis involved use of on-road and wind-tunnel tests to investigate the effects of most common constraints present in wind tunnels on accuracy of the simulations of engine cooling performance and radiator airflow profiles. To aid this investigation, an experimental technique for quantifying radiator airflow velocity distribution and an analytical model for predicting the heat dissipation rate of a radiator were developed. A four-hole dynamic pressure probe (TFI Cobra probe) was also used to document flow fields in proximity to a section of radiator core in a wind tunnel in order to investigate the effect of airflow maldistribution on radiator heat-transfer performance. In order to cope with the inability to simulate ambient temperature, the technique of Specific Dissipation (SD) was used, which had previously been shown to overcome this problem.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wind tunnel testing</field><field name="subject">automotive engineering</field><field name="subject">engine cooling system</field><field name="subject">aerodynamics</field><field name="subject">radiators</field><field name="subject">underhood flow</field><field name="subject">radiator airflow distribution</field><field name="subject">Cobra pressure probe</field><field name="subject">Specific Dissipation technique</field><field name="subject">cross-flow heat exchangers</field><field name="subject">corrugated louvred fin surfaces</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080422.100014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Avatars and the Invisible Omniscience: The panoptical model within virtual worlds.</field><field name="creator">Dodds, Christopher</field><field name="description">This Exegesis and accompanying artworks are the culmination of research conducted into the existence of surveillance in virtual worlds.

The future of this field will be marked by a significant increase in mobile device usage as a tool for co-workers to cooperate, collaborate and work on a shared workspace in real-time to produce artefacts such as diagrams, text and graphics regardless of their geographical locations.      A real-time collaboration editor can utilise a centralised or a replicated architecture. In a centralised architecture, a central server holds the shared document as well as manages the various aspects of the collaboration, such as the document consistency, ordering of updates, resolving conflicts and the session membership. Every user's action needs to be propagated to the central server, and the server will apply it to the document to ensure it results in the intended document state. Alternatively, a decentralised or replicated architecture can be used where there is no central server to store the shared document. Every participating site contains a copy of the shared document (replica) to work on separately. Using this architecture, every user's action needs to be broadcast to all participating sites so each site can update their replicas accordingly.       The replicated architecture is attractive for such applications, especially in wireless and ad-hoc networks, since it does not rely on a central server and a user can continue to work on his or her own local document replica even during disconnection period. However, in the absence of a dedicated server, the collaboration is managed by individual devices. This presents challenges to implement collaborative editors in a replicated architecture, especially in a mobile network which is characterised by limited resource reliability and availability.        This thesis addresses challenges and requirements to implement group editors in wireless ad-hoc network environments where resources are scarce and the network is significantly less stable and less robust than wired fixed networks. The major contribution of this thesis is a proposed framework that comprises the proposed algorithms and techniques to allow each device to manage the important aspects of collaboration such as document consistency, conflict handling and resolution, session membership and document partitioning.  Firstly, the proposed document consistency algorithm ensures the document replicas held by each device are kept consistent despite the concurrent updates by the collaboration participants while taking into account the limited resource of mobile devices and mobile networks. Secondly, the proposed conflict management technique provides users with conflict status and information so that users can handle and resolve conflicts appropriately. Thirdly, the proposed membership management algorithm  ensures all participants receive all necessary updates and allows users to join a currently active collaboration session. Fourthly, the proposed document partitioning algorithm provides flexibility for users to work on selected parts of the document and reduces the resource consumption. Finally, a basic implementation of the framework is presented to show how it can support a real time collaboration scenario.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Collaborative Editor</field><field name="subject">Real-Time</field><field name="subject">Ad-hoc Collaboration</field><field name="subject">Ad-hoc network</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080424.113836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of heat shock protein 72 in preventing obesity-induced insulin resistance</field><field name="creator">Chung, Jason</field><field name="description">Patients with type 2 diabetes have reduced gene expression of Heat Shock Protein (HSP) 72 which correlates with reduced insulin sensitivity. Heat therapy, which activates HSP72, improves clinical parameters in these patients. Activation of several inflammatory signalling proteins such as c-jun amino terminal kinase (JNK) can induce insulin resistance but HSP72 can block the induction of these molecules in vitro. Whether up-regulation of HSP72 can protect against insulin resistance is not known. In experiments reported in this thesis we show that HSP72 protects against insulin resistance and blocks the activation of JNK in vivo. We first show that mice that underwent weekly heat shock therapy to increase intramuscular HSP72 protein expression were protected from high fat diet (HFD)-induced hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance, factors associated with reduced JNK phosphorylation. To determine whether the elevation in intramuscular HSP72 expressio n and protection from insulin resistance are causally linked, we studied muscle specific HSP72 overexpression mice (HSP72+/+). Compared with wild-type mice, HSP72+/+ mice were protected from hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance when placed on a HFD, factors associated with a complete inhibition of HFD-induced JNK phosphorylation in skeletal muscle. Finally, we show that HSP72+/+ mice display greater mitochondrial enzyme activity in the liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, corresponding to reduced plasma free fatty acid levels, white adipose tissue mass and alterations in circulating adipokines.  These data identify HSP72 as being pivotal in protecting against obesity-induced insulin resistance possibly by blocking JNK and/or by up-regulation of mitochondrial oxidative capacity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Inflammation</field><field name="subject">stress proteins</field><field name="subject">metabolic disorders</field><field name="subject">JNK</field><field name="subject">type 2 diabetes</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080424.114938</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental Management Accounting within Universities: Current State and Future Potential</field><field name="creator">Chang, Huei-Chun</field><field name="description">Environmental management accounting (EMA) is attracting increased recognition as a management tool that assists in improving financial and environmental performance through enhanced environmental accountability. Various industries have been included in EMA-related research and study, but universities have typically failed to be the focus of the attention. This research studied the experiences of key managers from five universities to explore potential factors influencing the decision to adopt, or not to adopt, EMA within the higher education sector. For the purpose of this study, EMA is defined as the generation, analysis, and use of monetary (or financial) and physical (or non-financial) environment-related information in order to improve organisational financial and environmental performance.   The two objectives of this study were to understand current accounting practices for managing major environmental costs, and to identify factors influencing EMA adoption within universities. For the purpose of this study, the major environmental costs referred to are limited to the costs pertaining to the consumption of electricity, water and paper, and the generation of wastes. A case study methodology was followed using semi-structured interviews of key personnel with four different management functions (i.e. environmental management, management accounting, senior management, and heads of academic schools) within each university, and performing content analysis on the transcribed interview data. Specifically for achieving the second research objective, a theoretical framework that considers four theories was embraced to guide the data collection and focus the study. The four theories are contingency theory, institutional theory, legitimacy theory, and stakeholder theory.   The findings of the first research objective revealed that there was a general lack of EMA utilisation within the case universities. This was in part due to a perceived lack of appreciation by key personnel of the extent of environmental costs being incurred, but arguably mainly because of the absence of relevant environmental cost information being brought to the attention of senior management. Although environmental sustainability was promoted as important from an environmental management perspective, efforts to improve internal environmental accountability, in particular from an accounting perspective, were still absent.   In relation to the second research objective, it was found that five key barriers contributed to this lack of EMA utilisation within the five case universities, and they were attitudinal, financial, informational, institutional, and management barriers. Among the factors that provide further explanations about how each barrier influences EMA adoption, resistance to change, resource constraints, (a lack of) legitimacy considerations, and a lack of environmental responsibility &amp; accountability were found to be strong factors, as they were supported in all of the five cases.   Apart from the theoretical extension to this area of research, the results and findings of this study supported the uses and applications of EMA by the higher education sector. Much more can, and should, be done by universities in relation to how they account for the environment. This can provide benefits not only for the sector itself, but also for the environment in which we live.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental management accounting (EMA)</field><field name="subject">universities</field><field name="subject">environmental costs</field><field name="subject">environmental accountability</field><field name="subject">institutional theory</field><field name="subject">contingency theory</field><field name="subject">legitimacy theory</field><field name="subject">stakeholder theory</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080424.122823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nanostructured Multilayer Coatings of Aluminium and Aluminium Oxide with Tungsten</field><field name="creator">Burgmann, Flame Astra</field><field name="description">The development of nanostructured coatings which exhibit enhanced mechanical properties is currently of interest due to the importance of high performance coatings in a large range of applications. Single layer coatings have predominantly been used for these demanding applications, however the promising mechanical properties observed in multilayer coatings has shifted the focus of current research. In particular, there has been reports of the use of alternating materials with opposing mechanical properties, as seen in the abalone shell, which have exhibited hardness and toughness values significantly greater than either of their constituent materials. The main objective of this thesis was to fabricate Al/W nanostructured multilayers and determine if they exhibit enhanced mechanical properties.      The Al/W nanostructured multilayers were fabricated using two different deposition techniques: pulsed magnetron sputtering and cathodic arc deposition. These two techniques differ in the energy of the depositing species and this results in significant differences in film properties. The indentation hardness of the coatings was measured using a Hysitron Nanoindenter. The relationship between the mechanical properties and microstructure was obtained using a range of characterisation techniques. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) were used to determine the chemical composition and stoichiometry, while cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (XTEM) and energy filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) were used to explore the microstructure.      The findings of this thesis showed very different results for the two deposition techniques. Although sputtering successfully produced well defined multilayers, no evidence of enhanced hardness was found for periods between 5 and 200 nm. On the other hand, arc deposited samples with intended periods between 1 and 200 nm showed a hardness enhancement above that of pure W, however the samples of highest hardness did not contain Al layers for much of their thickness. Arc deposited samples with the finest nominal periods (1 and 2 nm) contained W-Al intermetallics and were soft. The hardening mechanism was not attributed to a multilayer structure, rather to the introduction of defects in the W layers which acted as pinning sites for dislocations. A modified Hall-Petch equation for hardness enhancement fitted the data for W films prepared by pulsed cathodic arc in which the grain diameter was replaced by the nominal multilayer period. The difficulty producing Al layers on W surfaces in the cathodic arc was overcom e by changing the film growth mechanism by introducing Ar or O2 at the W/Al interface. In the latter case, Al2O3/W multilayers were formed but again showed no hardness enhancements. Complete microanalysis and characterisation of the multilayer structures is vital in determining the mechanisms which govern the hardness enhancements. The evidence in this thesis suggests that the defect density, and not the presence of interfaces are responsible for the hardness enhancement effect.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multilayers</field><field name="subject">PVD</field><field name="subject">Mechanical Properties</field><field name="subject">Microstructure</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080424.135857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mix Design and Impact Response of Fibre Reinforced and Plain Reactive Powder Concrete</field><field name="creator">Gao, Xiang</field><field name="description">Concrete is the most broadly used material in construction worldwide and Reactive Powder Concrete (RPC, a type of ultra high performance concrete) is a relatively new member of the concrete family. In this work the critical parameters of RPC mix design are investigated and the mix design is explored through a program of concrete casting and testing.      Owing to the enhanced microstructure of RPC, porosity and permeability can be significantly decreased in the concrete matrix. This benefits the durability characteristics of RPC elements resulting in a longer service life with less maintenance costs than conventional concrete. It has been used for high integrity radiation waste material containers because of its low permeability and durability. Fibre reinforced RPC is also ideal for use in long span and thin shell structural elements without traditional reinforcement because of its advantageous flexural strength. Moreover, due to improved impact resistance, RPC can be widely employed in piers of bridges, military construction and blast protection.      There is no standard approach to assessing the impact resistance of concrete. This investigation utilises relatively well accepted impact equipment to evaluate the mechanical properties of RPC under dynamic loading. The compressive and flexural tensile strengths of plain and fibre reinforced RPC are investigated using a variety of specimens and apparatus. The dynamic increase factor (DIF) is evaluated to indicate the strain rate sensitivity of the compressive and flexural strength.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reactive Powder Concrete</field><field name="subject">RPC</field><field name="subject">mix design</field><field name="subject">silica fume</field><field name="subject">impact</field><field name="subject">fibre reinforced</field><field name="subject">drop hammer rig</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080424.150722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing (tools (for designing (tools for ...))))</field><field name="creator">Fischer, Thomas</field><field name="description">Outcomes of innovative designing are frequently described as enabling us in achieving more desirable futures. How can we design and innovate so as to enable future processes of design and innovation? To investigate this question, this thesis probes the conditions, possibilities and limitations of toolmaking for novelty and knowledge generation, or in other words, it examines designing for designing.   The focus of this thesis is on the development of digital design tools that support the reconciliation of conflicting criteria centred on architectural geometry. Of particular interest are the roles of methodological approaches and of biological analogies as guides in toolmaking for design, as well as the possibility of generalising design tools beyond the contexts from which they originate. The presented investigation consists of an applied toolmaking study and a subsequent reflective analysis using second- order cybernetics as a theoretical framework.   Observations made during the toolmaking study suggest that biological analogies can, in informal ways, inspire designing, including the designing of design tools. Design tools seem to enable the generation of novelty and knowledge beyond the contexts in and for which they are developed only if their users apply them in ways unanticipated by the toolmaker. Abstract   The reflective analysis offers theoretical explanations for these observations based on aspects of second-order cybernetics. These aspects include the modelling of designing as a conversation, different relationships between observers (such as designers) and systems (such as designers engaged in their projects), the distinction between coded and uncoded knowledge, as well as processes underlying the production and the restriction of meaning.   Initially aimed at the development of generally applicable, prescriptive digital tools for designing, the presented work results in a personal descriptive model of novelty and knowledge generation in science and design.  This shift indicates a perspective change from a positivist to a relativist outlook on designing, which was accomplished over the course of the study.    Investigating theory and practice of designing and of science, this study establishes an epistemological model of designing that accommodates and extends a number of theoretical concepts others have previously proposed. According to this model, both design and science generate and encode new knowledge through conversational processes, in which open-minded perception appears to be of greater innovative power than efforts to exercise control. The presented work substantiates and exemplifies radical constructivist theory of knowledge and novelty production, establishes correspondences between systems theory and design research theory and implies that mainstream scientific theories and practices are insufficient to account for and to guide innovation.

In particular, the thesis analyses trade flow changes, foreign direct investment inflow changes, industrial total factor productivity changes and specific commodity trade flow changes in Australia and China. Four empirical studies are undertaken.       Firstly, the thesis introduces the gravity model to estimate the effect of regional trade agreements on trade flow changes, focusing on thirty-nine countries and areas from seven regional trade agreements during 1980-2004. The results show that there are trade creation and trade diversion effects for various memberships. The results further show that China experiences an export creation effect for its APEC membership while Australia has an import diversion effect for its CER membership. When trade between Australia and China is considered, Australia's CER membership impedes its trade with China. However, both Australia and China benefit from attending APEC jointly to enlarge their bilateral trade.      Secondly, a modified gravity model is undertaken to test the impact of regional trade agreements on foreign direct investment inflows to Australia and China. It uses the same regional trade agreements to that of the trade flow study for the period of 1980 to 2004 for Australia and 1985 to 2004 for China. The results show that CER members tend to strengthen their bilateral foreign direct investment cooperation after the implementation of CER trade and investment liberalization.      Thirdly, the impact of regional trade agreements is examined on industrial total factor productivity growth. The findings show that industries with comparative trading advantages in both Australia and China tend to improve their total factor productivity upon liberalizing trade both bilaterally and multilaterally. However, industries with comparative disadvantages need more protection against severe foreign competition. It uses data from 1974-75 to 2004-05 for the Australian market sector analysis, from 1968-69 to 1990-2000 for the Australian manufacturing industry analysis, and from 1987 to 2003 for the Chinese industry analysis.      Finally, the thesis investigates the impact of regional trade agreements on bilateral commodity trade between Australia and China from 1979 to 2004. A similar gravity model to that of the trade flow study is used, introducing an additional GDP per capita variable to capture the effect of increasing consumers' income on their consumption of particular goods and products type based on product and production characteristics. Both the one-digit and some detailed four-digit commodity classifications described in the Standard International Trade Classification are considered. The results show that participation in regional trade agreements is an important factor that affects Australia's major commodity trade with China.      The major contribution of this thesis is the investigation of issues on trade flows and foreign direct investment specifically in Australia and China, together with the studies of the effect of regional trade agreements on industrial total factor productivity improvement and specific commodity trade changes. Due to the increasing pursuit of bilateral and regional economic cooperation in Australia and China, the results of this thesis are of particular importance to both countries in their foreign trade and economic strategies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Regional trade agreements</field><field name="subject">trade flows</field><field name="subject">trade creation effect</field><field name="subject">trade diversion effect</field><field name="subject">foreign direct investment</field><field name="subject">industrial total factor productivity</field><field name="subject">commodity trade</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080428.094213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies Toward the Synthesis of Salvinorin A</field><field name="creator">Lingham, Anthony</field><field name="description">Salvinorin A [(2S,4aR,6aR,7R,9S,10aS,10bR)-9-(acetyloxy)-2-(3-furanyl)-dodecahydro-6a,10b-dimethyl-4,10-dioxo-2H-naptho[2,1-c]pyran-7-carboxylic acid methyl ester] is a trans-neoclerodane diterpene from the leaves of the hallucinogenic Mexican sage Salvia divinorum and has been identified as the principal psychoactive component in this plant of traditional spiritual importance. Salvinorin A is the most potent naturally occurring hallucinogen found so far and is reported to act selectively as a &#131;&#219;-opioid receptor agonist. Synthetic modification of the natural product has contributed to a number of proposed pharmacophores to identify the key structural features necessary for biological activity and a direct strategy for the asymmetric synthesis of the natural product is desirable since it allows access to a more diverse range of analogues.       An ambitious retrosynthetic study of salvinorin A indicated the C(3)-heterosubstituted furan as an appropriate starting material for a Diels-Alder approach towards the ketone ring of the natural product. An expedient and high yielding methodology for the preparation of 3-furylamines is described, allowing the flexible introduction of alkyl substituents in the C(5) position. Optically pure ephedrine isomers have been explored as chiral amine auxiliaries and have been successfully attached as 3-furylamine substituents using the general methodology described.       The 3-furylamines are electron rich dienes that are highly reactive towards Diels-Alder cycloaddition reactions with methyl acrylate. Diastereoisomers of the 7-oxanorbornane species methyl 1-methyl-5-oxo-7-oxa-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylate were prepared as new compounds from the hydrolysis of Diels-Alder cycloadducts and are functionalised bicyclic intermediates to access the ketone of the natural product. Diels-Alder reactions between the non-racemic (2S)-ephedrine-derived furans and methyl acrylate gave spiro-oxazolidine adducts that underwent hydrolysis to give the desired ketone. X-ray crystallography data for the derivatised cycloadduct established diastereoselectivity in favor of the (1S,4S)-enantiomer, as desired for the asymmetric natural product synthesis.       A procedure for the ether cleavage of methyl 1-methyl-5-oxo-7-oxa-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylate was required to access the convergent precursor methyl 5-acetoxy-2-methyl-4-oxocyclohex-2-enecarboxylate. Successful C-O cleavage was achieved using Lewis-acid catalysis with BBr3 followed by mixing with the hindered base 2,4,6-collidine to yield methyl 5-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-oxocyclohex-2-enecarboxylate albeit only at high dilution. Acetylation proceeded in excellent yield in the same reaction vessel to give methyl 1-methyl-5-oxo-7-oxa-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylate in excellent yield. The devised synthetic pathway is shown to successfully construct the ketone ring of salvinorin A and stereoselectivity for the (1S,4S)-enantiomer can be achieved using the ephedrine derived furans as desired for the asymmetric natural product synthesis.       The &#131;&#212;-lactone ring 6-(furan-3-yl)-5,6-dihydro-4-methyl-3-vinylpyran-2-one was derived from rudimentary precursors as a convergent reagent to introduce the lactone ring of salvinorin A. A short synthesis for the racemic compound is described starting from the aldol reaction between 3-furaldehyde and acetone to give the 3-furfurol, 4-(furan-3-yl)-4-hydroxybutan-2-one in quantitative yield. The 3-furfurol was reacted to form the &#131;&#209;-bromovinyl ester, 1-(furan-3-yl)-3-oxobutyl 2-bromobut-3-enoate using a deconjugation/esterification protocol with 2-bromobut-3-enoyl chloride. Intramolecular ring closure to the &#131;&#212;-lactone was achieved using a Reformatsky reaction and dehydration under acidic conditions yielded the racemic convergent precursor 6-(furan-3-yl)-5,6-dihydro-4-methyl-3-vinylpyran-2-one in high yield. A possible strategy for joining the ketone and lactone fragments for the total synthesis of salvinorin A is proposed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salvinorin A</field><field name="subject">3-Furylamines</field><field name="subject">Diels-Alder</field><field name="subject">Natural product synthesis.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080428.095126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tales of Ash: Phantom Bodies as Testimony in Artistic Representations of Terrorism</field><field name="creator">Lavi, Tali</field><field name="description">This paper delves into the realms of tragedy, memory and representation.  Drawing upon the phenomenon of the Phantom Limb and extending it towards a theory of Phantom Bodies, various artworks - literary, theatrical and visual - are examined. After the conflagration of the terrorist attack, how are these absences grieved over and remembered through artistic representation? The essay examines this question by positioning itself amongst the scarred landscapes of post-September 11 New York and suicide bombings in Israel (2000-2006).  Furthermore, it investigates whether humanity can be restored in the aftermath of an event in which certain individuals have sought to eradicate it.  The fragmentation of the affected body in these scenarios is understood as further complicating processes of grief and remembrance.   Artists who reject political polemic and engage with the dimensions of human loss are seen to have discovered means of referring to the absence caused by the act of terrorism.  Three such recurring representations present themselves: ash and remnants, presence/absence and memory building.  Phantom Bodies are perceived as simultaneously functioning as a reminder of the event itself, insisting upon the response of bearing witness, and as a symbol of the overwhelming power of humanity.  Challenges arise when individuals or sections of the affected society deem these artworks to be inappropriate or explicit.   Works considered include: Neil LaBute's play The Mercy Seat, Sigalit Landau's art installation The Country, Jonathan Safran Foer's Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close, Spike Lee's 25th Hour, Daniel Libeskind's architectural plans for the World Trade Center site, Eric Fischl's sculpture 'Tumbling Woman', Honor Molloy's autodelete://beginning dump of physical memory and A.B.Yehoshua's A Woman in Jerusalem.   The accompanying play, Tales of Ash: A diptych for the theatre, is set in Melbourne, New York and Tel Aviv and deals with life in the face of and after terror.  It veers between naturalism, poetic monologue and the epic.  Tales of Ash contains two plays.  The first centres on Mia, a young sculptor living in New York, who loses both her lover and her creativity on September 11.  Upon returning to her home in Melbourne, she finds familial bonds still entwined with guilt and family trauma.  The second play revolves around Ilana and Benny, two people living in Tel Aviv, who find themselves suddenly thrust together after a devastating bombing.  As they attempt to resume rhythms of life, in the face of all the inherent ferocity of a modern existence in Israel, the struggle between The Ash Woman and The Ash Takers escalates.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phantom Bodies</field><field name="subject">Terrorism</field><field name="subject">Testimony</field><field name="subject">Memory</field><field name="subject">September 11 2001</field><field name="subject">New York after September 11</field><field name="subject">Israel and Terrorism</field><field name="subject">Artistic Responses to Terrorism</field><field name="subject">Trauma</field><field name="subject">Theatre</field><field name="subject">Visual Art</field><field name="subject">Literature</field><field name="subject">Architecture</field><field name="subject">Elizabeth Grosz</field><field name="subject">Slavoj Zizek</field><field name="subject">Neil LaBute</field><field name="subject">Sigalit Landau</field><field name="subject">Jonathan Safran Foer</field><field name="subject">Spike Lee</field><field name="subject">Daniel Libeskind</field><field name="subject">Eric Fischl</field><field name="subject">Honor Molloy</field><field name="subject">Honour Kane</field><field name="subject">A.B.Yehoshua</field><field name="subject">Etgar Keret.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080428.114445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Can learning save the sandcastle? A case study of facilitating change at an Australian manufacturing facility.</field><field name="creator">Harvey, Christopher John</field><field name="description">The focus of this work-based action research project was attempts to change practice in an Australian manufacturing facility. The setting is a medium sized light manufacturing operation responding to the new commercial realities of the globalised and deregulated Australian marketplace. The analogy of a sandcastle facing the rising tide is used to assist the reader associate with the destructive threat that globalisation brings to Australian manufacturing.      In an attempt to maintain profitability amidst unprecedented competition, the organisation has published a manufacturing improvement strategy designed to raise productivity and assure its future viability.  Consistent with the objectives of this strategy, the project examines processes for changing practice within the organisation. Specifically, the project aimed to implement change using the Global Manufacturing Strategy as a guide, to increase the capacity of the managers who were accountable for the implementation of the Strategy. to improve the productivity and profitability of the company and to make a contribution to professional knowledge, in particular, the way that change is facilitated in an Australian manufacturing setting.      Set within this local context, constructionist-learning techniques are implemented and their effectiveness assessed. The influence of power relationships on practice are analysed from data derived through workplace conversations and questionnaires.        The paper concludes that under the threat of job losses, change in practice was limited. Manager-researcher role tension and the associated knowledge, power, time and ethical conflicts impacted the processes of collaborative learning and the rate of change in practice. It is suggested that collaborative change may be limited to situations where there are tangible benefits for all parties. As the profitability squeeze continues to slowly and relentlessly tighten, a depressing outlook is envisaged for those employed at the factory.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Workplace learning</field><field name="subject">Australian manufacturing</field><field name="subject">practitioner research</field><field name="subject">collaborative change</field><field name="subject">change through learning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080428.115950</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing Appropriately - Design projects to examine how contemporary civic buildings can be distinguishable in suburban and regional Australia.</field><field name="creator">Harrison, Stuart</field><field name="description">This research investigates contemporary architecture's difficulty in distinguishing new civic buildings from commercial and other non-public building types. Historically, the desire to create a clear typological distinction for the civic has come and gone through periods of time and key practitioners. Through projects, the masters attempts to formulate strategies to speak of the civic in the contemporary condition. The research aims to consider architectural language and its use in the context of new public buildings to establish a sense of difference from dominant urban typologies, and be grounded within a contemporary reading of the civic.      This project-based research features three principal resolved design projects - a Civic Centre in Mildura; Council Offices for the City of Hume, Broadmeadows; and a new 'civic school' in the Melbourne outer suburb of Mill Park. The design process undertaken for each project is subject to investigation of selected precedents, both contemporary and historical, and these are explored through an illustrated written chapter.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civic</field><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">public</field><field name="subject">decorum</field><field name="subject">appropriate</field><field name="subject">suburban</field><field name="subject">legibility</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080428.122307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial dynamic media system - Amalgam of form and image through use of a 3D light-point matrix to deliver a content-driven zone in real-time</field><field name="creator">Haeusler, Matthias</field><field name="description">The core project within my PhD research has been the development of a system as an extension of existing media facades that allows me to test the representation of information and ideas as 'form' within space that is constantly generated and regenerated as a result of fresh input.  The hypothesis is that this real time reconfiguration of space using light offers a variety of new perceptions ranging from information sharing to public art never experienced previously.  During my research, I have established an extensive body of evidence that points to a growing scholarship around the details and impacts of media fa&#231;ade technological developments and the content displayed on them. In the thesis I define the boundaries of these technology shifts and enhanced content combinations limited to 2 dimensions. In my research I consider the technical and media implications of extending conventional 2D screens which are limited currently to architectural cladding into a 3D ma trix thereby causing an alteration to spatial perception through the content animating the 3D matrix.   The core research-question is:   When weaving together architecture and electronically applied and managed imagery, are their respective properties successfully interchanged to the extent that they mutually create a new architectural zone in constant flux, generated and regenerated through content that never stands still?   I have undertaken four projects to develop my research hypothesis. I have developed a prototype system which, with the use of a 3D light-point matrix, alters space. The prototype system has then been applied in an architectural context, tested by applying 'designed' content to it. Lastly I have experimented with writing software 'applets' for a third party to adapt their own input for display purposes.     I argue that with such a prototype system, a shift from an autoplastic determinated architecture to an alloplastic indeterminate architecture is possible [Goulthorpe, 1999]. This is a significant shift for architecture beyond the scope of a single PhD.  I have concentrated within my area of expertise: media and architecture.  By experimenting with a prototype system and limiting the scope of my research to examining the shift from auto to alloplastic architecture, I can consider whether this shift can be achieved through the manipulation of content alone and not rely on the appearance and status of the associated hardware.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">spatial perception</field><field name="subject">alloplastic indeterminate architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080428.143249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Campylobacter jejuni and the Guillain-Barr&#233; syndrome.</field><field name="creator">Phongsisay, Vongsavanh</field><field name="description">Campylobacter jejuni is an enteric bacterium that causes human   gastroenteritis worldwide. Some C. jejuni strains exhibiting   human ganglioside-like lipooligosaccharide (LOS) structures,   such as GM1 ganglioside, can induce an autoimmune neuropathy   of the peripheral nervous system known as the Guillain-Barr&#233;   syndrome (GBS). This GBS-inducible determinant is encoded by a   gene cluster, which shows a high degree of variation among C.   jejuni strains. The experiments presented in this thesis were   conducted to give a better insight into the LOS synthesis genes   in relation to the pathophysiology of C. jejuni. Firstly, a C. jejuni   strain without GM1-like molecules was shown to be able to take   up large DNA fragments, including LOS synthesis genes, from a   strain expressing GM1-like molecules and consequently be   transformed into a number of potential GBS-inducible   transformants, which exhibited a high degree of genetic and   phenotypic diversity. The ability of C. jejuni to take up and   integrate foreign DNA explains the genome plasticity observed in   this pathogen. Secondly, while attempting to analyse   transcription of the LOS gene cluster, neither published methods   nor any commercially available kits for RNA isolation could   produce DNA-free RNA from C. jejuni. Combinations of these   methods were trialled and only the combination of RNAzolB,   TURBO DNase treatment, and acid phenol extraction was able to   produce DNA-free RNA. The RNA isolated from most C. jejuni   strains showed different RNA patterns to that of other bacteria. In   addition the RNA from C. jejuni seemed closely associated with   DNA compaired to RNA from other organisms. This might be   caused by species-specific DNA conformation or chromatin   structure. Thirdly, bidirectional transcription was observed in the   LOS gene cluster. Both DNA strands were transcribed but   transcription of the non-coding strands was at a lower rate, and   both sense and antisense transcripts of each LOS gene tested   were responsive to acid stress. This unusual transcription might   have a potential effect on the expression of the GBS-inducing   determinant. Finally, one of the LOS genes, the htrB gene, was   further analysed. It was shown that expression of the htrB gene   affects morphology, viability, growth ability, and sensitivity to   stress environments. These results showed that the LOS   molecule of C. jejuni is involved in many processes and is an   important molecule for survival.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Campylobacter jejuni</field><field name="subject">lipooligosaccharide</field><field name="subject">Guillain-Barr&#233;</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20061221.100446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Model Predictive Control of Magnetic Bearing System</field><field name="creator">Huang, Yang</field><field name="description">Magnetic Bearing Systems have been receiving a great deal of research attention for the past decades. Its inherent nonlinearity and open-loop instability are challenges for controller design. This thesis investigates and designs model predictive control strategy for an experimental Active Magnetic Bearing (AMB) laboratory system. A host-target development environment of real-time control system with hardware in the loop (HIL) is implemented. In this thesis, both continuous and discrete time model predictive controllers are studied. In the first stage, local MPC controllers are applied to control the AMB system; and in the second stage, concept of supervisory controller design is then investigated and implemented.   Contributions of the thesis can be summarized as follows;   1. A Discrete time Model Predictive Controller has been developed and applied to the active magnetic bearing system.   2. A Continuous time Model Predictive Controller has been developed and applied to the active magnetic bearing system.   3. A frequency domain identification method using FSF has been applied to pursue model identification with respect to local MPC and magnetic bearing system.   4.

Efficient query evaluation is achieved through the   use of an inverted index, where, for each word in the collection the index   maintains a list of the documents in which the word occurs. Query processing   may also require access to document specific statistics, such as document   length; access to word statistics, such as the number of unique documents in   which a word occurs; and collection specific statistics, such as the number of   documents in the collection. The index maintains individual data structures   for each these sources of information, and repeatedly accesses each to   process a query.   A by-product of a web search engine is a list of all queries entered into the   engine: a query log. Analyses of query logs have shown repetition of query   terms in the requests made to the search system. In this work we explore   techniques that take advantage of the repetition of user queries to improve   the accuracy or efficiency of text search. We introduce an index organisation   scheme that favours those documents that are most frequently requested by   users and show that, in combination with early termination heuristics, query   processing time can be dramatically reduced without reducing the accuracy   of the search results.   We examine the stability of such an ordering and show that an index based   on as little as 100,000 training queries can support at least 20 million   requests. We show the correlation between frequently accessed documents   and relevance, and attempt to exploit the demonstrated relationship to   improve search effectiveness. Finally, we deconstruct the search process to   show that query time redundancy can be exploited at various levels of the   search process. We develop a model that illustrates the improvements that   can be achieved in query processing time by caching different components of   a search system. This model is then validated by simulation using a document   collection and query log. Results on our test data show that a well-designed   cache can reduce disk activity by more than 30%, with a cache that is one   tenth the size of the collection.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information retrieval</field><field name="subject">search engines</field><field name="subject">access-ordering</field><field name="subject">caching</field><field name="subject">efficiency</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080501.093229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">English Language Teaching in Chinese Universities in the Era of the World Trade Organization: A Learner Perspective</field><field name="creator">Luo, Weihua</field><field name="description">Since China's accession to the WTO in 2001, China has reformed its higher education system in order to meet the challenges of globalisation. In the era of WTO, China needs more and better English, which facilitates access to modern knowledge and technology and the possibility of communication with the outside world in the process of globalisation. To correspond with this trend, the Chinese government has prioritised reforms in the teaching of English at various levels of the education system. In this context, the change of policy in the foreign language education sector becomes an issue of concern. This research, with a view to informing the ongoing reform of English language teaching (ELT), investigates learners' perspectives of ELT in Chinese universities in the context of current process of globalisation.       This thesis argues that the adoption of various ELT curricula in various periods is heavily influenced by broader social and political policies that shape Chinese responses to the process of globalisation. The promulgation in 2004 of the College English Curriculum Requirements (For Trial Implementation) represented an immediate response in the ELT field to China's economic globalisation. It further argues that the Global English model, with its stress on communicative competence and performance should be the ELT priority in Chinese universities to meet the new communication demands of contemporary globalisation. These arguments are advanced based on a study focusing on College English education, which represents ELT in China at the tertiary level, the final as well as most important part in the hierarchy of language education. To investigate the research problem in this project, a multi-faceted methodology was applied, including surveys, classroom observation and document analysis.       The following conclusions can be drawn based on the data collected. First, English remains a priority in China's education system and globalisation of English in WTO era is to the benefit of Chinese learners. Second, there has been evident shift of the goal of ELT in China from mastery of pure linguistic knowledge to development of communicative competence and the pedagogy from single skill training, i.e. reading, to integrated development of the four macro skills. Computer-aided and competence-led curricula in English language education are recent trends that contribute to the increasing awareness of both the professionals and students that productive abilities should be the priority. From the perspective of learners, this means a switch to a learner-centred model that allows more autonomy by making the teaching and learning a computer-based process of individualized learning, collaborative learning and hyper-textual learning. Third, the 1999 Curriculum failed to address the emerging issues regarding ELT in  the process of China's globalisation. This led to strong dissatisfaction from the learners and strong appeal for ELT reformation in College English education in China. Finally, the College English Curriculum Requirements (For Trial Implementation), while pinpointing the trend and model of future English education development, is confronted with serious challenges in its implementation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language learning</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080501.100805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and simulation of large-scale complex networks</field><field name="creator">Luo, Hongwei</field><field name="description">Real-world large-scale complex networks such as the Internet, social networks and biological networks have increasingly attracted the interest of researchers from many areas. Accurate modelling of the statistical regularities of these large-scale networks is critical to understand their global evolving structures and local dynamical patterns. Traditionally, the Erdos and Renyi random graph model has helped the investigation of various homogeneous networks. During the past decade, a special computational methodology has emerged to study complex networks, the outcome of which is identified by two models: the Watts and Strogatz small-world model and the Barabasi-Albert scale-free model.      At the core of the complex network modelling process is the extraction of characteristics of real-world networks. I have developed computer simulation algorithms for study of the properties of current theoretical models as well as for the measurement of two real-world complex networks, which lead to the isolation of three complex network modelling essentials.      The main contribution of the thesis is the introduction and study of a new General Two-Stage growth model (GTS Model), which aims to describe and analyze many common-featured real-world complex networks. The tools we use to create the model and later perform many measurements on it consist of computer simulations, numerical analysis and mathematical derivations.       In particular, two major cases of this GTS model have been studied.      One is named the U-P model, which employs a new functional form of the network growth rule: a linear combination of preferential attachment and uniform attachment. The degree distribution of the model is first studied by computer simulation, while the exact solution is also obtained analytically. Two other important properties of complex networks: the characteristic path length and the clustering coefficient are also extensively investigated, obtaining either analytically derived solutions or numerical results by computer simulations. Furthermore, I demonstrate that the hub-hub interaction behaves in effect as the link between a network's topology and resilience property.       The other is called the Hybrid model, which incorporates two stages of growth and studies the transition behaviour between the Erdos and Renyi random graph model and the Barabasi-Albert scale-free model. The Hybrid model is measured by extensive numerical simulations focusing on its degree distribution, characteristic path length and clustering coefficient.       Although either of the two cases serves as a new approach to modelling real-world large-scale complex networks, perhaps more importantly, the general two-stage model provides a new theoretical framework for complex network modelling, which can be extended in many ways besides the two studied in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scale-free</field><field name="subject">complex network</field><field name="subject">small-world</field><field name="subject">preferential attachment</field><field name="subject">uniform attachment</field><field name="subject">random graphs</field><field name="subject">clustering coefficient</field><field name="subject">network resilience</field><field name="subject">hub-hub</field><field name="subject">general  two-stage model</field><field name="subject">GTS model</field><field name="subject">U-P model</field><field name="subject">Hybrid model</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080506.142224</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Floating World - An investigation into illustrative and decorative art practices and theory in print media and animation.</field><field name="creator">Murray, Philippa</field><field name="description">Considered under the theme 'The Floating World', the aim of this research project was to create a written exegesis and a series of artworks, primarily in the form of digital animation and illustration, which investigate decorative and illustrative art practices and their historical lineages. Particular emphasis was given to investigating the links between contemporary decorative/illustrative art practice and the aesthetics and psychology of the Edo period in Japan (C17th - C19th), in which the term 'The Floating World' was used to describe the city of Edo (old Tokyo). The writing concerned with The Floating World is comprised of the following chapters: history; concepts; aesthetics; contemporary adaptations of Ukiyo-e; and gothic romance and associated genres.       The outcomes of my Masters program represent a sustained exploration of decorative and illustrative art practice and theory, and incorporate experimentation with associated genres such as magic realism, gothic romance, the uncanny, iconography, surrealism and other metaphorical and abstract representational practices. More broadly, my Masters project is an investigation, both theoretical and practical, into the way drawing and illustration have been a process through which to (literally) give shape to hopes and fears, and to describe understandings of self and the world.       I am particularly interested in exploring how, through the act of abstraction and the use of metaphor and decoration, a capacity to 'speak the unspeakable' and 'know the unknowable' are somehow enabled. For example, when contemporary Japanese artist Takashi Murakami decorates Edo-inspired screens with a colourful arrangement of morphing cartoon mushrooms, he conjures up a startling and complex poetic space that juxtaposes traditional Japanese aesthetics and philosophy with the hyper-consumerist characters and ethos of Disneyland, as well as disquieting references to the mushroom bombs that dropped down on Hiroshima and Nagasaki from US planes. A similarly complex space is enacted by contemporary US artist Inka Essenhigh: her oversized canvases seem like sublime Japanese-inspired screens but a closer inspection reveals that the decorative motifs are actually dismembered body parts morphed together to create a savage and compelling metaphor for contemporary America that is all the more disarming for being perf ormed in a seemingly innocuous illustrative style. My research will draw on these examples but will endeavour to create a series of artworks that are particular to an Australian context. This interests me particularly in a time when, as a nation, we appear to be confounded about what it means to be Australian: as a contemporary artist I am interested in how we represent ourselves as a nation, and in exploring the motifs and attributes that we consider to be ours.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">The Floating World</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">Ukiyo-e</field><field name="subject">pictures of the Floating World</field><field name="subject">new media</field><field name="subject">digital</field><field name="subject">media arts</field><field name="subject">animation</field><field name="subject">illustration</field><field name="subject">gothic</field><field name="subject">uncanny</field><field name="subject">magic realism</field><field name="subject">uncanny</field><field name="subject">horror</field><field name="subject">Hiroshige</field><field name="subject">Hokusai</field><field name="subject">Takashi Murakami</field><field name="subject">Chiho Aoshima</field><field name="subject">Hiropon Factory</field><field name="subject">Phip Murray.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080506.143949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Story telling ...</field><field name="creator">Morris-Nunn, Robert William</field><field name="description">I believe it is possible to tell stories through architecture. Indeed, it is my practice to create   buildings that tell stories. It is important to build and elaborate connections between past and   present, to tease out memories and discover meanings. These define and strengthen a sense of   community - in this instance the very community of which I am a part.   My oeuvre springs from cultural - even anecdotal - reference points, more than from the work of my   architectural forebears and compatriots. Other architects design through a creative interaction with   their unconscious: they develop doodles and lines, and resolve them into ordered spatial   environments. Instead, when I claim to design buildings that tell stories, I mean that I create a   spatial identity that resonates with memories and unconscious associations. This entails the very   deliberate ordering of spaces - external and internal - where cultural considerations and their   associated meanings are developed from the outset, informing the whole design process. My   materials are the traditional fabric of contemporary architecture. I use them to modify buildings and   shape spaces to visual symbols, objects by association.   My early work evolved in such a way that projects could be read as a illustrated story. I have more   recently begun to engage in a more psychological 'place making' to conceive a building's form.   The functional aspect of layout is always overlaid with visual imagery designed to evoke memories   among the ordinary, mostly architecturally-illiterate people who use the buildings.   I am continually challenged to create architectural forms that more effectively engage with the   culture and traditions of people and place. But neither my architectural practice nor my designs   can be termed 'traditional'. Here I seek to describe story-telling as an architectural form. Stories   are my contextual framework for thinking. And story-telling is my way to connect buildings with   people.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">story telling</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">narrative</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080506.150101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Landscape ecological planning for protected areas using spatial and temporal metrics</field><field name="creator">Mirkarimi, Hamed</field><field name="description">The natural characteristics of protected areas have changed for a variety of reasons through time. Changes in protected area landscapes can occur because of natural and/or cultural processes. Natural processes such as geomorphological disturbance and climatic condition can permanently and/or temporarily change the characteristics of the environment. In addition, changes in human needs, knowledge and activities are the cultural driving forces behind changing characteristics of landscape through time.    These changes can be studied both spatially and temporally. Spatially, protected area landscape structures such as shape, size and location with respect to their neighbourhood context can be studied to describe landscape configuration. Temporally, landscape functions such as different geographical locations and land characteristics can be studied to determine the rate of temporal variability in landscape. Any changes in temporal characteristics may lead to changes in spatial characteristics of protected areas and vice versa.    This thesis has developed a framework to enhance the landscape ecological planning approach with attention to changes in landscapes of protected areas. Considering landscape ecological concepts, this framework draws upon spatial and temporal characteristics of protected areas. Initially, a basic model of the landscape ecological approach to protected area planning and data requirements for landscape ecological planning was developed according to the concept of landscape ecological planning. In order to examine the model in the real world, the data requirements for landscape ecological planning were implemented using a case study method. The basic list of data required for landscape ecological planning was further developed through the case study approach by highlighting the importance of road metrics in the process of planning. In addition, the case study approach proved that spatial and temporal metrics can be used in the interpretation of spatial configuration and temporal variability of protected areas th rough a quantitative method. The framework was developed for three case studies in Iran and three case studies in Australia. A number of metrics were applied in order to quantify spatial and temporal aspects of the protected areas. A list of spatial and temporal criteria was developed to assist interpretation of area compaction, spatial fragmentation and temporal variability of protected areas. Using the criteria list, a new framework for spatial and temporal evaluation of protected areas has been developed. This can be used to determine spatial and temporal management issues of protected areas at the landscape scale. Then planning scenarios for spatial and temporal issues of protected areas at the landscape scale can be suggested. The developed framework has the potential to be applied to all protected areas even where detailed ecological data and information are not available. In addition, when all data required are available, the developed framework using spatial and temporal metrics has the potential to  suggest a flexible zoning plan for protected areas.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spatial metrics</field><field name="subject">temporal metrics</field><field name="subject">protected area planning</field><field name="subject">landscape ecological planning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080507.122506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drink spiking: An investigation of its occurrence and predictors of perpetration and victimisation</field><field name="creator">McPherson, Bridget Anne</field><field name="description">The current study assessed features associated with drink spiking, or the adding of a substance to another person's drink without the consumer's knowledge or consent. A sample of 805 Australians, aged 18-35 years, completed a survey designed to measure the occurrence and predictors of the perpetration and victimisation of drink spiking. Almost half of the sample reported at least one experience of purchasing or mixing cocktails for others (49% and 45%, respectively), while smaller proportions reported adding alcohol to punch (26%) and adding alcoholic shots to alcoholic beverages belonging to other people (16%). A number of participants also reported previous experience of adding alcoholic shots to non-alcoholic beverages (6%), adding prescription or illicit substances to alcoholic beverages (1%), adding substances to non-alcoholic beverages (1%), and adding substances to punch (1%).   Purchasing or mixing cocktails for others, adding alcohol to punch, or adding alcoholic shots to alcoholic beverages were predicted by beliefs that deliberately causing intoxication in others is acceptable and that alcohol consumption by others is indicative of their sexual attraction to participants. Engagement in these behaviours was also predicted by participants' illicit substance use and participation in casual sexual activity. Adding prescription or illicit substances to other people's beverages, or adding alcoholic shots to non-alcoholic beverages, were predicted by the belief that alcohol consumption increases one's confidence and sexual responsiveness, and by participants' use of narcotics and sedatives. Perpetrators were predominantly motivated by a wish to have fun or to increase the likelihood of engaging in consensual sexual activity.   With regard to victimisation of drink spiking, 26% of the sample reported at least one victimisation. The majority of incidents occurred in licensed venues, after the participant had engaged in such low supervisory behaviours as leaving their drink unattended or accepting a drink without observing its preparation. Most participants established a belief that they had been spiked after experiencing a degree of intoxication that was beyond their expected level (based on the amount of alcohol consumption), or after experiencing such physiological symptoms as vomiting, hallucinations, lack of coordination, or unconsciousness. Despite such experiences, 85% of victims did not report the incident to authorities. Victimisation in general was predicted by participants' use of stimulant and hallucinogenic substances. Female victimisation was predicted by previous episodes of victimisation of oral sexual assault. Victimisation was not affected by participants' degree of supervision of their drinks.    These findings provided empirical evidence that drink spiking is committed primarily for the purposes of creating a fun, entertaining situation. However, it was also apparent that drink spiking is perpetrated in an attempt to encourage participation in consensual sexual activity; this was particularly the case in incidents involving the addition of substances, as opposed to alcohol, to beverages belonging to others.    Conclusions regarding the motivations held by perpetrators of drink spiking and the post-spiking experiences of victims informed the provision of recommendations for intervention for victims and prevention programs aimed at reducing the incidence of victimisation in the future.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drink spiking</field><field name="subject">sexual assault</field><field name="subject">perpetration</field><field name="subject">victimisation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080507.141942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An assesssment of non-conventional measures of lung function and the effedt of a herbal extract on mild-moderate childhood asthma</field><field name="creator">Maxwell, Sheena</field><field name="description">Background:    Respiratory conditions are prevalent and cause an enormous burden on society. In recent decades, there has been a global increase in asthma in children and adults, yet the diagnosis of asthma must be made on clinical grounds as the diagnostic use of pharmacological reversibility of airway obstruction remains controversial. It is possible however that tools exist from different medical paradigms that may assist in the clinical diagnosis of asthma. Tools such as Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) enquiry, Breath Holding Time (BHT) or Electro-Dermal Screening Test (EDST) may provide useful clinical information, yet their use has not been widely explored or validated.   Integrative medicine may be considered to represent a new frontier in medicine where each therapy and diagnostic method is seen to have its own advantages and limitations and where an integration of both diagnostic and therapeutic techniques from conventional and complementary medicine is seen to produce the best results. However, while there is a high community use of complementary therapies for conditions such as asthma, there is also a need to maintain accepted standards of medical and scientific principles and foster high quality research into complementary therapies.   Objectives:    The current study sought to determine:   &#149;	 If there is a correlation between conventional measures of lung function such as Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) and less conventional measures such as airways expired NO level (eNO), electrodermal measures, TCM enquiry and BHT.   &#149;	If any of the lung function measures are able to distinguish between asthmatic and healthy subjects.    &#149;	If the use of a rye grass extract is better than placebo in improving requirements for bronchodilator medication, peak flow, forced expiratory volume in one second or quality of life in mild to moderate childhood asthma.      Rational for carrying out two separate studies as one study;   The author was interested on both the integration of diagnostic techniques as well as the effect of the herbal extract on asthma so it was decided to use the opportunity and put both in one study.   Method:    A range of conventional and non-conventional measures were conducted in healthy and asthmatic children including demographic details, quality of life data, spirometry measures, airway nitric oxide levels, electro-dermal measures, TCM history enquiries, breath holding time, and skin prick tests. The data were analysed to determine any significant correlations between these measures. A double blind randomized controlled pilot clinical trial was also performed to assess the effect of using rye grass extract in asthmatic children aged 8 to 16 years.   Results:    There were significant correlations between forced expiratory volume in one second and active quality of life, TCM spleen score and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide measurements.  There were also statistically significant differences between asthmatic and healthy subjects in TCM history, breath holding time and exhaled nitric oxide. The use of rye grass extract did not produce any significant improvement over placebo in any of the asthma outcome measures.     Conclusions:    The use of inexpensive measures such as BHT and TCM enquiry may provide useful clinical information when assessing respiratory conditions such as asthma. However, further research is required in larger populations to confirm their use. The use of the rye grass extract at the dose given in this study did not provide any clinical benefit for the asthmatic children in this study.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Traditional Chinese Medicine</field><field name="subject">TCM</field><field name="subject">Breath Holding Time</field><field name="subject">BHT</field><field name="subject">Electro-Dermal Screening Test</field><field name="subject">EDST</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080507.150547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supply and Demand of Creative Arts in Regional Victoria, Australia</field><field name="creator">Masters, Tristan Andrew</field><field name="description">Creative arts can make vital contributions to both economies and   communities. Moreover, these impacts can be keenly felt by smaller, regional   communities, where shifts away from traditional rural industries are apparent,   and in the context of the Inew economy' which emphasises the importance   of knowledge industries and creative industries. This research investigates   creative arts supply and demand in regional Victoria, Australia through the   collection and analysis of qualitative and quantitative data in three target   communities. Fundamentally, this thesis presents a detailed analysis of the   current supply and demand environment, including the impacts of regional   arts festivals, and determines the conditions, events and characteristics which   could strengthen regional Victorian supply and demand of creative arts.   This thesis analyses focus group data to investigate current levels of supply of   creative arts in regional Victoria. Qualitative analysis of the data shows that   the supply of creative arts in the target areas is limited by scarce resources,   isolation, negative community attitudes towards creative arts, and a small   audience or sales market and an over-reliance on volunteers. Small and   micro-businesses in the regional Victorian arts sector are seen as having   motivations for operating beyond making money, limited business acumen,   and have difficulty in marketing themselves effectively. Best-practice   strategies to strengthen the operations of small and micro-businesses include   adopting a more entrepreneurial attitude towards arts business, using an   agent to source new audiences or sales markets and to maximise the   promotion of their product, creating art which is accessible to the local   community, and to engage in skills development and business training.   Using attitudes towards creative arts, participation in creative arts and   expenditure on creative arts as a measure of current demand levels, this   thesis applies a range of statistical and econometric tests to the data   collected from the three target communities. Contrary to the view emergent   from the supply data, this thesis shows that regional Victorians have strong   levels of demand for creative arts. Results show higher than average levels of   overall monthly arts expenditure, and strong demand for cinema, craft fairs or   exhibitions, books, CDs and other music formats. Low levels of demand were   noted for classical music, opera or ballet. Chi-Squared analysis and ordered   probit results show that gender, age, festival attendance, education, and   individual levels of overall arts expenditure are all determinants of creative   arts demand. Analysis regarding impacts and key aspects of two regional arts festivals   found that regional festival patrons are more likely to be female, local to the   host region, have a middle income, and hold a high school or equivalent   qualification. An econometric model, including two versions of an Ordinary   Least Squares regression in addition to Tobit and probit estimations, was used   to more accurately estimate individual expenditure characteristics, notably   accounting for the zero-expenditure of attendees who are local to the host   region.   This thesis provides valuable contributions to knowledge regarding the supply   and demand of creative arts in regional areas. It also provides practical   insights for policy makers, festival organisers, and the regional arts industry.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Arts</field><field name="subject">Cultural Economics</field><field name="subject">Regional</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Supply</field><field name="subject">Demand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080507.152730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene expression profiling of chickpea responses to drought, cold and high-salinity using cDNA microarray</field><field name="creator">Mantri, Nitin Laxminarayan</field><field name="description">Cultivated chickpea (Cicer arietinum) has a narrow genetic base making it difficult for breeders to produce new elite cultivars with durable resistance to major biotic and abiotic stresses. As an alternative to genome mapping, microarrays have recently been applied in crop species to identify and assess the function of putative genes thought to be involved in plant abiotic stress and defence responses. In the present study, a cDNA microarray approach was taken in order to determine if the transcription of genes, from a set of previously identified putative stress-responsive genes from chickpea and its close relative Lathyrus sativus, were altered in chickpea by the three abiotic stresses; drought, cold and high-salinity. For this, chickpea genotypes known to be tolerant and susceptible to each abiotic stress were challenged and gene expression in the leaf, root and/or flower tissues was studied. The transcripts that were differentially expressed among stressed an d unstressed plants in response to the particular stress were analysed in the context of tolerant/susceptible genotypes. The transcriptional change of more than two fold was observed for 109, 210 and 386 genes after drought, cold and high-salinity treatments, respectively. Among these, two, 15 and 30 genes were consensually differentially expressed (DE) between tolerant and susceptible genotypes studied for drought, cold and high-salinity, respectively. The genes that were DE in tolerant and susceptible genotypes under abiotic stresses code for various functional and regulatory proteins. Significant differences in stress responses were observed within and between tolerant and susceptible genotypes highlighting the multiple gene control and complexity of abiotic stress response mechanism in chickpea. The annotation of these genes suggests that they may have a role in abiotic stress response and are potential candidates for tolerance/susceptibility.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chickpea</field><field name="subject">drought</field><field name="subject">cold</field><field name="subject">high-salinity</field><field name="subject">cDNA microarray</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080509.160714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blown Film Extrusion: Experimental, Modelling and Numerical Study</field><field name="creator">Majumder, Khokan  Kanti</field><field name="description">Abstract         This thesis correlates rheological data into a non-linear blown film model that describes the stress and cooling-induced morphological transformations in the axial and flow profiles of the blown films. This will help to improve the physical and mechanical properties of the films in a cost effective way, which will in turn be of great benefit to the food and packaging industries.      In this research, experimental and numerical studies of a blown film extrusion were carried out using two different low-density polyethylenes (LDPEs). In the experiment, the key parameters measured and analysed were molecular, rheological and crystalline properties of the LDPEs. In the numerical study, blown film simulation was carried out to determine the bubble characteristics and freeze line height (FLH). A new rheological constitutive equation was developed by combining the Hookean model with the well known Phan-Thien and Tanner (PTT) model to permit a more accurate viscoelastic behaviour of the material. For experimental verification of the simulation results, resins were processed in a blown film extrusion pilot plant using identical die temperatures and cooling rates as used in the simulation study.          Molecular characteristics of both LDPEs were compared in terms of their processing benefit in the film blowing process.  Based on the experimental investigation, it was found that molecular weight and its distribution, degree of long chain branching and cooling rate play an important role on melt rheology, molecular orientation, blown film processability, film crystallinity and film properties. Effect of short chain branching was found insignificant for both LDPEs.       Statistical analysis was carried out using MINITAB-14 software with a confidence level of 95% to determine the effect of process variables (such as die temperature and cooling rate) on the film properties. Film properties of the LDPEs were found to vary with their molecular properties and the process variables used.      Blown film model performance based on the newly established PTT-Hookean model was compared with that based on the Kelvin model. Justification of the use of PTT-Hookean model is also reported here using two different material properties. From the simulation study, it has been found that predictions of the blown film characteristics conformed very well to the experimental data of this research and previous studies using different materials and different die geometries.       Long chain branching has been found as the most prominent molecular parameter for both LDPEs affecting melt rheology and hence the processability. Die temperature and cooling rate have been observed to provide similar effect on the tear strength and shrinkage properties of blown film for both LDPEs. In comparison to the Kelvin model, the PTT-Hookean model is better suited for the modelling of the film blowing process. It has also been demonstrated in this study that the PTT-Hookean model conformed well to the experimental data near the freeze line height and is suitable for materials of lower melt elasticity and relaxation time.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rheology</field><field name="subject">Blown film</field><field name="subject">Extrusion</field><field name="subject">Polyethylene</field><field name="subject">LDPE</field><field name="subject">PTT-Hookean</field><field name="subject">Long chain</field><field name="subject">Branching</field><field name="subject">Crystallinity</field><field name="subject">Modelling</field><field name="subject">Simulation</field><field name="subject">Melt elasticity</field><field name="subject">Relaxation time</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080509.161859</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impacts of Agriculture and Plantation Forestry in a Selection of Upper Catchments of the Strzelecki Ranges, Victoria</field><field name="creator">Mainville, Daniel Mark</field><field name="description">The intensive nature of land uses in the Strzelecki Ranges poses significant threats to landscape values and water quality. A comprehensive catchment strategy was developed based on sustainability science concepts incorporating the careful management of landscape values, proper land management approaches, and government policy and legislative change to ensure that agriculture, forestry and other land uses become sustainable in this sensitive environment.       The readily measurable water quality indicators of turbidity, flow, electrical conductivity, and water temperature were used to determine the impacts of the major land uses in the Strzeleckis. From a water quality perspective, there was a trend of decreasing water quality with increasing intensity in land management. However, from a total sediment load perspective, the forest area contributed the highest total sediment load due to higher volumes of steam flow suggesting that natural processes in the Strzeleckis may remain the principal mechanisms for sediment movement within the catchment.       An incidental but significant finding was extensive bioturbation along the riparian zone of the plantation area, the extent of which was not observed in the other catchments. This finding suggested that bioturbation may have been the most significant contributor to poorer water quality flowing from in the plantation catchment.      The project developed insights into the major environmental processes active in the upper catchment of the Morwell River. Understanding of the contributions to total sediment loads from natural erosional processes and bioturbation, findings related to the impacts on water quality from agricultural practices, and encountering negligible impacts from conservative timber harvesting practices demonstrate that catchment management approaches need to be tailored to achieve sustainability in land uses across the landscape. Key recommendations include the re-establishment and protection of riparian zones in agricultural catchments, the careful assessment and setting of stream buffer zone widths for timber harvesting operations, and the need for further work to map the extent of natural processes such as bioturbation and stream bank erosion.       To mitigate these issues, government policy and legislation will need to focus on the preservation and enhancement of the Crown land riparian zones. Recommended changes to current administrative land management arrangements for these sensitive areas include a move from licensing riparian zones for agricultural practices such as grazing to conservation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Land use</field><field name="subject">catchment</field><field name="subject">land management</field><field name="subject">agriculture</field><field name="subject">forestry</field><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="subject">turbidity</field><field name="subject">flow</field><field name="subject">electrical conductivity</field><field name="subject">stream temperature</field><field name="subject">sediment</field><field name="subject">bioturbation</field><field name="subject">riparian</field><field name="subject">erosion</field><field name="subject">Strzelecki Ranges</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080509.162820</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Disruptions on Routinization of Goal-Directed Grocery Shopping Behavior</field><field name="creator">Ong, Adeline, Pek Kay</field><field name="description">This thesis bridges a gap in extant research by examining key factors that play a role in behavioral grocery shopping routines following minor and major disruptions.  The present research involves two interrelated investigations incorporating mixed methodologies (Cresswell, 2003).        Study 1 involves semi-structured in-depth interviews seeking to establish how goal-directed grocery shopping routines are developed over time.  Utilizing a laddering approach of questioning (Gutman, 1997), respondents are probed on their routines (Brotherton, 2001) and goals, including end goals as described in the List of Values (Kahle &amp; Kennedy, 1988).  Three participants were interviewed on three occasions over an eight week period, until theoretical saturation was achieved.        A significant contribution of Study 1 lies in the development of a conceptual framework for understanding factors associated with grocery shopping routines.  This model reflects a working definition characterizing routines as goal-driven and value-guided heuristic strategies.  It is proposed that routines are repetitive patterns of personal and private behavioral activities dependent upon situational and temporal contexts, and utilized for instrumental reasons.  Risk-taking attitudes and personal values also shape goal-directed behaviors.        Using structural equation modeling (SEM) procedures (J&#246;reskog &amp; S&#246;rbom, 1993), Study 2, an online experiment, aims to test and build upon the conceptual model emanating from Study 1.  This study also investigates the impact of minor and major disruptions on routinized grocery shopping behavior.  612 participants were allocated across three experimental groups: situational contexts, anticipated temporal conditions, and repetitive value.  Cohorts were assessed at baseline levels and received unique minor and major disruptions appropriate to their circumstance.        Study 2 contributes through the large-scale SEM testing of a model of grocery shopping routinization.  Overall, sound structural model fit demonstrates that the present model of grocery shopping routinization is explained by six distinct components including routinized behavior, goal-centeredness, situational contexts, anticipated temporal conditions, repetitive value, and risk-taking attitudes; and three dimensions of personal values: maturity, self-direction/achievement, and enjoyment. In terms of disruptions, findings indicate that routine strength is dependent on degree of situational, temporal, and instrumental interruptions. Disruptions can both facilitate and impede routines. Results demonstrate that regardless of goal stability, routines change when model components are disrupted.      Findings suggest theoretical, research, and practical implications.  This thesis expands decision making theory (Betsch, Fiedler, &amp; Brinkmann, 1998) by demonstrating that, despite unwavering goals, new contexts arising from disruptions influence new behavioral deliberations.  In relation to research implications, this thesis develops then subsequently tests a model of grocery shopping routinization. Despite routines becoming subconscious over time (Aarts &amp; Dijksterhuis, 2000a), this study asserts that routines are intentional and involve goal-directed strategies for dealing with the environment.  From an applied perspective, practitioners should be aware that routine-disrupted consumers remain goal-driven.  Consumers are unlikely to forego focal goals (e.g., shop for weekly household meals) if these goals are non-negotiable.  Present results suggest that consumers esteem maturity-related personal values, such as fostering and maintaining warm relationships with others and sense of belonging, when grocery sho pping.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Routines</field><field name="subject">Goals</field><field name="subject">Grocery Shopping</field><field name="subject">Structural equation modeling</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080513.135519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Urban Yards: Terraires Vagues of inner northern Melbourne</field><field name="creator">O'Loan, Timothy</field><field name="description">This Masters of Landscape Architecture investigates the occurrence of small, temporary urban voids in inner northern Melbourne.

Consultants who work in this way focus on the many layers of interactions and exchanges taking place both within organisations and at the interface between an organisation and its external environment. The territory for collaborative exploration with clients extends from interpersonal and group dynamics to service and product- related systems and processes. It is a holistic approach that creates opportunities for transformational learning at every level of the organisation.      As a practice, consulting with a systems psychodynamics approach is complex and difficult to master. Arguably, the most challenging dimension of this work for consultants is developing a capacity to think within a psychoanalytic conceptual framework: to discern and hypothesise about unconscious processes in organisations. But what precisely does this mean and what is this experience like for the consultants? This research project was designed to explore and describe the experience of working with a systems psychodynamic approach from the consultants' perspectives within the Australian context. To this end, 20 consultants who self-selected as working with a systems psychodynamic approach were involved in this research. From the data created in this process, what is documented in this thesis is the first detailed description of the experience of 'working in this way' taken from the combined perspectives of these 20 consultants.      Further, a systems psychodynamic approach to research is defined and applied in this thesis. In this way, the systems psychodynamics within the temporary 'system' created by the research was part of the territory under investigation. This process led to an important discovery. 18 of 20 consultants strongly asserted the importance of working with colleagues in pairs or teams when adopting a systems psychodynamic approach. However, at the time of interviewing, all 20 consultants were working alone and only 3 had immediate plans to work with others. An exploration of the reasons for this gap between beliefs about best practice and actual practice became the focus for the analysis of the data.      What is discovered through this analysis is that the reasons why consultants are predominantly choosing to work alone are likely to be complex and irreducible. An exploration of the issues that working together can surface for consultants who apply a systems psychodynamic approach is presented under four sub-topics: system domain issues; theory-related issues; interpersonal issues and intrapsychic issues. In this detailed analysis, what is revealed is an absence of 'good enough' containment for the anxieties that are likely to be aroused when consultants work together. To this end, four 'containers' are proposed: organisation/brand-as-container; management-as-container; supervision-as-container and theory/praxis-as container. This research has uncovered some important challenges facing the community of practitioners in Australia. It is the contention in this thesis that they need to be addressed if the practice of consulting with a systems psychodynamic approach is to flourish and continue to grow.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Systems Psychodynamics</field><field name="subject">consulting</field><field name="subject">organisations</field><field name="subject">psychoanalysis</field><field name="subject">group relations</field><field name="subject">open systems theory</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080513.144938</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of the Rat Relaxin-like Factor Gene</field><field name="creator">Nasa, Zeyad</field><field name="description">Relaxin-like factor (RLF), also known as Leydig insulin-like peptide (Ley-I-L) or Insulin 3 (INSL3), is a newly characterized member of the insulin peptide family.

The main aim of this thesis was to sequence the rat RLF (Relaxin-like factor) gene and determine the structure and organisation of the gene.  Secondly to compare the structural organisation of the rat RLF/JAK3 genomic region with that of the mouse and human, using bioinformatic databases.

The homology between rat and mouse in the JAK3/RLF region revealed 84.4 % similarity over 1262 bp of DNA sequence, observing that unlike the mouse, the rat RLF promoter is separated from the JAK3 gene by around 700-1000 bp.  Similarly in humans, the RLF gene is located around 4 kb downstre am from JAK3.

This study augments the extensive body of  research pertaining to knowledge about literacy programs, theory and pedagogy and it aims to explore a further dimension relating to the skills and knowledge that Literacy Coordinators need to acquire and apply in order to successfully manage their programs.  The research paradigm of this study, as described by Guba and Lincoln (1994), uses constructivist (naturalistic) inquiry methodology and a case study approach.  The collection of the data in these case studies has been achieved using a semi-ethnographic approach described by Denzin and Lincoln (2000) where the researcher observes the classroom program as a non-participant observer and engages in active collaborative reflection and analysis of the key knowledge and strategies required for successful p rogram management, in conjunction with the Literacy Coordinator participants.  This study has also employed purposeful sampling (Patton, 1990) in the selection of the Literacy Coordinator participants and their schools and incorporates the use of teacher's voice in the construction and interpretation of key issues.       The literature review examines the conceptualisation of literacy learning with a focus on the past three decades and explores current leadership and management theory as an integral component of program provision.  A historical background to the industrial and political influences on the provision of literacy support for the purpose of raising the literacy achievement of students in secondary schools in Victoria is also provided.  The value and relevance of having a theory that informs the Literacy Coordinators' practice is explored.  The importance of professional development through participant observation and shared retelling and collaborative interpretation of the events is also examined.  The case studies highlight the need for training in program design, diagnosing of student needs and for training for the leadership component of the role.        The data collection involved six school sites and six Literacy Coordinators employed in secondary schools in the Northern metropolitan region of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.  Data included key informant interviews, curriculum and strategic planning documents and program materials.      A number of key skills and knowledge criteria emerged as key factors in successful program management.  They include the need for time and appropriate resources to effectively manage the program; the need for Literacy Coordinators to be trained in selecting and designing content, the need to master pedagogical knowledge related to literacy program provision and the need for training in the use of testing instruments and interpretation of testing data.  Other key knowledge and skill requirements include training in management, the ability to develop effective partnerships and the ability to build and maintain teams.

Like all strategic planning, SISP requires measuring how well SISP is done and how planning is improving over time. The measurement of these intangibles is a complex exercise. There have been few efforts undertaken in the Information Systems (IS) literature to formally develop a model for assessing and measuring SISP efforts.   In this study, two models were proposed: a five-stage SISP maturity model for defining SISP maturity and another one for assessing the degree of SISP maturity. The five SISP maturity levels were defined as: Rudimentary Planning, Ineffectual Planning, Attainable Planning, Sustainable Planning, and Adaptable Planning. The assessment model was structured as a third-order system, where eight first-order dimensions were termed as Form and Content, Collaboration, Policies, Stakeholders' Designation, Knowledge Bank, Technology, Time Dimension, and Viability. The first-order dimensions were grouped into three second-order constructs, namely Effectiveness, Efficiency and Manoeuvrability, which ultimately characterise the level of SISP success. This model was used to establish a theoretical benchmark for each SISP maturity level.   To model the level of SISP maturity, an 'Integral Engineering' approach was established and the Analytic Network Process (ANP) theory was used. The study is a novel approach in using ANP to synthesize the measures of the various SISP constructs into a single overall measure of SISP maturity level.    A survey was performed and data collected from 260 Australian organisations to examine the degree of SISP maturity and the relationships among SISP constructs. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to test the fit between the hypothesized model and the survey data The models were applied to the data collected and the findings suggested that the models fit the data well.   While Effectiveness and Efficiency are well recognised planning constructs, Manoeuvrability as a measure of planning dynamics is not acknowledged in the literature as an equally important construct. This study confirmed a strong correlation between Manoeuvrability and SISP success and found it to be more important than the Efficiency construct. The empirical data did not confirm the existence of Rudimentary and Ineffectual planning levels of SISP maturity Australia-wide. SISP maturity in the majority of Australian organisations is at Sustainable and Attainable planning levels. A small percentage of the surveyed organisations have actually reached the highest planning level (Adaptable planning). The empirical data showed that current SISP is lacking strategic dimension and that the recently popularised one-year planning horizon may not be the best choice. Australian organisations did not consider the strategic relevance of IT as the key objective. IT/IS was seen as a business enabler, thus the strategic advan tage associated with IT came as a secondary objective.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SISP</field><field name="subject">Strategic Information Systems Planning</field><field name="subject">SISP maturity stages</field><field name="subject">SISP Assessment</field><field name="subject">SISP Measurement</field><field name="subject">ANP</field><field name="subject">AHP</field><field name="subject">SEM</field><field name="subject">IT</field><field name="subject">IS.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080514.162332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Properties of Trace Maps and their Applications to Coding Theory</field><field name="creator">Pinnawala, Nimalsiri</field><field name="description">In this thesis we study the application of trace maps over Galois fields and Galois rings in the construction of non-binary linear and non-linear codes and mutually unbiased bases.       Properties of the trace map over the Galois fields and Galois rings has been used very successfully in the construction of cocyclic  Hadamard, complex Hadamard and Butson Hadamard matrices and consequently to construct linear codes over integers modulo prime and prime powers. These results provide motivation to extend this work to construct codes over integers modulo . The prime factorization of integers paved the way to focus our attention on the direct product of Galois rings and Galois fields of the same degree. We define a new map over the direct product of Galois rings and Galois fields by using the usual trace maps. We study the fundamental properties of the this map and notice that these are very similar to that of the trace map over Galois rings and Galois fields. As such this map called the trace-like map and is used to construct cocyclic Butson Hadamard matrices and consequently to construct linear codes over integers modulo . We notice that the codes construct in this way over the integers modulo  6 is simplex code of type .       A further generalization of the trace-like map called the weighted-trace map is defined over the direct product of Galois rings and Galois fields of different degrees. We use the weighted-trace map to construct some non-linear codes and mutually unbiased bases of odd integer dimensions.       Further more we study the distribution of   over the Galois fields of degree 2 and use it to construct 2-dimensional, two-weight, self-orthogonal codes and constant weight codes over integers modulo prime.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Codes</field><field name="subject">Butson</field><field name="subject">Hadamard</field><field name="subject">Trace</field><field name="subject">Cocycle</field><field name="subject">Weight-Trace</field><field name="subject">Self-orthogonal</field><field name="subject">Two-weight</field><field name="subject">Galois ring</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080515.121603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Historical Based Adaptation Mechanism For BDI Agents</field><field name="creator">Phung, Toan</field><field name="description">One of the limitations of the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) model is the lack of any explicit mechanisms within the architecture to be able to learn. In particular, BDI agents do not possess the ability to adapt based on past experience. This is important in dynamic environments as they can change, causing previously successful methods for achieving goals to become inefficient or ineffective. We present a model in which learning, analogous reasoning, data pruning and learner accuracy evaluation can be utilised by a BDI agent and verify this model experimentally using Inductive and Statistical learning. Intelligent Agents are a new way of developing software applications. They are an amalgam of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Software Engineering concepts that are highly suited to domains that are inherently complex and dynamic. Agents are software entities that are autonomous, reactive, proactive, situated and social. They are autonomous in that they are able to  make decisions on their own volition. They are situated in some environment and are reactive to this environment yet are also capable of proactive behaviour where they actively pursue goals. They are capable of social behaviour where communication can occur between agents. BDI (Belief Desire Intention) agents are one popular type of agent that support complex behaviour in dynamic environments. Agent adaptation can be viewed as the process of changing the way in which an agent achieves its goals. We distinguish between 'reactive' or short-term adaptation, 'long-term' or historical adaptation and 'very long term' or evolutionary adaptation. Short-term adaptation, an ability that current BDI agents already possess, involves reacting to changes in the environment and choosing alternative plans of action which may involve choosing new plans if the current plan fails. 'Long-term' or historical adaptation entails the use of past cases during the reasoning process which enables agents to avoid repeating past mistak es. 'Evolutionary adaptation' could involve the use of genetic programming or similar techniques to mutate plans to lead to altered behaviour. Our work aims to improve BDI agents by introducing a framework that allows BDI agents to alter their behaviour based on past experience, i.e. to learn.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agent</field><field name="subject">BDI</field><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="subject">Alkemy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080515.124049</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Efficient, Practical, Portable Mapping Technique on Computational Grids</field><field name="creator">Phinjaroenphan, Panu</field><field name="description">Grid computing provides a powerful, virtual parallel system known as a computational Grid on which users can run parallel applications to solve problems quickly. However, users must be careful to allocate tasks to nodes properly because improper allocation of only one task could result in lengthy executions of applications, or even worse, applications could crash. This allocation problem is called the mapping problem, and an entity that tackles this problem is called a mapper. In this thesis, we aim to develop an efficient, practical, portable mapper.      To study the mapping problem, researchers often make unrealistic assumptions such as that nodes of Grids are always reliable, that execution times of tasks assigned to nodes are known a priori, or that detailed information of parallel applications is always known. As a result, the practicality and portability of mappers developed in such conditions are uncertain. Our review of related work suggested that a more efficient tool is required to study this problem; therefore, we developed GMap, a simulator researchers/developers can use to develop practical, portable mappers. The fact that nodes are not always reliable leads to the development of an algorithm for predicting the reliability of nodes and a predictor for identifying reliable nodes of Grids. Experimental results showed that the predictor reduced the chance of failures in executions of applications by half. The facts that execution times of tasks assigned to nodes are not known a priori and that detailed information of parallel applications is not alw ays known, lead to the evaluation of five nearest-neighbour (nn) execution time estimators: k-nn smoothing, k-nn, adaptive k-nn, one-nn, and adaptive one-nn. Experimental results showed that adaptive k-nn was the most efficient one. We also implemented the predictor and the estimator in GMap. Using GMap, we could reliably compare the efficiency of six mapping algorithms: Min-min, Max-min, Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, and Quick-quality Map, with none of the preceding unrealistic assumptions. Experimental results showed that Quick-quality Map was the most efficient one. As a result of these findings, we achieved our goal in developing an efficient, practical, portable mapper.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mapping Problem</field><field name="subject">Mapping Algorithm</field><field name="subject">Grid</field><field name="subject">Computational Grid</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080516.145808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhanced SOAP Performance for Low Bandwidth Environments</field><field name="creator">Phan, Thi Khoi Anh</field><field name="description">It is desirable that SOAP performs efficiently in environments where   there are a large number of transactions. However, SOAP is based on XML and therefore inherits XML's disadvantage of having voluminous messages.   Firstly, the performance of different SOAP bindings is investigated.   A benchmark of different SOAP bindings in wireless environments demonstrates the unsuitability of HTTP and TCP bindings in limited bandwidth environments. UDP is recommended as an alternative transport protocol for SOAP. Secondly, the thesis examines the use of multicast in reducing the traffic caused by SOAP messages in low bandwidth environments to deal with challenges described. A novel SOAP-level multicast protocol based on the similarity of SOAP messages,   called SMP (Similarity-based SOAP Multicast Protocol), is proposed. In particular, issues of traffic, network optimization, response time and scalability are investigated. Lastly, two extensions of SMP are proposed to further improve the performance of SMP. SMP's extensions are two algorithms, greedy and incremental tc-SMP, for traffic-constrained similarity-based SOAP multicast. Tc-SMP optimizes network traffic by building its own   spanning trees instead of using the one built by traditional methods, such as Dijkstra's algorithm. A new client is added to a tc-SMP tree through an existing tc-SMP node that causes minimal additional traffic for that connection. Detailed analytical models and experimental evaluations of the proposed methods demonstrate that combining SOAP messages of similar content and multicasting them as aggregated messages can significantly lower total network traffic. These improvements are advantageous for Web   service applications that involve a high number of simultaneous similar transactions such as stock quotes, weather and sport event reports.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SOAP</field><field name="subject">Web service</field><field name="subject">multicast</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080516.150810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and evaluation of QCM sensors for the detection of     influenza virus from clinical samples</field><field name="creator">Peduru Hewa, Thamara Mangalika</field><field name="description">The Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is a very sensitive mass-detecting device which is based on changes in to the vibrational frequency of quartz crystals after adsorption of substances to a modified crystal surface. In this study a QCM-based biosensor was developed for the rapid diagnosis of influenza viruses and its suitability and limitations were compared with currently available diagnostic methods on 67 clinical samples (nasal washes) received during the 2005 Australian winter.      The type-specific and conserved viral M1 proteins of both A/PR/8/34 and B/Lee/40 viruses were used to prepare polyclonal antisera for the development of an ELISA. The limits of detection of ELISAs for the detection of purified A/PR/8/34 and B/Lee/40 &#131;nviruses were 20&#131;&#221;g/mL &#131;nand 14 &#131;&#221;g/mL using polyclonal antibodies, and 30 &#131;&#221;g/mL and 20 &#131;&#221;g/mL for monoclonal antibodies, respectively. The limit for detection of each virus was 104 pfu/mL, irrespective of whether antisera or monoclonal antibodies were used for capture. Non-purified cell culture-grown preparations of either virus could be detected at 103 pfu/mL      The QCM utilised the same reagents used in ELISAs. However, a number of parameters were then further optimised to improve the sensitivity of the tests. These included blocking of non-specific binding, examination of the effects of flow-cell compression, the role of  pH, flow rate, antibody concentration and the addition of protein A to the crystal surfaces of the biosensor.       The lowest virus concentration that could be detected with the QCM was 104 pfu/mL for egg-grown preparations of both A/PR/8/34 and B/Lee/40, which could be detected within 30 min. However, conjugation of 13 nm gold nanoparticles to a second detector antibody resulted in a 10-fold increase in sensitivity and a detection limit of 103 pfu/mL that could be determined within 1 h. The direct detection of the influenza viruses in nasal samples was not possible by QCM because of the significant frequency fluctuation that was probably caused by the viscosity of the samples. Therefore, an additional culture step of 12 h was required, which increased the processing time to 2 days.      The QCM/nanoparticle method was shown to be as sensitive as the standard cell culture method, and the QCM method as sensitive as the shell vial method. The QCM and QCM/nanoparticle methods were shown to be 81 and 87% as sensitive and both were 100% as specific as the real-time polymerase chain reaction. However, for use in rapid diagnosis, improvements are required to remove frequency fluctuation resulting from the direct use of nasal samples.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">QCM sensors</field><field name="subject">influenza virus</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080516.160600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Girls, Empowerment and Education: a History of the Mac. Robertson Girls' High School 1905-2005</field><field name="creator">Parker, Pauline Frances</field><field name="description">Despite the considerable significance of publicly funded education in the making of Australian society, state school histories are few in number. In comparison, most corporate and private schools have cemented their sense of community and tradition through full-length publications. This history attempts to redress this imbalance. It is an important social history because this school, Mac.Robertson Girls' High School can trace its origins back to 1905, to the very beginnings of state secondary education when the Melbourne Continuation School (MCS), later Melbourne High School (MHS) and Melbourne Girls' high School (MGHS) was established.       Since it is now recognised that there are substantial state, regional and other differences between schools and their local communities, studies of individual schools are needed to underpin more general overviews of particular issues. This history, then, has wider significance: it traces strands of the development of girls' education in Victoria, thus examining the significance and dynamics of single-sex schooling, the education of girls more generally, and, importantly, girls' own experiences (and memories of experiences) of secondary schooling, as well as the meaning they made of those experiences.       'Girls, Education and Empowerment: A History of The Mac.Robertson Girls' High School 1905-2005', departs from traditional models of school history writing that tend to focus on the decision-makers and bureaucrats in education as well as documenting the most 'successful' former students who have made their mark in the world. Drawing on numerous narrative sources and documentary evidence, this history is organised thematically to contextualise and examine what is was like, and meant, to be a girl at this school (Melbourne Continuation School 1905-12; Melbourne High School 1912-27; Melbourne Girls' High School 1927-34, and Mac.Robertson Girls' High School from 1934) during a century of immense social, economic, political and educational change.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History of Education</field><field name="subject">girls' education-Australia</field><field name="subject">state secondary schools-Victoria</field><field name="subject">high schools-girls</field><field name="subject">oral history</field><field name="subject">women's history</field><field name="subject">social history-Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080516.164340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Congestion Removal in the Next Generation Internet</field><field name="creator">Suryasaputra, Robert</field><field name="description">The ongoing development of new and demanding Internet applications requires the Internet to deliver better service levels that are significantly better than the best effort service that the Internet currently provides and was built for. These improved service levels include guaranteed delays, jitter and bandwidth. Through extensive research into Quality of Service and Differentiated Service (DiffServ) it has become possible to provide guaranteed services, however this turns out to be inadequate without the application of Traffic Engineering methodologies and principles. Traffic Engineering is an integral part of network operation. Its major goal is to deliver the best performance from an existing service provider's network resources and, at the same time, to enhance a customers' view of network performance.   In this thesis, several different traffic engineering methods for optimising the operation of native IP and IP networks employing MPLS are proposed. A feature of these new methods is their fast run times and this opens the way to making them suitable for application in an online traffic engineering environment. For native IP networks running shortest path based routing protocols, we show that an LP-based optimisation based on the well known multi-commodity flow problem can be effective in removing network congestion. Having realised that Internet service providers are now moving towards migrating their networks to the use of MPLS, we have also formulated optimisation methods to traffic engineer MPLS networks by selecting suitable routing paths and utilising the feature of explicit routing contained in MPLS.   Although MPLS is capable of delivering traffic engineering across different classes of traffic, network operators still prefer to rely on the proven and simple IP based routing protocols for best effort traffic and only use MPLS to route traffic requiring special forwarding treatment. Based on this fact, we propose a method that optimises the routing patterns applicable to different classes of traffic based on their bandwidth requirements.   A traffic engineering comparison study that evaluates the performance of a neural network-based method for MPLS networks and LP-based weight setting approach for shortest path based networks has been performed using a well-known open source network simulator, called ns2. The comparative evaluation is based upon the packet loss probability. The final chapter of the thesis describes the software development of a network management application called OptiFlow which integrates techniques described in earlier chapters including the LP-based weight setting optimisation methodology; it also uses traffic matrix estimation techniques that are required as input to the weight setting models that have been devised. The motivation for developing OptiFlow was to provide a prototype set of tools that meet the congestion management needs of networking industries (ISPs and telecommunications companies - telcos).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Routing</field><field name="subject">traffic engineering</field><field name="subject">IP Networks</field><field name="subject">Multi-protocol Label Switching</field><field name="subject">Shortest paths</field><field name="subject">Linear Programming</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080521.114723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Why alcohol and drug treatment workers smoke cigarettes.</field><field name="creator">Stephens, Raymond Peter</field><field name="description">A grounded theory approach was used to explore the reasons why staff who work in alcohol and drug treatment services smoke cigarettes.   Eleven in-depth interviews were conducted with staff in Victoria across a variety of service types and roles.  Data gathered from the interviews were analysed and grouped into categories.  From analysis of the interviews it appeared that cigarette smoking is given legitimacy in the alcohol and drug treatment field that reinforces its place in these services.  Legitimacy was evident in three main ways - Permission, a Therapeutic Tool and Rewards.   Permission to smoke was communicated by means which included the opportunity to smoke at work, the provision of smoking areas, the absence of no-smoking rules and policies, and an acceptance of smoking.    Smoking was seen as a therapeutic tool that enhanced the treatment provided to clients.  Some smokers saw cigarettes as a tool to convey empathy, develop rapport, promote a feeling of engagement and manage difficult clients.     Smokers also received some rewards to reinforce their behaviour.  There was a benefit of feeling an increased acceptance by other staff, increased socialising, work breaks, a reduction in perceived stress levels and the opportunity to readily satisfy cravings for nicotine that reinforced the smoking behaviour.   Punishments, or negative rewards, for smoking were also described.  These included being recipients of harassment or pressure from non-smoking staff and concerns about the impact of smoking on their health.   These three categories of permission, therapeutic tool and rewards contribute to the legitimacy of smoking in this field and support the continued presence of this behaviour.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Smoking</field><field name="subject">alcohol</field><field name="subject">drug</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">tobacco</field><field name="subject">cigarettes</field><field name="subject">workplace</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080521.122401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Dance of Compliance: Performance Management in Australian Universities</field><field name="creator">Stavretis, Lyn</field><field name="description">This qualitative study identified the formal and informal performance management (PM) practices in use in Australian public universities for academic staff Levels A, B and C.  It asked the following research questions.   &#149;	What PM practices are currently in use in these universities?   &#149;	What are the similarities in approach and what issues does PM raise?   &#149;	How do academic staff who take part in these practices (as either staff or management) experience them?   &#149;	What cultural and contextual factors (if any) contribute to this experience?   &#149;	What are the perceived effects of these practices on the performance of individuals, teams and the organisation?   &#149;	Which system elements do academic staff and academic managers perceive to be most effective in academic cultures and why?   The context of substantive change within Australian universities was outlined and literature pertaining to the field of PM in general, and in educational organisations in particular, was explored.   The existence, structure, purposes and other factual details of formal PM systems were identified, although the study focused on the opinions, perceptions and attitudes of the respondents.   Findings suggested that current PM practice in Australian public universities did little to meet the needs of any of the key stakeholders and remained fundamentally unsatisfying to all concerned.   Furthermore, the failure to clearly articulate the purposes and to consider the implementation and ongoing costs of a formal PM system typically resulted in widespread cynicism and a ritual dance of compliance that demonstrated palpably low engagement with systems.   Formal PM systems helped to clarify objectives and workload allocation for some staff, but were found to be poorly linked to organisational planning processes, poor at differentiating levels of performance, not valued by academic staff as a vehicle for meaningful feedback, failing to follow through on development outcomes and thus did little to build team, individual or organisational capability.   Study recommendations suggested that developmental models of PM were more appropriate and acceptable in academia and that considerable work would be required to incorporate evaluative links such as performance-related pay successfully.   More rigorous evaluation, consultation processes regarding user preferences, piloting of PM systems prior to full implementation, and dedicated resources for the PM function and its outcomes (such as staff development), would be required as a part of a comprehensive change management strategy to overcome historical resistance.   A thorough capability analysis of the people management skills for Heads of School and above was seen as a priority, given that feedback skill and the management of under-performance were consistently identified as problematic. The costs of under-performance warranted this expenditure.   A national evaluation study of PM practice in higher education was recommended to assess the real outcomes, costs and benefits and determine whether continued investment in PM systems was actually merited.   Alternative models and approaches such as modular PM systems for the different stages of an academic career, promotion portfolios, reflective practice or peer learning groups were suggested as potentially more successful in enhancing the accountability and performance of academic staff than mandated hierarchical PM.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Performance appraisal</field><field name="subject">performance management</field><field name="subject">performance management systems</field><field name="subject">Australian universities</field><field name="subject">Academic staff</field><field name="subject">Human resource management.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080521.123556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Information and Communication Technologies in Knowledge Management: From Enabler to Facilitator</field><field name="creator">Song, Hongli</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the role of Information and communication technology (ICT) in support of effective knowledge management. Based on a comprehensive literature review, a knowledge management framework was developed for investigating the role of ICT in support of knowledge management. The framework not only centers on the dynamics of knowledge objects and processes, but also focuses on the impact of the internal knowledge management environment where organizational, managerial, structural, cultural and other related elements are intertwined and interplayed.      Based on this research framework, two sets of hypotheses were proposed for testing: (a) whether ICT enables and facilitates conversions between knowledge objects and knowledge management processes, and (b) whether the internal knowledge management environment impacts the effective implementation of knowledge management projects. To test the hypotheses, a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methodologies including theoretical induction, continuous literature review, secondary data analysis, and the conduct of an online questionnaire survey and a case study was adopted in this study.      The empirical findings were drawn from the secondary data analysis, case study and questionnaire survey. A questionnaire survey and a case study were conducted to obtain empirical data for testing and validating research hypotheses. To obtain a better understanding of current knowledge management best practices, secondary data were gathered and analyzed. In order to investigate the conversion processes of knowledge objects, an online survey was used to explore the experience, perceptions and opinions of respondents in the use of electronic resources at an individual level. To identify the factors that can determine success or failure in implementing knowledge management projects, a case study involving the pilot implementation of a knowledge portal was undertaken for collecting and analyzing empirical evidence from the field.      The empirical findings confirm the ICT's enabling role in knowledge management. The results of this study further suggest that the conversion processes between data and information are fully supported by ICT, whereas the conversion processes between data and knowledge, and the conversion processes between information and knowledge are only partially supported by ICT. While knowledge codification and dissemination are increasingly supported by ICT, supportive technology for knowledge generation and application remains much less effective. The critical success factors impacting the implementation of knowledge management projects include organizational, structural, strategical, managerial, and cultural elements. These interlocking elements form the internal knowledge management environment in an organization.      This study provides theoretical contributions by better understanding the nature of knowledge, the relationship between ICT and knowledge management, and the relationship between knowledge management and internal knowledge management environment. It also provides a contribution relevant to practitioners by developing a novel knowledge management framework, which can be used as a guideline of knowledge management efforts.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">knowledge management</field><field name="subject">Information and communication technology</field><field name="subject">electronic resources</field><field name="subject">knowledge portal</field><field name="subject">data</field><field name="subject">information</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080521.150600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Federated Text Retrieval from Independent Collections</field><field name="creator">Shokouhi, Milad</field><field name="description">Federated information retrieval is a technique for searching multiple text collections simultaneously. Queries are submitted to a subset of collections that are most likely to return relevant answers. The results returned by selected collections are integrated and merged into a single list. Federated search is preferred over centralized search alternatives in many environments. For example, commercial search engines such as Google cannot index uncrawlable hidden web collections; federated information retrieval systems can search the contents of hidden web collections without crawling. In enterprise environments, where each organization maintains an independent search engine, federated search techniques can provide parallel search over multiple collections.   There are three major challenges in federated search. For each query, a subset of collections that are most likely to return relevant documents are selected. This creates the collection selection problem. To be able to select suitable collections, federated information retrieval systems acquire some knowledge about the contents of each collection, creating the collection representation problem. The results returned from the selected collections are merged before the final presentation to the user. This final step is the result merging problem.   In this thesis, we propose new approaches for each of these problems. Our suggested methods, for collection representation, collection selection, and result merging, outperform state-of-the-art techniques in most cases. We also propose novel methods for estimating the number of documents in collections, and for pruning unnecessary information from collection representations sets.   Although management of document duplication has been cited as one of the major problems in federated search, prior research in this area often assumes that collections are free of overlap. We investigate the effectiveness of federated search on overlapped collections, and propose new methods for maximizing the number of distinct relevant documents in the final merged results.   In summary, this thesis introduces several new contributions to the field of federated information retrieval, including practical solutions to some historically unsolved problems in federated search, such as document duplication management. We test our techniques on multiple testbeds that simulate both hidden web and enterprise search environments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Federated search</field><field name="subject">distributed information retrieval</field><field name="subject">federated text retrieval</field><field name="subject">metasearch</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080521.151632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Superflatworlds: A Topography of Takashi Murakami and the Cultures of Superflat Art</field><field name="creator">Sharp, Kristen</field><field name="description">This thesis maps Takashi Murakami's Theory of Superflat Art and his associated artistic practices and works. The study situates Murakami and Superflat within the context of globalising culture. The thesis interrogates Murakami's art and the theory of superflat within the historical, social, and cultural contexts of their production-consumption in Japan, the United States, and Europe. The thesis identifies Superflat art and Murakami's work as actively participating in, and expressing, the cultural conditions associated with the 'global postmodern' and globalisation processes. The thesis employs a Cultural Studies theoretical and heuristic framework, utilising a range of contemporary critical theorisations on postmodern art, Japanese cultural identity and globalisation. This framework and approach are adopted in order to draw attention to ways in which Murakami and Superflat articulate and represent the fundamental contentions and dialogues that characterise contem porary globalisation processes. The tensions that are articulated in relation to the discursive construction of the concepts of art/commodity, modern/postmodern and global/local cultural identities.       Importantly, this research demonstrates the ways in which Murakami both participates in, and challenges, the conceptual distinctions indexed within the concepts of 'art' as an aesthetic expression and 'commodity' as an object of symbolic exchange in the global marketplace. It interprets Superflat as an 'expressivity' that challenges binary demarcations being constructed between art and commercial culture, and between the aesthetic-cultural identities of Japan and the West. This thesis problematises the meaning of Murakami's concept and aesthetic of Superflat art by drawing attention to these contestations within Murakami's works and Superflat which are generated as they circulate globally.       The thesis argues that Murakami strategically presents his work and Superflat art as an expression of Japanese identity which paradoxically also expresses the fluid imaginings of cultural identity available through contemporary global exchanges. This deliberate territorialising and deterritorialising impulse does not resolve the contentions emerging in globalisation, but rather amplifies them, exposing the key debates on the formation of cultural identity as an oppositional expression and as a commodity in global markets. The concept of 'strategic essentialism' is used as a theoretical lens in order to understand Murakami and Superflat's activation of these global processes. This research contributes a valuable case study to the understanding of cultural production as a strategic negotiation and expression of the flows of capital and culture in globalisation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Takashi Murakami</field><field name="subject">Superflat</field><field name="subject">contemporary Japanese art</field><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="subject">national-cultural identity</field><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">commodification</field><field name="subject">strategic essentialism.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080522.093156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationships Between the Ethnic Kyrgyz and Uzbeks on the Border Zone in the Ferghana Valley During the Transition</field><field name="creator">Sawut, Nurgul</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of interethnic relationships between the ethnic Uzbek and Kyrgyz on the eastern edge of the Ferghana Valley, the cross-border zone between Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, from independence to 2005. It argues that strong ethnic tension between the ethnic Uzbek and Kyrgyz was present during 'the Yellow Revolution' and the Andijan massacre in that year.      The economically dominant ethnic Uzbeks in southern Kyrgyzstan played a role in initiating the opposition due to ongoing political marginalization by the government, while the opposition appealed to Kyrgyz ethno-nationalism and failed to draw wider political support from the Uzbeks or other minorities. As a result, there the ethnic minorities' lines were divided into pro-Akaev and pro-Revolution group. In the case of the Andijan massacre, the Uzbek government, after the arrival of the Uzbek asylum seekers into Kyrgyzstan territory on the eastern edge of the Ferghana Valley, had stirred latent fears amongst local Kyrgyz through their propaganda broadcasting. The economically marginalized ethnic Kyrgyz on the Kyrgyzstan side of the Uzbek-Kyrgyz border on the eastern edge of the Ferghana Valley had subsequently turned against the refugees and the tension was not alleviated until the refugees were moved to Romania by UNHCR.       Both cases exhibit that the ethnic tension between these titular ethnic groups has deeper roots, which could be taken back to the pre-1991 Soviet era. A range of dynamics affect interethnic relations: (1) the potential for harmonious relations between the ethnic Uzbeks and Kyrgyz has been reduced by the rise of 'pure Uzbek' and 'pure Kyrgyz' ethnic-nationalism among these two ethnic communities in their newly created states; (2) a new economic aspect of the ethnic tension has arisen since 1991 in both eastern Uzbekistan and southern Kyrgyzstan as a result of the ethnic Uzbeks dominating the local economy in southern Kyrgyzstan; and (3) clan networks have strongly influenced the flow of post-independence politics.      The revival of Islam and fundamentalist and radical ideologies, before and after independence had added complexity to the ethnic Uzbek and Kyrgyz relationships in the Ferghana Valley. Initially democratic nationalists and Islamic nationalists shared some goals, but this commonality faded as Islamic groups became to be seen as a critic and a threat to the Uzbek government and were subsequently banned. The ethnic Uzbeks express more religiosity than the ethnic Kyrgyz, while the majority of the supporters of Islamic fundamentalism and radicalism are the Uzbeks and a smaller number of ethnic Kyrgyz supporters.      The failure of post-independence economic transitions of both countries have deepened rural poverty in eastern Uzbekistan and southern Kyrgyzstan, and gradually created collective poverty on the Uzbek-Kyrgyz border zone on the eastern edge of the Ferghana Valley. The ethnic Kyrgyz have been victimized by the deepening rural poverty on both sides of the border. As a result, creation of 'poorer Kyrgyz' vs. 'richer Uzbeks' dynamic has sharpened the conflict between these two ethnicities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Central Asia</field><field name="subject">Kyrgyzstan</field><field name="subject">Uzbekistan</field><field name="subject">'Yellow Revolution</field><field name="subject">Andijan massacre</field><field name="subject">poverty and ethnic conflict</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080522.145910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vibration absorption in the tennis grip and the effects on racquet dynamics</field><field name="creator">Savage, Nicholas James</field><field name="description">The modern game of tennis has changed in recent years as a result of lightweight, stiffer racquets. The evolution of the tennis racquet, with respect to both design and materials, has increased the speed of the game but also the levels of stress placed on the player's bodies. Many believe that injuries such as lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) are caused and aggravated by the absorption of racquet energy by the player, in the form of shock and vibration. This thesis presents an experimental investigation into the absorption of racquet vibration to the player's hand and forearm.      Quantification of the tennis grip has been achieved in this research using different experimental techniques to analyse different aspects of the tennis grip. Grip pressure distribution profiles during impact have been established using both pressure sensitive film and real-time data acquisition methods. Quantification of grip tightness during impact, together with gripping times, has also been quantified using a strain gauge cantilever system manufactured specifically for this research. The experimental data acquired in this research has provided the base for grip pressure distribution profiles to be established for three stroke types (e.g. Forehand, service and the problematic backhand). The profiles depict the distribution of pressure in the tennis grip in relation to the ball impact, in the time domain. Based on these grip profiles, the research hypothesises hand movements in an attempt to establish muscle contractions (and moreover locations of vibration absorption) specific to stroke types.      The research investigates the absorption of racquet vibrations by the player's hand in the time domain. Filtering of accelerometer data allows for the isolation of specific frequencies of interest (i.e. below 200Hz). Logarithmic decrement of racquet vibration has been calculated and related to the grip pressure distributions in the time domain, and the relationship between grip pressure and vibration damping has been modelled. The correlation between grip pressure and the logarithmic decrement has been show to be significant (p less than 0.005) and non-linear. The relationship between the tennis grip and the damping of racquet vibrations has been found to be dependant on both grip pressure and the proximity of grip pressure application in proximity to the handle node. Grip pressure applied to the racquet close to the handle node has a greater damping effect than a similar pressure further away.      In addition to these key research findings, the effectiveness of a piezoelectric racquet damping system is also investigated. A comprehensive modal analysis of two tennis racquets is given with further ball impact tests. The ball impact tests showed that the damping system has a 28% difference in racquet vibrations during freely suspended grip conditions. However, under hand-held grip conditions the inclusion of grip damping into the system provides a much greater damping entity (880% greater). Therefore, the effect of the piezoelectric system was deemed to be negligible.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vibration</field><field name="subject">tennis</field><field name="subject">absorption</field><field name="subject">damping</field><field name="subject">grip</field><field name="subject">logarithmic decrement</field><field name="subject">lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow).</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080522.153134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HDR Brachytherapy: Improved Methods of Implementation and Quality Assurance</field><field name="creator">Toye, Warren</field><field name="description">This thesis describes experimental work performed (1998-2001) during the author's involvement with the Brachytherapy group at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (PMCC), where he was employed by its Department of Physical Sciences and subsequent modeling and analytical studies. When PMCC added HDR brachytherapy to its radiation therapy practice, an existing operating suite was considered the ideal location for such procedures to be carried out. The integration of brachytherapy into the theatre environment was considered logical due to the relatively invasive nature of brachytherapy techniques and the availability of medical equipment. This thesis contains the detailed study of three key Research Questions involved in clinical aspects relating to quality assurance of an HDR brachytherapy practice. An investigative chapter is dedicated to the pursuit of each of the Research Questions.      The first question asked&#133; Is the novel approach to using modular shielding combined with time and distance constraints adequately optimized during HDR brachytherapy? In order to establish optimal clinical practices, this project evaluates the effectiveness of additional shielding added to the modular shielding system without modification of the previously determined time and distance constraints for PMCC staff, other patients, and member of the public. The DOSXYZnrc user code for the EGSnrc Monte Carlo radiation transport code has been used to model exposure pathways to strategic locations used for measurement in and around the operating theatre suite. Modeling allowed exposure pathways to various areas with the facility to be tested without the need to use real sources.      The second Research Question asked&#133; How well is dose anisotropy characterized in the near field range of the clinic's HDR 192Ir source? This study experimentally investigated the anisotropy of dose around a 192Ir HDR source in a water phantom using MOSFETs as relative dosimeters. In addition, modeling using the DOSRZnrc user code for the EGSnrc Monte Carlo radiation transport code was performed to provide a complete dose distribution consistent with the MOSFET measurements. Measurements performed for radial distances from 5 to 30 mm extend the range of measurements to 5 mm which has not been previously reported for this source construction.      The third Research Question is aimed at the patient level. Is the dose delivered to in vivo dosimeters, located within critical anatomical structures near the prostate, within acceptable clinical tolerance for a large group of HDR prostate patients? An in vivo dosimetry technique employing TLDs to experimentally measure doses delivered to the urethra and rectum during HDR prostate brachytherapy was investigated. Urethral and rectal in vivo measurements for 56 patients have been performed in the initial fraction of four-fraction brachytherapy boost. In the absence of comparable in vivo data, the following local corrective action level was initially proposed: more than 50% of the prostatic urethra receiving a dose 10% beyond the urethral tolerance. The level for investigative action is considered from the analyses of dose differences between measured data and TPS calculation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HDR brachytherapy</field><field name="subject">MOSFET</field><field name="subject">TLD</field><field name="subject">anisotropy</field><field name="subject">Monte Carlo</field><field name="subject">shielding</field><field name="subject">prostate</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080528.091630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate Ownership, Equity Agency Costs and Dividend Policy: An Empirical Analysis</field><field name="creator">Truong, Thanh</field><field name="description">Equity agency costs are important to the firm and the management of these costs is a critical element of corporate governance, yet empirical research that focuses on the magnitude and impact of agency costs is limited. This thesis sets out to furnish empirical evidence in the area of corporate ownership with a particular focus on the magnitude of equity agency costs as well as the relation that exists between the largest shareholder in a firm and equity agency costs and between the largest shareholder and the dividend policy that a firm adopts.     This thesis provides an empirical analysis of the effect of corporate ownership, together with other governance mechanisms on equity agency conflicts for the largest 500 Australian listed firms. The results from this analysis provide strong support for the view that equity agency costs are related to corporate ownership. Specifically, there is evidence of a significant non-linear relation between inside ownership and the proxies for agency costs. Further, the results demonstrate that other governance mechanisms, particularly board size, board leadership and short-term debt financing, are effective in improving the use of firm assets, yet they do not seem to restrain firm management from incurring excessive discretionary operating expenses.    This thesis also extends the investigation of the corporate ownership-equity agency cost relation by focusing on the largest shareholder for 9,165 listed firms drawn from 43 countries around the world. The results suggest that cross-sectional variation in equity agency costs can be partly attributable to corporate ownership. Specifically, there is evidence of a statistically significant non-linear relation between the shareholding of the largest shareholder and the agency cost proxies. The type of the largest shareholder, i.e. whether the largest shareholder is an insider or a financial institution, is also important in analysis of this relation. Further, debt financing, dividend policy and legal origin vary in their impact on the agency cost proxies.       This thesis also investigates the interaction between the largest shareholder and dividend policy for 8,279 listed firms drawn from 37 countries around the world. Consistent with previous studies, the results suggest that firms are more likely to pay dividends when profitability is high, debt is low, investment opportunities are limited, or when the largest shareholder is not an insider. It is also apparent that largest shareholding and dividend payout are related and that, consistent with the extant literature, legal system does matter in dividend policy decisions.   Together, the results imply that equity agency costs vary with corporate ownership though this relation remains, of course, the subject of continuing investigation in finance. A major contribution of this thesis is demonstrating that corporate ownership, particularly the largest shareholder, plays a pivotal role in controlling agency costs. Accordingly, this suggests the following policy implication: by improving the legal environment and regulatory constraints imposed on large shareholders as well as legal protection for minority shareholders, the efficiency gains generated from large shareholder control can be translated into higher firm valuation to the benefit of all shareholders in the firm.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate Governance</field><field name="subject">Corporate Ownership</field><field name="subject">Equity Agency Costs</field><field name="subject">Dividend Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080528.094747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical Modelling of Turbulent Gas-Particle Flow and Its Applications</field><field name="creator">Tian, Zhaofeng</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is three-fold: i) to investigate the performance of both the Eulerian-Lagrangian model and the Eulerian-Eulerian model to simulate the turbulent gas-particle flow; ii) to investigate the indoor airflows and contaminant particle flows using the Eulerian-Lagrangian model; iii) to develop and validate particle-wall collision models and a wall roughness model for the Eulerian-Lagrangian model and to utilize these models to investigate the effects of wall roughness on the particle flows.      Firstly, the Eulerian-Lagrangian model in the software package FLUENT (FLUENT Inc.) and the Eulerian-Eulerian model in an in-house research code were employed to simulate the gas-particle flows. The validation against the measurement for two-phase flow over backward facing step and in a 90-degree bend revealed that both CFD approaches provide reasonably good prediction for both the gas and particle phases.       Then, the Eulerian-Lagrangian model was employed to investigate the indoor airflows and contaminant particle concentration in two geometrically different rooms. For the first room configuration, the performances of three turbulence models for simulating indoor airflow were evaluated and validated against the measured air phase velocity data. All the three turbulence models provided good prediction of the air phase velocity, while the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model base on the Renormalization Group theory (RNG) provided the best agreement with the measurements. As well, the RNG LES model is able to provide the instantaneous air velocity and turbulence that are required for the evaluation and design of the ventilation system. In the other two-zone ventilated room configuration, contaminant particle concentration decay within the room was simulated and validated against the experimental data using the RNG LES model together with the Lagrangian model. The numerical results revealed that the particle-wall coll ision model has a considerable effect on the particle concentration prediction in the room.      This research culminates with the development and implementation of particle-wall collision models and a stochastic wall roughness model in the Eulerian-Lagrangian model. This Eulerian-Lagrangian model was therefore used to simulate the gas-particle flow over an in-line tube bank. The numerical predictions showed that the wall roughness has a considerable effect by altering the rebounding behaviours of the large particles and consequently affecting the particles motion downstream along the in-line tube bank and particle impact frequency on the tubes. Also, the results demonstrated that for the large particles the particle phase velocity fluctuations are not influenced by the gas-phase fluctuations, but are predominantly determined by the particle-wall collision. For small particles, the influence of particle-wall collisions on the particle fluctuations can be neglected. Then, the effects of wall roughness on the gas-particle flow in a two-dimensional 90-degree bend were investigated. It was found that the wa ll roughness considerably altered the rebounding behaviours of particles by significantly reducing the 'particle free zone' and smoothing the particle number density profiles. The particle mean velocities were reduced and the particle fluctuating velocities were increased when taking into consideration the wall roughness, since the wall roughness produced greater randomness in the particle rebound velocities and trajectories.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CFD</field><field name="subject">gas-particle flows</field><field name="subject">indoor air and particle flow</field><field name="subject">particle-wall collision model</field><field name="subject">wall roughness model</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080528.150211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling Commodity Prices in The Australian National Electricity Market</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Stuart John</field><field name="description">Beginning in the early 1990s several countries, including Australia, have pursued programs of deregulation and restructuring of their electricity supply industries. Dissatisfaction with state-run monopoly suppliers and a desire for increased competition and choice for consumers have been the major motivations for reform. In Australia, the historical, vertically-integrated, government-owned electricity authorities were separated into separate generation, transmission, distribution and retail sectors in each State and a competitive, wholesale market for electricity, the National Electricity Market (NEM) began operation in December 1998.    The goal of deregulation was (and remains) increased competition in electricity supply, so that consumers may enjoy wider choice and lower prices.  The first benefit has largely been delivered but it is arguable whether the second benefit of lower prices has been realised. Increased competition has come at the price of increased wholesale price volatility, which brings with it increased cost as market participants seek to trade profitably and manage the increase in price risk.  In the NEM, generators compete to sell into a pool market and distributors purchase electricity from the pool at prices determined by demand and supply, on a half-hourly basis. These market-clearing prices can be extremely volatile.     Electricity prices are generally characterised by significant seasonal patterns, on an intra-day, weekly and monthly basis, as demand and supply conditions vary. Prices are also characterised by strong mean-reversion and extremely high spikes in price. While long-run mean prices typically range between $30 and $45 per megawatt hour, prices can spike to levels above $9,000 or $10,000 per megawatt hour from time to time. These spikes tend to be sporadic and very short-lived, rarely lasting for more than an hour or two. Although infrequent, spikes are the major contributor to price volatility and their evolution and causes need to be investigated and understood.    The purpose of this thesis is to investigate and model Australian electricity prices. The research work presented is mostly empirical, with the early analytical chapters focusing on investigating the presence and significance of seasonal factors and spikes in electricity price and demand. In subsequent chapters this work is extended into analysis of the underlying volatility processes and the interaction between extreme values in demand and price is specifically investigated.  The findings of the thesis are that while the characteristics of strong seasonal patterns and spikes that are generally observed in similar electricity markets are present in the NEM in both price and demand, there is significant variation in their presence and effect between the regional pools. The study also finds that while time-varying volatility is evident in the price series there is again some variation in the way this is characterised between states. A further finding challenges the accepted wisdom that demand peaks drive price  spikes at the extremes and shows empirically that price spikes are more likely to be caused by supply disruptions than extremes of demand. The findings provide useful insight into this highly idiosyncratic but economically important national market.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electricity</field><field name="subject">Microstructure</field><field name="subject">Seasonalities</field><field name="subject">Outliers</field><field name="subject">GARCH</field><field name="subject">Event Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080528.160806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resilience in Australian Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Adolescents</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Helen</field><field name="description">Resilience (positive adaptation despite exposure to risk or adversity) is a widely researched construct, yet it has not been examined systematically with Australian Indigenous adolescents despite their high level of risk. Indigenous adolescents experience disproportionate disadvantage and associated poorer health and well-being compared with their non-Indigenous peers. Thus the protective factors or predictors of resilience that ameliorate the negative effects of risk in this subgroup are important to explore. Adolescence is a critical period for examining resilience given the increased vulnerability to mental health problems during this time.    Of interest to this thesis are the psychosocial predictors of resilience (protective factors), which act to ameliorate the negative effects of stress. Three widely established protective factors were examined: Coping skills, social support, and multidimensional self-concept.    These protective factors were compared in a sample of 304 Australian non-Indigenous (n = 245) and Indigenous (n = 59) adolescents, aged 12-18 years. Using a methodological framework developed for this study resilience was assessed by examining stress (negative stressful life events and daily hassles) and adaptation (internalising, externalising and other mental health symptoms).   Participants were classified into four resilience groups based on their stress (high or low) and adaptation (positive or negative): resilient (high stress, positive adaptation), negative expected (high stress, negative adaptation), positive expected (low stress, positive adaptation), or poor copers (low stress, negative adaptation). Results were examined separately for non-Indigenous and Indigenous participants. The two cultural groups were then compared.    Results revealed that higher stress was strongly associated with more internalising, externalising and other mental health problems. The impact of daily hassles was a strong predictor of adaptation, particularly for Indigenous participants. Indigenous participants reported higher levels of stress and more negative adaptation than non-Indigenous participants.    Three coping methods were examined: Solving the Problem, Reference to Others and Non-Productive coping. Solving the Problem coping was a strong predictor of positive adaptation and resilience for non-Indigenous adolescents but not for Indigenous adolescents. No cultural differences in Solving the Problem coping were revealed. Reference to Others was found to be a maladaptive coping method in relation to resilience. Non-Productive coping (e.g., avoidance and substance use) was also found to be maladaptive, and used more by Indigenous than non-Indigenous participants.   Social support only predicted resilience for non-Indigenous participants in conditions of very high stress. Contrary to expectations, social support did not discriminate among the Indigenous resilience groups and no significant cultural differences were revealed. Self-concept was strongly related to resilience and positive adaptation for non-Indigenous participants, although not for Indigenous participants. Cultural comparisons, however, revealed that positive self-concept was associated with positive adaptation for both groups. While differences between non-Indigenous and Indigenous participants on several self-concept domains were revealed, the total self-concept of non-Indigenous and Indigenous participants did not differ.    The results of this study revealed both similarities and differences in the relationships between the three predictors investigated and the resilience of non-Indigenous and Indigenous adolescents. The findings make some progress toward informing culturally appropriate interventions to promote and strengthen the resilience of Indigenous young people.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adolescents</field><field name="subject">Indigenous</field><field name="subject">Resilience</field><field name="subject">Stress</field><field name="subject">Coping</field><field name="subject">Social Support</field><field name="subject">Self-Concept</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080528.161807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A young nomad's guide to new digital terrains</field><field name="creator">Satchell, Christine</field><field name="description">In the early twenty first century, the mobile phone plays an integral role in helping young people shape their identity and achieve social goals.

Automatic speaker recognition is when a person's voice is analysed by a machine and the person's identity is worked out by the comparison of speech features to a known set of speech features. Automatic speaker verification is when a person claims an identity and the machine determines if that claimed identity is correct or whether that person is an impostor.   	Channel distortion occurs whenever information is sent electronically through any type of channel whether that channel is a basic wired telephone channel or a wireless channel. The types of distortion that can corrupt the information include time-variant or time-invariant filtering of the information or the addition of 'thermal noise' to the information, both of these types of distortion can cause varying degrees of error in information being received and analysed.   	The experiments presented in this thesis investigate the effects of channel distortion on the average speaker recognition rates and testing the effectiveness of various channel compensation algorithms designed to mitigate the effects of channel distortion.    The speaker recognition system was represented by a basic recognition algorithm consisting of: speech analysis, extraction of feature vectors in the form of the Mel-Cepstral Coefficients, and a classification part based on the minimum distance rule.   Two types of channel distortion were investigated:   &#149;	Convolutional (or lowpass filtering) effects   &#149;	Addition of white Gaussian noise   Three different methods of channel compensation were tested:    &#149;	Cepstral Mean Subtraction (CMS)   &#149;	RelAtive SpecTrAl (RASTA) Processing    &#149;	Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA)       The results from the experiments showed that for both CMS and RASTA processing that filtering at low cutoff frequencies, (3 or 4 kHz), produced improvements in the average speaker recognition rates compared to speech with no compensation. The levels of improvement due to RASTA processing were higher than the levels achieved due to the CMS method.    Neither the CMS or RASTA methods were able to improve accuracy of the speaker recognition system for cutoff frequencies of 5 kHz, 6 kHz or 7 kHz.   In the case of noisy speech all methods analysed were able to compensate for high SNR of 40 dB and 30 dB and only RASTA processing was able to compensate and improve the average recognition rate for speech corrupted with a high level of noise (SNR of 20 dB and 10 dB).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Speaker recognition</field><field name="subject">signal processing</field><field name="subject">speech processing</field><field name="subject">channel effects</field><field name="subject">channel compensation</field><field name="subject">channel equalisation</field><field name="subject">adaptive filtering</field><field name="subject">RelAtive SpecTral processing</field><field name="subject">RASTA</field><field name="subject">Cepstral Mean Subtraction</field><field name="subject">Constant Modulus Algorithm</field><field name="subject">speech filtering</field><field name="subject">Mel-Frequency Cepstral coefficients</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080514.093453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Domestic Transfer Pricing in Services: A Value Chain Framework</field><field name="creator">Terzioglu, Bulend</field><field name="description">The question of the management of the transfer process and transfer pricing is   an important one for managers and academics alike (Colbert and Spicer, 1995).   Yet, in general, our current knowledge on several aspects of transfer pricing   process is limited. One question which arises in relation to transfer pricing in   service organizations is whether there is an association between the transfer   price and the internal customer's perception of value emanating from the   transaction. An inappropriate transfer pricing system can give rise to a number of   adverse effects which can include among other things, maldistribution of   economic resources, negative motivation for reducing costs (Lesser, 1987), lack   of goal congruence and inequitable performance evaluation (Cravens and   Shearon, 1997).   The gap in the literature on transfer pricing in the service sector applies equally   in the Australian setting. This is despite the significant and increasing contribution   of the service sector to both GDP and employment.   The objective of this research is to explore the domestic transfer pricing practices   of service organisations in Australia with the emphasis placed on examining   whether, in internal transactions, the domestic transfer price had any influence on   the value perceived by the internal buyer. Because the extant transfer pricing   theories cannot explain the value perceived by the internal customer in internal   exchange of goods and services, an exploratory research methodology is   adopted and no assumptions are made about the relationship.   PDF created with pdfFactory trial version www.pdffactory.com   3   Data were gathered from survey responses from eighty service organisations   and thirteen face-to-face interviews. Survey data were sought at two levels.   Questions of a strategic nature were directed to corporate management while   questions pertinent to transfer pricing and value were sought from the divisional   management who are actually involved in such transfers. Exploratory factor   analysis was used to analyze the data.   The findings indicate that cost-based transfer pricing was the most preferred   method, and in internal transactions, and responsiveness of the internal supplier   was the key factor for internal buyers. The research found that service   organisations are external customer oriented and internal customer issues are   secondary. The research results also demonstrate that no significant association   exists between transfer pricing and internal customer perceived value.   The current research contributes to the transfer pricing literature by providing   insights to locus of transfer pricing decisions, transfer pricing methods employed   by service organizations in Australia, objectives of transfer pricing systems,   conflicts arising during from the transfer pricing process and the role of transfer   prices on the value perceived by internal customers. As a research topic, this   study is pioneering as it integrates for the first time, the constructs of transfer   price and value in internal transactions. Another unique feature of this research is   that it was carried out in another important but under-researched context of   service organisations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transfer process</field><field name="subject">transfer pricing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080529.150135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Aluminium Nitride and Titanium Vanadium Nitride Thin Films</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Matthew Bruce</field><field name="description">Thin film coatings are used to improve the properties of components and products in such diverse areas as tool coatings, wear resistant biological coatings, miniature integrated electronics, micro-mechanical systems and coatings for optical devices. This thesis focuses on understanding the development of intrinsic stress and microstructure in coatings of the technologically important materials of aluminium nitride (AlN) and titanium vanadium nitride (TiVN) deposited by filtered cathodic arc deposition.      Thin films of AlN are fabricated under a variety of substrate bias regimes and at different deposition rates. Constant substrate bias was found to have a significant effect on the stress and microstructure of AlN thin films. At low bias voltages, films form with low stress and no preferred orientation. At a bias voltage of -200 V, the films exhibited the highest compressive stress and contained crystals preferentially oriented with their c axis in the plane of the film. At the highest bias of -350 V, the film forms with low stress yet continue to contain crystallites with their c axis constrained to lie in the plane of the film. These microstructure changes with bias are explained in terms of an energy minimisation model.       The application of a pulsed high voltage bias to a substrate was found to have a strong effect on the reduction of intrinsic stress within AlN thin films. A model has been formulated that predicts the stress in terms of the applied voltage and pulsing rate, in terms of treated volumes known as thermal spikes. The greater the bias voltage and the higher the pulse rate, the greater the reduction in intrinsic stress. At high pulsing and bias rates, a strong preference for the c axis to align perpendicular to the substrate is seen. This observation is explained by dynamical effects of the incident ions on the growing film, encouraging channelling and preferential sputtering.   For the first time, the effect of the rate of growth on AlN films deposited with high voltage pulsed bias was investigated and found to significantly change the stress and microstructure. The formation of films with highly tensile stress, highly compressive stress and nano-composites of AlN films containing Al clusters were seen. These observations are explained in terms of four distinct growth regions. At low rates, surface diffusion and shadowing causes highly porous structures with tensile stress; increased rates produced Al rich films of low stress; increasing the growth rate further led to a dense AlN film under compressive stress and the highest rates produce dense, low stress, AlN due to increased levels of thermal annealing.      Finally this thesis analyses the feasibility of forming ternary alloys of high quality TiVN thin films using a dual cathode filtered cathodic arc. The synthesised films show exceptional hardness (greater than either titanium nitride or vanadium nitride), excellent mixing of the three elements and interesting optical properties. An optimum concentration of 23% V content was found to give the highest stress and hardness.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aluminium Nitride</field><field name="subject">Titanium Vanadium Nitride</field><field name="subject">Cathodic Arc</field><field name="subject">thin films</field><field name="subject">electron microscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080529.151820</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the impact of close-out netting on bank portfolios</field><field name="creator">Taranto, Aldo</field><field name="description">The stochastic volatility of daily foreign exchange (FX) derivatives poses a number of risks for the international banking community. Settlement risk, liquidity risk and capital adequacy are just a few immediate concerns that arise from such volatility. This thesis examines the impact of close-out netting on minimising the stochastic volatility of inter-bank FX derivatives. The problem with close-out netting is that although it is a simple formula of taking the differences between two banks at one point in time, it is the stochastic and volatile nature of FX rates that makes measuring the full impact of netting difficult.      The objective of this thesis is to establish a realistic international banking framework or modelling environment in which close-out netting can be scientifically applied and examined. Five international daily FX rates will be used as sufficient approximations for five international banks. A generalised autoregressive conditionally heteroschedastic (GARCH) modelling approach is adopted as a robust and rich FX volatility paradigm. Then through Monte Carlo simulation of the resulting fitted GARCH models, we generate the distributions -with and without close-out netting.      The findings of this thesis are interesting, showing that close-out netting is far more than just a simple mathematical process. Netting surely does reduce each bank's exposure to FX volatility, however, its multivariate nature reveals some important results for banking risk research and bank analysts.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Banking</field><field name="subject">capital adequacy</field><field name="subject">Monte Carlo</field><field name="subject">close-out</field><field name="subject">derivatives</field><field name="subject">exposure</field><field name="subject">foreign exchange</field><field name="subject">FX</field><field name="subject">GARCH</field><field name="subject">inter-bank</field><field name="subject">liquidity</field><field name="subject">netting</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">settlement</field><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="subject">stochastic</field><field name="subject">volatility.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080529.162733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sources Of Competitive Advantage For Emerging Fast Growth Small-To-Medium Enterprises: The Role Of Business Orientation, Marketing Capabilities, Customer Value, And Firm Performance</field><field name="creator">Tan, Caroline Swee Lin</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the influence of market, learning, and entrepreneurial orientation as sources of competitive advantage in fast-growth SMEs. It is taken that these three factors synergistically comprise an organization's business orientation, enhancing marketing capabilities and firm performance. In Australia, these firms tend to be emerging enterprises, usually less than 10 years of age, and comprise approximately 10% of all SMEs, contributing substantially to national revenue.      Two studies (Study 1 and Study 2) were incorporated, utilizing a sequential explanatory design, which is characterized by undertaking quantitative data collection and analysis (path modelling), prior to conducting qualitative research (case studies/causal network modelling).      Study 1 reveals that business orientations are significant antecedents to marketing capabilities. Accordingly, firms leverage advantages associated with a business orientation to strengthen their marketing capabilities. While superior marketing capabilities are important drivers of performance, these capabilities also mediate relationships between business orientation and performance. Without such capabilities, it appears that firm market, entrepreneurial and learning orientations provide little value to attainment of desired performance objectives. Fast growth SMEs invest in maintaining sound relationships with distributors and developing superior products/services for positional advantages. However, only product/service development capabilities contribute significantly to firm performance. Although Relationship Capabilities are related positively with Shared Vision (learning orientation) and Proactiveness (entrepreneurial orientation), this marketing capability dimension displays nonsignificant relationshi ps with performance measures. This finding suggests that even though FGF employees might have sound relationships with distributors/retailers, Relationship Capabilities are not a direct contributor to subjective measures of firm profitability, ROI, ROE, customer satisfaction, new product success, and overall marketing effectiveness, confirming that positional advantage does not necessarily lead to enhanced firm performance. In addition, marketing research, marketing management, marketing communications, and pricing are nonsignificant contributors within the context of the present hypothesized model.       Study 2 extends the hypothesized model originating from Study 1. Based on an inductive analysis of case studies, qualitative findings reveal four significant qualities specific to these organizations: Leadership/CEO characteristics, human resource practices, organizational culture, and organizational climate. These characteristics can be regarded as intangible resources associated with fast-growth firms. These attributes appear to be significant antecedents to business orientation, marketing capabilities, customer value, and firm performance. Customer value features prominently. This model is also nonrecursive: firm performance sends a signal to potential employees and customers, impacting human resource related issues such as staff motivation, rewards, and recruitment. Successful firms tend to attract highly talented employees because potential staff want to be associated with winning enterprises. Information generated and disseminated from the renewal process adds new knowledge to superior organizational r esources, making the process nonrecursive.      Perhaps, more importantly, Study 2 reveals that fast-growth companies seem to have an uncanny ability to remain ahead, preventing competitors from surreptitiously entering their markets. It might sound as a clich&#233;, however, but these organizations appear to possess a commitment to customer centricity for at least some period of time, retaining customers by developing new products which continue to serve current customers as they change what they value.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fast-growth firms</field><field name="subject">competitive advantage</field><field name="subject">customer value</field><field name="subject">marketing capabilities</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080530.094224</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Students' Approaches To Learning: A Case Study of Learning Biology in Foundation    Studies at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology.</field><field name="creator">Varughese, Varughese Kuzhumannil</field><field name="description">The large influx of international students to universities of the developed world, the increased use of Problem-Based method of teaching and learning in the field of Health Education and growing awareness of the need to accommodate varying learning styles in any classroom are the three factors that influenced this research.       This study was designed to investigate the effect of learning styles and demographic differences on performance in Biology when taught using two different methods of teaching. One was the teacher-directed Traditional Teaching and Learning (TTL) and the other was the student-centred Problem-Based Learning (PBL). The preferred learning styles of all Foundation Studies (FS) Biology students over four academic years at RMIT were determined using the Paragon Learning Style Inventory (PLSI). These students were taught two selected topics in Biology by the researcher using the two different methods and their performance assessed by a written test at the end of each topic. Two instruments were developed to assess student participation in PBL. The first instrument Students' Participation in Group Discussions (SPGD) rating scale was designed for teacher evaluation of student participation in PBL group discussions while the second instrument the Student Self Evaluation (SSE) rating scale was for self-evaluation by stud ents. Individual interviews provided students' views and opinions about their learning styles and the two teaching methods.       The analysis of data was predominantly conducted by quantitative methods, supported by qualitative analysis of the interview data. Effect size analyses were used to investigate differences in performance under the two teaching methods on the basis of demographic and learning style differences. Further probes were conducted to elicit any interactions among the demographic variables and the learning style traits in their effect on performance under the two teaching methods and a quantitative measure for interaction was derived using effect sizes.       While results confirmed some of the trends displayed by learning style traits in other disciplines, a number of interactions among variables were found to affect performance in Biology as well as performance under the two teaching methods. Gender, age, prior qualification and the language of instruction of prior education had various levels of interactions with the introvert/extrovert, intuitive/sensing, thinking/feeling and perceiving/judging learning traits and affected performance in Biology to varying extents. However, it was found that international students from diverse backgrounds were able to cope with both methods of teaching though there was a definite preference expressed for the traditional teacher directed method.       The conclusions from this study have resulted in a number of recommendations for Biology educators, FS administrators, authors and all practitioners of PBL. Several suggestions have opened new avenues for future research. These recommendations for pedagogy and suggestions for future research can improve the outcomes of Biology education as well as other disciplines in related fields. As a consequence of this study two new instruments have been developed to assess student participation in the group discussions of PBL. These could prove to be valuable assessment tools for practitioners of this methodology.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foundation Studies (FS)</field><field name="subject">Problem-Based Learning (PBL)</field><field name="subject">Learning styles</field><field name="subject">Students' Participation in Group Discussions (SPGD)</field><field name="subject">Student Self Evaluation (SSE)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080530.123852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing drivers, shifting trends: a decade of equity research in Australian vocational education and training (VET) 1996-2006</field><field name="creator">Volkoff, Veronica</field><field name="description">This integrating essay presents and discusses the findings of the research studies that Veronica Volkoff completed within the context of the shifts in the Australian vocational education and training landscape and resultant trends in vocational education and training policy, in particular equity policy, during the period of researching and writing the nominated works, 1995 to 2004.    The research included analysis of vocational education and training in relation to: equity policy; provider inclusiveness strategies; and access, participation, completion and outcomes in relation to learners, in particular members of designated and emerging equity target groups. A range of methodologies was implemented in these studies, usually utilising a mix of both quantitative and qualitative methods.    The first study, the Longitudinal study of student experiences in vocational education and training, explored the experiences of access, participation and outcomes of students in vocational education and training from a range of equity target groups. It was undertaken in six Australian locations across three states and territories. It revealed that intentions, experiences and outcomes varied across students and equity target groups and that membership of multiple equity target groups compounded disadvantage and had an adverse effect upon outcomes.     The second study, a Review of equity literature, was commissioned to inform national policy and broad strategy development and analysed the situation for five designated equity target groups in vocational education and training, nationally. Two other studies focussed on Vocational education and training for people from non-English speaking backgrounds, undertaken five years apart, reviewed the literature and analysed participation and outcomes for people from non-English speaking backgrounds.

Bullying has become a topic of increasing public concern and the focus of considerable research in Australia over the last decade. Parallel to this rise in interest in bullying research is a rise in research into resilience. Research has indicated that children facing distress will show a range of responses; some will regress, while others tolerate and even thrive in the face of trauma; it is this second group that are described as resilient. It was therefore postulated in this thesis that individuals exposed to bullying may not all succumb to the typical negative effects of being a victim of school bullying. While previous studies have noted the difference in reactions to bullying, this is the first study to investigate whether resilient victims can be identified, and their  key psychosocial characteristics profiled. Based on this notion, it was predicted that victims of bullying could be taught a set of skills and attitudes that would build their resilience to the expected effects of bullying.   The present research consisted of two studies. Study 1 had two phases. The first phase of Study 1 identified 'resilient victims' of school bullying by assessing participants on their levels of victimisation and their levels of wellbeing using a battery of questionnaires. Participants were assigned to one of four groups: resilient victims, non-resilient victims, healthy non-victims, or poor-health non-victims. From the original sample of 867 students, 111 were categorised into one of the four groups, and completed a second questionnaire package. The second phase examined the relationships between these resilience groups and eight psychosocial correlates of general resilience: individual protective factors, optimism, coping, social support, social skills, self-esteem, self-concept, and emotional intelligence. The results showed that there were significant discriminators between resilient and non-resilient victims, particularly on factors such as optimism, productive coping, self-concept and self-esteem, and so cial variables.   The aims of the second study were to 1) develop a cognitive-behavioural group intervention program to teach social skills, perceived social support, self-esteem, optimism, and effective coping skills, to adolescent victims of school bullying; and 2) to investigate the effectiveness of the intervention. Ten year 7 and 8 students who reported negative consequences to high levels of bullying participated in the intervention program. Results indicated that the program had positive effects on the skills and attitudes that the program targeted. The program also appeared to have positive effects on the participants' levels of victimisation and general wellbeing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bullying; Resilience; Cognitive-Behavioural; Group Intervention</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080603.101203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interventions with Adolescents in Out-of-Home Care Diagnosed with Severe Conduct Disorder</field><field name="creator">Wahl, Lothar Werner</field><field name="description">This research examines interventions with adolescents in out-of-home care diagnosed with severe conduct disorder. Interventions from the service sectors of mental health, juvenile justice, child protection and welfare are reviewed and discussed. The research centred around three hypotheses. Firstly, that adolescents in out-of-home care diagnosed with severe conduct disorder have poor treatment outcomes. Secondly, that adolescents in out-of-home care diagnosed with severe conduct disorder are a particularly difficult client group to work with because of issues of attachment. Thirdly, that a diagnosis of severe conduct disorder negatively impacts upon the work professionals undertake with these young people. These hypotheses were considered in the context of an extensive literature review as well as findings gleaned from interviews and questionnaires conducted with research participants drawn from the abovementioned service sectors. Research participants were senio r practitioners and managers with many years of practice and experience working with adolescents in out-of-home care diagnosed with severe conduct disorder.      The main findings from the research were that all three hypotheses appeared to be supported. These were that adolescents in out-of-home care diagnosed with severe conduct disorder have poor treatment outcomes and that one of the particular difficulties of working with this client group is the issue of attachment. Also, that the diagnosis of severe conduct disorder negatively impacts upon the work professionals undertake with these young people.       These findings are discussed within the theoretical frameworks of attachment theory and critical theory, which are utilised in exploring the alienation and oppression of these young people on intrapersonal, interpersonal and societal levels. Finally, implications for social work research and practice are considered.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adolescents</field><field name="subject">Conduct Disorder</field><field name="subject">Out-of-Home Care</field><field name="subject">Attachment</field><field name="subject">Critical theory</field><field name="subject">Mental Illness</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080604.095348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sources of the Communicative Body</field><field name="creator">Wagner, Mark</field><field name="description">This study provides evidence for the warranted assertion that classroom practices will be enhanced by awareness of how non-linguistic modalities of the face, hands and vocal intonation contribute to cohesive and cooperative strategies within social groups.  Both the history and observations of non-linguistic communication presented by this study suggest that visual, kinesic, and spatial comprehension create and influence social fields and common spaces, yet our language for these fields and spaces is impoverished.  This knowledge has been submerged and marginalized through history.  At the same time, through time, despite this submersion and marginalization, interrelational and intrarelational synchrony and dis-synchrony, centered on and by the communicative body, occur in social settings in ways that can be considered from both historical and observational perspectives.  Building on recent theory by Damasio, Donald, Noddings, Grumet, Terdiman, and Nussbaum, the  historical concepts and classroom observations presented here evidence that social values such as caring, loyalty, and generosity are sometimes understood, implicitly and explicitly, through the exchange, perception, and interpretation of non-linguistic signs.  By understanding how the face and hands and rhythm and pitch of the voice create cohesive and cooperative social values in learning spaces - separate from racial, ethnic, and intellectual differences - this investigation recovers a submerged knowledge in order to offer a new logic for understanding social process.  In turn, this new logic hopes to further transformational practice in the learning and teaching arts and sciences.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-linguistic communication</field><field name="subject">non-verbal communication</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080604.102741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and Simulating Mobile Commerce Diffusion in China Using System  Dynamics</field><field name="creator">Wang, Wenqing</field><field name="description">Current deployments of mobile commerce focus mostly on digital content. However, mobile commerce will grow rapidly with the increased use of portable devices such as cellular phones and personal digital assistants (PDA), increased network bandwidth, and the availability of a wider range of mobile commerce services and transactions. As the revenue generated from mobile commerce is expected to skyrocket in the coming years, strategists are turning their attention to untapped emerging markets in the developing countries. Understanding how mobile commerce will develop in countries like China, where huge market potential exists, is of paramount importance in order to develop effective strategies that will positively affect its course.      Modelling the diffusion of mobile commerce in a country is a difficult task due to the non-linear, complex and uncertain nature of its operating environment. A System Dynamics approach is more appropriate to model such a complex system. The main objective of this study is to illustrate the process of developing System Dynamics models for simulating mobile commerce diffusion in China by using a subset of the factors involved.       In order to achieve this objective, the Chinese mobile commerce was modelled as the interaction of three subsystems, namely: population evolution in China; mobile commerce diffusion; and the influence from the provision of mobile commerce terminals (MCT) on mobile commerce diffusion. Each subsystem was modelled by identifying the factors influencing its development as well as the interactions between the factors. The subsystems were calibrated using historical and forecasted data whenever they were available. The validation of the subsystems was also performed through extensive sensitivity analysis. The complete model was used for experimenting with some typical Chinese mobile commerce scenarios for the purpose of analysing mobile commerce trends and designing strategies to exert positive influences on those trends.       The simulation of the submodels provided useful insights into their respective areas for controlling their development. Simulation of the population development submodel showed that, in addition to family planning policies, urbanisation rates and life quality were important factors that significantly influenced population dynamics in China. Simulation of the mobile commerce diffusion submodel showed that the time when mobile commerce is implemented will significantly influence its market expansion speed i.e. the later mobile commerce is implemented, the quicker the market will expand. The existence of floating populations in China will be a big advantage in starting up the rural market. However, if mobile commerce is implemented too late, the penetration in rural areas will be negligible. Simulation of the MCT provision submodel showed the importance of opening the Chinese market to foreign suppliers and the coordination of strategies regarding the design and supply of MCTs with strategies for the growth of  mobile commerce in China.       This study is a first attempt to simulate the diffusion of mobile commerce in China using System Dynamics. The results obtained showed that the models developed were useful for understanding and controlling the future diffusion of mobile commerce in China.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">system dynamics</field><field name="subject">systems thinking</field><field name="subject">strategy development</field><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="subject">scenario</field><field name="subject">mobile commerce</field><field name="subject">electronic commerce</field><field name="subject">population dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080604.115004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation of arterial stenosis incorporating fluid-structural interaction and non-Newtonian blood flow.</field><field name="creator">Chan, Weng Yew</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to investigate the fluid-structural response to pulsatile   Newtonian and non-Newtonian blood flow through an axisymmetric stenosed vessel   using FLOTRAN and ANSYS. This is to provide a basic understanding of   atherosclerosis. The flow was set to be laminar and follows a sinusoidal waveform. The   solid model was set to have isotropic elastic properties. The Fluid-Structural Interaction   (FSI) coupling was two-way and iterative. Rigid and Newtonian cases were investigated   to provide an understanding on the effects of incorporating FSI into the model. The wall   expansion was found to decrease the axial velocity and increase the recirculation effects   of the flow. To validate the models and methods used, the results were compared with the   study by Lee and Xu [2002] and Ohja et al [1989]. Close comparisons were achieved,   suggesting the models used were valid. Two non-Newtonian models were investigated   with FSI: Carreau and Power Law models. The Carreau model fluid behaviour was very   close to the Newtonian model. The Power Law model produced significant difference in   viscosity, velocity and wall shear stress distributions. Pressure distribution for all models   was similar. In order to quantify the changes, Importance Factor (IG) was introduced to   determine the overall non-Newtonian effects at two regions: the entire flow model and   about the vessel wall. The Carreau model showed reasonable values of IG whereas the   Power Law model showed excessive values. Transient and geometrical effects were   found to affect the Importance Factor. The stress distributions for all models were found   to be similar. Highest stress occurred at the shoulders of the stenosis where a stress   concentration occurred due to sharp corners of the geometry and large bending moments.   The highest stresses were in the axial direction. Notable circumferential stress was found   at the ends of the vessel. Carreau model produced slightly higher stresses than the other   models. Wall stresses were found to be primarily influenced by internal pressure, rather   than wall shear stresses.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fluid-structural</field><field name="subject">interaction</field><field name="subject">FSI</field><field name="subject">fluid-solid</field><field name="subject">non-Newtonian</field><field name="subject">blood</field><field name="subject">stenosis</field><field name="subject">FLOTRAN</field><field name="subject">ANSYS</field><field name="subject">power law</field><field name="subject">Carreau</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070108.164458</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of aerofoils at high angle of attack in ground effect</field><field name="creator">Walter, Daniel James</field><field name="description">Aerodynamic devices, such as wings, are used in higher levels of motorsport (Formula-1 etc.) to increase the contact force between the road and tyres (i.e. to generate downforce). This in turn increases the performance envelope of the race car. However the extra downforce increases aerodynamic drag which (apart from when braking) is generally detrimental to lap-times. The drag acts to slow the vehicle, and hinders the effect of available drive power and reduces fuel economy. Wings, in automotive use, are not constrained by the same parameters as aircraft, and thus higher angles of attack can be safely reached, although at a higher cost in drag. Variable geometry aerodynamic devices have been used in many forms of motorsport in the past offering the ability to change the relative values of downforce and drag. These have invariably been banned, generally due to safety reasons. The use of active aerodynamics is currently legal in both Formula SAE (engineering compet ition for university students to design, build and race an open-wheel race car) and production vehicles. A number of passenger car companies are beginning to incorporate active aerodynamic devices in their designs.    In this research the effect of ground proximity on the lift, drag and moment coefficients of inverted, two-dimensional aerofoils was investigated. The purpose of the study was to examine the effect ground proximity on aerofoils post stall, in an effort to evaluate the use of active aerodynamics to increase the performance of a race car. The aerofoils were tested at angles of attack ranging from 0&#176; - 135&#176;. The tests were performed at a Reynolds number of 2.16 x 105 based on chord length. Forces were calculated via the use of pressure taps along the centreline of the aerofoils. The RMIT Industrial Wind Tunnel (IWT) was used for the testing. Normally 3m wide and 2m high, an extra contraction was installed and the section was reduced to form a width of 295mm. The wing was mounted between walls to simulate 2-D flow. The IWT was chosen as it would allow enough height to reduce blockage effect caused by the aerofoils when at high angles of incidence. The walls of the tunnel were pressure tapped to allow monitoring  of the pressure gradient along the tunnel. The results show a delay in the stall of the aerofoils tested with reduced ground clearance. Two of the aerofoils tested showed a decrease in Cl with decreasing ground clearance; the third showed an increase. The Cd of the aerofoils post-stall decreased with reduced ground clearance. Decreasing ground clearance was found to reduce pitch moment variation of the aerofoils with varied angle of attack.

The strategy employed here for the development of chromatographic separations involved the utilization of experimental designs, multi-linear regression and response surface methodology to build empirical models that related the chromatographic quality to the factors influencing the separation.      Separation of Nitrofuran antibiotics (NFAs) and their metabolites (NFMs) by using micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography was successfully completed. The best conditions found to give optimum resolution from the optimization study was pH 9.0, 80 mM SDC concentration, 16 kV with running buffer consisting of 20 mM borate and 20 mM phosphate concentration using a 73 cm x 75 &#131;&#221;m column, resulting in completely resolved NFAs and NFMs within 16 min. It is interesting that all the compounds can be reliably separated with the one mixture, and single CE condition. Whilst all antibiotics have shorter migration time than their respective derivatised metabolites, as a group apart from nitrofurantoin the antibiotics elute before the metabolites. The analytical figures of merit for CE analysis exhibited excellent reproducibility of absolute and relative migration times, and acceptable reproducibility of relative response areas. Successful separation of metabolite derivatives was achieved when the developed method  was applied to a spiked prawn sample.       The chiral separation of Triadimenol was successfully completed using micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography. The best conditions found to give optimum resolution from the optimisation study were pH 6.0, 20% methanol, 50 mM SDS concentration, 18 kV with running buffer consisting of 20 mM borate and 20 mM phosphate concentration using a 64.5 cm x 50 &#131;&#221;m column, resulted in baseline resolution of all Triadimenol isomers within 18 min. The optimised separation conditions were applied to a blank grape sample and to a spiked grape sample. No peaks were observed in the blank grape sample whereas the spiked grape sample had two diastereoismer peaks with poor detection sensitivity. Increase in detection sensitivity is necessary to determine the possibility of resolution of all the isomers of Triadimenol, in the spiked grape sample and the blank.       Online preconcentration techniques were attempted to for Triadimenol isomer separation. When using online preconcentration technique of sweeping, a 30-fold increase in detection sensitivity of Triadimenol was observed compared to MEKC mode. However enantiomer separation was not possible with sulfated-&#163;]-CD chiral selector. The best conditions were found to be pH 2.5, 50 mM SDS concentration, -20 kV with running buffer consisting of 20 mM phosphate concentration, using a 64.5 cm x 50 &#131;&#221;m column, resulting in diastereoisomer separation within 8 min.       Final stage of the project was to create stationary phase beds in capillaries and micro-channels that could be removed and re-created, thus providing a fresh stationary phase.  The replaceable stationary phase (RSP) can be used as an operating mode of CE/CEC. Preparation of reversible stationary phase (RSP) inside the capillary column was successfully performed using low methoxy pectin (LMP). LMP renders a capability of reversible thermogelation. Electroosmotic flow (EOF) and sufficient hydrophobicity of LMP gel allow separation of analyates. The porosity of LMP RSP was adequate to support EOF. Successful separation with good reproducibility of areas and migration times was obtained for Caffeine, Aspartame, Benzoic acid, Saccharine (CABS) mixture and NFAs. After performing continuous analyses, the aging of RSP was observed. Temperature was the &#161;&#165;switch&#161;&#166;, which applied to remove aged RSP. RSP was recreated for further analysis of analytes. RSP was UV transparent, capable of handling various analytes and diff erent buffer electrolytes including aqueous-organic solvents.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nitrofuran antibiotics</field><field name="subject">Nitrofuran metabolites</field><field name="subject">Triadimenol</field><field name="subject">Replaceable stationary phase</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080617.115607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of the psychological and political dimensions of violence and   aggression within the war film genre</field><field name="creator">Blackman, David</field><field name="description">Parade's End, a screenplay accompanied by an exegesis exploring institutional and ideological violence within the war film genre. The problem to solve with my exegesis and subsequent screenplay was how to create a unique visual form for the treatment of violence. This was done by examining screenwriting techniques that have been used to explore the psychology of violence and aggression within the war film genre. I identified and examined those techniques used to depict vioence within the war film genre, specifically those discussed by film theorist Stephen Prince. Stephen Prince in Savage cinema: Sam Peckinpah and the rise of ultraviolent movies in America examines the cultural and subsequent technical shifts that occurred in the late sixties towards the treatment of violence in contemporary cinema. He focuses on specific techniques that he believes radicalised the depiction of vioence and its aftermath in the cinematic form. In Visions of empire: political image ry in contemporary American film, Prince examines those techniques that he believed explored the political dimensions of violence. A primary consideration of my research then was how to integrate the techniques under discussion in ways that will help create a convincing form the for depiction of violence for a contemporary screen audience. A major outcome of my investigation and exploration of Prince's techniques, was to sustain within my screenplay the audience's gaze at a disturbing mirror, and probe an audience's ambivalent response to contemporary social currents.

Following a review of approaches to   biodiversity conservation at the bioregional level, including the roles and   potential of geospatial science technologies in this regard, I consider biodiversity   modelling using a case study of the Burt Plain bioregion in central Australia that   focuses on selected taxa, ecosystems and landscapes. The Burt Plain bioregion   was chosen since it is one of 19 bioregions nationally that has been given a 'very   high' priority status for biological survey, assessment and potential reservation of   land for conservation purposes.   The specific research objectives for the Burt Plain bioregion study were to:   &#183; describe the species composition, distribution and nature of the dominant   vegetation communities within the bioregion;   &#183; characterise environmental niche of communities with respect to selected   environmental and management variables - latitude, longitude, climate, land   systems and land units, geology, hydrography, topography, and tenure;   &#183; analyse how well or otherwise taxa have been sampled (during previous   ground surveys) with respect to geographical and environmental variables;   Biodiversity conservation at the bioregional level   &#183; develop and compare quantitative habitat models of the potential distribution   of selected species based on presence-only distributional data; and   &#183; examine the significance of radiometric data as a potential correlate and   predictor of the distribution of those selected species.   National conservation initiatives such as the bioregional approach and   international initiatives such as the biosphere reserves program to support the   planning and management of biodiversity conservation are discussed in chapter   two. The scientific and related processes underpinning the development of   bioregions and strategies across the Australian states and territories are then   considered. An important finding arising from this review is the need to improve   biological information, especially through systematic surveys and on-going   monitoring of ecosystems and populations of species, at the bioregional level to   inform land use allocation and management. This finding is consistent with one   of the general aims of the thesis to improve the spatial modelling techniques   available for bioregional assessment and biodiversity conservation.   In chapter three I review the role and limitations of geospatial technologies   currently employed for biodiversity conservation management. Current   developments and applications of GIS and remote sensing to wildlife research,   conservation gap analysis and conservation reserve design are considered.   Geographic information systems (GIS) are now routinely used by ecologists to   Biodiversity conservation at the bioregional level   analyse spatial data. Although various forms of GIS have been available for 15 to   25 years, the biological applications of GIS have figured most prominently in the   ecological literature only in the past 15 years. The use of computer-generated   models to simulate environmental events can provide a greater understanding of   ecosystems, and offers improved predictive powers to conservation and land   managers. The decision support offered by computer-based modelling   techniques appears likely to underpin conservation and management decisions   much more into the future providing that adequate biological and other datasets   are available for this purpose.   Dominant vegetation communities and various environmental gradients were   analysed to characterise environmental niches at the bioregional scale for the   Burt Plain bioregion (Chapter 4) and more locally at the catchment scale for the   Upper Todd River Catchment (Chapter 5). In Chapters four and five I describe   in detail the land tenure and use, land systems, climate soil, geology,   topography, hydrology, vegetation and biodiversity of the Burt Plain bioregion   and Upper Todd River Catchment. The bioregion contains some ephemeral   watercourses, which are generally in fair to good condition, but are afforded little   protection from a range of threatening processes, including grazing and   trampling by feral animals and livestock and weed infestation. The major river   systems occurring in the bioregion include parts of the Plenty, Hanson, Sandover   and Lander Rivers. In the Upper Todd River Catchment the major watercourses   Biodiversity conservation at the bioregional level   are the Todd River and Station Creek, which exit the area via two narrow gaps in   the low rocky hills on the southern boundary of the bioregion. The dominant   geology can be summarised as plains and low rocky ranges of Pre-Cambrian   granites on red earths. The bioregion has approximately 200 - 250 mm of   summer rainfall, with rainfall occurring on 20 - 30 days per year. There is a high   variability and range of temperatures, with an annual mean temperature of   approximately 22-23&#176;C.   In Chapter six I consider a range of species found within the Burt Plain bioregion   using existing survey data and techniques that enables the prediction of the   spatial distribution of taxa. Using GLM and GAM models, Black-footed Rock-   Wallaby (Petrogale lateralis), Spinifex Hopping Mouse (Notomys alexis) and   Spencers Frog (Limnodynastes spenceri) were chosen for a more in-depth analysis.   Environmental variables correlated with the presence of each species are then   described and prediction maps showing the probability or likelihood of the   presence of the species within the bioregion developed.   In Chapter seven I examine the utility of radiometric data for wildlife habitat   modelling. Statistical relationships are tested between the concentrations of the   elements uranium, thorium and potassium and terrain characteristics such as   position in the landscape, slope and aspect as well as other climatic variables.   Radiometric data were found to be useful for developing statistical predictive   Biodiversity conservation at the bioregional level   models of six species: Red Kangaroo (Macropus rufus), Desert Dunnart   (Sminthopsis youngsoni), Rabbit (Orcytolagus cuniculus), Brown Honeyeater   (Lichmera indistincta), Little Spotted Snake (Suda punctata) and Southern Boobook   (Ninox novaeseelandiae). I suggest that the utility of radiometric data for wildlife   habitat modelling would appear significant and should be explored further using   alternative quantitative modelling techniques and presence/ absence records for   target faunal species. Predictions of species distributions may be useful for   prioritising land acquisitions for reservation as well as in the future design of   biological surveys.   The thesis concludes with a synthesis of the major research findings, discussion   of the limitations of the datasets available for the study, perspectives on   management issues in the Burt Plain bioregion, and possible future research   directions. It is important that purposefully-designed biological survey research   be undertaken across the bioregions of the arid zone of Australia to enhance   basic understanding of biodiversity patterns and their relationships to   environmental heterogeneity and site-landscape level processes. Geospatial   modelling techniques can assist such biodiversity survey and evaluation and   make their conduct more cost-efficient and the inferences drawn from   subsequent data analyses more powerful. This knowledge is required to   contribute to the emergent concepts and theory of ecosystem dynamics and   associated biodiversity patterns in arid Australia and, most significantly, to enhance the conservation and management of the unique biological complement   and systems found in this region.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biological modelling</field><field name="subject">conservation evaluation</field><field name="subject">bioregional planning</field><field name="subject">arid zone</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070209.120654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motor imagery and developmental coordination disorder (DCD).</field><field name="creator">Williams, Jacqueline Louise</field><field name="description">Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) is characterised by impairments to motor control and learning, the cause of which remains unclear.  Recently, researchers have used cognitive neuroscientific approaches to explore the basis of poor coordination in children, with one hypothesis suggesting that an internal modelling deficit (IMD) is one of the underlying causes of DCD.  The aim of this thesis was to further test the IMD hypothesis using a motor imagery paradigm - the mental rotation of hands.  Versions of this task were used in all studies to assess motor imagery ability, with an additional whole-body task used in Studies 2 and 3.  Further, an alphanumeric rotation task was used in Studies 1 and 2 to assess visual imagery ability.       Studies 1 and 2 provided varying levels of support for the IMD hypothesis.  In Study 1, only a subgroup of DCD children performed differently from other children in the study on the hand tasks, but tighter task constraints in Study 2 led to overall group differences between DCD and controls in terms of accuracy.  The DCD group were also significantly less accurate than controls in the whole-body task, but there were no group differences in either Study 1 or 2 on the visual imagery task.  Interestingly, in Study 2, there was an indication that children with severe levels of motor impairment were less accurate than children with less severe motor impairment, suggesting that motor impairment level could play a role in the severity of motor imagery deficits.   Study 3 was designed to explore the impact of motor impairment severity on motor imagery ability further.  The results confirmed that children with severe DCD had greater motor imagery impairment than children with mild DCD - children with severe DCD performed less accurately than both controls and those with mild DCD in the hand task with instructions and the controls in the whole-body task.  Further, those children with mild DCD were able to respond somewhat to motor imagery instructions, whereas those with severe DCD were not.  This study provided support to the IMD hypothesis, though the deficit was shown to be dependent on a number of factors.   	Chapter 5 presents a reasoned account of these various findings and their implications are discussed.  It is concluded that motor imagery deficits are evident in many children with DCD, but more so in children with severe motor impairment.  A general imagery deficit was ruled out based on the findings of Studies 1 and 2 which showed that visual imagery processes appear intact in children with DCD.  Taken together with previous imagery and IMD studies, and related research on feedforward control in DCD, it is concluded that the deficits in motor imagery observed in this thesis are consistent with the hypothesis that an IMD is one likely causal factor in the disorder, particularly in more severe DCD.  The observation of differing response patterns between children with mild and severe forms of DCD has important implications for developing a theory of DCD and for remediation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD)</field><field name="subject">motor imagery</field><field name="subject">mental rotation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080617.141139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Drawn Subject: Meaning and the Moving Drawing</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Naomi</field><field name="description">Using the vehicle of hand drawn animation, this is an ongoing reflection of instances that repeat themselves to a point beyond the humorous and back.

Despite its significance, there are currently no treatments available to abrogate this process and those that suffer with this burden eventually succumb to renal failure.  Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is largely mediated by fibroblasts and myofibroblasts present in the interstitium.  In response to injury, activated fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts which serves as a histological hallmark of fibrosis.  Myofibroblasts are characterised as the key contributors to interstitial volume and their presence ultimately leads to loss of renal function.    The pathological entities leading to fibrosis inextricably depend on complex signalling pathways.   Whilst many of the well-known growth factors that exert effects on renal fibroblasts (such as FGF, EGF and PDGF) involve the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, the intracellular signalling events dictating the response of fibroblasts remain undefined.  The kinase mTOR, responsible for integrating stress and amino acids and controlling cell growth, is increasingly recognised for its ability to integrate growth factor signals mediated through the upstream serine/threonine kinase PI3K.  A number of recent studies have highlighted the role of PI3K and mTOR in the regulation of key events relevant to fibrosis, serving as a basis for Chapter 3: The role of PI3K and mTOR in the regulation of fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis, and the first part of Chapter 5: The role of PI3K and mTOR in the regulation of myofibroblast differentiation.  These studies have identified a key role for PI3K and mTOR in  the regulation of fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen synthesis.   The work described within has also attempted to examine the derivation of myofibroblasts via EMT.  EMT is a process that is integral to embryogenesis and may act as an important source of myofibroblasts during fibrosis.  This process is examined in Chapter 4: Development and validation of an ex vivo model of EMT.  This model aims to better represent the in vivo environment and has also been used to identify novel regulators involved in EMT being utilised in the second part of Chapter 5: The role of PI3K and mTOR in EMT.     Although cytokines and growth factors are thought to be chiefly responsible for tubulointerstitial fibrosis, we now know that serine proteases of the coagulation cascade may also play roles in renal disease.  However, unlike their role in glomerular diseases, the role of coagulation in tubulointerstitial fibrosis is less well-known.  The work described in Chapter 6: Constituents of the coagulation cascade are spatially and functionally related to experimental tubulointerstitial fibrosis has examined temporal and spatial in vivo relationships of coagulation factors and markers of fibrosis that aid our understanding of mechanisms of fibrosis.       The aim of this thesis was to examine those facets of renal fibroblast function that are most devastating to renal function and culminate in an expansion of the renal interstitium during fibrosis.  This work hopes to provide useful information to aid the understanding of the multifaceted mechanisms involved in renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tubulointerstitial fibrosis</field><field name="subject">mTOR</field><field name="subject">PI3K</field><field name="subject">epithelial-mesenchymal transition</field><field name="subject">coagulation cascade</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080617.143850</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the differential effects of varieties of praise</field><field name="creator">Delin, Catherine R.

Perceptually lossless encoding offers the best of both worlds, delivering images free of visual distortions and at the same time providing significantly greater compression ratio gains over its information lossless counterparts. This is achieved through a visual pruning function, embedded with an advanced model of the human visual system to accurately identify and to efficiently remove visually irrelevant/insignificant information. In addition, it maintains bit-stream compliance with the JPEG 2000 coding framework and subsequently is compliant with the Digital Communications in Medicine standard (DICOM). Equally, the pruning function is applicable to other Discrete Wavelet Transform based image coders, e.g., The Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees. Further significant coding gains are ex ploited through an artificial edge segmentation algorithm and a novel arithmetic pruning algorithm.    The coding effectiveness and qualitative consistency of the algorithm is evaluated through a double-blind subjective assessment with 31 medical experts, performed using a novel 2-staged forced choice assessment that was devised for medical experts, offering the benefits of greater robustness and accuracy in measuring subjective responses. The assessment showed that no differences of statistical significance were perceivable between the original images and the images encoded by the proposed coder.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Image coding</field><field name="subject">Perceptually lossless quality</field><field name="subject">Medical imaging</field><field name="subject">Biomedical imaging</field><field name="subject">vision model</field><field name="subject">visual pruning</field><field name="subject">JPEG 2000</field><field name="subject">DWT</field><field name="subject">Wavelets</field><field name="subject">DICOM</field><field name="subject">forced choice</field><field name="subject">2-staged forced choice.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080617.160025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the Temporal Variation of the Ionosphere in a Network-RTK Environment</field><field name="creator">Wyllie, Scott John</field><field name="description">The Global Positioning System (GPS) has been widely used for precise positioning applications throughout the world. However, there are still some limiting factors that affect the performance of satellite-based positioning techniques, including the ionosphere. The GPS Network-RTK (NRTK) concept has been developed in an attempt to remove the ionospheric bias from user observations within the network. This technique involves the establishment of a series of GNSS reference stations, spread over a wide geographical region. Real time data from each reference station is collected and transferred to a computing facility where the various spatial and temporal errors affecting the GNSS satellite observations are estimated. These corrections are then transmitted to users observations in the field. As part of a Victorian state government initiative to implement a cm-level real time positioning service state-wide, GPSnet is undergoing extensive infrastructure upgrades to meet  high user demand. Due to the sparse (+100km) configuration of GPSnet's reference stations, the precise modelling of Victoria's ionosphere will play a key role in providing this service.       This thesis aims is to develop a temporal model for the ionospheric bias within a Victorian NRTK scenario. This research has analysed the temporal variability of the ionosphere over Victoria. It is important to quantify the variability of the ionosphere as it is essential that NRTK corrections are delivered sufficiently often with a small enough latency so that they adequately model variations in the ionospheric bias. This will promote the efficient transmission of correctional data to the rover whilst still achieving cm-level accuracy. Temporal analysis of the ionosphere revealed that, during stable ionospheric conditions, Victoria's double differenced ionospheric (DDI) bias remains correlated to within +5cm out to approximately two minutes over baselines of approximately 100km. However, the data revealed that during more disturbed ionospheric conditions this may decrease to one minute.      As a preliminary investigation, four global empirical ionospheric models  were tested to assess their ability to estimate the DDI bias. Further, three temporal predictive modelling schemes were tested to assess their suitability for providing ionospheric corrections in a NRTK environment. The analysis took place over four seasonal periods during the previous solar maximum in 2001 and 2002. It was found that due to the global nature of their coefficients, the four global empirical models were unable to provide ionospheric corrections to a level sufficient for precise ambiguity resolution within a NRTK environment.       Three temporal ionospheric predictive schemes were developed and tested. These included a moving average model, a linear model and an ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) time series analysis. The moving average and ARIMA approaches gave similar performance and out-performed the linear modelling scheme. Both of these approaches were able to predict the DDI to +5cm within a 99% confidence interval, out to an average of approximately two minutes, on average 90% of the time when compared to the actual decorrelation rates of the ionosphere. These results suggest that the moving average scheme, could enhance the implementation of next generation NRTK systems by predicting the DDI  bias to latencies that would enable cm-level positioning.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Global Positioning System</field><field name="subject">Ionosphere</field><field name="subject">Modelling</field><field name="subject">Network RTK</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080617.161323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of selected agricultural chemicals on freshwater microalgae and cladocerans in laboratory studies, with particular emphasis on hormesis</field><field name="creator">Zalizniak, Liliana</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the toxicity of the herbicide glyphosate (two formulations &#161;V technical grade and Roundup Biactive RB) and the insecticide chlorpyrifos CPF to a model freshwater food chain of a producer and consumer. The importance of studying the toxicity of low (environmentally realistic) concentrations of pesticides to non-target organisms is highlighted. An extensive literature review on the toxicity of glyphosate and chlorpyrifos to aquatic organisms is provided. The requirements for the maintenance of algal (Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and Daphnia carinata cultures are discussed.    The effects of two formulations of the herbicide glyphosate (technical grade and Roundup Biactive&#132;&#181;) and the insecticide chlorpyrifos on the growth of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata were studied, and the EC50 values determined. Hormesis was observed when P. subcapitata was exposed to concentrations of Roundup equal to 7% and 4% of its EC50 respectively. When exposed to chlorpyrifos concentrations 0.3-5 &#131;&#221;g/L, hormesis was observed for both algal species with a maximum at 0.06% of EC50.    The effects of sublethal concentrations of chlorpyrifos on population characteristics of Daphnia carinata were investigated in multiple-generation toxicity testing using individual culture. Exposure to chlorpyrifos affected survival and fecundity of animals in the first generation. In the second generation the most affected endpoint was time to the first brood with an indication of hormesis. LC50 tests were then conducted using animals of the third generation from each of the exposures in individual tests. Results of testing the third generation showed a constant significant decline in LC50 in the order of control daphnids through to &#161;&#165;0.1 LC50&#161;&#166; pre-exposed daphnids.   The same experimental protocol was used in testing of glyphosate (technical grade and Roundup Biactive). Glyphosate was tested in two different media: sea salt solution and M4 medium, while Roundup Biactive was tested in M4 medium. Results indicated that glyphosate and Roundup Biactive had low toxicity to Daphnia. Hormesis was evident in sea salt medium exposures in the first and second generations of daphnids with glyphosate. When exposed to glyphosate and Roundup Biactive in M4 medium animals showed no indication of hormesis. It is hypothesized that glyphosate may have compensated for the lack of microelements in the sea salt medium, and possible mechanisms discussed.The modifying effect of glyphosate on the toxicity of cadmium to Daphnia carinata was studied using the same experimental design. Low concentrations of Roundup Biactive reduced the toxicity of cadmium, and the performance of daphnia was enhanced in terms of animal size, survival, fecundity, and the rate of natural increase in both generations  in the presence of glyphosate. However when the third generation was tested for their sensitivity to Cd in the 48-h LC50 experiments there was no difference between RB-free and RB-spiked treatments in pair wise comparisons, indicating that no adaptation mechanisms were involved in the enhancement.   The implications of these observed effects for environmental freshwater food chains subjected to pesticide exposure are discussed and recommendations on modifying pesticide use are provided.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecotoxicology</field><field name="subject">Daphnia carinata</field><field name="subject">microalgae</field><field name="subject">toxicity</field><field name="subject">glyphosate</field><field name="subject">chlorpyrifos</field><field name="subject">hormesis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080618.091930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flight Delay-Cost Simulation Analysis and Airline Schedule Optimization</field><field name="creator">Yuan, Duojia</field><field name="description">In order to meet the fast-growing demand, airlines have applied much more compact air-fleet operation schedules which directly lead to airport congestion. One result is the flight delay, which appears more frequently and seriously; the flight delay can also significantly damage airline's profitability and reputation   	The aim of this project is to enhance the dispatch reliability of Australian X Airline's fleet through a newly developed approach to reliability modeling, which employs computer-aided numerical simulation of the departure delay distribution and related cost to achieve the flight schedule optimization.   	The reliability modeling approach developed in this project is based on the probability distributions and Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) techniques. Initial (type I) delay and propagated (type II) delay are adopted as the criterion for data classification and analysis. The randomicity of type I delay occurrence and the internal relationship between type II delay and changed flight schedule are considered as the core factors in this new approach of reliability modeling, which compared to the conventional assessment methodologies, is proved to be more accurate on the departure delay and cost evaluation modeling.    	The Flight Delay and Cost Simulation Program (FDCSP) has been developed (Visual Basic 6.0) to perform the complicated numerical calculations through significant amount of pseudo-samples. FDCSP is also designed to provide convenience for varied applications in dispatch reliability modeling. The end-users can be airlines, airports and aviation authorities, etc.   	As a result, through this project, a 16.87% reduction in departure delay is estimated to be achieved by Australian X Airline. The air-fleet dispatch reliability has been enhanced to a higher level - 78.94% compared to initial 65.25%. Thus, 13.35% of system cost can be saved.   	At last, this project also achieves to set a more practical guideline for air-fleet database and management upon overall dispatch reliability optimization.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flight Delay</field><field name="subject">Cost</field><field name="subject">Simulation</field><field name="subject">Airline Schedule</field><field name="subject">Optimization</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080618.092923</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The functional study of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in vascular smooth muscle cells</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Jun</field><field name="description">Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) is a membrane protein which can mediate either Ca2+ entry (reverse mode) or exit (forward mode) in cells. As one of the major Ca2+ transport systems, NCX is postulated to play a critical role in the vascular smooth muscle cell. The aims of the present study are to firstly demonstrate the functional existence of NCX in vascular smooth muscle (including aorta and arteriole); to clarify the modulation of NCX; to explore the selectivity of NCX inhibitor KB-R7943;  and lastly to investigate the role of NCX in the myogenic response.       KB-R7943 has been widely used as a NCX inhibitor. The study investigated its pharmacological actions in rat aorta on a variety of Ca2+ dependent systems. Rat aortic rings were used. The constriction to low extracellular [Na+] is a functional response mediated by NCX operating in reverse mode. The data demonstrate that 10 &#181;M KB-R7943 inhibited L-type Ca2+ channel, the capacitative Ca2+ entry and &#61537; adrenergic receptor pathway. Nevertheless, KB-R7943 can be used as a selective inhibitor of NCX at the lower concentration of 1 &#181;M in rat aortic rings.   The study investigated whether the endothelium could modulate NCX in rat aortic rings. Lowering extracellular [Na+] to 1.18 mM induced constriction in endothelium denuded rat aortic rings, but only a small constriction in endothelium intact rat aortic rings. In endothelium intact rat aortic rings, the guanylate cyclise inhibitor ODQ (1 &#181;M) and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME (50 &#181;M) greatly amplified the vasoconstriction to lowering extracellular [Na+], but had no effect when the endothelium was removed. The adenylate cyclise inhibitor SQ 22536 (100 &#181;M) and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 &#61549;M) showed no significant effect on the low-Na+ induced vasoconstriction in either endothelium denuded or intact aortic rings. The results suggest that endothelium modulated the NCX operation via the nitric oxide/guanylate cyclase, not the adenylate cyclase system; further prostanoids including prostacyclin was not involved. The interaction between nitric oxide and NCX was furt her explored using the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside. Endothelium denuded rat aortic rings were preconstricted to the same extent with either low Na+ (1.18 mM), or the thromboxane A2 agonist U46619 (0.1 &#181;M) or high K+ (80 mM). The vasorelaxation of SNP (30 nM) in low Na+ constriction was significantly larger compared to other agents.  This indicates that NO has a special antagonism of low Na+ constriction and a hypothesis is proposed involving Na+/K+ ATPase.   The investigation of NCX is mainly conducted in large vessels; much less evidence is available for small resistance vessels. The study investigated the role of NCX on myogenic response in pressurized cremaster muscle arterioles. Reducing extracellular [Na+] resulted in graded vasoconstriction which was inhibited by NCX inhibitor SEA0400 (1 &#181;M). Myogenic vasoconstriction and the concomitant rise in internal [Ca2+] were induced by a transmural pressure increase from 70 to 120 mmHg which was prevented by NCX inhibitor: SEA0400 (1 &#181;M). In conclusion, the present study suggests that NCX contributes to the myogenic response in cremaster arteriole.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Na+/Ca2+ exchanger</field><field name="subject">vascular smooth muscle cell</field><field name="subject">aorta</field><field name="subject">arteriole</field><field name="subject">myogenic</field><field name="subject">KB-R7943</field><field name="subject">SEA0400</field><field name="subject">nitric oxide</field><field name="subject">endothelium.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080617.163746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Degradation Models for the Collapse Analysis of Composite Aerospace Structures</field><field name="creator">Orifici, Adrian Cirino</field><field name="description">For the next generation of aircraft, the use of fibre-reinforced polymer composites and the design of</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fibre-reinforced composites</field><field name="subject">Aerospace</field><field name="subject">Stiffened structures</field><field name="subject">Postbuckling</field><field name="subject">Collapse</field><field name="subject">Interlaminar damage</field><field name="subject">Ply damage</field><field name="subject">Virtual Crack Closure Technique</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080619.090039</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Missing Links - Evolutionary theory as a model and scientific intervention as a strategy for artistic process and production</field><field name="creator">Summers, Fleur Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Missing Links explores relationships between objects. It is an empirical exercise in equivalence and divergence, an experiment in the visual nomenclature of enumeration and classification and a dissertation on the materiality of the construction of systems of thought. It is concerned with the manufacture and production of particular histories through the formal analysis of fifty specimens.      The specimens, or objects, under investigation are constructed from recycled corrugated cardboard, water-activated brown tape and hot glue. These materials are transformed and renewed through a series of repetitive processes and activities including cutting, slicing, rolling, joining, gluing&#133;The material is receptive and provisional in nature. The specimens exist as a series of models, one made after the other, each made in response to the one before, and as thus present an unfolding of thoughts and material experiences. They represent a genealogy of the imagination ; creating relationships and dialogues within and between external physical manifestations.      The study of natural history informs this collection with particular reference to the nineteenth century work of Charles Darwin. In his attempts to understand the temporal arrangement of the natural world in The Origin of the Species, Darwin posited the notion of infinite change. This project is inspired by Darwin's emphasis of the sheer multiplicity of living objects, their complexity and the possibility of a transformational and material history. The objects in Missing Links were produced in response to the prolific nature of the natural world, its endless variations and ability to produce exquisite material adaptations. As a collection, they contain, support and enact a layered history, an archive of process and a document of action.      Missing Links also references the procedures of the laboratory - the facilitation of controlled conditions under which experiments, documentary exercises and data collection and collation can take place. It is the merging of these two realms and activities that lies at the heart of the project. The synergy of the artistic world and the scientific activities the project employs highlight similarities and discontinuities between seemingly disparate practices. This is a productive coupling; facilitating interesting juxtapositions between objects and ideas and signalling the potential for the collection to coalesce in a multiplicity of orders in response to the systems of thought that contain and constrain it.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evolution</field><field name="subject">science</field><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">process</field><field name="subject">sculpture</field><field name="subject">collection</field><field name="subject">classification</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080619.121144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Potential of the Internet in Arts Management: Content Analysis of Arts Organization Websites</field><field name="creator">Heo, Soonran</field><field name="description">This study is undertaken in response to the issue of incorporating traditional arts management effectively in online arts management via the websites of arts organizations. The aim is to investigate the introduction and implementation of websites in order to suggest effective and efficient approaches of management. This thesis contributes to online management and will enhance its perspective and enlarge its practice.       The study presents the design and development of content analysis to analyse the content of websites in order to create both quantitative and qualitative measuring tools that are unlike currently available commercial evaluation tools, which use purely quantitative and automatic measures. The sample consists of 102 arts organization websites from six countries: Australia, Canada, France, South Korea, UK, and USA. In total seventeen arts organization websites from each country from the Yahoo regional directory have been examined.       In this study, the website content analysis applied describes preliminary data that will shed some light on the current state of arts management, combining both on and offline application. The thesis articulates the three key functions that online and offline integrated arts management must incorporate in order to increase the value of utility and quality of their services delivered to audiences via the website. The framework of this study provides: 1. interactive communication dimensions between arts organizations and audiences via the website, 2. e-commerce features applicable to the website of arts organizations, and 3. other important and relevant features relating to arts management in websites in order to enforce the appropriate selection and allocation of different services, and to dynamically adapt to changes within those organizations. One of the most important contributions of this study may be that it has value for both academic and practical purposes in the implementation of arts management.       As a result of this study, low levels of interactivity were identified in arts websites. This result suggests that online arts marketing is not as interactive as it could be, but undergoes a technological innovation phase towards more developed exploitation. In terms of e-commerce, successful introduction and adoption of websites has been identified. Other traditional arts management features that were not included in interactivity and e-commerce were well represented in the content of websites. The outcome confirms the potential of the website in arts management as an indispensable venue for interactive communication, e-commerce, and other important arts management tasks, such as arts education.       By using content analysis, this study provides an evaluative measure for arts organizations that wish to use their websites more effectively, and it also affords a perspective on the current state of online and offline integrated arts management. The result of this study shows that arts management in the virtual venue is the same, or at least similar, to the real venue, and that websites allow arts organizations to coordinate online and offline integrated marketing management. This exploration of little known areas shows what visitors to the website actually communicate and contribute, which indicates that there is ample room for development and research in this area.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">arts management</field><field name="subject">online arts management</field><field name="subject">arts marketing</field><field name="subject">arts organizations</field><field name="subject">website content analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080619.122504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moving forward in service research: a conceptual and empirical contribution</field><field name="creator">White, Christopher James</field><field name="description">The broad aim of this research program was to advance theoretical and practical knowledge of service quality, customer satisfaction and loyalty intentions.

The current research program began in 2003 with the first published output appearing in 2004. The program was completed in 2007. It consists of nine peer reviewed publications that have been classified into three distinct phases. In many respects it was an evolutionary process, in that earlier findings identified the questions for proceeding research, and while service quality, customer satisfaction and customer loyalty intentions were of primary concern, other constructs were also examined. These were cultural values, work values, consumption emotions, mood and destination image.       The unit of analysis in all of the articles was individuals, as opposed to organisations, and as such, the theories and concepts that were examined and tested throughout the research program have their origins in psychology.

The particular characteristics of the Thai language (e.g. no capital letters, no break between words, Thai script etc.) present some interesting challenges for online Thai surveys. This experimental study investigated web-based survey design principles based on an English language background trial at a Thai university with individual interviews and focus groups with the use of think aloud and other research techniques. The findings of two types of web usability tests revealed that the scrolling web-based format was the most suitable for conducting surveys and that such surveys are most likely to attract higher response rates when endorsed  by a trusted organization, when instructions are short, simple and specific, when closed and dichotomous questions provide sufficient answer options and when matrix and semantic differential questions are limited.

The expansive nature of the corrosion process results in cracking of the concrete and eventually spalling. In order to select suitable remedial measures it is necessary to make an assessment of the residual strength and the residual life.      In order to investigate the effect of corrosion on bond strength of the reinforcement, specimens comprising square prismatic sections containing steel reinforcement in the four corners have been subjected to a wet-dry cycle and corrosion has been accelerated by polarising the bars. The research has studied the change of bond strength with level of corrosion for 12 mm and 16 mm bars with concrete cover of 1 and 3 times the bar size. The bond strength is assessed by means of pull out tests and the corresponding extent of corrosion has been assessed in terms of the mass loss. Observations and measurements of the form of the corrosion (pit dimensions and loss of bar diameter) are also presented.      The relationship between bond strength and surface crack width has been investigated. Results show that the surface crack width may be a good indicator of residual bond strength. In addition, the influence on bond strength of concrete compressive strength, reinforcement cover, bar position and bar size on the change of bond strength has been explored.      It should be noted that all conclusions drawn in this project are based on tests on specimens without shear reinforcement (unconfined) and that accelerated corrosion (by impressed current) has been adopted. Consequently, care should be exercised in applying these results directly to structures in the field. Additional research is needed to assess the influence of impressed current on crack patterns and the effect of shear reinforcement.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reinforcement  corrosion</field><field name="subject">Concrete durability</field><field name="subject">Bond strength</field><field name="subject">Impressed current</field><field name="subject">Crack width</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080530.091350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC ) for drug analysis</field><field name="creator">Song, Shin Miin</field><field name="description">Separation technologies have occupied a central role in the current practices of analytical methods used for drug analysis today. As the emphasis in contemporary drug analysis shifts towards ultra-trace concentrations, the contribution from unwanted matrix interferences takes on greater significance. In order to single out a trace substance with confidence from a rapidly expanding list of drug compounds (and their metabolites) in real complex specimens, analytical technologies must evolve to keep up with such trends. Today, the task of unambiguous identification in forensic toxicology still relies heavily upon chromatographic methods based on mass spectrometric detection, in particular GC-MS in electron ionisation (EI) mode. Although the combined informing power of (EI) GC-MS has served faithfully in a myriad of drug application studies to date, we may ask if (EI) GC-MS will remain competitive in meeting the impending needs of ultra-trace drug analysis in the fut ure? To what extent of reliability can sample clean-up strategies be used in ultra-trace analysis without risking the loss of important analytes of interest? The increasing use of tandem mass spectrometry with one-dimensional (1D) chromatographic techniques (e.g. GC-MS/MS) at its simplest, considers that single-column chromatographic analysis with mass spectrometry alone is not sufficient in providing unambiguous confirmation of the identity of any given peak, particularly when there are peak-overlap. Where the mass spectra of the individual overlapping peaks are highly similar, confounding interpretation of their identities may arise. By introducing an additional resolution element in the chromatographic domain of a 1D chromatographic system, the informing power of the analytical system can also be effectively raised by the boost in resolving power from two chromatographic elements. Thus this thesis sets out to address the analytical challenges of modern drug analysis through the application of high resolut ion comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC&#132;eGC) to a series of representative drug studies of relevance to forensic sciences.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multidimensional chromatography</field><field name="subject">GC</field><field name="subject">GC&#132;eGC</field><field name="subject">two-dimensional gas chromatography</field><field name="subject">chiral analysis</field><field name="subject">trace analysis</field><field name="subject">drug analysis</field><field name="subject">sensitivity</field><field name="subject">drug screening</field><field name="subject">time-of-flight mass spectrometry</field><field name="subject">chemical profiling</field><field name="subject">amphetamines</field><field name="subject">solid-phase extraction</field><field name="subject">solid-phase micro-extraction</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080627.114511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Total Skin Electron Therapy Using Beam Modifiers</field><field name="creator">Al-Khatib, Zaid</field><field name="description">The short range of low energy electrons from 2 to 9 MeV has made them useful for the treatment of superficial lesions covering large areas of the body, such as mycosis fungoides and other cutaneous lymphomas.

The oldest man in the sample was born in 1922 and the youngest in 1980.  Their understanding of what it was to be gay is historically contingent, for their lives spanned the greater part of the twentieth century: from when homosexuality was illegal through the less repressive but no less problematic eras of gay liberation and the HIV-AIDS epidemic.      Qualitative in approach, the thesis was based on oral history interviews.  Interviewees were asked set questions about their social, affective and sexual lives.  The sample comprised an old cohort of 22 men, a middle cohort of 30 men, and a young cohort of 28 men.  The majority of interviewees were of Anglo-Saxon or Anglo-Celtic decent.  The exceptions were Aboriginal men, and the children of migrants to Australia from South-east Asia and Southern Europe.      Interviewees' personal narratives included their experiences of the repression of the Cold War period, the exuberance, and, for some, personal confusion of gay liberation and the disco culture of the 1970s, and the trauma of the HIV-AIDS epidemic.  Through their life stories, the men in this sample illustrated the significant shifts in sexual attitudes and culture that Australia experienced in the latter part of the twentieth century.  Aspects of the lives examined included the men's experience of coming out and development of their sexual identity, their social and affective lives, and their involvement in the gay 'scene' and gay community.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ageing</field><field name="subject">coming out</field><field name="subject">gay liberation</field><field name="subject">gay</field><field name="subject">gay 'scene'</field><field name="subject">HIV-AIDS</field><field name="subject">homosexuality</field><field name="subject">life stories</field><field name="subject">oral history</field><field name="subject">relationships</field><field name="subject">sexual identity</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080627.144914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Road Maps - Navigating the Road Movie</field><field name="creator">Fiskaa, Sverre</field><field name="description">This Master of Arts project in Creative Writing was submitted to the School of Creative Media at Royal Melbourne University of Technology. It contains a full length feature screenplay for an un-produced road movie entitled Free Radicals. It is primarily a dark love story between the drug-addicted rent boy Roman and the budding actor, the protagonist Jonathan. It is however written in a conventional structure familiar to Hollywood professionals, and a good deal of humour is used to attract interest in the story. The storyline itself is more familiar to the audience of road movies and independent features in the US or European Art House ventures.       The exegesis explores the history and the conventions of the road movie genre, in addition to the established and not often debated conventions of screenwriting theory. The thesis attempts to show how these theories were applied to the screenplay and how they influenced the process of writing it within an academic and commercial context. The MA project shows how different expectations may create a conflict in the personal writing process and inspire a product that makes compromises.

Graphite oxide is a high modulus material that can be separated into thin layers with high surface area. The aim of this study is to prepare polymer layered graphite oxide composites using functionalised polyolefin to enhance compatibility with various forms of layered graphite oxide in varying concentration.    Functionalised polyolefins reinforced with layered graphite oxides and expanded graphite oxides were prepared using solution blending and melt blending methods. Three different mixing methods with varying shear intensity were employed to prepare polymer layered graphite oxide composites.    The crystalline structure, thermal and mechanical properties of the prepared polymer layered graphite oxide composites was studied. Oxidised graphite prepared from the Staudenmaier method and its exfoliated form were dispersed in poly(ethylene-co-methyl acrylate-co-acrylic acid) (EMAA) via solution blending to prepare EMAA layered composites. The thermal stability was determined using thermogravimetric analysis. The EMAA layered composites showed higher thermal stability in comparison with pure EMAA. The mechanical properties of these EMAA layered composites were determined through dynamic mechanical analysis. Shear modulus, yield stress and storage modulus of EMAA in the presence of graphite oxide fillers decreased.    A solution blending method was used to prepare poly(propylene-grafted-maleic anhydride) layered expanded graphite oxide composites (PPMA-EGO). Two types of PPMA-EGO were prepared using different mixing methods - low and high shear were employed. The effects of preparative mixing methods on the PPMA-EGO properties were investigated. The mechanical properties of PPMA-EGO obtained from dynamic mechanical analysis indicated that EGO had a reinforcing effect on the elastic behaviour of PPMA-EGO. This is due to strong interfacial adhesion between PPMA and EGO as a result of hydrogen bonding. The elastic behaviour of PPMA-EGO was affected by the surface area of graphite flakes. Low sheared PPMA-EGO elastic behaviour was found to be higher compared with that of high sheared PPMA-EGO.    A melt blending method was used to prepare PPMA-EGO with varying EGO concentration. The interconnected network structure of EGO in the PPMA-EGO was not observed as shown by its scanning electron microscopy images. Thermogravimetric analysis of PPMA-EGO indicates increased decomposition temperature of the PPMA matrix. Dynamic mechanical analysis showed enhanced storage modulus of PPMA-EGO. The maximum elastic modulus of PPMA-EGO was observed at 3 %wt of EGO. The electrical conductivity of PPMA-EGO was measured only for EGO concentrations above 2 %wt. The EGO concentration was found to be the most critical factor in the enhancement of the electrical conductivity of PPMA-EGO.   Wide angle X-ray diffraction analysis of all polymer layered graphite oxide composites revealed no change in interlayer spacing of graphite layers, indicating the absence of EMAA intercalation in the graphite layers.    The crystallisation temperature and crystallinity of all polymer layered graphite oxide composites were determined using differential scanning calorimetry. The results indicated that graphite oxide and expanded graphite oxides acted as nucleating agents in inducing the crystallisation of functionalised polyolefin in the layered composites.

In Australia, allergic rhinitis affects 16% of the population. Increasingly, patients are seeking alternative therapies especially acupuncture for allergic diseases.    Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of persistent allergic rhinitis.    Methods: Eighty (80) subjects aged between 16 and 70 were randomly assigned to either real or sham acupuncture groups. Each patient received either real or sham acupuncture treatments twice per week for the period of eight weeks. Daily symptom scores by subjects using five-point scale was employed as the primary outcome measure to assess the severity of nasal symptoms every day. The secondary outcome measures were rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (RQLQ) and relief medication scores. Relief medication scores were recorded every day by subjects whereas RQLQ assessment was monitored fortnightly throughout the trial and at the end of three-month follow-up period.     Results: Compared to the control group, the real acupuncture group demonstrated more improvement of nasal symptoms after eight-week treatment and significant after the follow-up periods. Significant differences between the two groups were also shown in terms of RQLQ. While there were not significantly Relief medication scores were more reduced in real acupuncture group than those in control group, although the differences were not significant. Both real and sham acupuncture treatments were well tolerated.    Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that acupuncture is potentially an effective and safe option of treatment for persistent allergic rhinitis and it may improve patients' quality of life.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acupuncture</field><field name="subject">Persistent allergic rhinitis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080701.165246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tumour Control and Normal Tissue Complication Probabilities: Can they be correlated with the measured clinical outcomes of prostate cancer radiotherapy?</field><field name="creator">Hornby, Colin</field><field name="description">The chief aim in developing radiation treatment plans is to maximise tumour cell kill while minimising the killing of normal cells. The acceptance by a radiation oncologist of a radiation therapy treatment plan devised by the radiation therapist, at present is largely based on the oncologists' previous clinical experience with reference to established patterns of treatment and their clinical interpretation of the dose volume histogram.    Some versions of radiotherapy planning computer software now incorporate a function that permits biologically based predictions about the probability of tumour control (TCP) and/or normal tissue complications (NTCP). The biological models used for these probabilities are founded upon statistical and mathematical principles as well as radiobiology concepts. TCP and NTCP potentially offer the capability of being able to better optimise treatments for an individual patient's tumour and normal anatomy. There have been few attempts in the past to correlate NTCPs to actual treatment complications, and the reported complications have generally not shown any significant correlation. Thus determining whether either or both NTCPs and TCPs could be correlated with the observed clinical outcomes of prostate radiotherapy is the central topic of this thesis.   In this research, TCPs and NTCPs were prospectively calculated for prostate cancer patients receiving radiation therapy, and subsequently assessed against the clinical results of the delivered treatments. This research was conducted using two different types of NTCP models, which were correlated against observed treatment-induced complications in the rectum and bladder. The two NTCP models were also compared to determine their relative efficacy in predicting the recorded toxicities. As part of this research the refinement of some of the published bladder parameters required for NTCP calculations was undertaken to provide a better fit between predicted and observed complication rates for the bladder wall which was used in this research. TCPs were also calculated for each patient using the best available estimate of the radiosensitivity of the prostate gland from recent research.   The TCP/NTCP data was analysed to determine if any correlations existed between the calculated probabilities and the observed clinical data. The results of the analyses showed that a correlation between the NTCP and a limited number of toxicities did occur. Additionally the NTCP predictions were compared to existing parameters and methods for radiotherapy plan evaluation - most notably DVHs. It is shown that NTCPs can provide superior discriminatory power when utilised for prospective plan evaluation. While the TCP could not be correlated with clinical outcomes due to insufficient follow-up data, it is shown that there was a correlation between the TCP and the treatment technique used.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NTCP</field><field name="subject">TCP</field><field name="subject">dose volume histogram</field><field name="subject">normal tissue complication probability</field><field name="subject">tumour control probability</field><field name="subject">radiation therapy</field><field name="subject">radiobiology</field><field name="subject">prostate cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080702.123739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in Development and Design of Hi-Performance Yarns.</field><field name="creator">Kanesan, Jayaprakash</field><field name="description">The aim of the research was to produce hollow yarn knitted fabrics with improved   thermal comfort properties.

It is an acknowledgement of their global significance, and of their mysterious and mythic presence in legend and history. The main body of the research and studio practice focuses on the Murray-Darling River System. Contained within the research there is a store of personal knowledge and memories of a complex river network. I view this research as my personal tribute. Some of the most important environmental challenges currently faced by us as a community in the twenty first century are water quality and water usage. By understanding and integrating people's needs, and ensuring that the communities in the Basin are able to engage in the process of change, a sense of identity can be fostered, so that long - term sustainability becomes a shared goal. Salinity, algal blooms, trading water property rights, and establishing a balance between the needs of the environment and the needs of the communities  in the consumption of water are some of the strategies that are planned under the Murray - Darling Basin Initiative. For my exploration into the environment, ecology and poetry of water paths, I have researched and will discuss the work of a number of contemporary visual artists, and quoted from works of both writers and poets, to further illustrate aspects of a water path and landscape environment. My selection is primarily governed by artworks that specifically reference the human traces that mark or imprint on the landscape, water paths in the riverine landscape and the linked ecology. By reflecting on the broader position of water, its usage and control, it can be seen how this factor relates to the health of our ecological environment, and the most likely impact water usage and control will have in the future. Through both studio research and exegesis, I encapsulate a key part of childhood memory and significance of place, and established a sense of its importance within my integral identity. Simultaneo usly, the research explores the duality of this river environment and its atmospheric moods. I encompass the meditative qualities and beauty of this specific river environment, and include some investigation of social and ecological factors related to the presence and usage of water in the Murray - Darling Basin.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Murryay-Darling Basin</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080702.144923</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refrain: postmodern confessions.</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Andrew Hugh</field><field name="description">The creative component of my project is a conteporary, confessional novel, Refrain.

Now he returns alone to the suburban backwater he'd tried so hard to escape, ready for stability and responsibility. However, his attempts to reinvent himself in this world of chronic unemployment and limited horizons are thrown into confusion by old friends, estranged fmaily members, an unresolved attachment, and by his musical successor - a volatile young woman with her own problems, who draws him back to things he'd rather forget and towards a future he isn't ready to face.

External local communities and society at large   are a very significant reservoir of social capital for any organisation and, in a global era of constant   change, relations between organisations and these wider communities need constant replenishment and   repair. The business literature gives insufficient attention to this vital connection between social and   the other forms of capital that have traditionally been given regarded as the mainstay of business   enterprise. Through a combination of theoretical debate and field research, this thesis asserts that tacit   knowledge is embedded in social capital which is itself acknowledged as the principal source of all   human and information capital within organisations.   Corporate citizenship programs have a pivotal role to ensure and sustain the flow of social capital and   knowledge between organisations and the communities in which they are embedded. Drawing on the   prior established connection between social capital and tacit knowledge, the thesis establishes that   corporate community involvement by employees has the potential to develop or enhance the   propensity to trust, leading to greater effectiveness in teams.   Multinational Banks are widely viewed as the agents of transnational capital. The Australian banking   sector has also been under constant community pressure in Australia because of rising fees and   charges and a few prominent scandals. Using secondary data, practices in one Canadian bank are   compared to corresponding programs at two major Australian banks to gauge relative investment   strategies in social capital generation. This thesis then proceeds to present primary research data on   corporate citizenship practices in two Australian banking institutions, one an Australian multinational   bank and the other a self-styled 'community' bank.   Literature surveyed on corporate citizenship and community involvement has not revealed awareness   by corporations of the possibilities of community involvement by employees as being sources of new   knowledge, skills, creativity and innovation. This is further confirmed by the field research which   showed communication as being a major hurdle internally and externally. This thesis shows that in   the knowledge era where learning organizations will have a definite competitive advantage, structured   employee involvement in corporate community initiatives can yield long lasting dividends and   sustainable competitive advantage in terms of knowledge acquisition. This can be made possible by   investment in social capital of local communities and societies through employee involvement. In turn   this can aid recruitment, morale and retention of staff. However, a new approach, perhaps a new 'state   of mind' needs to be cultivated in business enterprises and in the business education programs of   business schools worldwide.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Globalisation</field><field name="subject">social capital</field><field name="subject">corporate social responsibility</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080702.162807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on Andrographis paniculata   (Burm. f.)

As 80% of the country's land is covered by tropical rainforest, Brunei Darussalam may have some medicinal plants with unique characteristics of secondary metabolites. Some plants such as Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don and  Eurycoma longifolia Jack have long been used by the local communities to treat various disease conditions. However, no research has been done in terms of the constituents or biological activities of the Brunei Darussalam medicinal plants.

This effect has not been examined in patients with chronic pain. In this thesis, a randomised, double-blind, sham acupuncture-controlled study was reported. The trial aimed to evaluate the effect of EA in reducing OLM consumption in patients with chronic non-malignant pain.    Methods: Thirty-five patients were recruited from a multidisciplinary pain management clinic in Melbourne. After a two-week baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned to one of the two groups by a computer generated randomisation sequence: real EA (REA, n = 17) or sham EA (SEA, n = 18). The REA group received 2/100 Hz EA stimulation on two pairs of acupoints (Zusanli ST36 and Fenglong ST40 on one leg and Hegu LI4 and Quchi LI11 on one arm) and manual acupuncture on an additional five chosen acupoints for 30 minutes. The SEA group received superficial needling on non-acupoints without Deqi sensation or electrical stimulation. Both groups received treatment twice a week for six weeks. Participants were followed up for 12 weeks at intervals of four weeks. During the trial, participants were given clear instructions on how to reduce their OLM usage. A researcher telephoned the participants three times during the trial to encourage them to reduce OLM intake. The assessor, researcher and participants  were blinded to treatment allocation.    Outcome measures: The primary outcome measures included OLM consumption, related side effects, dosage of non-opioid analgesics and the intensity and unpleasantness of pain. These measures were recorded daily for two weeks before the intervention, six weeks during the treatment period and three times during the follow up period. Secondary outcome measures were depression and quality of life as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the Medical Outcome Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36), respectively. Data were analysed with independent t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) where appropriate and per protocol analysis was employed.    Results: Nine participants withdrew from the study. At baseline, the two groups were comparable on all demographic characteristics and major outcome variables except for the average intensity of pain. During the treatment period, the reduction of OLM consumption was more rapid in the REA group (64%) than in the SEA (46%) (ANOVA, p less than 0.05). The effect was maintained for four weeks in the REA group. There were no differences in the improvement of all other measures between the two groups. The incidence of EA-related adverse events (AEs) per treatment was 21% and 10% in the REA and SEA groups, respectively. All AEs were minor. Over 90% of the participants were satisfied with the treatments given and would recommend EA to others. The blinding was successful.   Conclusions: EA could be an effective and safe treatment for reducing OLM consumption for patients with chronic pain, and may be used as an adjunct therapy in chronic pain management. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electro-acupuncture</field><field name="subject">opioid consumption</field><field name="subject">chronic pain</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080703.161141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chronik disorder</field><field name="creator">Davis, Sally</field><field name="description">The research and project   The Chronik Disorder project consists of an exegesis and screenplay.

A single layered aperture coupled microstrip patch antenna has been optimised to match the source reflection coefficient of a transistor in designing an active antenna. The active aperture coupled microstrip patch antenna was optimised to satisfy Global Positioning System (GPS) frequency specifications.      A rudimentary aperture coupled microstrip patch antenna consists of a rectangular antenna element etched on the top surface of two dielectric substrates. The substrates are separated by a ground plane and a microstrip feed is etched on the bottom surface. A rectangular aperture in the ground plane provides coupling between the feed and the antenna element. This type of antenna, which conveniently isolates any circuit at the feed from the antenna element, is suitable for integrated circuit design and is simple to fabricate. An active antenna design directly couples an antenna to an active device, therefore saving real estate and power. This thesis focuses on designing an aperture coupled patch antenna directly coupled to a low noise amplifier as part of the front end of a GPS receiver.      In this work an in-house software package, dubbed ACP by its creator Dr Rod Waterhouse, for calculating aperture coupled microstrip patch antenna performance parameters was linked to HP-EEsof, a microwave computer aided design and simulation package by Hewlett-Packard. An ANSI C module in HP-EEsof was written to bind the two packages. This process affords the client the benefit of powerful analysis tools offered in HP-EEsof and the fast analysis of ACP for seamless system design. Moreover, the optimisation algorithms in HP-EEsof were employed to investigate which algorithms are best suited for optimising patch antennas. The active antenna design presented in this study evades an input matching network, which is accomplished by designing the antenna to represent the desired source termination of a transistor. It has been demonstrated that a dual-band microstrip patch antenna can be successfully designed to match the source reflection coefficient, avoiding the need to insert a matching network.      Maximum power transfer in electrical circuits is accomplished by matching the impedance between entities, which is generally acheived with the use of a matching network. Passive matching networks employed in amplifier design generally consist of discrete components up to the low GHz frequency range or distributed elements at greater frequencies. The source termination for a low noise amplifier will greatly influence its noise, gain and linearity which is controlled by designing a suitable input matching network.      Ten diverse search methods offered in HP-EEsof were used to optimise an active aperture coupled microstrip patch antenna. This study has shown that the algorithms based on the randomised search techniques and the Genetic algorithm provide the most robust performance. The optimisation results were used to design an active dual-band antenna.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">active antenna</field><field name="subject">aperture coupled patch antenna</field><field name="subject">direct search</field><field name="subject">genetic algorithm</field><field name="subject">gauss-newton search</field><field name="subject">global positioning system</field><field name="subject">gradient search</field><field name="subject">least Pth</field><field name="subject">least squares</field><field name="subject">low noise amplifier</field><field name="subject">microstrip patch antenna</field><field name="subject">minimax</field><field name="subject">optimisation</field><field name="subject">quasi-newton search</field><field name="subject">random search</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20060307.144507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Changing Face of Play in Australian Primary School Playgrounds</field><field name="creator">Chancellor, Barbara</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the play of children in three Melbourne primary school playgrounds, in diverse socio-economic areas.

The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effects of LTrPs on the muscle activation patterns (MAPs) of key shoulder girdle muscles during scapular plane elevation of the arm in the unloaded, loaded and fatigued states. In connection with the main aim, a preliminary study was carried out to examine the frequency with which LTrPs occur in the scapular positioning muscles in a group of normal subjects.       After establishing intra-examiner reliability for the clinical examination process, 154 healthy subjects volunteered to be screened for normal shoulder girdle function, then undergo a physical examination for LTrPs in the trapezius, rhomboids, levator scapulae, serratus anterior and the pectoralis minor muscles bilaterally. Of these 'healthy' subjects, 89.8% had at least one LTrP in the scapular positioning muscles (mean=10.65 &#177; 6.8, range=1-27), with serratus anterior and upper trapezius harbouring the most LTrPs on average (2.46 &#177; 1.8 and 2.36 &#177; 1.3 respectively). Consistent with clinical opinion, this study found that LTrPs occur commonly in the scapular positioning muscles.       To investigate the motor effects of LTrPs, surface electromyography (sEMG) was used to measure the timing of muscle activation of the upper and lower trapezius and serratus anterior (upward scapular rotators), the infraspinatus (rotator cuff) and middle deltoid (arm abductor). These studies found that LTrPs housed in the scapular upward rotator muscles affected the timing of activation and increased the variability of the activation times of this muscle group and were also associated with altered timing of activation in the functionally related but LTrP-free infraspinatus and middle deltoid. Compared with the control group (all muscles LTrP-free), the MAPs of the LTrP group appeared to be sub-optimal, particularly in relation to preserving the subacromial space and the loading of the rotator cuff muscles. After the initial sEMG evaluations, the LTrP subjects were randomly assigned to one of two interventions: superficial dry needling (SDN) followed by post-isometric relaxation (PIR) stretching to remove LTrP s or sham ultrasound, to act as a placebo treatment where LTrPs remained. Where LTrPs were removed, a subsequent sEMG evaluation found MAPs to be similar to the control group in most of the experimental conditions investigated. Of particular note, when LTrPs had been treated and the subjects repeated the fatiguing protocol, the resultant MAP showed no significant difference with that of the control group in the rested state, suggesting treating LTrPs was associated with an improved response to fatigue induced by repetitive overhead movements.      In conclusion, the findings indicate that LTrPs commonly occur in scapular positioning muscles and have deleterious effects on MAPs employed to perform scapular plane elevation and thus affect motor control mechanisms. Treating LTrPs with SDN and PIR stretching increases pressure-pain thresholds, removes associated taut bands and at least transiently optimises the MAP during scapular plane elevation. Discussion includes possible neuromuscular pathophysiology that might explain these results.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Latent myofascial trigger points (LTrPs)</field><field name="subject">shoulder</field><field name="subject">muscle activation pattern</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080408.144402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nightscapes on open space</field><field name="creator">He, Hong</field><field name="description">The initial concept of my project started from my experience in China. The domestic increase of productivity, heavier workloads   and longer working hours have provoked an urgent desire for an increased quality of leisure, which has triggered an enormous   basic demand for comfortable houses with gardens in Chinese societies. But most Chinese people do not have a backyard or   a garden to themselves due to the high population density. Public open space has to compensate for this demand. Meanwhile,   with the quickening tempo of modern life and prolonged working hours, most people have to enjoy their entertainment and   social activities after daytime. Therefore, these public open spaces are even more highly used than during the day, people use   them as their backyard and for social gatherings. How these open spaces operate at night has had an enormous impact on   nightlife and its importance has been gradually recognized. The Chinese government is spending large amounts of money   constructing and upgrading the lighting in open space. But most of these projects do not address key issues associated with   lighting. For example, what the government considers 'good lighting' many people consider to be over-lighting or functional   lighting and even some lighting projects leave many functions of the space unlit, For instance, pathways or sidewalks are not   lit but the plazas and squares are. Those types of issues occur in many open spaces due to a traditional approach to the lighting   design process which tends to occur separately to the design process. Obviously most lighting projects do not really consider   the relation of light, space and people's use. When I came to Melbourne I found out that the City of Melbourne has a specific   lighting strategy, which is more about electricity saving and technical requirements rather than spatiality. In addition, many   lighting companies deal with lighting effect on surrounding landscape and architecture but are also not about spatiality.   So in order to understand the spatial qualities of lighting, my original research questions were: 1. Instead of traditional building   materials how lighting can be used to transform space and spatial quality in open space? 2. How does lighting spatially bridge   between site and street, site and building, site and context, eventually site and city? 3. I also wanted to consider the site's identity   at various scales.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lighting</field><field name="subject">china</field><field name="subject">space</field><field name="subject">spatial quality</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080715.142827</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ideology and literature : a study of society and literary criticism with special reference to the reception of Heinrich B&#246;ll during the 1970's</field><field name="creator">Martens, Erika.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 29-340.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">B&#246;ll, Heinrich, 1917-1985 Appreciation Germany (West)</field><field name="subject">B&#246;ll, Heinrich, 1917-  Political and social views</field><field name="subject">Criticism Political aspects Germany (West)</field><field name="subject">Literature and society Germany (West)</field><field name="subject">Politics and literature Germany (West)</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phm377.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:6623278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Professional Learning of Teachers    A Case Study of Multiliteracies Teaching in the Early Years of Schooling</field><field name="creator">Cloonan, Anne</field><field name="description">This study is a response to shifts in literacy education produced by the new affordances of multimodal texts and changing social dynamics as a consequence of an increasingly digitised, networked communications environment. Acknowledging the powerful influence of the teacher on student outcomes, the study involved intervention in teacher professional learning as a means for influencing print based literacy pedagogy to incorporate multimodality literacy practices.   This study is a case study of the professional learning of four teachers of primary school students over the course of eight months in a workplace based research project instigated by the researcher in her role reviewing early years literacy policy, programs and resources within the Department of Education, Victoria. Professional learning interventions deployed within a participatory action research methodology were found to be efficacious in involving case study teachers as researchers of their own practice and in enhancing teachers' professionalism in the operationalisation of multiliteracies. They also had the effect of impacting on professional knowledge, practice and identity.    The study indicates that schemas emanating from the New London Group's multiliteracies theory acted as stimuli for expanding teacher repertoires of multimodality pedagogies, thereby addressing disjunctures between digitised multimodal literacy and the existing print based literacy pedagogical knowledge. The deployment of a 'multimodal schema' influenced teachers to expand the modes of meaning taught as literacy meaning-making resources. Deployment of a 'pedagogical knowledge processes schema' influenced teachers' reflective practices resulting in more knowing and purposeful pedagogical practices. Used as an analytical tool, a 'dimensions of meaning schema' also illustrated patterns in teachers' choices, revealing an arbitrary character in the development of a metalanguage for different modes of meaning making.    Recommendations arising from the study addressed the areas of educational consultancy; educational filming; literacy policy development; multimodality; pedagogical knowledge processes; and participatory action research methodology. Future research agendas indicated by the findings were presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teacher professional learning</field><field name="subject">multiliteracies</field><field name="subject">multimodality</field><field name="subject">early years</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080716.161254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electronic Classroom, Electronic Community: Virtual Social Networks and Student Learning.</field><field name="creator">Harris, Lisa</field><field name="description">The capacity for online learning environments to provide quality learning experiences for students has been the focus of much speculation and debate in the higher education sector from the late 1990s to the present day.  In this area, 'quality' has become synonymous with engaging students in a learning community. This study reports on a qualitative research project designed to explore the significance of community for students when they study in online learning environments.      This project used three case studies to explore tertiary students' thoughts and expectations about community in the online environment. The research was constructed iteratively. Data from the initial case suggested the need to explore the relationship between the constructed online learning environment and the development of learning communities or what I have termed Social Learning Support Networks (SLSN). To explore this issue further, the project was expanded and subsequent cases were chosen that included fundamentally different types of online learning environments.      The project had two significant results. Firstly, students not only confirmed popular educational theories on the value of learning communities, but also described how this form of social connection might practically benefit their learning. Secondly, the project found that certain forms of synchronous online environments provided enhanced opportunities for students to form social connections that supported their learning.      This project provides new evidence of the benefit of community for students studying online and argues that future online learning environments should be shaped by five key principles designed to foster a sense of social connection between students.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eLearning</field><field name="subject">social learning support networks</field><field name="subject">learning community</field><field name="subject">online learning environment design</field><field name="subject">student centred</field><field name="subject">social constructivist</field><field name="subject">online learning</field><field name="subject">course management systems</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080717.144715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of solutes on the phase behaviour of phospholipid membranes.</field><field name="creator">Lenn&#233;, Thomas</field><field name="description">Severe dehydration is lethal for most biological species, however there are a number of organisms which have evolved mechanisms to avoid damage during dehydration. One of these mechanisms is the accumulation of small solutes (e.g. sugars), which have been shown to preserve membranes by inhibiting deleterious phase changes at low hydration. Specifically, sugars reduce the gel to fluid phase transition temperatures of model lipid/water mixtures. However, there is debate about the precise mechanism, the resolution of which hinges on the location of the sugars.   An experimental investigation into the effects of small solutes on the phase behaviour of phospholipid membranes is presented in order help identify the mechanisms by which solutes facilitate desiccation tolerance. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the first comprehensive phase diagram for the synthetic phospholipid DPPC over a wide range of hydration and solute molar ratios between 0.1 and 1.0 sugars per lipid. Over the same range of hydrations and solute concentrations Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) was used to measure the structural parameters of the membrane bilayers necessary to determine both the phase of the membrane lipids and the location of the solutes. SAXS was also used to conduct the first comprehensive study of the effect of solutes on the kinetics of the fluid - gel transition of DPPC over a range of both hydration and solute concentration. Finally, contrast variation Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) was used to quantitatively determine the location of the  solutes.      Data from these complimentary techniques are presented which show a monotonic relationship between both transition temperature and repeat spacing with respect to solute concentration. This relationship exists between solute:lipid molar ratios between 0.1 to approximately 0.5, after which higher concentrations of solute are shown to have no further effect on either the bilayer repeat spacing or transition temperature. It is proposed that the exclusion of small solutes into sugar/water micro-phases external to the bilayer can account for this behaviour.      A theoretical model previously used to describe membrane phase behaviour at low hydrations is modified to account for the presence of solutes between membrane bilayers. This model is shown to be in quantitative agreement with the experimental data up until approximately 0.5 sucrose molecules per lipid, the point of solute exclusion. Once exclusion is taken into account, the model is quantitative over the whole range of sugar concentrations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Membranes</field><field name="subject">desiccation</field><field name="subject">freezing</field><field name="subject">phospholipids</field><field name="subject">sugars</field><field name="subject">phase transitions</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080717.151318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A limited study of mechanical   intelligence as media</field><field name="creator">Middleton, Steven Anthony</field><field name="description">The project investigates mathematics, informatics, statistical analysis and their histories, the history of human engagement with machines, and illustrates some uses of artificial intelligence and robotic technologies as media.      It is concerned with, amongst other issues, the sentient and not sentient binaries offered in discourses on machine intelligence. The term intelligence is used to distinguish between human and not human. However, a non-human, the intelligent machine, has become incorporated into the processes by which our culture defines intelligence. Those processes were explored in phases of the project that focused upon various kinds of interactions between people and machines, particularly the ways in which those interactions are mediated by knowledge.      The discourses that underpin the field of mechanical intelligence spring from the same sources as the rhetoric that delineates human beings from all other things.      We make intelligent machines because we have something to prove regarding our own intelligence. The devices expose attributes considered in our culture to be intelligent. The size and technical sophistication of modern robots result from the expenditure of considerable funds across several disciplines. Such machines signify wealth, power and excess, despite any other significance their makers intend.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">robot</field><field name="subject">machine</field><field name="subject">intelligence</field><field name="subject">cyborg</field><field name="subject">psiborg</field><field name="subject">steve middleton</field><field name="subject">contemporary practise</field><field name="subject">art history</field><field name="subject">art theory</field><field name="subject">interactive media</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080717.161751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drop size distribution and interfacial area in reactive liquid-liquid dispersion</field><field name="creator">Rajapakse, Achula</field><field name="description">Emulsion explosives have become the preferred choice as blasting agents for numerous industries including mining, agriculture, and construction.  One of the most important components in such an emulsion is an emulsifier, which controls the emulsification properties of the explosive.  The present study involves the production of one such emulsifier, which is produced by reacting two immiscible liquids, PIBSA (polyisobutylene succinic anhydride) and MEA (monoethanolamine).  The study examines the effect of design variable such as the impeller speed, impeller type and the dispersed phase volume fraction on interfacial area.        Experiments were carried out in a 0.15 m diameter fully baffled stirred tank using a 6-bladed Rushton turbine impeller and a marine propeller. Drop size was determined using a microscope with a video camera and image processing system. The transient concentration of PIBSA was determined using FTIR analysis and used to estimate the volume fraction of the dispersed phase (&#131;&#214;). The effective interfacial area was calculated using the Sauter mean drop diameter, d32 and &#131;&#214;.  Impeller speeds ranging from 150 to 600 rpm and dispersed phase volume fractions, &#131;&#214; ranging from 0.01 to 0.028 were examined in the experimental study.      It was found that that the evolution of Sauter mean drop diameter, d32 has four different trends depending on &#131;&#214; and impeller speed.  At high impeller speeds and high &#131;&#214;, d32 values decrease initially and reach constant values after a long period of time.  This trend is consistent with the findings in previous investigations.  Under certain operating conditions, d32 values increase initially with stirring time to reach a maximum value and then decrease to reach a steady state value.   The presence of these trends has been attributed to the effect of changing physical properties of the system as a result of chemical reaction.  Results indicate that, in general, Sauter mean drop diameter d32 decreases with an increase in agitation intensity.  However a decrease in the dispersed phase volume fraction is found to increase d32. These trends are found to be the same for both impeller types studied.  Comparing the drop size results produced by the two impellers, it appears that low-power number propeller produces s ignificantly smaller drops than the Rushton turbine.            It was found that the concentrations of reactants decrease with time for all impeller speeds thereby leading to a decrease in interfacial area with the progress of the reaction. Interfacial area values obtained at higher impeller speeds are found to be lower in spite of lower d32 values at these speeds. Also, these values decrease with time and become zero in a shorter duration indicating the rapid depletion of MEA. The interfacial area values obtained with the propeller at a given impeller speed are lower as compared to those for Rushton turbine. They also decrease and become zero in a shorter duration as compared to those for Rushton turbine suggesting propeller&#161;&#166;s performance is better in enhancing the reaction rate.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heterogeneous reactions</field><field name="subject">Liquid-liquid dispersion</field><field name="subject">emulsion explosives</field><field name="subject">drop size distribution</field><field name="subject">interfacial area</field><field name="subject">stirred tanks</field><field name="subject">PIBSA</field><field name="subject">MEA</field><field name="subject">emulsifier production</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080717.163619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sources and antecedents of brand equity for online companies.</field><field name="creator">Rios, Rosa Elvira</field><field name="description">The area of Brand Equity has received considerable attention during the past twenty years. The importance of a brand emanates from the fact that brand recognition and positive associations with it create value for companies and consumers. This value is called Brand Equity and translates into monetary value. Until now, there is scant research on brand equity for online retailers to test whether theoretical frameworks developed for offline companies apply to online businesses. The study is an attempt to bridge this gap by developing and testing a comprehensive brand equity model with selected drivers (customer support and a mix of functionality and fulfilment marketing efforts) and sources (awareness, association of value and trust, and loyalty) of brand equity.   Grounded in a traditional offline consumer-based brand equity framework, a research model (at the aggregate level) for assessing brand equity of online companies is developed and tested using structural equation modelling (SEM).    	Several key findings are reported: First, a measurement model based on dimensions of awareness, associations of value and trust, and attitudinal loyalty seem to fit the data well. Measures have adequate reliability, convergent and discriminant validity. Secondly, from the SEM application, only value association and loyalty are potent determinants of brand equity. Third, awareness, trust and value associations contribute indirectly to create brand equity. Fourth, the hierarchical hypothesized relationships between the sources of brand equity are confirmed.   The final best-fitting (calibrating) model derived from the subjects that had bought from the online businesses under study was validated across a sample of subjects. Simultaneous model comparison using structural equation (by means of Chi square difference) confirms the tenability of the calibrating model. To test for the probability than an incorrect model will be rejected, power analysis was calculated. The results indicate that the likelihood of rejecting the hypothesis of exact and close fit equals 1.0.   			The second phase of the study involved brand analysis at the individual level. According to the calculations Amazon obtains slightly higher brand equity than eBay and puts it in first place, eBay is in second place, followed by Dell in third. CDNow is the worst performer and obtains consumer-based brand equity below average. The study offers contributions to both academia and business in several ways.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brand equity</field><field name="subject">online brand equity</field><field name="subject">brand loyalty</field><field name="subject">Internet brand equity</field><field name="subject">retail brand equity</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080721.120726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of future directions for victorian coastal residential property - exploring the myths.</field><field name="creator">Robson, Kathryn Mary</field><field name="description">This research provides an analysis of the disparate notions and ideas, to form an overview of the possible trends in residential property for the Victorian coastal areas of the Surf Coast and the Bellarine Peninsula.

My Research aimed to learn from Australia's Indigenous conscience to attain more culturally, ecologically and socially accurate modes of engagement with the landscape throughout design practice.  Stretching between Coober Pedy and Tweed Heads 'Being There' has become an exploration into the Landscape Architectural practice of engaging intimately with site and community through grounded techniques. In addition, the work aspires to engage with the idea of evolutionary design processes, which envisage landscape projects as points of open-ended interaction with site and place.   'Being there' is not only about spending time in one place, but also the techniques that these opportunities have given me such as documenting information gleaned through the eyes of local experts.  As a practitioner, I can not do this without appropriately engaging in the richness and complexity of place defined and revealed through the challenge of communication.  In this mode of design the processes of analysis and consultation act as lenses in curating the existing condition, defining its successes and failures in the cultural terms of people and place.  Here, in contrast to my former practice, the intent is that design recovers landscape, rather than recreating it.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal</field><field name="subject">Consultation</field><field name="subject">Communication</field><field name="subject">Analysis</field><field name="subject">Grounded</field><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">Place</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080722.123009</field></doc></add>
