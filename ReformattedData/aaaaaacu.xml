The two longest cDNAs encoded Vtgs with a complete suite of yolk protein domains and, based on comparisons with Vtg sequences from other species, they were categorized as VtgAa and VtgAb using nomenclature for multiple teleost Vtgs. The shorter cDNA encoded a Vtg that lacked a phosvitin (Pv) domain, had a shortened C-terminus, and was categorized as VtgC. Multiple distinct Vtg receptors (Vtgrs) with disparate affinities for binding the different types of complete Vtg ligands (Vtgs Aa and Ab) were discovered in the ovary of white perch. Ligand blots of ovarian membranes separated by non-denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using digoxigenin-labeled purified VtgAa and VtgAb resolved one large (200+kDa) receptor that binds primarily to VtgAa and two smaller receptors (116kDa and 110.5kDa) that bind primarily to VtgAb. Furthermore, in this species, the Pv-less Vtg (VtgC) does not bind to ovarian membranes in either ligand blotting or competitive binding assays. These findings provide the first evidence for a system of multiple Vtgrs involved in the specific uptake of dual complete type Vtgs and the lack of a receptor-mediated system for uptake of VtgC, thus providing for a new model of yolk protein deposition into teleost oocytes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06172008-105010/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Did Trade Liberalization in India Promote High Polluting Goods? &#226; An Empirical Analysis</field><field name="creator">PATHAK, SWATI</field><field name="description">Systematic removal of trade barrier across many industries during the early 1990s raised a debate over the role of trade on the environment. This thesis attempts to gain a deeper understanding of the environmental implications of trade liberalization in India. Data containing information on tariff rate, import, export, and production for 28 sectors from 1990 to 2001 are obtained from the World Bank Economic Review. To classify different trade sectors by pollution intensity, I used the three-digit International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) system. I used three different specifications with log of real production, export and import as the dependent variables in the empirical model. The coefficient of interest is &#206;&#178;_5 which measures the differential impact on the percentage change in the dependent variables, caused by tariff reduction from before to after trade liberalization and from lower to higher polluting industries. My result confirms my first two hypotheses that average tariff reduction (41 percentage point) from pre to post liberalization period increase the total production and export in high polluting industries by 16.4% and 106.6% respectively. The study concludes that differential impact of average tariff reduction during trade liberalization in India promotes heavy polluting industries.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06172009-105759/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays on the Application and Computation of Real Options</field><field name="creator">Marten, Alex Lennart</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents a series of three essays that examine applications and computational issues associated with the use of stochastic optimal control modeling in the field of economics. In the first essay we examine the problem of valuing brownfield remediation and redevelopment projects amid regulatory and market uncertainty. A real options framework is developed to model the dynamic behavior of developers working with environmentally contaminated land in an investment environment with stochastic real estate prices and an uncertain entitlement process. In a case study of an actual brownfield regeneration project we examine the impact of entitlement risk on the value of the site and optimal developer behavior. The second essay presents a numerical method for solving optimal switching models combined with a stochastic control. For this class of hybrid control problems the value function and the optimal control policy are the solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality. We present a technique whereby approximating the value function using projection methods the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality may be recast as extended vertical non-linear complementarity problem that may be solved using Newton's method. In the third essay we present a new method for estimating the parameters of stochastic differential equations using low observation frequency data. The technique utilizes a quasi-maximum likelihood framework with the assumption of a Gaussian conditional transition density for the process. In order to reduce the error associated with the normality assumption sub-intervals are incorporated and integrated out using the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation and multi-dimensional Gauss Hermite quadrature. Further improvements are made through the use of Richardson extrapolation and higher order approximations for the conditional mean and variance of the process, resulting in an algorithm that may easily produce third and fourth order approximations for the conditional transition density.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06172009-174406/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Devil You Know: US-Haitian Relations, 1957-1968</field><field name="creator">Coleman, Adam</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the relationship between the United States and Haiti during the dictatorship of Dr. Francois ?Papa Doc? Duvalier. In the wake of the Cuban revolution, the United States attempted to change its foreign policy in Latin America and the Caribbean. In order to prevent social upheavals that increased the probability of communist revolution in Latin America and the Caribbean, the United States tried to move away from its policy of supporting dictatorships and toward an anti-dictatorship policy that encouraged US-backed economic development and mutual hemispheric cooperation. Nevertheless, the primary goal of US foreign policy in Latin America and the Caribbean remained preventing the spread of communism. Because the United States so doggedly pursued its anticommunist policy over its anti-dictatorship policy, it found it extremely difficult to exert influence on countries with harsh dictatorial governments. In Papa Doc?s Haiti, the United States consistently failed in its efforts to operate an economic development program, peacefully push Duvalier from power, or influence him to reform his dictatorial policies. Because Duvalier efficiently and brutally suppressed all political opposition to his regime, there existed no one in or out of Haiti whom the United States trusted to replace him. As such, fearing that removing Duvalier from power would lead to anarchy (and possibly communist revolution) in Haiti, the United States felt it had no choice but to maintain relations with him. The United States? relationship with Duvalier exposed the flaws of its Latin American policy. Namely, that economic assistance did not grant the United States a significant degree of political influence in countries receiving aid, and that economic development projects were useless if the money never reached the people for whom it was meant. Moreover, so long as the United States treated the Caribbean as a Cold War battlefield, its anxiety about the spread of communism through the region made it virtually impossible to pursue an anti-dictatorship foreign policy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06182004-131920/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tillage and cover crop management influence weeds, insects, soil and crop nutrients, crop development and yield in organically managed North Carolina sweetpotato Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam. systems.</field><field name="creator">Treadwell, Danielle Dion</field><field name="description">In 2004, North Carolina supplied 46% of the nations' sweetpotato and generated 79 million dollars for the state but of the 16,000 ha in production that year; only 405 ha were managed according to federal organic standards. A three-year field experiment was initiated in 2001 to evaluate organic sweetpotato ?Beauregard? production systems that varied in cover crop management and tillage. Three organic systems including 1) compost and no cover crop with tillage (Org-NC), 2) compost and cover crop incorporated prior to transplanting (Org-CI), and 3) compost and cover crop with reduced tillage (Org-RT) were compared to a conventionally managed tilled and chemical control (Conv) production system using a randomized complete block design with six replications. All sweetpotato tissue macro and micronutrient concentrations were within sufficiency ranges defined by North Carolina Department of Agriculture &amp; Consumer Services. Sweetpotato N (4.6%), P (0.5%), and K (4.3%) tissue concentrations were greater in Org-CI compared to remaining systems at 60 DAP in 2004. Monocot and dicot weed density and biomass were similar between Org-NC and Org-CI each year, and with few exceptions were similar to Conv. In Org-RT, high monocot weed density limited sweetpotato vine above ground biomass (154 g m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) and total yield 11.2 Mg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) in 2002. In 2001, the percentage of No. 1 grade roots was at least 19% greater in Org-CI (65 %) and Org-NC (62 %) than Conv (50 %). In 2002, the percentage of No. 1 roots was similar among Org-CI (74 %), Org-NC (71 %) and Conv (67 %) and similar among systems in 2004. Root quality was assessed based on degree of insect damage by wireworm-Diabrotica-Systena (WDS) complex. In 2001, Org-RT had the highest percentage of marketable roots (68 %) compared to remaining systems (19-43 %). The number of marketable roots was similar among systems in 2001 and 2004, but reduced in Org-RT (1.3 Mg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to remaining systems. Means of wireworm (Melanotus and Conoderus spp.) densities per trap were significantly correlated with degree of root damage. Overall, organic systems performed as well as the conventionally managed system in at least one or more areas.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06182005-181203/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Colloidal Behavior of Polyampholytes</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yun</field><field name="description">Polyampholytes are polymers that have both positively and negatively charged groups in the same chain. In recent years polyampholytes have started to be used in papermaking applications, as well as in sludge treatment processes. Benefits, in the case of papermaking, have included increased dry-strength and faster removal of water. But the molecular mechanisms by which such benefits are achieved have not been fully understood. This thesis project focused on effects related to polyampholyte charge density. A series of polyampholytes with a fixed charge ratio but different charge density was used for the experiments. Analysis methods included pH titrations, streaming current titrations, and adsorption isotherms. From pH titrations the charge density of cationic and anionic groups under different pH were calculated. From streaming current tests the net apparent charge density under different pH was calculated. And from adsorption tests it was found that the highest adsorbed amounts were achieved in certain cases corresponding to the highest content of ionic groups on the polyampholytes. Adsorption depended strongly on pH. Substantial differences were observed when comparing results obtained with polyampholyte samples versus ordinary polyelectrolyte samples with same charge density of cationic or anionic groups.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wood and Paper Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06182006-220545/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of Naturally Occurring Fruity Fermented Off-flavor in Peanuts Using Descriptive Sensory, Consumer, and Instrumental Analyses</field><field name="creator">Greene, Jeffrey Lynnette</field><field name="description">Peanuts are a valuable agricultural commodity and roasted peanut flavor is the driving force for consumer purchase and consumption. The development of off-flavors is a major concern to the peanut industry and physiological differences (i.e. oil and sugar content) among the different maturity classes can influence the presence and/or absence of specific flavors. Fruity fermented (FF) is a common off-flavor found in peanuts and is developed when peanuts are cured at excessive temperatures (&gt;35&#186;C). Previous literature has characterized FF off-flavor using descriptive sensory analysis; however, there is little information on FF off-flavor using consumer evaluation. The peanut plant has an indeterminate flowering pattern meaning a range of maturities are present at harvest and the immature and mature peanuts differ in roasting and flavor quality. Immature peanuts tend to have more FF off-flavor than mature peanuts which results in a FF distribution within large peanut lots. The flowering pattern and heterogeneous distribution of immature and mature seed make it challenging to obtain an accurate determination of FF off-flavor in a bulk lot. Establishing links between flavor and volatile flavor compounds can be obtained by using sensory and instrumental analyses. Currently, there is little research published on the volatile components that contribute to naturally occurring FF off-flavor. The objectives of this research were to: i) characterize consumer?s perception of FF off-flavor, ii) measure the variability and determine the FF distribution in bulk lots, iii) and identify the volatile compounds responsible for naturally occurring FF off-flavor using sensory and instrumental analyses. Descriptive sensory analysis was conducted to determine the no FF and FF samples used for the consumer study. Two-hundred and eight consumers evaluated a control (no FF off-flavor), low (1.0 FF) intensity, and a high (3.0 FF) intensity using two different scaling techniques: category and line scales. Results indicated FF off-flavor negatively impacts consumer acceptance of peanuts and the line scales were more sensitive and showed more differences among the samples compared to the category scale. The second study investigated the distribution of FF off-flavor in peanut lots and the results indicated that FF intensity varied from lot to lot and within a single bulk lot. Solvent assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE), solidphase microextraction (SPME), gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and model systems were conducted to identify the compounds responsible for naturally occurring FF off-flavor. Volatile analysis indicated that ethanol and the esters previously reported as causing FF off-flavor were not detected in natural FF samples by solvent extractions; however, they were present in natural and artificially created Georgia Green and Flavor Runner 458 samples by headspace extractions. These findings emphasizes that the use of laboratory created samples should not be used to identify off-flavor sources in peanuts. Additionally, the use of analytical techniques to identify FF off-flavor in bulk lots cannot be achieved using ethanol or esters as indicators.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06192007-175623/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Semiotic Phenomenology of Visual Rhetoric: Communication and Perception of Attributes of Cultural Sustainability in the Visual Environment of Public Housing</field><field name="creator">Ma, Magdy</field><field name="description">An integrated framework comprising rhetoric, semiotics, and phenomenology was constructed to provide theoretical foundations for exploring public housing residents&#226; experiences engaging in the visual phenomenon of &#226;new signage&#226; and &#226;estate art.&#226; The focus of study concerns how design, meanings, and experiences of the visual objects evoke in residents a sense of cultural sustainability. A mixed-method &#226;concurrent nested qual+QUAL&#226; strategy was developed to approach the research problem. This theory-driven methodology embeds semiotics within the dominant strategy of phenomenology. The researcher began with self-reflection, or &#226;bracketing,&#226; providing a descriptive account of her own experience of the phenomenon. Qualitative interviews were then conducted in four housing estates with 26 participant residents including elderly people, workers, housewives, and students. Standardized questions elicited participants&#226; readings of designs within their social context; the questions were &#226;nested&#226; within informal conversations, which generated participants&#226; full descriptions, first-person accounts of visual experiences interpreted within a more personal context. Bracketing identified that a rhetorical situation exists in the semiotic neighborhoods of estates wherein relocated residents appeared to have &#226;a sense of disorientation&#226; and &#226;aspiration to prosper.&#226; These sensibilities were addressed through the design of name signs and public art. Socio-semiotic analysis of the visuals entailed seven cultural codes, representing cultural values underpinning the community. Phenomenological analysis captured residents&#226; lived experience of visuals as seven phenomenological themes. The themes formed a structure of experience, indicating what it is like to perceive attributes of cultural sustainability. Further, five interpretive positions, or essences of experiences were uncovered as underlying the experiences. A synthesis of findings shows that communication and perception of cultural sustainability involved the rhetorical encoding of intended positive meanings into the visual designs, which residents decoded to come up with cultural meanings that evoked thoughts and feelings about the vitality of their community and continuity of Chinese culture. It is a result of &#226;visuality&#226; &#226; interrelationships among design&#226;s persuasive power, visual signification, and viewing experience &#226; conditioned by residents&#226; interpretive positions. This dissertation bridges visual design and sustainability, unveiling their enhanced social values while integrated, and strengthens the knowledge base of both fields of study, especially by its theoretical and methodological implications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06192008-072312/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pre-service Secondary Mathematics Teachers&#226; Preferences of Statistical Representations of Univariate Data</field><field name="creator">Henderson, John Tolliver</field><field name="description">This study was designed to analyze if preferences for certain statistical representations existed for a group of pre-service secondary mathematics teachers. Twenty-three surveys were distributed to two classes of pre-service teachers enrolled in a mathematic education course and 18 competed surveys were returned. Questions on the survey focused on five major statistical ideas: (1) typical value for a data set, (2) standard deviation, (3) spread/distribution of a data set, (4) recognition/effect of outliers, and (5) comparing two or more data sets. Students were asked to indicate the representation that they found most helpful in answering these questions. Students chose from box plots, dot plots, histograms, and data tables. The conclusions drawn from this study involved the use of two types of statistical analyses combined with observed trends within the data. A goodness of fit test determined that within each of the main ideas, representational preferences existed. Confidence intervals were used in combination with observed preferences to determine if and where individual representational preferences existed. The results indicated that these pre-service teachers typically focused on median as typical value for a data set, felt that any of the graphs could be used to determine distribution, lacked a complete understanding of standard deviation, and that their initial focus on individual points when recognizing outliers developed into a more global view of the data as they reasoned about the outliers&#226; effects. Discussions and implications from this survey along with recommendations for future research are included.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06192008-130035/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of Stringently Controlled Vacuum Environments with in situ Surface Cleaning on Contact Resistance of Au and Ru Based Radio Frequency Microelectromechanical Switches</field><field name="creator">Walker, Matthew James</field><field name="description">Radio frequency microelectromechanical system (RF MEMS) switches have many promising advantages over solid state switches, particularly with respect to signal stability, cutoff frequency, insertion loss and power consumption characteristics. While gold has traditionally been employed for RF MEMS contacts on account of its chemical inertness and low resistivity, its softness has proven problematic in terms of reliability for commercial applications. The use of materials other than gold appears to be necessary, and a better understanding of the mechanisms causing premature failure has become increasingly necessary. Prior studies of RF MEMS contacts have been performed in air, nitrogen and vacuum environments that ranged in pressure from 10-3 to 10-7 torr. Since these studies were performed in conditions where condensation of contaminants can easily occur, their reproducibility is uncertain. The studies performed for this dissertation involved operation of switches in a stringently controlled vacuum environment, with in situ oxygen plasma surface cleaning and controlled hydrocarbon gas exposure. Three primary topics were studied, and are reported on herein: 1) The impact of in situ oxygen plasma cleaning on the resistance of Ru and Au-Ru based RF MEMS contacts in vacuum, 2) documentation of pentane and dodecane exposure levels that result in an increase in contact resistance for Ru and Au-Ru based contacts, and 3) switch lifetime measurements as a function of surrounding gas environment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06192009-085112/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Changes in Subsidies and Trade Interventions on the Sheep Industry</field><field name="creator">Deese, William Franklin</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to analyze the dynamic response of an industry to production subsidies and to trade restrictions on a competing product. Specifically I examine the U.S. sheep industry and compare the effects of a production intervention similar to the Wool Act and to a tariff-rate quota. I begin with a dynamic profit function and derive an Euler equation. I use the iterated generalized method of moments to estimate the demand for slaughter lambs, the Euler equation, and the demand for domestic wool. These equations are estimated separately using instrumental variable techniques to adjust for the endogenous right hand side variables and for future-dated variables, in which the number of instruments exceeds the number of parameters. In each case, the iterated generalized method of moment estimator converges and produces reasonable estimates. Separately I estimate the demand for imported lamb meat using regression with autocorrelated errors. I then generate equilibrium slaughter lamb prices and breeding stock levels for a base case, for the production-subsidies case and for the tariff-rate quota case. The equilibrium quantities and prices are generated from the solution to a variable-coefficient difference equation. A feature of the model is the effects of joint outputs, slaughter lambs and wool, are included in the model. Results are that re-imposition of the Wool Act increases breeding stock levels relative to the base case, although breeding stock levels continue to decline, and slaughter lamb prices also initially increase. Implementation of the tariff-rate quota raises slaughter lamb prices and lowers breeding stock levels relative to the base case. Effects of the tariff-rate quota are small compared with the re-imposition of the Wool Act.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06202003-075732/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deployment Dynamic of Space Tether Systems</field><field name="creator">Mantri, Parag</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to model and understand the deployment dynamics of space systems with long and short tethers. This research is divided into two parts; in the first part, a model for short and medium length tether systems is developed and simulated by solving equations of motion. A detailed parametric study is conducted after identifying important parameters affecting the deployment and studying the effect of each parameter on the deployment performance. Certain tools are developed to assist mission planners in predicting the deployment performance of a space tether system for a given set of parameters. The second part of the research is motivated by Space Elevator (SE) dynamics. SE is a futuristic and highly challenging technology based on the idea of connecting Earth and Space by an approximately 100,000 km long tether. The tether used for the SE would be deployed from Geostationary Orbit(GEO). With this motivation, the short tether analysis from the previous section is extended to the analysis of long tethers. A model for long tether deployment is developed and governing equations of motions are formulated. Critical parameters are identified and problems involved in SE deployment are investigated. Tether mass is initially included in the model, but it is found that that the mass of the tether has very little effect on the overall qualitative dynamics of the system. Hence, for further analysis, a massless tether model is adapted. Upon simulating the system, it is found that long tethers can be highly unstable during deployment and can crash onto the Earth. However, a considerable fraction of the tether can be deployed successfully without any external control mechanism before the instability manifests itself. Hence, alternate SE designs with shorter tether deployment requirements may be a possibility.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06202007-100101/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dirty Jobs: How Welfare-to-Work Caseworkers do the Dirty Work of Welfare</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Tiffany</field><field name="description">How do caseworkers do the dirty work of welfare reform? I examine this question in a case study of a county welfare office in rural North Carolina. Historically welfare has faced threats to its survival. To survive, welfare to work agencies need to appear effective to tax payers, state and federal politicians, and local communities. Caseworkers do the daily work to make this possible, but to do this work they have to convince themselves first. Caseworkers take the goals and rules given to them by federal, state, and county officials and they embrace and enforce these rules, but only sometimes. Caseworkers routinely bend the rules, but in ways that benefit the county more than the clients. This creates some ideological dilemmas for the caseworkers and to solve these tensions, caseworkers focus their attention on redefining themselves as a helper through a &#226;tough love&#226; parenting style. Caseworkers, they say, are trying to teach clients that &#226;the real world has rules&#226; and that there are consequences for not following these rules. Doing this dirty work has negative consequences for both the caseworkers and the clients.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06202008-164126/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natural Product Synthesis via [2+2+2] Cyclotrimerization Reactions</field><field name="creator">Teske, Jesse</field><field name="description">The transition metal mediated [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization reaction of alkynes is a highly convergent approach to the synthesis of polysubstituted carbo- and heterocyclic aromatic ring systems.

This study was initiated to monitor sediment and water quality by stable nitrogen isotope ratio analyses (IRMS) of snails and sediments, permeable membrane devices (PMD), polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCISTM), and conventional water quality analyses for the Conasauga River Basin. Atrazine, metalochlor, prometon, and simazine were the most frequently detected herbicides throughout the basin. Most of the ambient concentrations of detected organic contaminants are at or near the method detection limit and all are well below any aquatic life criteria. Recent evaluation of water quality criteria for ammonia and nitrate suggest that these criteria levels are not protective for mussels. Data suggests that a shift to livestock and row crop land-use results in greater water nutrient levels and increased &#228;15N signatures for aquatic snails. Mean &#228;15N values for snails collected at national forest sites are significantly different from &#228;15N in snails collected in agricultural areas of the Conasauga River Basin (Student t-test, p&lt;0.05). &#228;15N signatures of cow manure (6.71? wet, 8.40? dry) and poultry manure treated soil (9.47?) were similar to those of the snails collected in the agricultural areas of the Conasauga. Dissolved nitrate had elevated &#228;15N signatures that reflected the upper range of &#228;15N signatures for the aquatic snails. Elevated nitrogen isotope signatures indicate the fact that a shift in land use within in the basin is impacting the dominant nitrogen source to the aquatic environment. Continued evaluation of water quality criteria levels are needed to determine if aquatic habitats are viable for mussel reproduction, growth, and survival.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural Resources</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06212005-121444/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Azaleodendrons: Investigating Parentage, Fertility, and Effects of Polyploidy Among Hybrids of Deciduous Azaleas and Evergreen Rhododendrons</field><field name="creator">Contreras, Ryan Nelson</field><field name="description">Studies were conducted in order to develop a fertile form of the azaleodendron cultivar Rhododendron L. ?Fragrant Affinity? and determine parentage of this and two other azaleodendron cultivars. Wide hybridization can potentially lead to recombination of diverse traits and creation of unique phenotypes, but these hybrids are often sterile as is the case with the inter-subgeneric hybrid R. ?Fragrant Affinity?. Sterility in wide hybrids can either be genic or chromosomal; the latter may be overcome by induction of polyploidy which can restore chromosome homology and fertility. Initial cytological studies of ?Fragrant Affinity? showed bridges between bivalents in metaphase I and laggard chromosomes in anaphase I. In this study we successfully developed an allotetraploid form of R. ?Fragrant Affinity? using oryzalin (4-(dipropylamino)-3, 5-dinitro-benzenesulfonamide) as a mitotic inhibitor and chromosomal doubling agent. Genome sizes (2C) were determined using flow cytometry and found to be approximately 1.6 and 3.2 pg for the diploid and allotetraploid, respectively. Pollen viability, determined by staining and germination tests, was 4% and 0%, respectively for the diploid and 68% and 45%, respectively for the allotetraploid. No seeds were produced when the diploid R. ?Fragrant Affinity? was used as a maternal parent when crossed with pollen from viable diploid and tetraploid parents. The allotetraploid produced viable seeds and seedlings when crossed with pollen from either diploid or tetraploid parents, including self pollination, demonstrating restored male and female fertility. Additional crosses were successfully completed using the allotetraploid as part of an ongoing breeding program to develop new fragrant, cold hardy, evergreen rhododendron. Morphological analysis has historically been used to determine parentage of unknown hybrids. This can be difficult when the purported parental taxa have very similar morphology as in the case of the three azaleodendron cultivars R. ?Fragrans?, ?Fragrans Affinity?, and ?Fragrant Affinity?. The three cultivars are purported hybrids of R. catawbiense Michx. or R. ponticum L. and R. viscosum (L.) Torr., the three cultivars are very similar morphologically as are the purported parents. In this study, morphological and AFLP analyses were conducted to determine if these are unique cultivars or clones and to elucidate the parents. The three cultivars, potential parents from subgenera Hymenanthes (Blume) K.Koch (evergreen rhododendrons) and Pentanthera (G.Don) Pojarkova (deciduous azaleas), and related taxa from each subgenus were evaluated using 31 primer combinations. Morphological comparison indicated that R. ponticum is likely the evergreen rhododendron parent of R. ?Fragrant Affinity? based on intermediate petiole and leaf blade lengths and floral characteristics. Genetic similarity calculated using Jaccard?s coefficient of similarity was highest between the hybrids and R. ponticum among the evergreen rhododendrons and R. viscosum among the deciduous azaleas, respectively. Genetic similarities among the three azaleodendrons indicated that they are unique cultivars and not synonyms, but likely share the same parental species. A dendrogram generated using the genetic similarity matrix grouped taxa into generally accepted taxonomic groups and nested R. ponticum with the hybrids suggesting it is the evergreen rhododendron parent. Additionally, a plot of the first three principle components also showed R. ponticum to be grouped more closely with the hybrids. Furthermore, there were 18 fragments unique to R. ponticum and the hybrids, however no unique bands were found for the purported deciduous azalea parent, suggesting the original parent may have been a hybrid.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06222006-134637/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Character And Caring in the Context of American Football: An Examination of the Relationship Between Positive Youth Development and Achievement Goal Theory</field><field name="creator">Greenwood, Paul Brian</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to examine the relationship between the positive youth development constructs of character and caring with achievement goal orientation and ability level, variables associated with achievement goal theory, in the context of organized American football. A multiple methods-mixed data approach to the research was utilized with self-administered web-based questionnaires and face-to-face interviews in an effort to provide increased understanding of the relationship between these theoretical perspectives. Participants were male adolescents attending an intercollegiate football skills camp. Significant findings included a relationship between increased self-reported ability level and measures of character and support for an interaction between ability level and orthogonal achievement goal orientation on measures of character. Recommendations for the field and future research are included in light of the limitations of the study. This initial examination of the relationship between an emerging theoretical framework in positive youth development and achievement goal theory provides an important first step towards development of an applied and conceptual model for youth development through organized sport.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06222007-171050/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Diabetes Patients&#226; Trust in Their Physicians on Medical Care &amp; Health-Producing Activities</field><field name="creator">Lari, Nasim</field><field name="description">This research evaluates how a diabetic&#226;s trust in his physician, as measured through the area of communication between the patient and physician, and his travel costs influence his decision to obtain medical care and spend time on health-producing activities such as diet and exercise.

I used likelihood methods to study the impact of each of these factors on detecting association. In the presence of multiple disease susceptibility alleles, I found that power of the likelihood ratio test (LRT) declines less when based on haplotypes made up of tightly linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) than when based on individual SNPs. The result suggests that statistical methods based on haplotypes may be useful to identify and locate complex disease genes. Genotype errors can lead to excess type I error in nuclear family (case-parents) studies when errors resulting in Mendelian inconsistent families are corrected but other errors remain in the data. I developed a LRT for single SNPs or haplotypes that incorporates nuisance parameters for genotype errors and showed that type I error rate can be controlled at little cost to power. For nuclear family data in which missing parents and additional siblings create a diversity of family structures, I developed a unified approach to computing LRT power for a test of association. Comparison of LRT power with power of a family-based association test showed that LRT has greater power.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06232003-122033/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Cardiac Interferon Response to Reovirus Infection</field><field name="creator">Smoak, Kathleen Azzam</field><field name="description">Viral myocarditis may be caused by a number of different viruses, and the mechanisms of pathogenicity can be both immune mediated and/or due to direct cytopathic effect. While extensive research has been done regarding immune-mediated mechanisms, the mechanisms of direct cytopathic effect remain largely unexplored. Reovirus induced murine myocarditis is not immune mediated, providing for an excellent disease model. Reovirus induction of, and sensitivity to, interferon-beta (IFN-&#223;) has previously been found to be an important determinant for protection against viral myocarditis. There are many interferon regulatory factors that can both regulate, and be regulated by, IFN-&#223;. In the first part of this dissertation, transient transfections of primary cardiac myocyte cultures (PCMCs) were used to investigate the role of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) in regulation of IFN-&#223;. We found that while IRF-1 is downstream of the IFN response, it still plays an important protective role against viral myocarditis. In the next chapter, reovirus induction of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) was investigated in PCMCs and compared with a more generalized cell type, primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (PMEFs). Here we found that reovirus induction of ISGs is cell type-specific and interferon-mediated, yet levels of induction are discordant with viral induction of IFN. These results suggested that cell types that are prone to induction of IFN are resistant to induction of ISGs. In appendix I, reovirus induction of an Interferon Stimulated Response Element (ISRE) was investigated in the above mentioned cell types, providing insight into reovirus induction of ISGs and the cell type-specific response. In appendix II, the effect of IRF-1 on ISG induction was further examined by overexpressing IRF-1. These data indicated that IRF-1 could regulate ISGs and ISRE sequences, but that IFN may induce or activate a product that inhibits IRF-1 induction of these genes. In the final appendix, reovirus induction of the ISG, IRF-7, was investigated in PCMCs and PMEFs using real-time PCR. Here, we found that reovirus induction of IRF-7 is discordant with reovirus induction of IFN. Possible mechanisms of differential ISG induction are discussed in the summary of this dissertation to provide an overall picture of the cardiac IFN response to virus infection.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06232003-131502/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perfluorooctane Sulfonate-Induced Thyroid Hormone Disruption in the Rat</field><field name="creator">Thibodeaux, Julie Rene</field><field name="description">Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a perfluoroalkyl acid that has unique surfactant properties and is used widely in industrial and household products. Furthermore, PFOS is an environmentally persistent compound, and its presence has been detected in both humans and wildlife. The maternal and developmental toxicities of PFOS were evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats given 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg PFOS daily from gestational day (GD) 2 to GD 20. Controls received 0.5% Tween 20 vehicle (1 ml/kg). Serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the PFOS-treated dams were significantly reduced as early as one week after chemical exposure, although no feedback response of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was observed. The effects of sub-chronic exposure to PFOS (3 mg/kg/day for eight days) on thyroid hormone economy are further characterized in adult male rats, and the thyrotoxic effects of PFOS are compared to propylthiouracil (PTU), a classic goitrogen. This work substantiates the endocrine disrupting effects of PFOS, but fails to provide evidence for its physiological consequences in comparison to PTU based on two biomarkers of hypothyroidism: myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density and hepatic malic enzyme activity. Furthermore, in vitro static incubation of the pituitary is used to investigate the observed lack of response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. PFOS does not significantly alter thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) induced secretion of TSH from the pituitary. Therefore, it is not likely that PFOS-induced changes in circulating thyroid hormones are due to a disruption at the level of the pituitary.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06242005-103138/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure and mechanism of 16S rRNA in the ribosome studied by photocrosslinking</field><field name="creator">NANDA, KAVITA</field><field name="description">The ribosome is a complex RNA-protein machine that translates the genetic information contained in the mRNA molecule to a sequence of amino acids. This involves mediating the decoding of the mRNA sequence, peptide bond formation and translocation. Throughout the process of translation, the ribosome undergoes significant conformational changes. The crystal structures of ribosome and the ribosomal subunits have been resolved at moderate resolution, but the details of conformational changes at various steps of translation have just started to be understood. Both structural and biochemical techniques have been applied towards the understanding of the ribosome dynamics. UVB (far UV, 210-300 nm) radiation has been used to study the structural changes in 16S rRNA within the 30S ribosomal subunit by monitoring the changes in the crosslinking frequencies of RNA-RNA crosslinks. In the first part of this study additional RNA crosslinks in 16S rRNA are determined after &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; incorporation of 4-thiouridine (s&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;U) into RNA in a strain of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; deficient in pyrimidine synthesis followed by irradiation with UVA (near UV, 300-380 nm) light. Similar crosslinks are observed when synthetic 16S rRNA transcribed with s&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;U is reconstituted into 30S subunits except that there are a few conformational differences between in vivo and in vitro synthesized subunits. Crosslinks obtained from UVB and s&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;U-UVA irradiation show a striking similarity between their identity and location. All the crosslinks are found to be restricted in the 30S subunit making a reversed ?C? shape through the center of the subunit. These results predict local RNA conformational flexibility that is most likely the factor in determining the formation of the crosslinks. In the second part, the effects of initiation factors on the structural status of the 30S initiation complex are studied. The results indicate IF3 is the main player in determining the 30S structure during initiation and that its C-domain (IF3C) causes similar structural changes in the 16S rRNA.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06252004-153118/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alignment of Silicon wafers for 3D Packaging</field><field name="creator">Walker, Ernest Marshall</field><field name="description">Wafer level self-alignment is investigated with a Self assembled monolayer (SAM) deposition, SAM termination modification, friction dry and capillary alignment forces.

Excessive sediment from human activities in forested watersheds is of concern to responsible land managers. Prescribed fire is a common treatment applied to Southeastern Piedmont forests and is becoming increasingly important under the threat of higher fuel loads, and higher intensity storm events from changing land uses and climate. Several studies have been conducted to evaluate the impacts of fire on sedimentation processes with conflicting conclusions. Measuring the amount of runoff and erosion from fire-induced forested watersheds is difficult due to the high variability inherent in these systems. Erosion simulation models assist in relieving the time and resources consumed measuring these effects. The process-based Water Erosion Prediction Project (GeoWEPP) is widely used in the Western U.S. to predict erosion resulting from forest fires, but has yet to be tested in Southeastern Piedmont settings. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the GeoWEPP model in predicting sediment amounts from low-, moderate- and high-intensity forest fires on pine stands of the Sumter National Forest in the piedmont region of South Carolina. GeoWEPP simulation results were compared to observed sediment production from two ongoing prescribed burn studies in the Enoree and Long Cane Ranger Districts. Erosion measurements were conducted using 48 silt fences placed on hillslopes within 22 x 22 m plots. The measurements were collected biennially following low- and high-intensity prescribed burnings of the forested plots. The annual observed erosion amounts averaged 0.014 and 0.022-kg/m (width) for the Enoree and Long Cane sites respectively. Modeling results from the simulations of the same sites averaged 1.94-kg/m width of fence and 0.55-kg/m (width) annually. The model largely over predicted the amounts of erosion at these low levels. However, the average observed erosion amounts and average GeoWEPP predictions of 0.01 t/ac/yr were well below the tolerable soil loss value (T-value) of 0.41 t/ac/yr during the unburned, low-, and high-intensity forest fire conditions of the treatments. Predicted erosion exceeded this value only for high-intensity fires followed by high-intensity storm events (&gt;20-yr return periods). These results suggest that low-intensity fires may not elevate sediment loading above tolerable rates; however, higher-severity fires can cause soil erosion and sediment loading at levels of concern in water quality degradation. Land topography, fire intensity and soil surface texture type are key variables to predicting soil erosion and runoff. We conclude that this model may be a useful tool to land managers for evaluating and predicting the effects of fire on erosion following forest fires. This study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of the GeoWEPP model in predicting runoff and sedimentation in Southeastern piedmont watersheds. From this initial testing, recommendations were made to improve the model for applications in the Southeast.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural Resources</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06252007-113339/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Novel Anti-Biofilm Molecules Derived from the Oroidin Alkaloids</field><field name="creator">Richards, Justin James</field><field name="description">Bacterial biofilms are a surface attached community of microorganisms that are protected by an extracellular matrix of biomolecules. Within a biofilm state, bacteria are more resistant to antibiotics and are inherently insensitive to antiseptics and basic host immune responses. Biofilm infections of indwelling medical devices are also of major concern, as once the device is colonized, infection is virtually impossible to eradicate. Given the prominence of biofilms in infectious diseases, there has been an increasing effort toward the development of small molecules that will modulate bacterial biofilm development and maintenance. This, coupled with the spread of multi-drug antibiotic resistance across many of these bacteria, has put a tremendous burden on the medical community to alleviate biofilm related problems. Herein the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of small molecules derived from the oroidin class of marine natural products that both inhibit and disperse a number of medically relevant bacterial biofilms through a non-microbicidal mechanism is highlighted. This includes improvements to existing methodological approaches aimed toward the synthesis of these molecules in addition to the implementation of novel synthetic pathways which allow for the generation of diverse chemical libraries. Detailed structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies were performed with the ultimate goal of delineating which structural features of the analogues were essential for a biological response within the context of anti-biofilm activity. Preliminary toxicology studies also indicate that many of the analogues display non-cytotoxic properties, thus furthering hope for the use of these molecules in therapeutic biofilm remediation efforts.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06252009-105119/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes Wrapped by Various Polymers</field><field name="creator">Tallury, Srinivasa Syamal Sanmath</field><field name="description">Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess superior electrical and mechanical properties and thus are excellent candidates for nanostructured materials. Due to the very high length-to-diameter ratio of CNTs, they are ideal reinforcements for polymer nanocomposites. Engineering of the polymer-CNT interface through noncovalent modifications is necessary to achieve the desired mechanical properties and yet preserve the inherent properties of the CNTs. However, the effects of chemical composition and backbone stiffness on the adsorption characteristics of polymers are not well understood. Molecular dynamics simulations in vacuum were used to study the interaction between a (10,0) zig-zag type single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) and a series of polymers. These simulations investigate whether the polymers prefer to wrap the SWCNT, what the molecular details of that interface are, and how the interfacial interaction is affected by the chemical composition and structure of the polymer. The simulations indicate that polymers with both flexible and stiff backbones tend to wrap around the SWCNT, although in different conformations. Flexible backbones like nylon6 (N6) and poly(lactide) (PLA) wrap in a random conformation along both the longitudinal axis and the diameter of the SWCNT. One flexible polymer, poly(acrylnitrile) (PAN), preferred to extend along the longitudinal axis rather than wrap the diameter of the SWCNT as a means of optimizing pi-pi overlap between the cyano side chain and the SWCNT; PAN was the only flexible backbone polymer that exhibited preferential orientation of chemical groups along the SWCNT surface. Flexible polymers with bulky and aromatic side groups such as poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(styrene) (PS) prefer intra-chain coiling rather than wrapping the SWCNT. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), the only polymer with a semi-flexible backbone in this study, exhibited a partial wrap in an S-conformation along the side of the SWCNT. Polymers with stiff backbones such as poly(acetylene) (PA), poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV), poly(pyrrole) (PPy), and poly(arylene ethynylene) (PPE) exhibit distinct conformations upon adsorption. Helical-like wrapping conformations were only obtained for PPV and PPE. Aromatic groups along the backbone tend to dictate the adsorption conformation due to pi-pi interactions with the SWCNT, although the presence of bulky aliphatic side chains can have a slight impact on this interaction. Plots of the rotational moment of inertia of each polymer about the SWCNT longitudinal axis as a function of time quantify the interplay between intra-chain coiling and adsorption to the SWCNT surface. These plots indicate that the adsorption of polymers with stiff backbones tends to be a two-step process, whereas flexible backbones tend to exhibit a multi-step wrapping mechanism, especially those that have a preference for intra-chain coiling. To quantify the correlation between the chemical composition of the repeat unit and the conformational limitations of long polymer chains, MD simulations were also performed with small molecules that correspond to the repeat units of a subset of the polymers. These simulations indicate that the individual molecules have more conformational freedom, yet still exhibit some orientation characteristics similar to the polymers, such as adsorption of both aromatic rings and aliphatic hydrocarbons along the SWCNT surface.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06252009-181429/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">For Those Who Are Awake: A Collection of Stories</field><field name="creator">Ruane, Elizabeth Helen</field><field name="description">&lt;&gt; A collection of short stories allows a writer certain freedoms that the novel form does not.

This construction market covers a wide range of building usage, including apartment and office buildings, hotels, and schools. For years, standard C-shaped metal studs have been the only option for designers and contractors when selecting a cross-section for load bearing studs. As design loads for the studs get larger with heavier floor systems or at lower levels of mid-rise buildings, designers have been required to either use multiple (built-up) C-shaped studs or switch to structural steel members. An alternative to the standard shapes, although seldom found in the U.S., is the sigma-shaped section, but this shape is primarily used as a roof purlin in Europe. The Steel Network, Inc. of Raleigh, North Carolina recognized the potential of this section for use within a LSF system and developed the SigmaStud?. A testing program was developed for the SigmaStud? and testing was conducted at North Carolina State University?s Constructed Facilities Laboratory (CFL). Presented are the results of a series of tests to evaluate the web crippling behavior of a new sigma-shaped metal stud when subjected to lateral load in addition to axial load.

Many fish in the southeast U.S. use estuaries as juvenile nursery habitat, but are spawned on the continental shelf. Favorable cross-shelf larval transport pathways for fall / winter-spawned species off North Carolina have been theorized to occur as a result of seasonal circulation patterns of currents and episodic onshore movement of water masses. As a result, hydrographic fronts which separate the water masses; including the outer-shelf front and mid-shelf front have been linked to cross-shelf larval transport for several species. The objective of this study was to determine whether fronts on the continental shelf off the southeast U.S. influence larval fish distribution and cross-shelf transport. Ichthyoplankton and hydrographic data were analyzed in concert to determine if the presence of fronts on the shelf influenced larval distribution patterns or mean distance from shore of larvae. In addition, ?average? larval distribution patterns for each species were compared with the results from when fronts were present. Results indicated larval fish were not aggregated at fronts, though abundance and size distribution patterns and mean distance from shore of several species-size classes analyzed were significantly different when the outer-shelf front, mid-shelf front, warm Gulf Stream filament front, or Hatteras front (i.e., intrusions of Virginia coastal water) were present on the shelf. Average cross-shelf distributions of several species were similar to previous studies which led to the conclusion that cross-shelf larval transport was predominately driven by seasonal circulation patterns; however, present results verify that episodic events, such as fronts modify seasonal transport pathways.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06262007-095953/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling of RF Field effects due to MRI Fields in Patients with a Retinal Implant</field><field name="creator">JASTI`, SRINIVAS</field><field name="description">Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one of the most widely used clinical diagnostic procedures. Evaluation of safety due to Radio Frequency (RF) energy deposition and tissue heating in patients during MRI, especially in the presence of implantable prosthetic devices is significant for MR safety. The work presented in this thesis aims to characterize the interactions between the pulsed RF fields during MRI and biological tissues of a patient with a Retinal Prosthesis (RP) implant, in terms of Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) and temperature elevation. A logarithmically expanding grid Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) is used for computational modeling of the MR environment at 64, 128 and 256 MHz. Unlike traditional methods, expanding grid FDTD facilitates in accurate modeling of the region of the implant where a finer grid with cell sizes of the order of micrometers is used. Also, this technique greatly helps to reduce the constraints on computational memory and time. It was found that, while the RF magnetic field, B1, homogeneity decreases with frequency; power deposition in the tissues increases slightly. However, thermal elevation resulting from the SAR distribution as well as the induced currents in the RP implant, evaluated using the bio-heat equation, is observed to be minimal at these frequencies. These results provide useful information for RF safety guidelines during MRI at high fields.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06262007-105603/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wyatt's "My Mother's Maids" and the Perils of Ignorance</field><field name="creator">Brock, Kevin Michael</field><field name="description">Sir Thomas Wyatt?s epistolary satire, ?My mother?s maids,? is often overlooked by critics, purportedly because of the superiority of the poet's other two verse satires; and too often dismissed as little more than a straightforward retelling of the ?country mouse? fable in Horace?s Satire 2.6. However, Wyatt?s version does not merely endorse Horace's view of the superiority of the simple country life over that of the city and court. Indeed, his poem focuses attention on the inherent violence that characterizes the outside world regardless of the setting. In fact, Wyatt's poem is better read as a satire of its Horatian ?source,? genre, and central theme about the peace and contentment that can be supposedly found in the country. For Wyatt, exerting any effort to find peace outside of oneself is not only a chimera but a search that may inevitably end in tragedy. This inward focus is reflected beyond this satire in his lyric poems, where Wyatt's criticisms of his fellow courtiers for lacking such a focus grow more ambiguous, veiled by careful use of narrative personae. Wyatt ultimately argues that the only way to survive in the court is through a Stoic philosophy, turning inward and trusting only in oneself and the certainty of appearance as appearance rather than possessing faith in others or the outside world.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06262007-135435/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ghosts of Chances for Redemption via Abjection in Wilson Harris?s Palace of the Peacock and Others</field><field name="creator">Powell, Ethel Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis explores, in three works of literature, possibilities for redemption via abjection. Julia Kristeva?s semanalysis is the primary theoretical tool with which Aphra Behn?s Oroonoko (1688) is examined as a nascent work in Caribbean literature. Next, and central to this thesis, the Guyanese Wilson Harris?s The Palace of the Peacock (1960) is discussed within Kristevan context and within Caribbeanist literary critical context. Mariella, a central and fluid character in Palace, acts as a semiotic agent of destruction and of abjectly sublime redemption for Donne and his crew of river boatmen in pursuit of Other ethnically mixed peoples in Guyana?s interior. Donne?s moment of epiphany, wherein he comes to understand how inhumanely he has treated Others, is followed by his ?second? death and rebirth in a celestial palace (along with the rest of the crew), marking his and their transformation from abject slavers to abjectly sublime and redeemed beings. The semiotic linguistic characteristics of Palace are investigated: while written in the style of Magical Realism, Palace contains lexical and dialectal features stemming from African and Amerindian influences. Flannery O?Connor?s ?Revelation? (1965) is the final work examined. Via legacies of plantation slavery and ensuing discrimination against freed African-Americans, many works of Southern U.S. literature contain qualities of postcolonial literatures, particularly the element of abject Otherness. In ?Revelation? Mrs. Ruby Turpin?s ideas about abject Others are transformed, as she is transformed from an abject avatar of white Southern racism and classism, into an abjectly sublime person who receives a ?revelation? of her wrongs righted in a celestial march of all human beings. Her ?revelation? is markedly similar to Donne?s in Palace, both in what she sees and in the language employed to describe what is revealed to her. In Palace and in ?Revelation,? characters are redeemed by their limitations, by recognition of their abjections, and thus from these abject restrictions. Although Behn?s narrator aborts her encounter with an Other, she comes very close to actualizing abject sublimity as is evinced in a fractured and digressive narrative, indicative of the narrator?s conflicted psyche. At least she is conflicted about New World colonial enterprises and their institutions of brutal enslavement. Rather than abjure abject Otherness, perhaps readers?students of life and of literature?would embrace abjection, the eschewed Otherness within, as a critical agent for and means to the sublime.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06272005-105309/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the formation of sugar fatty acid esters</field><field name="creator">Adamopoulos, Lambrini</field><field name="description">This study aims at elucidating a variety of salient features that dictate the kinetics and chain length effects governing the formation and antimicrobial activity of sugar esters of fatty acids. To do this, anomerically pure glucose, sucrose and cellobiose sugars were transesterified with the methyl esters of fatty acids of variable chain lengths C4, C8, C12, C18, and C20. The methyl esters of butyric, caprylic, lauric, stearic and arachidic acids were reacted with the above carbohydrates to give the respective penta and octaesters. The kinetics of these transesterification reactions were followed by quantitative 31P NMR after phosphitylation of the labile OH groups with 1,3,2- dioxaphospholanyl chloride. This approach proved to be a facile and quantitative means to follow the specific substitutions occurring at the various OH positions within the sugars as a function of degree of conversion, and incoming chain length. As anticipated, a variety of steric and hydrophobic effects were shown to play a key role in determining the reactivity of these systems. The various sugar esters were then adsorbed onto cellulose disks and their microbial activity was examined. Finally, cellulose esters of butyric acid were synthesized using the acyl chloride process.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wood and Paper Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06272006-002917/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of Stresses on Induction Motors Due to Momentary Service Interruptions</field><field name="creator">Cavaroc, John Peter Jr</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents an assessment of the worst case stresses produced in an induction motor when the motor is allowed to ride through a power supply voltage disturbance. Results from laboratory experiments and computer simulations are shown. The experimental results are obtained from tests conducted on three squirrel cage induction motors, sized 10 hp, 50 hp, and 75 hp. Each motor is tested with three different load inertias, various motor loadings, and numerous interruption durations. The computer simulation results are obtained using a non-linear motor-load model, whose parameters are derived from a non-linear least squares parameter estimation technique. Experimental data acquired in the lab is used for the parameter estimation data and for the validation data. Deficiencies in the standard motor-load model are presented and addressed. Good agreement between the experimental data and the non-linear motor-load model data is achieved. Results show significant current and torque transients, but caused no significant damage to the motors or loads used for testing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06272007-001032/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Re-Analysis of the Skull of Acrocanthosaurus atokensis (NCSM 14345): Implications for Allosauroid Morphology, Phylogeny, and Biogeography</field><field name="creator">Eddy, Drew Richard</field><field name="description">Considerable debate has surrounded the phylogenetic position of the large-bodied theropod Acrocanthosaurus atokensis from the Early Cretaceous Antlers Formation of North America. Many phylogenetic analyses place Acrocanthosaurus as the sister taxon to the smaller- bodied Allosaurus, known from formations in North America and Europe, whereas others recover it as a member of Carcharodontosauridae, a derived group of large-bodied allosauroids that inhabited Gondwana. Re-examination of a well-preserved skull of Acrocanthosaurus (NCSM 14345) has provided new information regarding the morphology of the palatal complex and inner surfaces of the skull and mandible, features that were obscured by a sediment matrix during a previous description. From this revised description, twenty-three new characters were identified and added to a data matrix (164 characters; 17 terminals), the analysis of which recovered a single most parsimonious tree placing Acrocanthosaurus as a derived member of Carcharodontosauridae. This hypothesis is supported by several shared cranial characteristics, including: a sinuous medial groove for the maxillary dental lamina; a small accessory process between the quadratojugal prongs of the jugal; and a dorsal curvature of the jugal ramus of the ectopterygoid. The phylogeny recovered by this analysis fit significantly better with the stratigraphic record than previous hypotheses that place Acrocanthosaurus as more closely related to Allosaurus, a finding supported by visual assessment of phylograms and stratigraphic consistency metrics. An analysis of the paleobiogeography of Allosauroidea found Asia to be the most likely ancestral area for the clade, consistent with previous analyses. Distribution of carcharodontosaurid ancestors likely reached both North America and Gondwana during the Valanginian or Barremian stages, with Europe providing a connection between the two continents.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06272008-015218/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Screening Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) for Resistance to Downy Mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubensis)</field><field name="creator">Criswell, Adam</field><field name="description">Downy mildew, a foliar disease caused by the oomycete Pseudoperonospora cubensis (Berk. and Curt.) Rostow. is one of the most destructive pathogens of cucurbits. Resistant cultivars are available but nevertheless yield losses are high in North Carolina and Poland if fungicides are not used. The first objective of this experiment was to test all available plant introduction accessions from the U.S. National Plant Germplasm System of cucumber for downy mildew resistance under field conditions. The 1289 cultigens were tested at Clinton NC, USA, and Skierniewice, Poland during 2005-2007 under natural field epidemics of the disease. Averaged over locations, eighty-one cultigens were classified as highly resistant, 130 as moderately resistant, 406 as intermediate, 408 as moderately susceptible, and 271 as highly susceptible. The 40 most resistant and 10 most susceptible cultigens from these field trials, were further evaluated in replicated field and greenhouse experiments in North Carolina, along with 22 check cultivars. Results from the retest study in North Carolina confirmed the results of the initial screening study, although the range of downy mildew ratings in the North Carolina field retest were much narrower compared with the screening results obtained in the larger study. The most resistant and most susceptible lines in the screening study were also the most resistant and most susceptible lines in the field retest. The most resistant 10 cultigens averaged over both locations were Ames 2353, Ames 2354, PI 197085, PI 197088, PI 234517, PI 321008, PI 330628, PI 432878, PI 605996 and PI 618931. These cultigens originated from India, the United States, Pakistan, P.R. China and Taiwan. Despite the identification of resistant plant introduction accessions, they were not significantly better than the most resistant cultivars currently used in either North Carolina or Poland. The most positive aspect of the screening effort was that resistant plant introductions originated from diverse geographic regions. Because geographic diversity is often associated with genetic diversity in germplasm collections, the newly identified resistant typed may carry unique alleles as compared to commercial material. If so, then the potential exists to develop recombinant types from crosses of commercial by exotic materials which may be more resistant. The second objective of this study was to measure the correlation of four response traits. A low correlation among the four response traits on a diverse array of cucumber cultigens would suggest that the traits are controlled by different genes. Field studies were conducted to measure the response traits of plant stunting, leaf necrosis, chlorosis and sporulation caused by downy mildew infection. Each of the four traits were measured on 67 diverse cucumber cultigens in North Carolina and India. All cucumber cultigens were tested in four replications and two locations under natural field epidemics of the disease. A significant genotype by location interaction was found by analysis of variance and data from the two locations were analyzed separately. In North Carolina, necrosis and chlorosis were highly correlated (r=0.90) while sporulation was moderately correlated with necrosis and chlorosis(r=0.71 and r=0.70, respectively) and not significantly correlated with stunting. Stunting was moderately correlated with necrosis and chlorosis (r=0.43 and r=0.34, respectively). In India, chlorosis and sporulation were highly correlated (r=0.97) while necrosis was moderately correlated with chlorosis, sporulation and stunting (r=0.67 and r=0.0.65 and r=0.76, respectively). Stunting was moderately correlated with chlorosis and sporulation (r=0.55 and r=0.57, respectively). Sporulation or necrosis may be controlled by a different gene(s) but another year of testing is required. Stunting may also be controlled by a different gene(s) but difficulties in differentiating between stunting resulting from genotype and stunting resulting from disease must be resolved. Different degrees of correlation among chlorosis, necrosis and sporulation in North Carolina and India may be due to the presence of different races in the two locations. These differences may also be explained by the variable number and timing of ratings between the two locations. Availability of only one set of data for sporulation in North Carolina may have reduced the correlation between it and necrosis and chlorosis. Sporulation ratings need to be taken on a weekly basis rather than once during the last rating. Therefore, the possibility exists that chlorosis, necrosis and sporulation are response traits controlled by the same genes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06272008-145848/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growth and Characterization of Epitaxial ZnO Thin Films on GaN(0001) Epilayers and ZnO{0001} Substrates Using Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Depositon</field><field name="creator">Pierce, Jonathan Mark</field><field name="description">ZnO thin films were produced on GaN(0001) epilayers and ZnO(0001) substrates utilizing an iterative process requiring a structured low temperature (480&#176;C) layer followed by a high temperature (800&#176;C) densification step to create approximately 200 nm of contiguous film. This process is subsequently repeated to achieve thicker films with each iteration producing approximately 200 nm of dense film. Diethylzinc was used as the zinc source, UHP oxygen (O2) as the oxygen source, and UHP argon as both the carrier and diluent gas. Nitrous (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO2) were also used both as potential oxygen sources in the pure state as well as mixed with oxygen in the chamber and for nitrogen doping of the growing film. Major impurities of C, H, and N were incorporated into the films with the majority of the incorporation occurring during the low temperature step. Films grown using N2O + O2 contained an average of 5 x 1017 cm-3 atomic nitrogen while films using NO2 + O2 had an average nitrogen concentrations of 9 x 1019 cm-3. Needle microstructures were observed for low temperature layers using O2 and N2O + O2, while networked structures formed when using NO2 + O2. The surface of the densified films contained hexagonal pits that increased in number and depth with an increase in film thickness. Triple-axis XRD measurements indicated that the crystal structure of the films mimic the underlying substrates. A comparative analysis of undoped and N-doped films using capacitance voltage and photoluminescence measurements showed that the N-doped films were more insulating than the undoped films and the incorporation of nitrogen decreases the amount of excitonic peaks observed in the PL spectra. The 3.367 eV ionized donor bound exciton becomes dominant in N-doped films relative to the 3.361 eV donor bound exciton that dominates the undoped films. A preliminary inductively coupled plasma etching study determined that the smoothest sidewalls and surfaces were obtained using an ICP power of 600 W, a DC bias of 50 V, 5 mtorr total pressure, and 20 sccm of pure flowing BCl3 The etch rate under these conditions was 40 nm/min.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06282004-090927/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Computing Skills and Differences Between Demographic Groups: A Basis for Curriculum Development in Computer Technology Courses at UNC-Wilmington.</field><field name="creator">Dickerson, Jeremy</field><field name="description">This study examined the entry-level computing skills of undergraduate education majors at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington during the Spring 2005 semester.

The participants were pre-tested for their ability to complete 60 computer skills in the Microsoft Office Suite using an online performance test called Skills Assessment Manager by Thomson Course Technology. The data was analyzed as a whole group performance using descriptive statistics and analyzed for analysis between demographic groups using a non-parametric statistic test (the Mann Whitney U Test). The results yielded data that informed the researcher of the skills of the participants prior to taking a mandatory computer skills course. As a result, it was found that a large portion of students were able to do many of the skills before taking the mandatory skills course. It was also found that demographics were not a reliable predictor of computer skills.

Potential new properties such as lighter weight, lower cost and higher strength, motivate research to investigate blends of saturated hydrocarbon polymers. However, many questions remain concerning how polymer chain structure and packing influence local thermodynamics, or more specifically, the interplay between enthalpy and entropy, which ultimately control bulk phase behavior. Solid-state NMR has proven to be an essential tool in these studies due to its ability to selectively observe molecular level conformations and dynamics without isotopic labeling. Combinations of basic and advanced variable temperature studies such as 1D and 2D 13C cross-polarization exchange experiments, static 2H lineshape analysis, 1H relaxation/spin-diffusion measurements, and 129Xe experiments were applied in this work. Several systems were studied, including 50/50 weight percent blends of polyisobutylene with polyethylene-co-1-butene, polyisobutylene with head-to-head polypropylene, and atactic polypropylene with the same polyethylene-co-1-butene samples.

Nano-scale molecular docking and molecular assembly are vital for the discovery and development of medicines, nano-scale devices, and new materials. In this paper, a new method called NanoDAS (Nano-scale Docking and Assembly Simulator) is presented to determine the feasibility of a ligand molecule reaching the binding site of a receptor molecule. To improve the design of molecular docking process, effective user intervention is necessary and is introduced through the use of a 5-DOF (degrees of freedom) force-torque feedback Haptic device developed at our research lab. Through the force-torque feedback haptic interface, a user is able to feel the forces exerted on the ligand by the receptor and find a feasible path using the proposed NanoDAS. The user is also able to determine whether the ligand can actually dock into the receptor by considering its conformational changes using a proposed energy minimization algorithm. The developed techniques can be used in Computer-Aided Molecular Design (CAMD) and Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD) applications. Computer implementations and practical examples of the proposed methods are also presented.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06292005-164846/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamental Behavior of Steel-Concrete Composite Beams Strengthened with High Modulus Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) Materials</field><field name="creator">Dawood, Mina Magdy Riad</field><field name="description">There is a growing need for a cost-effective, durable repair system that can be used for the repair and strengthening of steel bridges. Recently, high modulus carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) have been developed with a modulus of elasticity approximately two times greater than that of steel. Externally bonded high modulus CFRP materials have successfully been used to increase the elastic stiffness and ultimate capacity of steel-concrete composite beams However, since the technology is relatively new, the detailed behavior of steel bridge members strengthened with high modulus CFRP is not yet well understood. The current research investigates three aspects of the behavior of steel-concrete composite beams in detail. An experimental program was conducted to investigate the behavior of steel-concrete composite beams strengthened with high modulus CFRP materials. In the first phase of the study the behavior under overloading conditions was investigated. In the second phase of the research, the fatigue durability of the system was examined. In the third phase, the possible presence of shear-lag between the steel beam and the CFRP materials was investigated in detail. An analytical model was developed which can be used to determine the ultimate capacity and elastic stiffness increase for steel beams strengthened with high modulus CFRP materials. Additionally, a set of criteria are proposed which can be used to determine the allowable increase in the live load level for steel beams strengthened with high modulus CFRP materials.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06292005-192140/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of Cutaneous Permeability of Biocides in Mixtures using QSPR Approach</field><field name="creator">Vijay, Vikrant</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research work was to assess the dermal permeation of biocides in metalworking fluids (MWFs) to develop predictive QSAR models and to develop an appropriate training set of chemicals to enhance the predictive ability of QSAR models for dermal permeation. Estimation of the amount of chemicals absorbed through skin plays a vital role in dermal risk assessment. Approximately 1.2 million US workers are occupationally exposed to MWFs annually. Different components of MWFs especially biocides, contribute to adverse health effects including irritant and allergic contact dermatitis as well as carcinogenesis. These adverse effects may be positively correlated to their dermal absorption and may cause systemic toxicity if absorbed in significant amount in workers involved in metalworking operations. A lack of scientific data exists regarding the dermal permeation of MWF components, particularly biocides. Therefore, the first two studies were conducted to (1) determine the dermal permeation of biocides and other chemicals (used as training set to develop Linear Solvation Energy Relationship (LSER) models) in commercial and generic MWFs; and (2) develop a LSER model for predicting dermal permeation of other biocides, not used in these studies. Dermal permeation was evaluated in dermatomed porcine skin by utilizing a flow through diffusion cell system. Chemical analysis was performed by employing gas chromatography with a solid phase micro-extraction technique and ultra performance liquid chromatography with a solid phase extraction technique. LSER models, which are a subset of quantitative structure activity relationship models, were constructed by multiple linear regression analysis with permeability coefficient as the response variable and solvatochromic descriptors as the predictor variables. The LSER model is useful to quantitatively measure the difference in interaction between the two phases (skin and vehicle) as well as a predictive tool. Since the training set used to develop a LSER model was not optimally diverse in terms of structure and chemical space, the third study focused on developing a training set of chemicals representing a wider chemical space (in terms of descriptor values) using a best possible chemical selection method. The results from the first two studies demonstrated that (1) the dermal permeation of biocides as well as other chemicals was highest in aqueous solution followed by synthetic, semi-synthetic and soluble oil type of MWFs; (2) addition of water to MWFs for dilution increased dermal permeation; (3) the LSER model adequately predicted the dermal permeability of biocides in MWFs and also shed light on the chemical interactions resulting in reduced permeability. An optimal and less subjective method (uniform coverage design) to select chemicals representing a wider chemical space was identified in the third study. The LSER model based on the new selected training set of chemicals performed statistically better over the LSER model based on the training set used in the previous study. In summary, the aforementioned results demonstrated that there is a difference in the absorption profile of chemicals among the type of MWFs and dilution of MWFs with water increases the dermal permeation of chemicals; the LSER model can be useful to explain the change in vehicle solvatochromic properties upon addition of water as well as can be an effective prediction model for dermal permeation of chemicals in mixtures; finally, a structurally diverse training set of chemicals representing a wider chemical space is required to improve the predictive capability of a model. All of these results will augment the dermal risk assessment of the chemicals in mixtures and contribute to the improvement of computational predictive models.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06292009-233331/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Adhesion of Paperboard to the Gypsum Core of Wallboard: An Investigation of Adhesive Bond Quality in Response to Paper Production Variables and Relative Humidity.</field><field name="creator">Tomasiewicz, Ryan</field><field name="description">The research investigated the interactions between paperboard and the gypsum core during the manufacturing process of gypsum wallboard.

For example, in cases of ischemia/reperfusion injury, there is a disruption in the gastrointestinal barrier. This may lead to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil (PMN) infiltration. It has been demonstrated that COX-2, which is upregulated during inflammation, and its downstream product PGE2 are important for recovery of barrier function, yet their regulation has not been fully characterized. Study 1: To study the effects of PMNs on acutely injured mucosa, we applied PMNs isolated from circulation to ischemic-injured porcine ileal mucosa. Since COX-2 is upregulated by inflammatory mediators such as IL-1beta, which is released by PMNs, we postulated that PMNs enhance recovery of ischemia-injured mucosa by a pathway involving IL-1beta and COX-2. Application of 5x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; PMNs to ischemia-injured ileal mucosa significantly enhanced transepithelial resistance (TER), an effect inhibited by the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 and an IL-1beta receptor antagonist. Western blots revealed up-regulation of COX-2 in response to PMNs, which was inhibited by an IL-1beta receptor antagonist. Real time PCR revealed increased mRNA COX-2 expression, which preceded increased COX-2 protein expression in response to IL-1beta. We concluded that PMNs augment recovery of TER in ischemia-injured ileal mucosa via IL-1beta-dependent upregulation of COX-2. Study 2: Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways transduce signals from a diverse array of extracellular stimuli, including IL-1beta. The three primary MAPK signaling pathways are the extracellular regulated kinases (ERK 1&amp;2), p38 MAPK, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Because COX-2 expression is regulated in part by MAPK?s, we postulated that MAPK pathways would play an integral role in recovery of porcine ischemia-injured ileal mucosa. Treatment of tissues with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB-203580 or the ERK 1&amp;2 inhibitor, PD-98059, abolished recovery. Western blots revealed that SB-203580 inhibited upregulation of COX-2 whereas PD-98059 had no effect on COX-2 expression. Inhibition of TER by SB-203580 or PD-98059 was overcome by exogenous PGE2. The JNK inhibitor, SP-600125, significantly increased TER and resulted in COX-2 upregulation. Thus, COX-2 expression appears to be positively and negatively regulated by the p38 MAPK and the JNK pathways respectively. Alternatively, ERK 1&amp;2 appears to be involved in COX-2-independent reparative events. Study 3: In previous studies, we had shown that PGE2 restored barrier function via a signal transduction pathway involving Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; secretion and recovery of interepithelial tight junctions (TJs). To study these mechanisms, we utilized human colonic T84 cells. We postulated that PGE2 induced chloride secretion would precede increases in TER associated with re-distribution of critical proteins to TJs. T84 cells were grown to confluence, but utilized at lower TER values (200-500 ohms.cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) to simulate our ileal mucosal model of ?leaky? restituted epithelium. Basolateral application of PGE2 induced transient increases in Isc, indicative of chloride secretion, followed by sustained increases in TER. Basolateral application of the Na/K/2Cl cotransporter inhibitor bumetanide, abolished the PGE2-induced rise in Isc and subsequent elevations in TER. PGE2 induced a shift in claudin-1 from the Triton-X soluble to insoluble fraction, beginning 4-hour after PGE2 administration, which was prevented by bumetanide. Alternatively, there were no changes in occludin or claudins-3 and -5. Immunoflourescence demonstrated that PGE2 increased accumulation of claudin-1 at the apical lateral membrane. Additionally, we showed that PGE2 increased tyrosine phosphorylation of claudin-1 within 30 min, an effect prevented by bumetanide. Therefore, PGE2-induced chloride secretion in T84 cells is directly linked with increases in TER, and these elevations in TER are associated with phosphorylation of claudin-1 and a shift in claudin-1 to the tight junction.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06302004-144347/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Seismic Behavior of Reinforced Concrete Members at Low Temperatures</field><field name="creator">Sloan, John Elliot</field><field name="description">While reinforced concrete structures depend on ductility for acceptable seismic performance, research on the material behavior of concrete and steel has indicated that the loss of ductility may occur under low temperatures.

The results of the experimentation indicate moderate increases in column strength as the temperature decreases, as well as moderate decreases in ultimate displacement capacity as the temperature decreases. The hysteretic damping properties of the columns were not significantly affected by low temperatures, and the specimen tested at -40 degrees Celsius exhibited a shortening of the extent of plasticity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06302005-131453/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A TEACHING JOB SHOP CONTROL SYSTEM WITH REAL-TIME INVENTORY MANAGEMENT</field><field name="creator">Maxwell, Andrew Charles</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a teaching job shop control system for running in assembly laboratories at colleges and universities in preparing Industrial Engineering students for challenges faced in real-world factories. Current techniques fail to encompass this idea of training for students like the proposed method does. Microsoft Access was used in creating a database that is the center point in this new system. Inventory is managed using this database system and added if parts are created in the manufacturing lab and moved to the assembly area. The system will stop if parts are low until new parts are created. In this new system, a pallet with an unfinished product on it moves down a conveyor system until it reaches the next workstation. At this station, the station operator scans a barcode on the pallet. This barcode contains what product is on this pallet. Based on this information, an ordered list of tasks appears on the workstation computer screen and must be done before the pallet can be moved on. When all tasks have been completed at a station, the station operator clicks ?done? on the screen and then can either move to the next pallet or end the run. Statistics are kept on the quality of the final products and parts as well as a work-in-process and on a goal percentage of good products out at the end of a one-hour time frame. Administrators will be able to assign tasks and parts to products and stations, as well as be able assign the goal ahead of time.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06302005-195145/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of Analyte-Surface Spacing on the Performance of Desorption/Ionization on Porous Silicon Mass Spectrometry (DIOS-MS)</field><field name="creator">Shah, Abhilasha Parag</field><field name="description">Desorption/ionization on porous silicon (DIOS), a matrix free-laser desorption mass spectrometric technique shows potential for direct analysis of biological compounds in the low mass region. However, the geometric scale of the porous silicon is significantly smaller than the biological samples used in MS imaging and suspect to limit an effective direct analysis of analyte. Herein, I have investigated the effect of the spacing distance between analytes and a porous substrate in DIOS-MS. In particular, organic polymer films were used to simulate the biological tissue between analyte and porous substrate. These films circumvent biological complexity that simplifies data analysis. The thicknesses of polymer film on the substrate controlled by varying spin coating condition. Different classes of analytes were used as standard molecules to evaluate the analyte-substrate spacing effect. In all cases, the standard molecules were successfully detected atop of the polymer film in DIOS-MS. The insulating layer of polymer shift the laser threshold compare to bare DIOS. Relatively stable signal-to-background (S/B) ratios across the tested spacing distances suggest that the analyte detection is less dependent of the distance between analyte and porous surface. The total ion current (TIC) of the analytes however, decreases as the distance increases suggesting distance effect on desorption/ionization. Moreover, the TIC was limited by the amount of analyte accessible for detection. In addition, the ultra-thin SiOx film showed improvement in analyte detectability over the tested thickness. Analyte detection on the DIOS surface greatly influence by surface chemical functionality; oxidized surface is advantageous for positive mode detection whereas the amine derivatized surface showed improvement in negative mode detection.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06302008-131449/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cardiac Cell Type-Specific Differences in the Interferon (IFN) Response, and Reovirus Repression of IFN</field><field name="creator">Zurney, Jennifer Michelle</field><field name="description">Viral myocarditis is an important human disease associated with a wide variety of viruses. The cardiac damage and inflammation associated with viral myocarditis can be immune mediated and/or due to direct cytopathic effect. Reovirus-induced myocarditis reflects direct virus-mediated apoptosis of cardiac cells, providing an excellent model to study direct cytopathic effect in the heart. Previous work has found interferon-beta (IFN) to be an important determinant for protection against viral myocarditis. Importantly, IFN signals through the Jak-STAT pathway to induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and establish an antiviral state. First, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of the IFN response in these cardiac cells. We found that high basal IFN-beta expression in cardiac myocytes protects this vulnerable, nonreplenishable cardiac cell type, while high basal expression of interferon alpha receptor 1 and latent Jak-STAT components in adjoining cardiac fibroblasts renders these cells more responsive to IFN and prevents them from inadvertently serving as a virus reservoir. This provides the first evidence for an integrated network of cell-type-specific innate immune components for organ protection. Next, we investigated whether particular reovirus strains were able to repress IFN signaling. We found that the mildly myocarditic reovirus, T1L, but not the nonmyocarditic reovirus, T3D, could repress IFN induction of ISGs and that this repressor function is determined by the M1 gene of T1L. Infection with T1L or reassortant or recombinant viruses containing the T1L M1 gene results in accumulation of IRF9 in the nucleus; an effect not previously described for any virus. The M1 gene has also previously been identified as a determinant of virus strain-specific differences in the IFN response, and the M1 gene and the IFN response have been identified as determinants of virus strain-specific differences in induction of murine myocarditis. Here, we find that virus-induced myocarditis is associated with repression of IFN function, providing new insights into the pathophysiology of this disease. Together, these data provide the first report of an increase in IRF9 nuclear accumulation associated with viral subversion of the IFN response, and provide evidence that virus strain-specific differences in IFN antagonism are a determinant of disease.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06302008-141954/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive Models of Discourse Comprehension for Narrative Generation</field><field name="creator">Niehaus, James Michael</field><field name="description">Recent work in the area of narrative generation has sought to develop systems that automatically produce experiences for a user that are understood as stories. Much of this prior work, however, has focused on the structural aspects of narrative rather than the process of narrative comprehension undertaken by readers. Cognitive theories of narrative discourse comprehension define explicit models of a reader's mental state during reading. These cognitive models are created to test hypotheses and explain empirical results about the comprehension processes of readers. They do not often contain sufficient precision for implementation on a computer, and thus, they are not yet suitable for computational generation purposes. This dissertation employs cognitive models of narrative discourse comprehension to define an explicit computational model of a reader's comprehension process during reading, predicting aspects of narrative focus and inferencing with precision. This computational model is employed in a narrative discourse generation system to select content from an event log, creating discourses that satisfy comprehension criteria. The results of three experiments are presented and discussed, exhibiting empirical support for the computational reader model and the results of generation. This dissertation makes a number of contributions that advance the state-of-the-art in narrative discourse generation: a formal model of narrative focus, a formal model of online inferencing in narrative, a method of selecting narrative discourse content to satisfy comprehension criteria, and implementation and evaluation of these models.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06302009-134916/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and Characterization of Biopolymer Composites and their Inorganic Hosts</field><field name="creator">Rovira Truitt, Rosimar</field><field name="description">Biopolymers are biodegradable and biocompatible materials obtained from renewable sources. These polymers could have an increased impact in consumer or health applications, given a larger, more flexible range of physical properties. Targeting enhanced properties through the design of organic-inorganic hybrids requires novel synthesis routes. An in-situ polymer composite that differs from hybrids generated by simple mixing of the organic and inorganic phases, has been demonstrated here. A known ring opening polymerization catalyst was incorporated within the channels of mesoporous hosts (e.g. MCM-41). A combination of elemental, solid-state NMR, BET nitrogen adsorption, and microscopy experiments indicated that the stannous octoate catalyst was supported inside the host channels, and that a charged framework is not required for its incorporation. These Sn(Oct)2 supported mesoporous catalysts were used to prepare poly(d,l-lactide) composites. Multiple experiments, including solid state NMR, BET nitrogen adsorption, and calorimetric analysis, gave evidence that the resulting polymer forms inside the host channels. In this way, an organic-inorganic composite which grows out of the crystallites is generated in-situ. Additionally, the acid catalyzed condensation polymerization of lactic acid with micro/mesoporous materials was investigated. Results suggest that Al-SBA-15 is a potential catalyst for this type of polymerization. This approach is desirable, since the generated organic-inorganic composite would contain no impurities (i.e. metal catalysts).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06302009-141225/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the Interactions of Point Defects, Dopants and Light Element Impurities in Silicon as Stimulated by 200 kV Electron Irradiation.</field><field name="creator">Stoddard, Nathan Gregory</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research has been the investigation of atomic manipulation in silicon. It has been demonstrated that bulk vacancies and interstitials are created and spatially separated one Frenkel pair at a time during 200 kV electron irradiation of nitrogen-doped silicon. The mechanism by which the nitrogen pair allows Frenkel pair separation is shown to be a combination of the lowering of the energy barrier to a knock-on event combined with a more stable end-state. Anomalous nitrogen diffusion has been observed as a result of low energy ion milling, and the diffusion of nitrogen is studied theoretically, revealing a new, low energy model for N2 pair diffusion. For the first time, 200 kV irradiation has been demonstrated not only to create Frenkel pairs during broad-beam irradiation, but also to allow the formation of extended defects like voids, oxygen precipitates and interstitial complexes. Using electron energy loss spectroscopy combined with first principles simulations, dark and bright areas induced in Z contrast images by 200 kV irradiation are demonstrated to be due to vacancy and self-interstitial complexes, respectively, with N&gt;2. Finally, the manipulation of dopants in silicon is induced by using the difference in energy transferable from a 200 kV electron to light versus heavy elements (e.g. B vs. Sb). Atomic Force Microscopy is used to demonstrate that n-type regions with a size corresponding to the beam diameter are created in p-type material by short periods of 200 kV e-beam exposure. In this way, a method can be developed to create p-n-p type devices of arbitrary size in codoped silicon using a room temperature process.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07012004-101912/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The History of Plant Use in Laos: Analysis of European Accounts of Plant Use for Primarily Religious and Medicinal Purposes</field><field name="creator">Callis, Kristine Lee</field><field name="description">A Review of manuscripts written by European explorers and colonists affords the opportunity to develop a clearer understanding both of types of plants employed and their significance in religion and medicine during the 16th to 19th centuries. This paper is a distillation of accounts by thirteen European explorers, written between 1545 until 1861, about Laos and the Lao people in Siam. All of the references to plants and plant use have been extracted for an analysis of which plants European explorers viewed being used traditionally in Laos during this time period and information on how these plants were used and collected. Many of the plants described in the texts were medicinal in nature and some have been examined for modern pharmaceutical use. These pharmaceutical studies have substantiated the effectiveness of historical medicinal plant use. The texts also describe plants that were used in religious ceremonies and that continue to play an important role in Lao culture. Future comparative analysis of these early records with modern day observations of plant use should prove productive in formulating assessments of Traditional Environmental Knowledge loss and the impact of this loss on daily life. Understanding the plants that are important to native Lao in the past can lead to better methods of conservation in the future.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07012005-111631/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tax Rates: A Study of their Form and Effects</field><field name="creator">Alexander, M. Erin</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents a series of three essays that examine the functional form of the U. S. federal income tax and its implications. In the first essay we introduce the convex functional form of the income tax which we believe is superior to the standard income-proportional form. We also describe the parameters within this function and their construction over the years from 1913 to 2005. The second essay discusses the characteristics of the time series of these parameters, the relation of these series to other tax series in the literature, the relation of the intertemporal variation in the tax parameters to the sharp reduction in volatility of macroeconomic time series after about 1950, and the interrelation of the tax parameters with other federal fiscal variables. In chapter three, we use a standard dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model and insert our tax function. We explore the implications that different tax policies will have on the macroeconomy by changing parameter values within this tax function. Specifically we compare the steady states values, second moments, and impulse response functions, of the usual variables, generated by these policies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07012009-080456/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inheritance of Fruit Characteristics in Watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.)

The qualitative fruit traits, such as flesh color, seed size, seed coat color, rind pattern, fruit shape, exhibit wide ranges of phenotypes. The flesh color can be red, orange, yellow, or white. The seed length of watermelon also varies from 4.4mm to 16.5mm. The seeds can have various coat colors or other decorations. The rind of watermelon fruits can be striped or solid colored, which are further characterized by different stripe widths, stripe colors, backgrounds colors, and additional modifications. The fruit shape can be elongate, oblong, and round. Other fruit traits include shape of fruit blossom end, fruit surface characters, and hollow-hearted flesh. By crossing watermelon cultivars with different phenotypes, we studied the inheritance of the various phenotypes and identified and verified genes responsible for the flesh color, seed size, rind pattern, and fruit shape. In addition, we studied the quantitative traits of the fruit weight and total soluble solids content. The calculated broad-sense and narrow-sense heritability for fruit weight is low to medium, indicating large environmental effect on fruit weight. Medium to high heritability is found for the total soluble solid content, suggesting possible gains from selection.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07012009-095803/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Low Cycle Fatigue Life Prediction of Four Bolt Extended Unstiffened End Plate Moment Connections</field><field name="creator">Lim, Chemin</field><field name="description">The end plate moment connection has been studied with various design concepts. However the low cycle fatigue (LCF) analysis was focused after 1994 the Northridge earthquake because the connection failure mode of structure was not matched with the current design concept. This concept has been applied to the design of moment resisting frames and several research studies on the LCF behavior of various connections under cyclic loading have been conducted. While the research on the behavior of end plate moment connections (EPMC) under cyclic loading has been conducted very little information on the LCF behavior is available. To evaluate the accumulation of LCF damage, the LCF life prediction, three phases of experimental tests were conducted. In order to investigate critical geometric parameters for 4E EPMCs in the LCF behavior, parametric study was conducted with pre-qualified FEM model. In the first phase of the experimental test, total 4 reduced EPMCs, T-stub, was tested to verify the elastic range of the connection system and general behavior of the connection. Three different levels of constant peak displacement loadings were applied to three full scale EPMCs for developing a LCF model in second phase of the experimental test. In the last phase, an accumulated damage model was evaluated by one full scale end plate moment connection test using random loading. All of phases were adopted three-dimensional finite element numerical analysis, and theoretical analysis to predict the experimental behavior and it successfully anticipated the behavior of connection. The results of the experimental test developed the LCF model for 4E EPMC and it predicted the LCF life of connection. The parametric study determined the three critical geometry parameters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07012009-153407/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acoustic Wave Dynamics in the Post-Bounce Phase of Core Collapse Supernovae</field><field name="creator">Heyward, Irvine Keith</field><field name="description">How a core collapse supernova successfully &#226;explodes&#226; is only partially understood.

Current research toward improving efficiency is focused on developing new materials with better absorption and charge transport properties, and on improving morphology. There are other pursuits that could also significantly improve efficiency yet are relatively neglected by researchers. Two of these are optical light trapping to increase absorption and control of interfaces to reduce energy loss. This thesis makes contributions to both of these goals in three ways. First, some surprising results from the optical modeling of organic solar cells at non-normal incidence are described. Second, a general method for assessing the potential of a promising light trapping geometry is introduced, and discrepancies between modeling and experiment of that structure are explained. Finally, the effect of air exposure on single material and bulk heterojunction solar cells with InGa cathode is investigated. Air exposure is found to increase open circuit voltage, and using this method the open circuit voltage of a common organic solar cell system is increased by 15%. This work exposes the current lack of knowledge of many aspects of band structure in organic solar cells which suggests the need for more research in this area.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07032009-113212/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Mentoring on Standardized Test Results of African American Males in the Elementary and Middle Grades.</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Kenneth Alonzo</field><field name="description">This study examined the effects of mentoring on standardized achievement for African American males in the elementary and middle grades.

This is particularly true for hurricane forecasting, where numerical ocean models are used to predict the height of the storm surge and the degree of coastal flooding. We use multivariate spatial-temporal statistical methods to improve coastal storm surge prediction using disparate sources of observation data. An Ensemble Kalman Filter is used to assimilate water elevation into a three dimension primitive equations ocean model. We find that data assimilation is able to improve the estimates for water elevation for a case study of Hurricane Charley of 2004. In addition we investigate the impact of inaccuracies in the wind field inputs which are the main forcing of the numerical model in storm surge applications. A new multivariate spatial statistical framework is developed to improve the estimation of these wind inputs. A spatial linear model of coregionalization (LMC) is used to account for the cross-dependency between the two orthogonal wind components. A Bayesian approach is used for estimation of the parameters of the multivariate spatial model and a physically based wind model while accounting for potential additive and multiplicative bias in the observed wind data. This spatial model consistently improves parameter estimation and prediction for surface wind data for the Hurricane Charley case study when compared to the original physical wind model. These methods are also shown to improve storm surge estimates when used as the forcing fields for the coastal ocean model. Finally we describe a new framework for estimating multivariate nonstationary spatial-temporal processes based on an extension of the LMC model. We compare this approach to other multivariate spatial models and describe an application to surface wind fields from Hurricane Floyd of 1999.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07042006-110351/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Morphological and histological aspects of the spermatheca as they relate to sperm organization in the grasshopper species Schistocerca americana and Dissosteira carolina (Orthoptera: Acrididae)</field><field name="creator">Gardner, Grant E</field><field name="description">The spermatheca of the acridid Orthoptera Schistocerca americana and Dissosteira carolina both consist of a ductus seminalis and a receptaculum seminis that ends in two blind sacs called the apical and preapical diverticula. The diverticula of acridid grasshoppers show high morphological variation that might imply functional differences. A microscopic examination of the structure of the spermatheca surface of both species found the presence of numerous gland ductules, but a lack of acanthae typical of many acridids. A histological study of macromolecules in the spermatheca of mated females found large carbohydrate and protein secretions present in all chambers. The secretion was not present in virgin S. americana but was present in virgin D. carolina. These secretions are likely glycoproteins either secreted by female gland ductules or contributed from males. Lipids were limited to small droplets contained within epithelial cells lining the walls of the spermatheca of both mated and virgin females. Histological sections of the spermatheca were utilized to track the course of sperm bundles in the chambers at various intervals following copulation initiation. In S. americana sperm bundles are found primarily in the diverticula and appear to be degraded in the apical diverticulum. In D. carolina sperm bundles are seen in all chambers of the spermatheca except the ductus seminalis and maintain a constant distribution an hour into copulation.

However, an off-flavor was found in peanuts which were microwave-blanched at high temperatures. As a result, the objective of this research has been to determine the impact of different microwave blanching parameters on the properties of roasted peanuts, and to characterize the off-flavor observed during high-temperature microwave blanching using a descriptive sensory panel and analysis of volatile flavor compounds. The processing parameters best suited for microwave blanching of peanuts were determined based on energy absorbed during processing, internal and surface temperatures, loss in moisture content, and blanchability. The best blanchability resulted from higher process temperatures and lower final moisture content. However, peanuts which reached the highest internal temperatures during blanching also developed an off-flavor, which was characterized by increased intensities of stale/floral and burnt/ashy notes. Solvent extraction / solvent assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE), gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC/O), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA), threshold testing, and model systems were used to examine the chemical compounds which may be responsible for this microwave-related off-flavor. Analysis revealed an increased formation of guaiacol, phenylacetaldehyde, and 2,6-dimethylpyrazine in the off-flavored peanuts as compared to a process control, which led to the burnt and stale/floral characteristics noted by descriptive sensory panel. These compounds were only a small fraction of over 200 aroma-active compounds which were found to contribute to roasted peanut flavor using GC/O. This research illustrates the importance of the relative concentrations of the many aroma-active compounds found in peanuts. These findings could aid in training sensory panels to evaluate processing-related off-flavors, because guaiacol and phenylacetaldehyde could be used as chemical standards to define the burnt/ashy and stale/floral off-flavors which can occur during high temperature processing. Through this project, it was determined that it is possible to achieve acceptable blanchability in peanuts using microwave blanching while minimizing the possibility of an off-flavor.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07052006-113250/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and Characterization of Amphiphilic Fe4S4-Core Dendrimers as Protein Models</field><field name="creator">KIM, NAMJIN</field><field name="description">The ultimate goal of this research is to clarify the structural effects on the rate and driving force for electron transfer in amphiphilic iron-sulfur core dendrimers, which can eventually be used as protein models. These dendrimers were synthesized by ligand exchange reactions, including the synthesis of dendrons via a modular synthesis approach. Their structure-property relationships were then investigated using electrochemical methods. Three different routes were used to synthesize thiol dendrons with both cationic and anionic peripheral units. The first utilized the disulfide linkage as a focal and protecting group. However, due to difficulties associated with generating free thiol from the disulfide, only partially-substituted dendrimers were prepared in ligand exchange reaction. Similar problems were encountered with the next two methods, which used thiocarbamate and trityl protecting groups, respectively. First generation dendrimers were successfully prepared and characterized using the thiocarbamate group; however, low thiol concentration resulted in only partially substituted dendrimers for the second generation. All synthetic attempts using the trityl focal group resulted in only partial substitution. Because the concentration of free thiol was the factor limiting the synthesis of these amphiphilic iron-sulfur core dendrimers, a protocol was established to measure the thiol concentration using Ellman?s reagent test. However, this proved to be inaccurate due to oxygen dissolved in solution and then re-oxidized thiols during the course of the test. The electrochemical properties of these cationic and anionic dendrimers were measured and compared to G1-flexible dendrimer previously studied by the Gorman Group. G1-cationic dendrimer exhibited more effective attenuation of the electron transfer rate than G1-flexible dendrimer. This was attributed to the difference of molecular weight in both dendrimers. The redox potential in the cationic dendrimer was shifted more positively by about 100 mV due to polar microenvironment around the iron-sulfur core. Cyclic voltammogram of G1-anionic dendrimer exhibited an unexpected peak so other electrochemical properties could not be measured. Only an approximate redox potential was obtained and exhibited a positive shift by about 60 mV compared to G1-flexible dendrimer.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07052006-133137/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pursuing the American Dream: A Case Study of North Carolina's House Bill 1183</field><field name="creator">Sanders, Marla Saterica</field><field name="description">This case study investigates the social and political factors influencing House Bill 1183, a bill introduced in the North Carolina General Assembly in April 2005 to extend resident-tuition rates to undocumented students seeking a postsecondary education. The data indicates that House Bill 1183?s defeat was due to a combination of factors. These factors included social and economic concerns, changing demographics of the state and the time and context the bill was introduced, the media, and the public?s response. A combination of the other factors contributed and significantly influenced the context of the public?s response, which undoubtedly led to the defeat of the bill. Advocacy coalitions, to some extent, played an important role in this process, as the supporting organizations, were key in the conceptual development of the bill, and the opposing coalition, was actively involved in calling their constituents to action.

Each year, hundreds of million of dollars are spent on fire suppression and fuels management applications, yet little is known, quantitatively, of the returns to these programs in terms of their impact on wildfire extent and intensity. This is especially true when considering that wildfire management influences and reacts to several, often times confounding factors, including socioeconomic characteristics, values at risk, heterogeneous landscapes, and climate. Due to the endogenous nature of suppression effort and fuels management intensity and placement with wildfire behavior, least-square models may prove inadequate. Instead, I examine the applicability of two-stage least squares, propensity score blocking, and a newly developed technique, control score blocking in modeling wildfire. This research makes several significant contributions including: (1) applying techniques developed in labor economics and in epidemiology to evaluate the effects of natural resource policies on landscapes, rather than on individuals; (2) a better understanding of the relationship between wildfire mitigation strategies and their influence on broad-scale wildfire patterns; (3) quantifying the returns to suppression and fuels management on wildfire behavior.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07052006-210050/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimating run size of anadromous fishes in the Roanoke River, North Carolina, using hydroacoustics</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Warren Anderson</field><field name="description">The annual arrival of American shad Alosa sapidissima, striped bass Morone saxatilis and hickory shad Alosa mediocris is ecologically and economically important in the rivers of North Carolina. Both species support commercial and recreational fisheries, and both are the focus of management efforts by state and federal agencies. Reliable information about population levels is essential for effective management. The goal of this study was to estimate the number of adult spawners returning to the Roanoke River. During April-May 2004 and March-May 2005, a stationary 430 kHz hydroacoustic system was deployed on the river bottom in a side-aspect orientation. Tracks of upstream-migrating fish were discernable from ambient noise. The number of fish migrating upstream was slightly lower during 00:00-08:00 compared to the other two 8-hr periods of the day. A majority of fish tracks were within 2 m of the river bottom in both years (89%), and were more associated with ranges near shore. Drift gill netting and boat electrofishing appear to provide an adequate measure of the seasonal presence and absence of target species, though electrofishing provides better samples size. These traditional fisheries methods confirmed the expected seasonal pulses of hickory shad, followed by striped bass, during both years. Counts of upstream fish tracks were low during periods between these pulses. Daytime electrofishing catch rates for 2005 were correlated with daily counts of upstream fish tracks. American shad occurred sporadically at low abundance throughout both years. It was the main target species in this study but made up less than 2% of the catch in both years. A majority of fish captured by gill netting (85%) were within two meters of the river bottom. Analysis methods were standardized in 2005 based on lessons learned in 2004. The 2004 species-specific estimates were 9,046 American shad and 126,176 striped bass. The default estimates (and SEs) for 2005, assuming a uniform cross-channel density of upstream migrants, were 7,054 (450) American shad and 118,778 (4,799) striped bass. Using alternative assumptions about detectability of fish tracks and the cross-channel distribution of upstream migrants, estimates ranged between 5,422 (346) and 13,604 (887) American shad and 94,529 (3,807) and 534,750 striped bass. This first large-scale assessment of the Roanoke River American shad population is difficult to compare with surveys of relative abundance. Estimates of striped bass abundance appear low when compared to traditional stock assessment results. The largest uncertainties regarding the hydroacoustic monitoring is the cross-channel distribution of upstream migrants. For American shad, our study points to the difficulty in assessing the abundance of a target species that is rare in biological samples. Using hydroacoustics to estimate run sizes appears to be feasible, but improvements to the study design are needed. Further validation will improve both accuracy and precision of estimates, and allow fishery managers to use hydroacoustic results with confidence in making management decisions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07052006-223946/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antibody and Cellular Immune Responses of Swine Exposed to Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus or a GP5 Subunit Vaccine.</field><field name="creator">lee, kang mi</field><field name="description">Developing effective vaccines against the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has proved difficult, highlighting the need for basic information on the nature of the immune response against this virus and the mechanisms of resistance that the virus employs. In this investigation our goal was to characterize the immune response against the major outer membrane protein of the virus, GP5, in pigs experimentally infected with a North Carolina isolate of PRRSV known as the NC Powell strain. In addition, we compared this response with the immune response seen after vaccination with purified recombinant GP5 (rGP5) protein. Humoral immune responses were monitored by western blot and immunofluorescence while T cell responses were monitored using proliferation assays and flow cytometry. Our results show strong humoral recognition of rGP5 protein during both natural and vaccine induced Ab responses. In addition, epitope mapping via western blot revealed that Ab responses were directed largely against the C-terminal endodomain of rGP5 protein in both experimentally infected and vaccinated pigs. We also investigated T cell responses to rGP5 protein. Our experiments revealed that T cells from vaccinated animals also responded to both rGP5 protein and inactivated NC Powell strain of PRRSV suggesting that T cells may play an important role in vaccine-induced resistance. Interestingly, we found that the inactivated NC Powell strain of PRRSV caused a strong proliferative response in na&#239;ve T cells from control animals, perhaps indicating the presence of a superantigen as a component of this highly virulent strain of PRRSV.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07052007-104723/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Dynamics in Self-assembled Monolayers and Polymers studied via sensitive Dielectric Spectroscopy</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Derrick</field><field name="description">For many molecular systems, interpreting experimental molecular dynamics, by studying the response of a system to external stimuli, is a difficult task. Often the experimental response cannot be reasonably connected to a specific molecular motion. The aim of this work is to examine molecular systems where this difficulty can be overcome. We use sensitive dielectric spectroscopy to investigate the molecular dynamics of two different systems, chlorosilane self-assymbled monolayers and modified siloxane polymers. The polymers studied responded to changes in their surrounding media by altering their wetting characterstics. Because this macroscopic responsive is present, we are able correlate the microscopic response (as measured by dielectric spectroscopy) to likely molecular motions. The goal of the self-assembled monolayer work is similar albeit by a different approach. In this case, the degrees of freedom were limited by using surface bound molecules. By controlling the molecular density we are able to investigate both local, non-cooperative motions as well as interacting dynamics. Specifically, we will show a connection between the interacting dynamics of the self-assembled monolayers to glass transitions found in more complicated materials.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07052009-111325/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NOx Formation in Unsteady Counterflow Diffusion Flames</field><field name="creator">DeBruhl, Christopher Dwayne</field><field name="description">The formation of NO and NO2 are sensitive indicators of both temperature and residence time.

The flames studied vary from non-sooting to high soot loading, and from low average strain rate to near extinction. Due to the relatively long time scales associated with NOx formation, the effect of unsteadiness on emission index is weaker than on either temperature or soot volume fraction.

For the problem of interest, the underlying elasticity modulus is a constant in each phase but vary from phase to phase. The basic goal here is to design an efficient numerical method using a fixed Cartesian grid. The application of such a method to problems with moving interfaces driving by stresses has a great advantage: no re-meshing is needed. A local optimization strategy is employed to determine the finite difference equations at grid points near or on the interface. The bi-conjugate gradient method and the GMRES with preconditioning are both implemented to solve the resulting linear systems of equations and compared. The level set method is used to represent the interface.

Research and application are stunted without adequate measures that assess the extent to which leaders demonstrate ethical or unethical behaviors. As business activities between countries increase (Stephens &amp; Greer, 1995), having tests available in multiple languages can have various benefits (Zumbo, 2003). The availability of a measure in different languages can allow researchers and practitioners to facilitate assessment without having to build a new test, develop understandings of new cultural differences, and conduct comparative research. This study used the differential functioning of items and tests (DFIT; Raju, van der Linden, &amp; Fleer, 1995) framework, based on item response theory (IRT), to assess the measurement equivalence between two language versions of the Perceived Leader Integrity Scale (PLIS; Craig &amp; Gustafson, 1998) using samples collected from the United States, New Zealand, and Mexico. The U.S. and New Zealand samples formed the English speaking or US-NZ group and the Mexico sample formed the Spanish speaking group. Two indices of DFIT were used to determine item level (NCDIF) and test level (DTF) inequivalence between the comparison groups. Results showed 17.9% (5 out of 28) of the items to be differentially functioning. No significant DTF was identified at the test level. Post hoc explanations of the items with significant NCDIF in terms of possible cultural and linguistic influences provide information about the possible reasons why the items are functioning differentially (e.g. translation errors, cultural differences, or both). Practical implications of the current study are discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial and Organizational Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07062005-020822/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure-Property Relationships for Electron Transfer Kinetics in Metal Tris(bipyridine) Core Dendrimers</field><field name="creator">Hong, Young-Rae</field><field name="description">Structure property relationship in the redox-active core dendrimers were systematically studied by probing the rate and driving force for electron transfer. An isostructural series of redox-active, metal tris(bipyridine) core dendrimers were synthesized for this purpose. Various synthetic routes were attempted to introduce the bulky dendritic moieties to the bipyridine units with high yields. Heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics was studied by electrochemical methods. In the second generation of these dendrimers, a large attenuation of electron transfer rate was observed qualitatively. A newly designed thin layer electrode was constructed and utilized to study heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics in the second generation dendrimers. In the finite condition, the slow heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics in second generation dendrimers could be studied by computer simulation. Homogeneous electron self-exchange kinetics was studied by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The rate attenuation of electron transfer with dendrimer generation was not the same as the behavior found in heterogeneous, electrochemical electron transfer rate determinations. While a large attenuation was observed between the zeroth and first generation, the attenuation of electron transfer between the first and second generation was insignificant. This was rationalized by the concept of core mobility. The redox core in slow exchange limit can move in a non-rate limiting fashion toward a neighboring redox core with the result that the structural effect of the dendrimer is reduced and electron transfer is facilitated in larger dendrimers. For further studies, thermodynamic activation parameters were also obtained by variable temperature nuclear magnetic resonance studies.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07062005-123630/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning Community Participation and Sense of Community</field><field name="creator">Buck, Alison R.</field><field name="description">To perform well and persist at universities, students need to feel socially and academically integrated.

Due to the curvature that characterizes a compact serpentine duct, issues with flow distortion and total pressure loss at the engine face arise leading to reduction in propulsion system performance. Computational analysis has shown that flow control implementing micro-fluidic vortex generators significantly reduces the losses. Previous work at North Carolina State University has demonstrated the benefits of a fluidic flow control of this type in a highly compact serpentine inlet duct through the design and experimental static testing of a propulsion system for an uninhabited aerial vehicle. With the implementation of flow control, engine face distortion was reduced and propulsion system performance was increased. This work continues the investigation of the effectiveness of the fluidic flow control by examining the performance of the system during dynamic situations through high speed taxi testing of an uninhabited aerial vehicle implemented with this technology.

Despite these mechanisms, nonmelanoma skin cancer is the most common cancer in the US. Previous analysis of immortalized mouse keratinocytes has revealed that the bZIP transcription factor, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha), is induced by DNA damage and has a role in the G1 checkpoint. Here we demonstrate C/EBP alpha is induced in the epidermis of the human subjects exposed to UVB. To begin to determine the in vivo physiological significance of the up-regulation of C/EBP alpha by UVB, we generated an epidermal specific C/EBP alpha knockout (K5Cre;C/EBP alpha fl/fl) mouse on a SKH1 hairless background. Following UVB treatment, these mice displayed an impaired keratinocyte cycle arrest and abnormal entry of keratinocytes into S-phase. This impaired cell cycle checkpoint in UVB-treated C/EBP alpha&#239;&#160;deficient skin was associated with greatly diminished p21 levels which occurred through a p53-independent mechanism. To further investigate whether C/EBP alpha could function as a tumor suppressor gene in UVB induced skin tumorigenesis, we exposed K5Cre;C/EBP alpha fl/fl and K5Cre control SKH1 mice to 20mJ/cm2 UVB three times weekly. The K5Cre;C/EBP alpha fl/fl mice displayed both increased tumor incidence and multiplicity, suggesting that loss of C/EBP alpha in the epidermis confers increased susceptibility to UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis. In addition, we also observed that human skin SCC and BCC display greatly reduced or absent C/EBP alpha levels, implicating that loss of C/EBP alpha contributes to the development of human nonmelanoma skin cancers. Collectively, our results demonstrate that C/EBP alpha is induced by UVB in human skin, inhibits cell cycle progression in response to UVB in vivo and is a tumor suppressor gene in UVB induced skin tumorigenesis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toxicology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07062009-002822/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applications of Atmospheric Plasmas</field><field name="creator">Oldham, Christopher John</field><field name="description">Surface modification techniques using plasmas have generally been completed in a low pressure environment due to Pd (pressure x gap distance) considerations influencing the behavior of plasma generation. Generally, plasmas produced in a low pressure environment are of a non-thermal or cold nature. The basic feature of non-thermal plasmas is the majority of electrical energy used to generate the plasma is primarily used to produce energetic electrons for generating chemical species. Low pressure plasmas serve many purposes for materials processing. Since the plasma environment is contained within a closed vessel, the plasma can be controlled very easily. Low pressure plasmas have been used in many industries but the complexity associated with the large pumping stations and limitation to batch processing has motivated new work in the area of atmospheric plasmas. Atmospheric plasmas offer both economic and technical justification for use over low pressure plasmas. Since atmospheric plasmas can be operated at ambient conditions, lower costs associated with continuous processing and a decrease in the complexity of equipment validate atmospheric plasma processing as a next generation plasma-aided manufacturing processes. In an effort to advance acceptance of atmospheric plasma processing into industry, a process was developed, the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), in order to generate a homogeneous and non-thermal plasma discharge at ambient conditions. The discharge was applied to the reduction of known food borne pathogens, deposition of thin film materials, and modification of lignocellulosic biomass.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07062009-135218/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nanoscale Assembly for Molecular Electronics and In Situ Characterization during Atomic Layer Deposition</field><field name="creator">Na, Jeong-Seok</field><field name="description">The work in this dissertation consists of a two-part study concerning molecular-based electronics and atomic layer deposition (ALD). As conventional &#226;top-down&#226; silicon-based technology approaches its expected physical and technical limits, researchers have paid considerable attention to &#226;bottom-up&#226; approaches including molecular-based electronics that self assembles molecular components and ALD techniques that deposit thin films with atomic layer control. Reliable fabrication of molecular-based devices and a lack of understanding of the conduction mechanisms through individual molecules still remain critical issues in molecular-based electronics. Nanoparticle/molecule(s)/nanoparticle assemblies of &#226;dimers&#226; and &#226;trimers&#226;, consisting of two and three nanoparticles bridged by oligomeric ethynylene phenylene molecules (OPEs), respectively, are successfully synthesized by coworkers and applied to contact nanogap electrodes (&lt; 70 nm) fabricated by an angled metal evaporation technique. We demonstrate successful trapping of nanoparticle dimers across nanogap electrodes by dielectrophoresis at 2 VAC, 1 MHz, and 60 s. The structures can be maintained electrically connected for long periods of time, enabling time- and temperature-dependent current-voltage (I-V) characterization. Conduction mechanisms through independent molecules are investigated by temperature dependent I-V measurements. An Arrhenius plot of log (I) versus 1/T exhibits a change of slope at ~1.5 V, indicating the transition from direct tunneling to Fowler&#239;&#173;Nordheim tunneling. Monitoring of the conductance is also performed in real-time during trapping as well as during other modification and exposure sequences after trapping over short-term and long-term time scales. The real-time monitoring of conductance through dimer structures during trapping offers immediate detection of a specific fault which is ascribed to a loss of active molecules and fusing of the nanoparticles in the junction occurring mostly at a high applied voltage (&#226;&#165;3 VAC). After successful trapping, the sample exposure to air reveals a small rapid decrease in current, followed by a slower exponential increase, and eventual current saturation. This work also reports on the dependence of electron transport on molecular length (2 to 4.7 nm) and structure (linear-type in dimers and Y-type in trimers). The extracted electronic decay constant of ~0.12/&#195; and effective contact resistance of ~4 Megaohm&#239; indicate a strong electronic coupling between the chain ends, facilitating electron transport over long distances. A three terminal molecular transistor is also demonstrated with trimers trapped across nanogap electrodes. The source-drain current is modulated within a factor of 2 with a gate bias voltage of -2 to +2 V. A subthreshold slope of ~110 mV/decade is obtained. Finally, we report on both fundamental understanding and application of atomic layer deposition. First, in situ analysis tools such as quartz crystal microbalance and electrical conductance measurements are combined to reveal direct links between surface reactions, charge transfer, and dopant incorporation during ZnO and ZnO:Al ALD. Second, the ability of ALD to form uniform and conformal coating onto complex nanostructures is explored to improve the ambient stability of single molecules/nanoparticle assemblies using Al2O3 ALD as an encapsulation layer. In addition, the ability to shield the surface polarity of ZnO nanostructures using Al2O3 + ZnO ALD, leading to hierarchical morphology evolution from one-dimensional ZnO nanorods to three-dimensional ZnO nanosheets with branched nanorods during hydrothermal growth is investigated.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07062009-143027/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermophysical Properties of Ionic Liquid&#226;LiX Mixtures</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Qian</field><field name="description">Ionic liquids (ILs) have attracted strong interest due to their high chemical, thermal and electrochemical stability; wide liquid range; high ionic conductivity and low volatility.

These mixtures may become the electrolyte materials essential for the success of safer, high-voltage next-generation lithium batteries targeted for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and/or electric vehicles (EVs). At present, there is only a limited amount of data available in the literature regarding the thermal stability and phase behavior of IL-LiX electrolytes. Such information, however, is crucial for determining the electrolyte safety characteristics and useful operating temperature range, as well as for clarifying the composition-temperature relationship for other properties such as ionic conductivity. The thermal phase behavior, thermal stability and other properties (viscosity and density) are reported here for the neat ILs containing 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium (IM10R+, R = 1, 2 and 4 for methyl, ethyl and butyl, respectively) or N-alkyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium (PY1R+, R = 3-5) cations with TFSI- or FSI- anions, as well as their mixtures with LiTFSI or LiFSI salts.

In this study, supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) has been studied as an alternative route for modifying substrates due to the unique gas-like (low viscosity, high diffusivity and zero surface tension) and liquid-like properties (high density). 1) The reaction kinetics of metal oxides thin film deposition from pyrolysis of metal organics in scCO2 was studied in detail. This method was demonstrated as a powerful technique to coat oxides, including Al2O3, Ga2O3 and others, into 3D high aspect ratio complex structure of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) forest. 2) The low temperature scCO2 based hydrogenolysis process was developed as a useful way to functionalize aligned CNTs forest with dense Nickel nanoparticles. On the second part of this work, atomic layer deposition (ALD) /molecular layer deposition (MLD), as a vapor phase, stepwise and self-limiting vacuum based deposition process, was demonstrated as a powerful way to form highly conformal and uniform film onto substrates, even into highly complex 3D complex structures.

We attempt to overcome this limitation by providing a perceptual component to a cognitive model that interacts with more realistic environments. This perceptual component is an image processing substrate that has been customized for two different gaming environments. The substrate formerly worked only for the static environments we associate with conventional graphical user interfaces; the work we describe here extends its functionality to a more general class of interfaces, as represented by the driving game and Mars rover game.

Further advances in non-chemical weed control will require in-depth knowledge of weed biology. The objective of new strategies likely will be to alter competitive interactions between crop and weed species. An important part of weed biology, and often the basis for competitiveness, is species response to the environment. Environmental conditions differ greatly in different parts of the world. In agricultural systems, the low nitrogen status of some soils requires most crops to be amended. Weed populations can experience a wide range of fertilization regimes from year to year due to different crop rotations. Fertilization patterns in a rotation can lead to differential growth and reproductive performance of weeds and competitiveness with crops. In research described in the first two chapters, we attempt to determine the extent that lowering parental nutrition would impact weed growth, reproduction, and offspring vigor. The purpose was to begin evaluating benefits of controlling nitrogen fertility in agronomic systems on low fertility soils. Another environmental factor that could influence weed competitiveness is temperature. The significance of temperature responses will become increasingly important in the future. Global climate change models are predicting increases in the earth?s average surface temperature between 1.4- 5.8 &#186;C during the 21st century. As temperatures increase it is conceivable that warmer temperatures will alter competitive balance between crop and weed species, intensifying weed pressures. The expression of temperature response also will be a function of other interacting factors such as the ability to acquire water and nutrients. Resource acquisition is controlled to a large extent by root growth and interactions with soil microorganisms. The third chapter of this thesis is focused on temperature responses of selected plant species from an agroecological system. The purpose was to begin assessment of possible climate change effects on weed competitiveness. All of our experiments made extensive use of the weed Senna obtusifolia due to its importance in crops in the Southeastern U.S.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07072004-001526/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gd3+-Nitroxide Pairs for Protein-Membrane Studies: A Multifrequency EPR Approach</field><field name="creator">May, Shanna Marie</field><field name="description">The objective of this research project is to advance the well-established method of Site-Directed Spin Labeling (SDSL) Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) by utilizing many advantages that High Field EPR (HF EPR) could offer. Specifically, we propose to utilize nitroxide-Gd3+ label pairs for site-directed distance measurements in protein and protein-membrane structure studies. The proposed method is based on through space dipole-dipole interactions between Gd3+ ion positioned on the surface of the bilayer and a nitroxide label attached at the point of interest on the lipid molecule or membrane associated protein. The proposed labeling approach coupled with multifreqency EPR can provide information on Gd3+-nitroxide distance, as well as orientation of Gd3+. Experiments were conducted to investigate the mechanism of nitroxide-Gd3+ interactions in solutions of various viscosities at multiple magnetic fields (corresponding frequencies from 9.5 to 220 GHz) in order to determine relative contributions of dipole-dipole and exchange interactions in nitroxide-Gd3+ pairs at various viscosities and to elucidate the relaxation processes modulating the dipole-dipole interaction as a function of magnetic field. Applications for membrane and membrane protein studies are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07072004-145808/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of Amphiphilic Iron-Sulfur Core Dendrimers and Investigations into Their Encapsulation Abilities in Different Solutions</field><field name="creator">Cameron, Christopher Stan</field><field name="description">Several novel amphiphilic iron-sulfur core dendrimers were synthesized by modifying the tips of the dendrons to install hydrophilic peripheries.

It should be fair among flows and also have low operational complexity. The packet scheduling techniques that have been proposed earlier do not have both these properties. Schedulers like Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ) provide good fairness among flows but have high operational complexity. Schedulers like Weighted Round Robin (WRR) are efficient but provide poor fairness among flows. We propose a new packet scheduling technique, Tiered Service Fair Queueing (TSFQ), which is both fair and efficient. We achieve our goal by applying the concept of traffic quantization. A quantized network offers a small set of service levels (tiers), each with its own weight. Each flow is then mapped to one of the service levels so as to guarantee a QoS at least as good as that requested by the flow. We propose different versions of TSFQ, each with its own level of fairness. We present the complexity analysis of the TSFQ scheduler. Finally, we demonstrate through simulations on the TSFQ implementation on $ns-2$, that TSFQ provides good fairness among flows.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07072006-055149/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical Investigation of the Causes of Juvenile Delinquency in Ukraine: Toward Integration of Classic Strain and Control Theories</field><field name="creator">Antonaccio, Olena</field><field name="description">This research provides a new assessment of Merton&#226;s classic strain/anomie theory and addresses some of its empirical and theoretical problems. First of all, it compares alternative operationalizations of classic strain and reports the results of a test of the theory&#226;s generality using the survey data from Ukrainian adolescents. Second, the research evaluates the chances of improving classic strain theory by elaborating and possibly integrating it with other explanations of crime and delinquency, particularly those featuring such constraints on behavior as perceptions of punishment, social bonds, self-control, and morality. The findings from this study confirm that additional clarifications of the concept of classic strain may be promising. They also demonstrate the applicability of Merton&#226;s account to the Ukrainian context and indicate the importance of socio-cultural macro-level influences. Furthermore, the results concerning the possibility of theoretical elaboration of the classic strain/anomie theory provide limited support for mediating or moderating effects of the constraint variables on the strain-crime relationship. However, they show that some measures of classic strain as well as all crime-inhibiting factors exert significant independent effects on involvement in juvenile delinquency. Therefore, empirical evidence seems to suggest that more drastic transformations of Merton&#226;s theory may be required in order to turn it into a more satisfying account of misbehavior. In particular, it indicates the necessity of theoretical integration of the classic strain/anomie explanation of crime with those featuring constraints on behavior.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07072008-112920/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the Effect of Reduced Supplementation Frequency on Performance, Digestion and Metabolism of Stocker Cattle.</field><field name="creator">Drewnoski, Mary Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Supplements are often fed to stocker cattle on forage-based diets to improve animal performance. Delivery costs can make up a substantial portion of the cost of supplementation. Reducing supplementation frequency can reduce labor and equipment costs and therefore has the potential to increase profit. However, less frequent feeding requires feeding larger quantities of supplement at once and can increase the likelihood of negative associative effects of supplementation. Additionally, little is understood about the metabolic response of ruminants to large fluxuation in nutrient intake. A 50:50 blend of soyhulls and corn gluten feed is widely used by producers to supplement growing cattle. This blend is high in energy but low in starch. It also contains a moderate amount of protein, much of which is ruminally degradable. The purpose of this research was to determine the effect of reducing supplementation frequency of a soybean hull and corn gluten feed blend on performance, digestion, and concentrations of metabolites and hormonal growth regulators in blood of steers. In Experiment 1, growing steers consuming medium quality fescue hay were supplemented either daily, 3 times a week, or 2 times a week. Hay intake was decreased by reducing supplementation frequency but gains were not affected. As a result, the feed to gain ratio increased slightly with less frequent supplementation. In Experiment 2, six ruminally cannulated steers consuming medium quality fescue hay were used in a replicated 3 x 3 Latin square to determine the effect of supplement frequency (daily at 1% BW or on alternate days at 2% BW) on digestion and ruminal parameters. Reducing supplementation frequency decreased hay intake but did not affect digestibility of the diet. On the day of supplementation molar proportions both of propionate and butyrate in the rumen of steers supplemented on alternate days was increased compared to those supplemented daily. In Experiment 3, growing steers were individually fed medium quality hay and supplemented daily (1% BW) or on alternate days (2% BW). Gains did not differ due to supplementation frequency. However, plasma IGF-1 was greater and insulin tended to be greater in steers supplemented less frequently.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07072009-121037/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical Differentiation Using Statistical Design</field><field name="creator">Bodily, Chris H</field><field name="description">Derivatives are frequently required by numerical procedures across many disciplines. Numerical differentiation can be useful for approximating derivatives. This dissertation will introduce computational differentiation (the process by which derivatives are obtained with a computer), focusing on statistical response surface (RSM) designs for approximating derivatives. The RSM designs are compared with two competing numerical methods: namely a rival saturated statistical design approach, and a method employing finite differencing. A covariance model incorporating function curvature and computer round-off error is proposed for estimating the derivative approximation variances. These variances and the computational workload each method requires become the basis for comparing the derivative approximations. A diagnostic test for variable scaling errors is also described.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07082002-235127/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Herbicide and Nutrient Effects on the Development of Gray Leaf Spot Caused by Pyricularia grisea on Tall Fescue</field><field name="creator">Gregg, John Patrick</field><field name="description">Gray leaf spot, induced by &lt;I&gt;Pyricularia grisea&lt;/I&gt;, is a disease of increasing importance in tall fescue in the southeastern United States. Previous research has shown that several herbicides may predispose turfgrasses to some diseases and that certain essential nutrients may have antagonistic effects on fungal plant pathogens. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the effects of herbicide and nutrient treatments on gray leaf spot development in tall fescue. Inoculation techniques were also evaluated for establishing gray leaf spot on tall fescue in controlled environments. Field studies revealed that 2,4-D applications resulted in significantly higher quality turf and lower gray leaf spot incidence than the untreated control. Turf treated with 2,4-D amine + mecoprop + dicamba also exhibited significantly less foliar blight symptoms than the untreated control. In vitro experiments revealed the growth-inhibiting effects of 2,4-D on &lt;I&gt;P. grisea&lt;/I&gt; implicated in the field, as mycelial growth was completely inhibited at concentrations of 500 and 1000 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Colony growth was not affected at 2,4-D concentrations up to 100 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Phosphorous acid treatments resulted in a reduction in turf quality compared to an untreated control, as did manganese and zinc treatments. Foliar blight caused by P. grisea was substantially increased in H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-treated plots in 2003, where a 40% difference in blighted turf was observed between plots that received H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; treatments every 14 days and the untreated control. Area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) analysis also revealed the significant detrimental effects of the phosphorous acid treatments. No significant differences in disease incidence or leaf spot size among nutrient treatments were observed in greenhouse treatments. Isolate selection was a significant factor for disease development and leaf spot size following spray inoculation under optimal environmental conditions. In general, disease incidence increased as inoculum density increased. Placing plants in covered containers or plastic bags immediately following inoculation for a 24-h period also appeared to promote disease development. Seeding rate did not have a significant effect on gray leaf spot development. We conclude that herbicide applications do not predispose tall fescue to gray leaf spot development and that applications of nutrients alone do not suppress development of gray leaf spot in tall fescue. Adjusting cultural practices as additional control measures for gray leaf spot does not appear to be a successful approach to managing this increasingly important disease.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Pathology and Crop Science (co-major)</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07082004-113557/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial Prediction of Forest Soil Carbon: Spatial Modeling and Geostatistical Approaches</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Eric Scott</field><field name="description">Understanding the carbon cycle is one of the most difficult challenges facing scientists studying the global environment.A series of studies were undertaken to explore a number of current issues that contribute to our inability to model SOC on a regional or landscape scale.

Much of the synthetic effort herein is directed toward the development of a particular class of phthalocyanine, herein referred to as benzimidazoporphyrazines. Benzimidazoporphyrazines are desirable substitutes for typical phthalocyanines in applications requiring phthalocyanine-based materials. The value of benzimidazoporphyrazines is derived from their geometry, which provides four substitution positions at peripheral carbon atoms that lie along the N-N axes of the macrocycles. The modular construction of pigment arrays that include phthalocyanines may be greatly facilitated with the use of benzimidazoporphyrazines. The history of research in benzimidazoporphyrazines is brief, and has not heretofore provided access to benzimidazoporphyrazines bearing substituents that may serve as synthetic handles for modification of the pigments after their formation. This report details the development of synthetic methodology to prepare benzimidazoporphyrazines that bear useful synthetic handles. The synthesis of a set of such pigments is also described. Additionally, the new pigments (and one pigment array) are studied with regard to structural confirmation, as well as by photochemical and electrochemical means.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07082005-113852/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing Machinery to Harvest Small Diameter Woody Biomass Transforming a Fire Hazard into an Energy Crisis Solution</field><field name="creator">Hannum, Lindsay Cloud</field><field name="description">Energy demands continue to increase despite depleting fossil fuels and growing awareness of global climate changes. Biomass energy will play a vital role as the demand increases for renewable energy. North Carolina State University, the U S Forest Service, FECON, and Craven Wood Energy have partnered to develop the &#226;Kraken&#226; FECON&#226;s Bio- Harvester; a mulcher which cuts, chips, and collects Small Diameter Woody Biomass. This machine removes hazardous biomass fuel loads from the forest and supplies a new source of material to produce carbon neutral wood energy. Unlike agricultural biomass harvesting, the Kraken must harvest natural vegetation diverse in size and composition. Available biomass at each site must be quantified as it varies greatly with species, densities, and age. As we work to develop this piece of equipment efficiently collecting and transporting biomass in the field is our greatest challenge. The testing of the machine did not yield an economically viable system, however it does not subtract from the potential for the equipment especially when fire reduction and habitat restoration are factored into the products. With research and development these machine systems will be improved enabling small diameter woody biomass to become a competitive energy resource.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07082009-101816/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Synthesizable HDL Model for Out-of-Order Superscalar Processors.</field><field name="creator">Choudhary, Niket Kumar</field><field name="description">Many contemporary servers, personal and laptop computers, and even cell phones are powered by high-performance superscalar processors. In the past, conventional microarchitecture and technology scaling has afforded leaps in their performance and functionality. Today, conventional microarchitecture and technology scaling are both yielding lower returns with increasing costs. Therefore, any microarchitecture level decision to increase performance needs to be critically analyzed from a technology standpoint. To address this critical need, we have developed a register transfer level (RTL) model of a superscalar microarchitecture with similar complexity of a current generation processor. The RTL model is written in Verilog and is fully synthesizable. The model can be implemented in different technology nodes using a well established ASIC design flow to provide high fidelity estimation of propagation delay, power consumption, area, and other technology related costs. The RTL model is supplemented with a register file compiler to estimate the costs of multi-ported memory structures which are extensively used in a superscalar microarchitecture. The RTL model is also tightly integrated with a C++ functional simulator to assist and accelerate verification.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07082009-161145/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Precision Fabrication and Development of Charging and Testing Methods of Fixed-Abrasive Lapping Plates</field><field name="creator">Kametz, David Austin</field><field name="description">The recording head industry is one of the dominant users of advanced ceramics such as alumina, silicon nitride, silicon carbide and AlTiC. The high hardness of these materials makes diamond the optimal abrasive for machining. One challenge when manufacturing recording heads for rigid disk drives is to generate surfaces that are both planar and smooth. Flatness tolerances are in the range of a few tens of nanometers to a few hundred nanometers per millimeter of length [1]. Roughness tolerances are in the range of a few nanometers to the subnanometer range [1]. Fixed-abrasive lapping, sometimes called nanogrinding, is a common method of machining used on ceramics. Fixed-abrasive lapping is generally a two-body abrasive process, with the abrasive grain fixed in the lapping plate that produces an extremely smooth surface due to the controlled depth of cut. The process of fabricating a quality fixed-abrasive lapping plate is a lengthy and sometimes demanding process. The goals of this research are to investigate the current fabrication process for improvements in surface texture quality, charging time and waste reduction of abrasive as well as the development of methods and equipment capable of estimating the lapping qualities of the plate during it?s fabrication process. The improvement of this process will reduce plate fabrication time and improve lapping performance. Current processes used to fabricate a plate can require 2 hours or more, and often the lapping quality of the plate is unknown until it is used. The research started by analyzing the current process used. The surface texture and charging quality were analyzed by quantifying characteristics such as surface roughness, kurtosis, bearing ratio and diamond concentration. The new process developed at the Precision Engineering Center changed the surface texture from scratches of random geometry to a continuous spiral groove cut by a diamond turning machine. This texture not only has better reproducibility than the random scratches, but the geometry of the individual features can be better controlled. The charging mechanism was also changed from a large charging ring that was half the diameter of the lapping plate to a small rolling cylinder. The cylinder creates higher pressures and the ability to follow the profile of the plate. These changes created a shorter charging time, higher charging quality and reduced abrasive waste during the charging process. A tribometer was developed to test the charging quality of the plate during the charging process. It took advantage of the changing friction coefficient on the surface of the plate with charging time. The mechanism constructed and tested did not perform as designed, but can be used as a prototype for future developments. The use of other equipment for charging verification utilizing friction or other aspects of the charging process is viable.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07092002-084606/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the value of agent certification in global sourcing: An exploratory study in apparel sourcing</field><field name="creator">Garg, Ashwajeet</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research has been to explore the role of agent certification in the process of global sourcing. While some research has been done in the area of exporter-intermediary relationship, little has been done to study the importance of buyer-agent relationship and how the process of agent certification could strengthen that relationship. Global sourcing has played a vital role in the existence of textile and apparel industries across the world. With the increased advancement of developing countries and the numerous advantages that these countries possess, developed countries, such as the United States and countries in the European sub-continent, rely heavily on global sourcing to remain competitive in the global marketplace. Due to numerous barriers to global sourcing such as language barriers and inability to check sources, companies have found it useful to source through agents. These agents act as the facilitators between the sources and the buyers. With the advent of Internet and e-commerce, online sourcing has come into picture. Although the transparency in terms of sources and buyers on the web and their processes has increased and organizations are thinking of certifying sources, the role of agents' sill exists. A total of 30 agents and apparel-manufacturing buyers were interviewed to assess the feasibility and role of agent certification in the global sourcing process. While the specific items to be certified were not confirmed, both types of subjects agreed that agent certification would assist in the transactions in the buyer-agent relationship. It was found that small and medium-sized buyers would find agent certification more useful than large-sized buyers because of small-size buyers' limited resources and potential to find trusted agents.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile and Apparel, Technology and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07092002-144057/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-Tensioned Clay Brick Masonry Walls for Modular Housing in Seismic Regions</field><field name="creator">Rosenboom, Owen Arthur</field><field name="description">From past research post-tensioned concrete masonry walls have performed well due to in-plane loading, yet despite the advantage of being more aesthetically pleasing, post-tensioned clay brick masonry walls have not been investigated under this loading.

This study addressed the hypothesis that overwinter mortality affects the recruitment of summer-spawned bluefish. A trawling survey was conducted in Onslow Bay, NC from October 2001 to May 2002 and from September 2002 to June 2003. Up to four transects were sampled monthly each ranging from 0.4 to 16.1 kilometers from shore. Lipid content of white muscle and livers were determined using soxhlet extraction. Abundance of bluefish in Onslow Bay depended on winter severity, as catches during the winter were higher during the more mild winter of 2001-02. The highest catches of bluefish occurred within two miles of shore and were strongly associated with anchovy and clupeid prey. Bluefish recruitment was shown to be more complex than previously supposed; at least three young-of-the-year cohorts were observed for both year-classes. Energy reserves peaked in November with larger fish having disproportionately more energy. However, by mid-winter there was little difference in energy storage between the cohorts. These data suggest that larger fish deplete a greater portion of their energy stores as the season progresses while smaller fish defend their energy levels by feeding. Catch data show that summer-spawned bluefish survive the winter despite having lower energy reserves. However, the magnitude of overwinter mortality remains uncertain.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07092004-112131/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">No-Till Pumpkin Production.</field><field name="creator">Harrelson, Enoch Ryan</field><field name="description">Vegetable growers in the Southeast US have successfully used cultivation to grow pumpkins. Many growers, due to the lack of surface applied herbicides, no-till planting equipment, and knowledge of conservation tillage methods for vegetables, have not pursued no-till pumpkin production in this region. All of these production aides are now present for successful no-till plantings. Reasons to use no-till technology for pumpkins include soil moisture conservation, cleaner fruit and similar yields as conventional tillage, and long-term improvements of soil chemical, microbial, and physical properties of the soil. The objectives of the two experiments were to evaluate the influence of surface residue type and amount on yield and quality of no-till pumpkins, and to establish planting date and nitrogen (N) rate recommendations. Results suggest that a minimum amount of residue is required for good no-till pumpkin yields, but increasing residues beyond 5600-6720 kg ha-1 will not affect pumpkin yield. Although this range will vary with location, weather conditions, and soil type, a vegetable grower should expect to successfully grow no-till pumpkins at these residue rates. Planting date and N rate greatly influenced no-till pumpkin yields. Planting dates that were earlier than traditional planting dates increased yields at one location where cooler weather conditions persist, but had minimal affect at a second warmer mountain region location. The highest rate of 120 kg Nha-1 produced the greatest yields, suggesting that perhaps a greater N rate may have continued to increase yield.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07092004-120503/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Long-term Impacts of Changing Land-use Practices on Water Quality and Phytoplankton Assemblages in the Neuse Estuary Ecosystem, North Carolina</field><field name="creator">Rothenberger, Megan Beth</field><field name="description">The goal of this research was to build upon present understanding of the eutrophication process in the Neuse Estuary ecosystem by evaluating linkages among land use practices, nutrient concentrations and ratios, and phytoplankton assemblage composition. First, geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis was used to characterize 26 sub-basins throughout the Neuse watershed for changes in land use over the past decade. GIS was also used in concert with multivariate statistics to synthesize and integrate ten years of land cover and water quality data into a conceptual model. Second, a continuous, decadal record of the phytoplankton in the mesohaline Neuse Estuary, in conjunction with synoptic measurement of environmental variables, provided a unique opportunity to evaluate responses of the phytoplankton assemblages to changing environmental conditions. Ordination techniques were used to investigate potential environmental predictors of phytoplankton community patterns through the process of eutrophication. Analyses indicated that over the past 10 years, total phosphorus concentrations were significantly higher during summer months in sub-watersheds with high densities of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and confined swine feed operations. Nitrate concentrations were significantly higher during winter in sub-watersheds with high WWTP densities, and both inorganic and organic forms of nitrogen were significantly higher in sub-watersheds with greater agricultural land use. Ammonium concentrations were significantly higher after high-precipitation periods, but were not significantly correlated with the land-use parameters included in this study. In the Neuse Estuary, among several important findings, abundance of the potentially toxic, bloom-forming dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum was positively related to low water temperatures (winter/spring) and organic nitrogen and suspended solids concentrations. In addition, abundance of other potentially toxic flagellated algae such as the raphidophyte, Heterosigma akashiwo, has increased over the past decade, and H. akashiwo was found to be an ?indicator species? for high ammonium concentrations (&gt; 50 &#956;g/L). Overall, the data indicate that wastewater discharges in the upper Neuse basin and intensive swine agriculture in the lower basin have been the highest contributors of nitrogen and phosphorus to receiving surface waters. In the estuary, increased nutrients, especially ammonium, are promoting increased abundance of several potentially toxic, bloom-forming phytoplankton species.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07092007-095443/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modification of Polymer Membranes: A Study of Crosslinking and In-Situ Growth of Palladium-Containing Nanoparticles in Polymer Matrices.</field><field name="creator">Aberg, Christopher Mark</field><field name="description">A crucial step in obtaining pure hydrogen is separating it from other compounds&#226;mainly CO2&#226;that often accompany hydrogen in industrial chemical reactions. Advanced membrane technology may prove to be the key to the successful, economical production of molecular hydrogen for the eventual consumer market. Size-sieving glassy polymer membranes can separate H2 on the basis of its small size. Alternatively, reverse-selective rubbery polymers can expedite the passage and, hence, removal of CO2 due to its relatively high solubility in such membranes alone or in conjunction with dissociative chemical reactions. Transition-metal membranes and their alloys can adsorb H2 molecules, dissociate the molecules into H atoms for transport through interstitial sites, and subsequently recombine the H atoms to form molecular H2 again on the opposite membrane side. Microporous amorphous silica and zeolite membranes comprising thin films on a multilayer porous support exhibit good sorption selectivity and high diffusion mobilities for H2, leading to high H2 fluxes. Finally, carbon-based membranes, including carbon nanotubes, may be viable for H2 separation on the basis of selective surface flow and molecular sieving. One approach to achieve higher gas selectivity is to cross-link polymer membranes, thus restricting the ability of gases of various sizes to readily permeate at an unimpeded rate. Cross-linking can occur through a number of means: UV and ion irradiation, plasma treatment, or chemical and thermal techniques. In this study, a chemical technique has been chosen to cross-link the polyimide Matrimid&#194;&#174;. Polyimides are well-established as gas-separation membranes due to their intrinsically low free-volume and correspondingly high H2 selectivity relative to other gases such as CO2. Prior studies have established that H2/CO2 selectivity can be improved by cross-linking polyimides with diamines differing in spacer length. In this first set of work, we follow the evolution of macroscopic and microscopic properties of a commercial polyimide over long cross-linking times (tx) with 1,3-diaminopropane. According to spectroscopic analysis, the cross-linking reaction saturates after ~24 h, whereas tensile, nanoindentation and stress-relaxation tests reveal that the material stiffens, and possesses a long relaxation time that increases, with increasing tx. Although differential scanning calorimetry shows that the glass transition temperature decreases systematically with increasing tx, permeation studies indicate that the permeabilities of H2 and CO2 decrease, while the H2/CO2 selectivity increases markedly, with increasing tx. At long tx, the polyimide becomes impermeable to CO2, suggesting that it could be used as a barrier material. Alternatively, polymer nanocomposites continue to receive considerable attention as multifunctional hybrid materials, with most nanocomposites fabricated by physical dispersion of surface-functionalized nanoscale objects. In the second study, we explore the viability of growing Pd-containing nanoparticles from Na2PdCl4 in two different polymers &#226; hyper-cross-linked polystyrene (HPS) and an aromatic polyimide (PIm). In HPS, single Pd-containing nanoparticles possessing a relatively narrow size distribution (ca. 1-4 nm) are observed to form upon reduction of the divalent PdCl4-2 ions and cluster more readily if the reducing agent is introduced as a liquid. Single nanoparticles with a broad size distribution ranging from ~2 to 16 nm develop in PIm, which simultaneously undergoes chemical cross-linking during ion reduction. The conditions yielding Pd incorporation in PIm are explored through the use of instrumental neutron activation analysis. Such Pd-containing hybrid materials hold promise in molecular catalysis and gas separations. Results from these studies give prospect that these materials, with a great deal of future research, could be developed for H2 separations applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07092008-182305/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perpetuating Color-Blind Ideology: Middle School Children and Their Understanding of Race</field><field name="creator">Bellota, Angella A.</field><field name="description">Current sociological research argues that children are social actors in their own right, and are capable of using race when explaining their social worlds. It is also argued that in order to examine how racial ideologies are produced and reproduced, we must look at day-to-day events as the arena where ideologies are learned and lived. In order to examine if children in the 21st century reproduce and perpetuate racist ideologies, I analyze 44 interviews with white and non-white middle school children from a small southeastern city. My results indicate that middle school children share racial stereotypes that reinforce racism. More importantly, in applying Eduardo Bonilla-Silva&#226;s conceptual framework of color-blind ideology, my findings suggest that although many of the respondents in this sample expressed equality rhetoric, their statements end up justifying racial inequality.

When conditions are not suitable for land application, broiler cake (or litter) may be stored in stockpiles which may contribute to ammonia emission. In this study, summer and winter ammonia emission factors from broiler cake stockpiles stored in a naturally ventilated shed were developed. The lab experiment measured relative ammonia emissions as affected by type of cover and depth of cake. Scrubbers were used to measure ammonia concentration both in the field and lab studies. In the field, the integrated horizontal flux (IHF) method and Fick&#226;s law of diffusion were used to determine ammonia emissions due to forced and natural convections, respectively. The ammonia emission due to natural convection was &lt;0.01% of total emission. However, it may be necessary to calculate emissions based on concentrations measured only during conditions of forced convection. In summer, the estimated total ammonia-N loss was 0.8 % of total N. In winter, the total ammonia loss was 1.4 % of total N during the first 7 d and 2.5 % for the whole 15-d period. The estimated average daily ammonia emission factor in summer (7 d) was 24.5 g NH3-N/m3-d of cake or 7.0 g NH3-N/AU (500 kg LW)-d. The estimated daily ammonia emission factor for the first 7 d in winter was 35.6 g NH3-N/m3&#226;d or 42.5 g NH3-N/AU-d. The total ammonia lost during the 15-d winter study was 33.8 g NH3-N/m3-d or 40.2 g NH3-N/ AU-d. Ammonia losses from the tarp covered cake were significantly lower than the control and double depth treatments by 45% and 49%, respectively, at the end of study. Ammonia losses (g/m3) are lower from stockpiles with lower surface area per unit volume.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological and Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07092009-095204/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensory and Instrumental Analysis of Pasteurized Dill Pickles Made from Acidified, Bulk Stored Cucumbers</field><field name="creator">Kuhlman, Nicholas Grant</field><field name="description">Storing fresh cucumbers for an 8 to 12 week period in an acidified, non-fermented environment prior to processing would extend the time for processing locally grown cucumbers into pasteurized pickle products. The effect of acidified storage of fresh cucumbers for up to 120 days prior to their conversion to pasteurized dill pickles was evaluated. Cucumbers stored at 18&#194;&#186;C prior to pasteurization maintained a fresh, non-cured appearance as well as a firm texture. Equilibrated acid concentrations of 3.5% acetic acid also helped to reduce the amount of curing and maintained firmness in cucumber tissue. Dill pickles made from acidified, bulk stored cucumbers maintained a firm texture after pasteurization. However, the cured appearance of bulk stored cucumbers increased by 40% within 30 days of pasteurization so that it was much higher than the cured appearance of dill pickles made directly from the same lot of fresh cucumbers and stored for an equivalent period of time after pasteurization. Sour, sweet, bitter and vinegar intensities were similar for dill pickles prepared from either bulk stored or fresh cucumbers. Firmness, saltiness, and dill flavor while significantly different, differed by less than 1 point on a 15-point scale. The major flavor difference between pasteurized dill pickles made from stored acidified cucumbers and pickles made directly from fresh cucumbers is that pickles made from stored cucumbers had an &#226;other&#226; flavor. The intensity of this flavor was perceived at a similar level regardless of the brine composition or storage time of the cucumbers prior to pasteurization. Descriptors for this &#226;other&#226; flavor were chlorine, pool, barny and metallic. GCxGC-TOFMS analysis of volatile components in dill pickles prepared from bulk stored cucumbers and dill pickles prepared from fresh cucumbers resulted in detection of 24 components that were significantly different (p&lt;0.05) between at least one treatment pair. Individual volatile components did not provide a clear basis for differentiation among different storage brine treatments. However, PCA analysis using the 24 components was able to differentiate treatments.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07092009-110919/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Single molecule fluorescence reveals dynamic structures of SNARE protein assemblies</field><field name="creator">Choi, Ucheor B.</field><field name="description">Conformational information about proteins can often reveal the mechanisms of their biological functions. This thesis examines conformational aspects of the synaptic SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) protein complex that is essential for membrane fusion leading to Ca2+ triggered neurotransmitter release. Biochemical and high-resolution structural studies of SNARE proteins and several different assemblies of these proteins have provided a foundation for our understanding of neurotransmitter release, but the exact mechanisms these protein machines use to effect membrane fusion are still unclear. Here we apply single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy to this problem. Single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is used to characterize dynamic aspects of intermediate structures of SNARE proteins along the pathway to full SNARE complex formation. Several SNAREs fall into the class of intrinsically unstructured proteins. We have used FRET to characterize these unstructured molecules as well as the development of specific conformations as they assemble into the SNARE complex. Finally, the structure of synaptotagmin bound to the fully assembled SNARE complex is derived using smFRET measurements as constraints for docking calculations. A common theme is the dynamic nature of many of these proteins and complexes. Dynamic protein structures are increasingly being recognized as critical for many functions of a wide variety of proteins. The methods developed in this thesis are expected to find increasing applications in future studies of the structure-function relationship in many biological macromolecules.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07092009-120330/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modification of Nylon 6 Structure via Nucleation</field><field name="creator">Mohan, Anushree</field><field name="description">For nearly two decades inclusion compounds (ICs) have been formed by threading polymer chains into the cyclic starches, cyclodextrins (CDs). Non-covalently bonded crystalline ICs have been formed by threading CDs, onto guest nylon-6 (N6) chains. When excess N6 is employed, non-stoichiometric (n-s)-N6-CD-ICs with partially uncovered and dangling N6 chains result. We have been studying the constrained crystallization of the N6 chains dangling from (n-s)-N6-CD-ICs in comparison with bulk N6 samples, as a function of N6 molecular weights, lengths of uncovered N6 chains, and the CD host used. While the crystalline CD lattice is stable to ~ 300&#194;&#176; C, the uncovered and dangling, yet constrained, N6 chains may crystallize below, or be molten above ~225&#194;&#176; C. In the IC channels formed with host &#206;&#177;- and &#206;&#179;-CDs containing 6 and 8 glucose units, respectively, single and pairs of side-by-side N6 chains can be threaded and included. In the &#206;&#177;-CD-ICs the ~ 0.5nm channels are separated by ~ 1.4nm, while in &#206;&#179;-CD-ICs the ~ 1nm channels are ~ 1.7 nm apart, with each &#206;&#179;-CD channel including two N6 chains. The constrained dangling chains in the dense (n-s)-N6-CD-IC brushes crystallize faster and to a greater extent than those in bulk N6 melts, and this behavior is enhanced as the molecular weights/chain lengths of N6 are increased. Furthermore, when added at low concentrations (n-s)-N6-CD-ICs serve as effective nucleating agents for the bulk crystallization of N6 from the melt. Because of the biodegradable/bioabsorbable nature of CDs, (n-s)-polymer-CD-ICs can provide environmentally favorable, non-toxic nucleants for enhancing the melt crystallization of polymers and improving their properties.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiber and Polymer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07092009-181421/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the Relationship between Science and Faith, the Nature of Science, and Controversial Content Understandings</field><field name="creator">Dickerson, Daniel Lee</field><field name="description">This study examines the views of the relationship between science and faith and the understandings of biological evolution, geologic history and the nature of science, with emphasis on the use of evidence, held by United Methodist ministers, pre-service science teachers, and pre-service language arts/social studies teachers.

This cross-sectional study used a written self-report questionnaire to evaluate levels of job-related psychological stress, exposure to ergonomic stressors, and 12-month and 7-day prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints in radiologic technologists who worked in hospital or clinic-based settings in one health system. Written surveys based on interviews and direct observations of radiologic technologists and adapted from the Job Content Questionnaire and the Nordic Questionnaire were used to elicit information about psychological stress from a control-demands theory approach, work organization factors, categories of work performed, types of equipment utilized, prevalence and severity of musculoskeletal symptoms, and specific personal and health factors. Associations between personal factors, the type of work performed and the presence and severity of musculoskeletal symptoms were explored through statistical analysis. Work stress factors for radiologic technologists sin this study were compared to similar health technologists and nurses from a previously established database of Job Content Questionnaire scores. RESULTS: Radiologic technologists have a high prevalence of low back symptoms that are likely to interfere with work and leisure activities. Patient positioning was associated with an increased prevalence of low back symptoms. Transporting equipment was associated with an increased risk of experiencing right hand/wrist symptoms and dominant hand/wrist symptoms. Working as a sonographer was associated with increased risk of experiencing symptoms in the right shoulder, dominant shoulder, right hand/wrist and dominant hand/wrist. Positioning patients was associated with greater risk of experiencing musculoskeletal symptoms in the low back. Technologists in this study were older and had more education than other health care technologists from previous research using the Job Content Questionnaire. They had better scores for decision authority, decision latitude and supervisor support than the other technologists. However, they also had higher levels of physical exertion and psychological demands than the other technologists. They had a similar distribution of males versus females, and scores for created skills, job insecurity, total social support, co-worker support and job dissatisfaction as the other health technologists. Technologists in this study were older than nurses in previous research conducted with the Job Content Questionnaire. They had higher scores for decision authority and reported higher levels for psychological demands than the nurses in previous research. CONCLUSIONS: This group of radiologic technologists had a very high prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms that were likely to interfere with work and leisure activities. Tasks related to patient handling and positioning and transporting equipment were associated with higher prevalence of symptoms. Results of this study may provide direction for future research efforts toward quantifying biomechanical exposures for radiologic technologists.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07102004-165004/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of an Introductory Agricultural Education Course on Agricultural Literacy and Perceptions of Agriculture in Urban Students</field><field name="creator">Riedel, Jodi Songer</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study has been to determine the effects of an introductory agricultural education course on high school urban students agricultural literacy and their perceptions of the food and fiber industry. North Carolina schools offer an introductory course called Agriscience Applications and is meant to be the first in a series of agricultural education courses. This course is expected to positively impact the agricultural literacy and perceptions of agriculture upon its students. Data were collected from six schools in urban counties throughout North Carolina with 152 respondents. Five questions were specified for this study as follows: 1) Does an introductory agricultural education course increase students agricultural literacy in an urban agricultural education program; 2) does an introductory agricultural education course increase student knowledge of agricultural careers and opportunities for employment; 3) does an introductory agricultural education class increase student knowledge of agriculture?s relationship with public policy; 4) does an introductory agricultural education class change a student?s understanding of agriculture?s relationship with the environment and natural resources; 5) what influence does an introductory agricultural education class have upon students? perceptions of the food and fiber industry? Upon completion of the Agriscience Applications course, students did increase their agricultural literacy.

Currently the only standard fatigue test available for asphalt concrete mixtures is the flexural bending fatigue test, AASHTO T-321. There are several issues associated with flexural fatigue testing, the most important of which are the stress state is not uniform but varies over the depth of the specimen and equipment for fabricating beam specimens is not widely available. Viscoelastic continuum damage (VECD) fatigue testing is a promising alternative to flexural fatigue testing. Different researchers have successfully applied the VECD model to asphalt concrete mixtures using constant crosshead rate direct tension test. However, due to the load level limitation of the new coming Asphalt Mixture Performance Tester (AMPT) testing equipment, there is an immediate need to develop a model that can characterize fatigue performance quickly using cyclic test data. In this study, a simplified viscoelastic continuum damage model developed at NCSU is applied to various North Carolina mixtures, which are used in the NCDOT HWY-2007-7 MEPDG local calibration project. It is shown that the simplified VECD model can predict fatigue tests fairly accurately under various temperature conditions and strain levels. It is also shown that the model can be further utilized to simulate both the strain controlled direct tension fatigue test and the traditional beam fatigue test. In this thesis, simulation results are presented. Conclusions regarding the applicability of the new model are advanced as well as suggestions for further work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07102009-011752/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transaction-level Modeling for a Network-on-chip Router in Multiprocessor System</field><field name="creator">Hu, Jianchen</field><field name="description">As the complexity of SoC design grows, the traditional register transfer level (RTL) centric design flow cannot meet the time to market.

Despite its importance, our knowledge about its mechanism and regulation is very limited. Although it is known that the regulation of AS is influenced by multiple factors, most previous studies have focused on analyzing an individual regulator. In this dissertation, we apply three types of association rule mining techniques to discover cis-regulatory motifs or motif groups that are associated with specific AS patterns in mouse. General association rule mining for categorical attributes is used to find &#226;motif=&gt;motif&#226; rules in gene groups that show similar exon skipping patterns. This method provides candidates for interacting motifs. Discretization-based and distribution-based quantitative association rule mining techniques are used to find &#226;motif =&gt; exon skipping profile&#226; rules. Many of the discovered motif candidates coincide with known splicing factor binding sites. Our ultimate goal is to find motifs and motif combinations that are involved in the dynamic regulation of AS. Based on our observations we hypothesize that some cis-regulatory elements affect AS only in combination with other elements. Interacting motifs show interesting differences to motifs that act individually. For example, interacting motif pairs are more conserved, they occur on average closer to the splice sites, motif pairs derived from distribution-based association rule mining, occur also in higher multiplicity. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that interacting cis-regulatory motifs might often correspond to weaker binding sites that occur in clusters close to the regulated splice sites.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07102009-092656/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Mowing on Anthraquinone for Deterrence of Canada Geese and Survey of Canada Goose Fecal Contaminants</field><field name="creator">Ayers, Christopher Ryan</field><field name="description">Resident Canada goose (Branta canadensis) populations have increased in urbanizing regions of the eastern United States, where man-made ponds and lakes surrounded by managed turfgrass offer ideal habitats. High concentrations of geese in these areas may cause feces accumulation, outbreaks of zoonotic diseases, eutrophication of adjacent waterways, and spread of turfgrass weeds. Although repellents effectively deter geese from turfgrass areas, frequent mowing (e.g., as in corporate parks and golf courses) may impact the efficacy of repellents. We tested the effect of 2 different mowing schedules on the longevity of FlightControl&#194;&#174; PLUS (FCP), an anthraquinone based avian digestive irritant. From June 2007 to October 2008, we conducted 4, 30-day experiments of repellent efficacy on free-ranging geese at 8 sites. Sites were divided into 4 0.1-ha plots, each containing a unique treatment of the repellent (treated or untreated) and mowing frequency (4-day or 8-day). Each experimental session consisted of a 7-day pretreatment period of baseline observations and 30 days of post-treatment observations. Goose droppings were collected daily from transects in each plot, and percent of grass with FCP remaining was measured daily. Also, we tested 234 droppings for Giardia lamblia using a ProSpect Giardia EZ Microplate Assay, measured amounts of nitrogen (TKN) and phosphorus (TP) in 304 fecal samples, and observed 127 potted droppings for plant germination in a greenhouse. On average, goose use of FCP treated plots was lower than on untreated plots for 30 days. Over the 30 day period, goose use and FCP coverage was similar between treated plots mowed every 4 and 8 days. Further, the average FCP coverage on grass blades in treated plots decreased steadily from approximately 95% to 10%. None of the fecal samples tested positive for Giardia. The average amounts of TKN and TP in fecal samples were 24.2 mg/g (range = 12.6 &#226; 55.7) and 3.6 mg/g (range = 1.4 &#226; 8.3) of dry matter, respectively, with an average of 4,318.0 g/ha/day deposited by &#226;42 geese. No controls germinated plants, whereas 4 (3.1%) fecal samples germinated plants: Pennsylvania smartweed (Polygonum pennsylvanicum L.), annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.), and 2 Kyllinga spp. FlightControl&#194;&#174; PLUS effectively repelled Canada geese, but longevity of the chemical depends on keeping treated blades alive and under mowing height. Transmission of G. lamblia by Canada geese does not appear to be a high risk. Resident Canada goose droppings at our study sites contribute 17 &#226; 31% of recommended N and 17 &#226; 38% of recommended P in lawn fertilization rates. Kyllinga spp. and annual bluegrass are turfgrass weeds; however the low percentage of germinations indicates little risk of turf-feeding Canada goose weed dispersal. I recommend using FCP on areas of highest goose concentration before and when they are most prevalent. This should be done along with reduction of palatable turfgrass and annual lethal reductions. Fertilization rates should be adjusted depending on the number of geese present and the concentration of their droppings in order to save money and prevent eutrophication. Periodic testing of goose droppings for Giardia lamblia and weed seeds may prevent infestations. Research is needed to find the optimal mowing rate to keep treated blades alive and below mowing height. Information on the movements of resident Canada geese will be important for management of free-ranging populations. Identifying or developing turfgrasses that are unpalatable to Canada geese would be highly useful. If geese test positive for Giardia sp. cysts, trophozoites should be collected to identify species. The alternative to this method is to develop species specific assays. Also, research is needed on the result of resident Canada goose fecal nitrogen and phosphorus deposition on adjacent water quality.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07102009-101753/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Control of Biological Processes with Modified Nucleosides, Amino Acids, and Small-Molecule Probes</field><field name="creator">Lusic, Hrvoje</field><field name="description">Several novel caging groups with a wide range of applications were designed.

The broken mechanism of aligned nanofibers was further confirmed by crystallinity parameters obtained from DSC and fiber diameter shown from SEM images.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07102009-165411/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">?To the Last Man and the Last Dollar?: Governor Henry Toole Clark and Civil War North Carolina, July 1861 to September 1862.</field><field name="creator">Poteat, R. Matthew</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the life and political career of Henry Toole Clark, the second of North Carolina?s three Civil War governors. Clark served one term as the state?s chief executive from July 1861 to September 1862, a crucial period in which North Carolina established itself as a constituent member of the Confederate States and first suffered the hardships of war. As the leader of the state in that formative period, he mobilized thousands of troops for the Southern cause, established the first, and only, Confederate prison in North Carolina, arranged the production of salt for the war effort, created European purchasing connections, and built a successful and important gunpowder mill. Clark, however, found more success as an administrator than as a political figure. The Edgecombe County planter devoted over twenty years to the service of the Democratic Party at the local, state, and national levels, and over ten years as a state senator. As governor, he was unable to maneuver in the new political world ushered in by the Civil War, and he retired abruptly from public service at the end of his term. Clark?s life and career offer insight into the larger world of the antebellum planter-politician, that dominant group of southern leaders who led the region into dependence upon slavery and, ultimately, to war. Though the planter class was diverted from power for a brief time during Reconstruction, the political and racial ideology of that class would shape conservative white southern thought for the next hundred years.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07112005-210225/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling the Anthropogenic Spread of an Aquatic Invasive Species: The Case of Zebra Mussels and Transient Recreational Boating in Wisconsin</field><field name="creator">Timar, Levente</field><field name="description">Transient recreational boating is the principal overland vector of dispersal for several freshwater invasive species. Traditional models of human-mediated aquatic invasions use aggregate data on boating patterns, and are unable to incorporate changes in boater behavior. This limits their practicality because most control policies, by targeting the human vector, are expected to have behavioral consequences, and a complete policy assessment needs to consider the resultant shift in invasion pressure. In this dissertation, I develop a framework that utilizes site choice probabilities from a travel cost recreation demand model to quantify anthropogenic invasion threat to a water body. This integrated behavioral approach enables the researcher to trace the effects of any perturbation that elicits a behavioral response, and to translate them into changes in site-specific invasion probabilities. I employ spatial and temporal data on the distribution of zebra mussels in Wisconsin, and the results of a large revealed preference boater survey in the state to empirically implement the model. Finally, I demonstrate via counterfactuals that a control policy that reduces the desirability of an infested choice alternative is less effective than a traditional model would imply. In some situations, the policy may be not only expensive in terms of lost consumer surplus, but also counterproductive in terms of increasing (instead of decreasing) the probability of zebra mussel spread to the uninfested water bodies it is designed to protect. Similar unintended consequences would be impossible to identify in a traditional, non-behavioral approach.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07112008-122212/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population Dynamics of Rhizoctonia Species in Tall Fescue and Creeping Bentgrass in Response to Disease Management Programs</field><field name="creator">Lee, David Jackson</field><field name="description">&lt;I&gt;Rhizoctonia&lt;/I&gt; species are important pathogens of all turfgrasses, yet little is known about the structure of populations of these pathogens or the effect of disease control programs on population dynamics. Isolates of &lt;I&gt;Rhizoctonia&lt;/I&gt; were obtained from a single creeping bentgrass putting green in 2002 and 2003 and from multiple tall fescue landscapes in 2003. Creeping bentgrass isolates were obtained by placing 5 mm soil cores on alkaline water agar, incubated at ~24 C for 1 to 2 days and the actively growing hyphae were transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA). Tall fescue isolates were obtained from foliar lesions using the same procedures. Isolates were characterized using morphological characteristics, anastomosis reactions, nuclear staining, and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences. From creeping bentgrass, 21 distinct clones of &lt;I&gt;R. solani&lt;/I&gt; AG 2-2 IIIB were present in the sample population in 2002. Seven of these clones were also recovered on multiple sampling dates. Fifteen of the 21 clones from 2002 were recovered in 2003. All seven clones that were isolated in multiple sampling dates in 2002 were also recovered in 2003. There were 29 and 21 isolates of &lt;I&gt;R. zeae&lt;/I&gt; collected from the sample population in 2002 and 2003, respectively. All 21 clones exhibited similar EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values to mancozeb, chlorothanlonil and azoxystrobin. Of 224 isolates collected from tall fescue during 2003, 88 were &lt;I&gt;R. solani&lt;/I&gt; AG 1, 105 were binucleate &lt;I&gt;Rhizoctonia&lt;/I&gt; CAG 1, 14 were &lt;I&gt;R. zeae&lt;/I&gt;, two were &lt;I&gt;R. cerealis&lt;/I&gt;, and 15 were not identified to species or AG. One hundred and seventy four of the isolates were assayed for sensitivity to the fungicides flutalonil, iprodione, tebuconazole, and trifloxystrobin. Mean EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values varied across fungicides and species, but generally were below 3.3 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The diversity of &lt;I&gt;Rhizoctonia&lt;/I&gt; populations associated with tall fescue, and the range in fungicide sensitivities among species indicates that response to management programs may vary with location and environment. The effects of phosphorous acid on fungal growth, disease incidence and turfgrass quality was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Mean EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of azoxystrobin (+SHAM) for &lt;I&gt;R. solani&lt;/I&gt; 2-2 IIIB, and AG 1, &lt;I&gt;P. aphanidermatum&lt;/I&gt;, and &lt;I&gt;R. zeae&lt;/I&gt; were 1.27, 0.04, 0.012, and 0.145 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Applications of phosphorous acid to creeping bentgrass and tall fescue did not significantly reduce brown patch incidence or increase turfgrass quality in field or greenhouse experiments. The benefit of phosphorous acid as a fungicide or plant nutrient is questionable.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Co-Major Crop Science and Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07122004-140248/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of Bird Island, North Carolina: an uninhabited, undeveloped barrier island</field><field name="creator">Rosenfeld, Kristen Marie</field><field name="description">Barrier islands include some of the most endangered and fragmented ecosystems on the Atlantic coast, providing critical habitat for many species, including some that are threatened and endangered. As the vast majority of these islands have been developed for human usage study and protection of the few remaining undeveloped and undisturbed islands is critical. This study was undertaken in order to characterize the vascular plant communities on Bird Island, an uninhabited, undeveloped barrier island on the border of North and South Carolina, with the objectives of a thorough survey of flora, vegetation, and environment, classification of plant communities, and multivariate analysis of vegetation and environmental data. A floristic inventory of the island and its associated marshes was conducted during the growing season (May-November) of 2002 and 2003. One hundred four 100m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; plots were inventoried for vegetation and environment using protocols developed by the Carolina Vegetation Survey. Plant communities were identified according to the National Vegetation Classification, the Classification of the Natural Communities of North Carolina, and the Carolina Vegetation Survey. Interpretation of vegetation patterns was based on multivariate analysis of vegetation and environmental data. Ninety-one vascular plant species in 35 families, including 4 exotic species, were distributed across 12 communities. Communities on Bird Island appear to be distinctive when compared to those described for other barrier islands in the region. Additionally, the vegetation survey on Bird Island revealed suitable habitat for the federally listed Seabeach amaranth (&lt;I&gt;Amaranthus pumilus&lt;/I&gt;); an important dune-building annual of the North American Atlantic coast. Surveys of the late 1980s and early 1990s documented small populations of Seabeach amaranth on Bird Island, but our work found no indication of a population in either 2002 or 2003. Seabeach amaranth?s existence range-wide is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, herbivory, and anthropogenic disturbances such as beach driving, hardening, and raking. Published work on this species has been limited, but observations of natural, experimental, and restored populations have indicated relationships between distance from the ocean and both survivorship and reproduction. To quantify this relationship, 314 plants were transplanted at varying distances from the ocean. Plants were monitored monthly from June until December 2003. We found that distance from the ocean had a significant effect on survivorship, size, and reproduction; however, presence of webworms and ghost crabs did not have significant effects on size or reproduction. Distance from the ocean combined with complex factors such as over wash and soil salinity appear to be important indicators of success for both natural and restored populations of this species, and landscape position should be incorporated into future conservation and restoration efforts for A. pumilus in the Carolinas and elsewhere. Overall, we found that the vegetation of Bird Island is mostly intact, with few exotic, invasive species present. Bird Island?s protected status and limited presence of invasive species make it suitable habitat for continued protection and further restoration of rare, threatened, or endangered species, such as Seabeach amaranth. Atlantic barrier islands in general provide distinct community types combined with a small species pool, a combination that may provide a model for examination of larger ecological questions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07122004-185722/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Eugenics of H. J. Muller: A Look at Scientific Optimism in the 1950s</field><field name="creator">Crowe, Nathan Paul</field><field name="description">My thesis focuses on post-World War II eugenics, specifically revolving around the well-known geneticist and eugenicist, Hermann J. Muller. By the 1950s, academic support for eugenics had faded. Refinements in genetics, new sociological and anthropological theories, and reaction to eugenic atrocities significantly undermined the feasibility or acceptability of eugenic programs, particularly in the United States. However, during the 1950s and into the mid-1960s, Hermann J. Muller and other prominent geneticists continued to promote eugenic principles. I posit that previous histories of post-World War II eugenics have inadequately explained the significance of H. J. Muller?s eugenics. The rapid progress during the first half of the twentieth century and advances such as the discovery of DNA caused scientific optimism to flourish during the 1950s. Rather than racism or bigotry, scientific optimism motivated H. J. Muller and others to offer eugenics as a viable option for human betterment. Muller and his supporters maintained a strong belief in the power of the gene. Their crucial role in defining the gene, its heredity capacity, and its very conceptual nature, reinforced the belief that the gene was the basis of all life, and at some level, represented the root of all biological and psychological expressions. To Muller and his supporters, the deterministic nature of the gene allowed them to believe that ultimately, if one could manipulate the gene, then one could alter the direction of human evolution, while remaining true to progressive ideals.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07122006-104029/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Persuasive Developments: Reflective Judgment and College Students' Written Argumentation</field><field name="creator">Overbay, Amy Stephens</field><field name="description">This study investigated the relationship between college freshmen?s stage of reflective judgment and the patterns in their written arguments using a mixed-method design with two major and two secondary data collection strategies. The Reflective Judgment Interview (RJI) was conducted with 15 college freshmen enrolled in a composition course that focused on persuasive writing. Participants? essays were examined for patterns in position-taking, evidence-usage, treatment of objections, and rhetorical strategies. Essays were examined ?blind? to participants? reflective judgment scores, and then analyses were compared across reflective judgment groupings. Participants? qualitative interviews and self-recorded reflections on Paper 4 were used to supplement analyses of their essays, and to provide information about contextual factors. Based on assessments made by independent raters, four participants were described as using predominantly pre-reflective judgment, and eleven were described as using predominantly quasi-reflective judgment. Qualitative interviews revealed that participants in both groups had received instruction in persuasive writing in high school, had taken advanced English classes, and were familiar with their own writing processes. However, participants rated as using predominantly quasi-reflective judgment tended to adopt balanced positions, differentiate their views from an authority?s, acknowledge the ill-structured nature of the rhetorical dilemma, and respond to objections more frequently than their pre-reflective counterparts. At the same time, findings for both groups of students suggested that the writing context did not support participants? use of sophisticated assumptions about knowledge and justification, in that most essays written by participants in both groups included one-sided positions, an uncritical use of evidence, and superficial attention to the objections of a doubting audience. Based on these findings, the researcher made recommendations for more developmentally-sensitive instruction.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Curriculum and Instruction, English Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07132003-201718/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of terminal disruption after partial denervation in slow- and fast-twitch muscles of neonatal CFP mice and Wistar rats.</field><field name="creator">Jacquet, Benoit Victor</field><field name="description">After partial denervation of mature muscle, the remaining motoneurons grow terminal sprouts, which reinnervate denervated muscle fibers. In neonatal rat soleus muscle however, not only do the remaining motoneurons fail to reinnervate nearby muscle fibers, but they also display clear morphological and physiological evidence of terminal disruption. My ultimate aim is to attain a better understanding of this disruption by performing repeated in vivo observations of individually identified terminals in transgenic mice expressing fluorescent proteins in their motoneurons. For technical reasons, these in vivo imaging studies would ideally be conducted on CFP mouse sternomastoid (SM) muscle. I therefore tested whether neonatal partial denervation of CFP mouse SM muscle also causes terminal disruption. Two to five days after neonatal partial denervation, I fluorescently labeled nerve terminals and acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) to assess the effect on terminal morphology. Terminal disruption after partial denervation did not occur as extensively in CFP mouse SM muscle (a fast-twitch muscle) as it did in rat soleus muscle (a slow-twitch muscle). This relative absence of terminal disruption in CFP mouse SM suggested that the extent/occurrence of terminal disruption after neonatal partial denervation could depend on either the species being studied or muscle fiber type. To distinguish between these possibilities, I investigated terminal disruption after partial denervation of rat SM muscle. In both soleus and sternomastoid muscles of rats, neonatal partial denervation resulted in disruption of about half of the terminals, whereas in SM muscles from CFP mice only 8% of terminals showed evidence of disruption. Therefore, it appears that the nature of terminal disruption that takes place after partial denervation of neonatal muscles is not related to muscle fiber type but may be species-specific.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07132005-180536/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organizational Politics and Relational Inequality: The Generation of Wage Inequality in the Production Process</field><field name="creator">Avent, Dustin Robert</field><field name="description">Previous research on stratification, primarily shaped by the status attainment tradition, has analyzed inequality as a function of individuals? statuses within a whole economy as opposed to relations among social groups embedded within organizations. Surprisingly, little research has been conducted on how relations among actors within organizations generate inequality. First, I critique this previous research for not analyzing relations within organizations. I then develop a model for understanding how social relations within organizations might generate income inequality. In this model, these relations are characterized by groups of actors struggling to appropriate portions of the surplus generated in organizations. These groups are organized around both material power and status-based power within the production process, both of which generate group-based conflict and struggle for the extraction of economic rents. Such rents form the basis for income inequality. Finally, I empirically assess this model using a sample of Australian organizations, and confirm that economic rents are generated out of both material power and status-based power. I conclude that relations within organizations engender a struggle over the surplus, which creates stratification. Thus, research should begin to focus on the organization as the unit of analysis, specifically on relations therein. Moreover, analyses of wage inequality should move toward understanding how actors struggle to appropriate portions of the surplus in organizations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07142005-111201/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">View Selection for Query-Evaluation Efficiency using Materialized Views</field><field name="creator">Gupta, Shalu</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to show the use of derived data such as materialized views for run time optimization of aggregate queries.

Our study investigated the effects of creating artificial canopy gaps by girdling exotic timber trees in plantations on the germination, growth, and survival of native tree species that may be important food plants for the Puerto Rican parrot. We found that seedling growth increased significantly in gaps; there were no differences in survival or germination between gap and closed plots. Percentage cover of grasses, shrubs, and vines increased but did not prevent tree seedlings from growing significantly more in gaps. Leaf litter removal had no effect on germination, growth, or survival. Both local and landscape level diversity is predicted to increase in gaps if large saplings present in the understory replace the girdled timber trees, but plantations will still be dominated by exotics and timber species. Our results suggest that restoration of native forest diversity in plantations will require continued management to remove exotic species and promote growth of tree species with high wildlife habitat value.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07142005-155017/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling the Growth and Death Kinetics of Salmonella in Poultry Litter as a Function of pH and Water Activity.</field><field name="creator">Payne, Joshua Bill</field><field name="description">In order to assess Salmonella dynamics in a poultry production setting, two studies were conducted to evaluate how common environmental factors during production influence Salmonella populations in poultry litter.

Litter pH, temperature, ammonia levels, moisture content, and water activity (A&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;) were also measured. The purpose of this field study was to assess the populations and prevalence of Salmonella present during grow-out along with how varying environmental growth parameters and management practices impact its growth, persistence and true risk for consumers. Field data were subsequently used to design a laboratory study that observed the combined effects of pH and A&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; at a constant temperature on the growth and decline of Salmonella spp. in inoculated litter for the purpose of predicting microbial behavior using statistical modeling.

Multivariate analyses tools were used for this purpose with data collected from 43 EISs. Two main relationships were found, between geographical region and environmental impacts, and between environmental impacts and economic characteristics of projects. While a relationship between geographical region and environmental impacts was expected, the relationship between environmental impacts and economic characteristics of a project was not. This relationship suggests that more environmental impacts occurred or are identified in high-income counties. However, information pertaining to farmland potentially impacted is reported inconsistently in NCDOT documents and cannot be used reliably for comparison purposes. For this reason, environmental impacts in lower-income counties may be seriously underestimated. According to the variables selected for this study, and assuming they effectively represent biodiversity treatment in EISs, logistic discrimination analyses provided some evidence that the CEQ regulation of 1993 concerning treatment of biodiversity had an effect on EISs. This effect might suggest either an improvement in data quality and/or an increase in the attention given to impacts to wetlands and to endangered species included in EISs because of demands from the regulation. Economic factors and impacts to property in EIS, and of geographic location, environmental impacts, and environmental assessment factors showed significant time trends. However, these relationships have not been affected by environmental regulation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07152002-170729/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Extension of the Intergroup Contact Theory: The Effects of Black-White Contact and Interracial Friendships on Whites' Racial Attitudes</field><field name="creator">Macomber, Kristine Claire</field><field name="description">Using data from the 1998 General Social Survey, this thesis examines the effects of black-white contact and close interracial friendships on whites? attitudes towards blacks. Intergroup contact theory maintains that contact between people of different groups reduces prejudices and improves attitudes. The majority of previous contact studies have focused on casual black-white contact in neighborhoods and workplaces. Emerging in the current literature is a focus on more personal contact between blacks and whites, as in close friendships. I hypothesize that a positive relationship exists between whites? having a close black friend and their attitudes towards blacks. I also hypothesize a positive relationship between contact and attitudes. I use OLS regression models to test both hypotheses. The results of the analysis support the second hypothesis. The key finding is a statistically significant positive effect of neighborhood contact on whites? attitudes towards blacks. In support of intergroup contact theory, this significant finding suggests that a necessary condition for contact effects on attitudes is equal status between blacks and whites.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07152004-152658/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Photobleaching on Membrane Fusion and Infectivity of Dye Labeled Sindbis Virus</field><field name="creator">Thongthai, Wor</field><field name="description">Membrane fusion has long been accepted as a common cell entry mechanism for enveloped viruses. We have observed membrane fusion between Sindbis virus (SIN) and liposomes formed from purified lipids using a fluorescence dequenching assay. We verified that labeling Sindbis virus with R18, DiI, and DiD fluorescent dyes did not decrease its infectivity as determined by plaque assays. We found that infectivity was eliminated after extensive photobleaching of R18-labeled Sindbis virus, and in contrast, DiI and DiD labeled Sindbis both maintain infectivity following bleaching. Even though photobleached R18-labeled Sindbis was not infectious, we verified that it is still fully competent for low pH triggered membrane fusion using a liposome assay where fusion was indicated by the dequenching of a second membrane dye incorporated into the liposome. We attribute the inactivation of Sindbis virus to the propensity of R18 to translocate to the inner leaflet of the viral membrane, thus exposing the viral genome to the byproducts of photobleaching.

Therefore, there is considerable interest in determining ways to mitigate the threat posed by these objects. This dissertation presents a method utilizing a tethered ballast mass for altering the trajectory of a NEO with an Earth-intersecting orbit so that it avoids hitting the Earth. The method is simulated using four different methods. The first method assumes a rigid massless tether. Using this method, a parametric study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the technique over a wide parametric space. Specifically, this study provided results in terms of deviation rates over the parametric space. After this, the massless inelastic method was used to study actual miss distances assuming the asteroid was on a collision course with the Earth. After this, a study was conducted, using the massless, inelastic model, in which the mass of the ballast was made constant, in order to determine the minimum tether length required to divert asteroids simulated based on actual asteroids from NASA's potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA) database, again assuming a massless inelastic tether. Finally, it was desired to determine how relaxing the constraints of the massless inelastic model would affect system performance. Therefore, three more models were introduced: massive inelastic, massless elastic, and massive elastic. Using these models, a study was performed to explore the effects of the changed model on system performance and to compare the results in terms of deviation, with those of the massless inelastic model. This was desired because the numerical cost of the new models was much higher than that of the massless inelastic model, so rather than conduct the study over a much larger parametric space, a smaller space was chosen, so that the results could be compared.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07152009-152128/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF A DYE SENSITIZING MOLECULE FOR PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL DNA HYBRIDIZATION DETECTION</field><field name="creator">Lowe, Lisa Bizzell</field><field name="description">A procedure for detection of DNA hybridization is described for the purpose of application in DNA microarray technology.

Its natural distribution is limited to seven islands in eastern Indonesia. Larger populations are found on the islands of Timor and Wetar, whereas smaller populations occur on the islands of Alor, Pantar, Lomblen, Adonara and Flores. Of concern is the depletion in the species&#226; genetic resource as a consequence of land conversion to agriculture. Proficient management of the genetic resource, with respect to both conservation and breeding programs, requires an understanding of the level of genetic diversity and population structure across the species&#226; native range. This may be achieved through the application of DNA marker techniques. Chloroplast DNA sequence variation in E. urophylla was studied to gain insight into its historical seed migration routes among the islands. Twenty haplotypes were identified. A high level of chloroplast genetic differentiation (GST = 0.581) was observed. Chloroplast haplotype diversity exhibited a decreasing trend from east to west in the species&#226; range, consistent with an east-to-west colonization route. Twelve nuclear microsatellite markers were used to infer the geographical distribution of nuclear genetic diversity. High levels of microsatellite diversity were observed throughout 19 geographically defined populations (HE = 0.703 to 0.776). Genetic differentiation among populations was low (FST = 0.031). A Bayesian clustering approach revealed a cryptic population structure comprising two genetically homogeneous groups, broadly structured according to geography. In order to gain insight into the diversity and population structure of genes associated with economically important traits, we investigated the geographical distribution of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) haplotypes in two wood formation genes (sucrose synthase1, and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase2). High levels of SNP haplotype diversity were observed throughout the natural populations (Hd = 0.58 to 0.76). Low levels of population genetic structure were observed for the SNP haplotypes of each gene (FST &lt; 0.08). The results of this study provide improved direction for conservation and breeding strategies in E. urophylla.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07162008-153216/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hybrid Reynolds-Averaged / Large-Eddy Simulations of Ramped-Cavity and Compression Ramp Flow-fields</field><field name="creator">Fan, Thomas Chen-Chuan</field><field name="description">A procedure for simulating wall-bounded,separated flows utilizing hybrid large-eddy / Reynolds- Averaged strategies is presented in this work. Following the zonal concept, the proposed hybrid method uses a distance-dependent blending function to shift the turbulence closure from Menter's two-equation model near wall surfaces to a one-equation subgrid model away from walls. The code is parallelized using domain-decomposition / MPI message-passing methods and is optimized for operation on the 720 processor IBM SP-2 at the North Carolina Supercomputing Center. The capabilities of the hybrid method are examined on two benchmark flows: a ramped-cavity flow that is representative of the internal flow field of a high speed propulsion device, and a compression ramp flow that features the classical problem of a shock wave / boundary layer interaction. Results indicate that the hybrid method provides generally good predictions for the ramped-cavity configuration, but less satisfactory predictions for the compression ramp configuration. Nevertheless, the strength of the hybrid method in capturing the recovery of the boundary layer downstream of reattachment is found in both cases, and it is a major improvement over the simulations produced by RANS alone. The weaknesses in simulating the compression ramp flow are also discussed and possible remedies are provided for further investigation in the future.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07172002-154448/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alternative Substrates for Estimating TCE-degrading Capabilities of Toluene-oxidizing Bacteria</field><field name="creator">Hicks, Kristin Adair</field><field name="description">One of the primary impediments to the implementation of bioremediation is uncertainty about success in the field. Soils and microbial populations are heterogeneous and it is difficult to extrapolate biodegradation rates from small samples to field scale. While biodegradation rates can be estimated from microcosm studies, in situ methods offer a more meaningful gauge of resident microbial activity. One method used to estimate biodegradation rates in the field is the newly developed Push-Pull technique. While this technique can be conducted on site, it is normally not possible to use target pollutants as the reactive substrates. Consequently, alternative, benign reactive tracers must be used. Ideally, these alternative, reactive tracers interrogate the same enzyme systems that are responsible for the biodegradation of the target pollutant. The objective of this study was to develop a reactive tracer system that could be used to assess toluene-dependent trichloroethylene (TCE) degradation. Our approach has been to determine whether a series of pure strains of toluene-oxidizing bacteria (Burkholderia cepacia G4, Pseudomonas putida F1, Pseudomonas putida mt2, Pseudomonas mendocina KR1), each with different toluene-oxidizing enzymes systems, are capable of cometabolically oxidizing a series of eleven potential alternative substrates. These substrates include simple alkenes, alkanes, and cyclic alkanes. The kinetics (Ks and Vmax) of the biotransformation of these compounds have been determined. While oxidation products were observed for a number of these substrates in connection with one or more of the test organisms, isobutylene was co-oxidized by all test organisms. Oxidation of isobutylene by each organism yielded kinetics constants comparable to the corresponding kinetics of TCE degradation. The enzyme system expressed by Burkholderia cepacia G4 catalyzed the epoxidation of isobutylene while the remaining enzyme systems catalyzed allylic alcohol formation. Isobutylene has potential in field scale Push-Pull studies as a tool for evaluating rates of aerobic toluene-dependent TCE degradation and of differentiating the relative contributions of the TCE-degrading population. A pilot study of this alternative substrate at Edwards Air Force Base will test whether it can be used successfully to estimate in situ degradation of TCE. Analysis of isobutylene oxidation products in toluene-enriched ground water may offer an inexpensive and effective method of measuring the degradation of TCE at contaminated sites nationwide.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07172002-182546/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Elevated Pressure on Soot Formation in a Laminar Jet Diffusion Flame</field><field name="creator">McCrain, Laura L.</field><field name="description">Soot volume fraction (f&lt;sub&gt;sv&lt;/sub&gt;) is measured quantitatively in a laminar diffusion flame at elevated pressures up to 25 atmospheres as a function of fuel type in order to gain a better understanding of the effects of pressure on the soot formation process. Methane and ethylene are used as fuels; methane is chosen since it is the simplest hydrocarbon while ethylene represents a larger hydrocarbon with a higher propensity to soot. Soot continues to be of interest because it is a sensitive indicator of the interactions between combustion chemistry and fluid mechanics and a known pollutant. To examine the effects of increased pressure on soot formation, Laser Induced Incandescence (LII) is used to obtain the desired temporally and spatially resolved, instantaneous f&lt;sub&gt;sv&lt;/sub&gt; measurements as the pressure is incrementally increased up to 25 atmospheres. The effects of pressure on the physical characteristics of the flame are also observed. A laser light extinction method that accounts for signal trapping and laser attenuation is used for calibration that results in quantitative results.

Both seedling and rhizome plants were evaluated. Resistant/susceptible ratios (R/S) were 11.0, 5.7, and 5.5 for clethodim, fluazifop-P, and sethoxydim, respectively, for seedling plants. R/S ratios were 15.6, 22.7, and 22.3 for clethodim, fluazifop-P, and sethoxydim, respectively, for rhizome plants. There was no difference between the resistant and susceptible biotypes in the absorption, translocation, or metabolism of 14C-clethodim in the resistant and susceptible biotypes. Specific activity of acetyl Co-A carboxylase (ACCase) from the susceptible and resistant johnsongrass biotypes (means of 0.221 and 0.223 nmol/mg protein/min, respectively) were similar. ACCase from the susceptible biotype was sensitive to clethodim, with an I50 value of 0.29 mM clethodim. ACCase from the resistant biotype was less sensitive, with an I50 value of 1.32 mM clethodim. The resultant R/S ratio for clethodim was 4.5. These results indicate that resistance to clethodim in this johnsongrass biotype resulted from an altered ACCase enzyme. The relative competitiveness and non-competitive productivity of R and S johnsongrass were assessed in greenhouse and growth chamber experiments. When grown in noncompetitive conditions in growth chamber experiments, photosynthetic rate, net assimilation rate, leaf number, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf dry biomass, and shoot dry biomass were similar for R and S biotypes 21, 27, and 35 days after planting. The biotypes were similar in terms of plant height and leaf number. Relative crowding coefficients for above ground dry biomass similar, and a combined t-test indicated that the resistant and susceptible biotype did not differ for above ground dry biomass (tlof=0.54, 1.3; P=0.38, 0.23, respectively). There does not appear to be a fitness penalty associated with the resistance. A seedling bioassay was developed for the determination of resistance to clethodim and fluazifop-P in johnsongrass. The assay was based on differences in the coleoptile length of R and S seedlings exposed to clethodim and fluazifop-P in petri dishes for 5 d. A bioassay concentration of 0.09 mg/L clethodim and 0.18 mg/L fluazifiop-P where chosen as discriminant based on rate responses of each biotype to increasing herbicide dose. At 5 DAT, the R:S ratio for clethodim was 18.7, and the R:S ratio for fluazifop was 35.4. A study was conducted to determine the nuclear state and develop a suitable medium and culture method for in vitro germination of johnsongrass pollen. Johnsongrass pollen was trinucleate, and in vitro tests for pollen viability using Alexander?s stain and a fluorochromatic reaction method indicated johnsongrass pollen was viable (92.6-98.4%). A factorial treatment of four concentrations of sucrose, two concentrations of boric acid, and two concentrations of calcium nitrate was used to determine the optimum pollen germination media. The factorial study was conducted using three different cultural methods: suspension culture, agar culture, and cellophane membrane culture. Germination was highest in a suspension culture with media containing 0.3 M sucrose, 2.43 mM boric acid, and 3 mM calcium nitrate. In a second study, pollen germination using the above media was 78.9% when harvested from flowers just before anthesis. Three studies were conducted to develop pollen tests for the screening of ACCase target-site resistance in a biotype of johnsongrass using the developed germination media. Pollen from the susceptible biotype of johnsongrass was strongly inhibited by increasing concentrations of clethodim, with a GR50 of 25.8 (standard error of &#177;0.6) mM and GR50 of 16.4 (standard error of &#177;1.7) mM clethodim by visual assessment and spectrophotometric assessment, respectively. Minimum R/S values were &gt;3.9 by visual assessment and &gt;6.1 by spectrophotometric assessment. Both assessment methods differentiated the susceptible and resistant biotypes, and ACCase target-site resistance is expressed in johnsongrass pollen.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07172005-093207/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soil reduction rates under water saturated conditions in relation to soil properties.</field><field name="creator">Zelasko, Amanda Jean</field><field name="description">The success of wetland restoration projects depends in part on the length of time that a soil is in a reduced redox state. The length of time that a soil is reduced depends on how quickly reduction occurs following saturation with water. The relationship between reduction rate and various soil chemical and mineralogical properties is poorly understood, but such properties might be manipulated to improve the success of wetland restoration projects. The goals of this research were to determine soil properties that predict the rate at which soils undergo reduction when saturated, and to determine the roles of electron donors and acceptors on reduction rates. Sixteen soil samples were collected at various depths from two wetland sites, a Carolina bay (Juniper Bay) and a wetland catena (Frog Level). Soils were incubated in specially designed redox incubators to monitor reduction rates, changes in soil properties, and soil solution chemistry. Soil samples were subjected to three cycles of oxidation and reduction during the course of 36 d. Soil reduction rates were determined from the slopes of linear regression models fit to data for redox potential (Eh) over time. Reduction rates varied among soils from 1.2 to 46.2 mV h-1, and were significantly greater (p-value &lt; 0.05) for soils with total organic carbon (TOC) &gt; 10 g kg-1 than in soils with TOC &lt; 10 g kg-1. Increasing amounts of dissolved Fe(II) were found at Eh values below 500 mV for pH between 4.5 and 5.1. Mineral soils with total reduction rates &gt; 10 mV h-1 released significantly more Fe(II) into solution than mineral soils with reduction rates &lt; 10 mV h-1 (p-value &lt; 0.05). Regression results indicated that organic carbon, an electron donor, was the dominant factor controlling reduction rates up to 10 mV h-1, and an electron acceptor Fe(III) was the dominant factor controlling reduction rates &gt; 10 mV h-1. For wetland restoration purposes multiple linear regression models based on our results that include TOC concentration and pH can be used along with hydrologic data to predict reduction rates in saturated soils.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07172007-154810/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Squestering Agents on Aflatoxin in Milk of Dairy Cows Fed Aflatoxin-contaminated Diets</field><field name="creator">Waltman, Lindsey</field><field name="description">Three experiments (EXP) were conducted to determine the potential of experimental sequestering agents, clays or non-digestible yeast oligosaccharides, to reduce milk aflatoxin concentration in lactating Holstein cows consuming aflatoxin. All EXP included two periods in a randomized block design. Cows were fed an aflatoxin-contaminated total mixed ration (TMR) for both periods of all trials. During the first period, cows received no sequestering agents in the TMR, but agents were included in the TMR for the second period. EXP 1 and 2 consisted of two 7 d periods with 12 cows per treatment. Milk aflatoxin (AFM1) concentrations were analyzed by HPLC for milk samples collected on d 5 to 7 and d 11 to 13. Two treatments in EXP 1 were: 1) control (no sequestering agent n=12), and 2) 100g/cow/day Lallemand n=12. Four treatments in EXP 2 were: control (no sequestering agent) n=12, 2) 10g/cow/day MTB-100&#194;&#174; (2004) n=12 (Alltech, Inc., Nicholasville, KY), 3) 10g/cow/day MTB-100&#194;&#174; 2006 n=12 (Alltech, Inc., Nicholasville, KY) n=12, and 4) 10g/day/cow Alltech experimental (Alltech, Inc., Nicholasville, KY) n=12. EXP 3 consisted of two 8 d periods and included 14 cows. Milk samples from d 4 to 8 and d 11 to 16 were analyzed for AFM1 concentrations by ELISA. Three treatments in EXP 3 were: 1) control (no sequestering agent) n=4, 2) MTB-100&#194;&#174; 2006 (Alltech, Inc., Nicholasville, KY) n=5 and 3) Astra-Ben 20A&#194;&#174; (AB-20A&#194;&#174;) (Prince Agri Products, Inc., Quincy, IL) n=5.For all EXPs, the percent differences in AFM1 concentrations between periods 1 and 2 were calculated. All percent differences were normalized using a correction factor that converted values for controls to zero. The changes from zero (%) due to sequestering agents were considered significant at P &lt; 0.05. In EXP 1, the addition of a mixture of NYO-A and diatomite-montmorillonite resulted in a 5.2% numerical increase in AFM1 concentration. In EXP 2, MTB-100&#194;&#174; (2004), MTB-100&#194;&#174; (2006), and Alltech experimental product resulted in 8.0%, 6.2%, and 9.5% numerical increases in AFM1 concentrations respectively.

In summary, the AB-20A&#194;&#174; in EXP 3 reduced AFM1 concentrations (P=0.01).

This dissertation explores some aspects of the statistical and computational issues used in the genetic marker data analysis. Chapter 1 gives an introduction to genetic marker data, as well as a brief description to each chapter. Chapter 2 presents the different genetic analyses performed on a large data set and discusses the use of microsatellites to describe the maize germplasm and to improve maize germplasm maintenance. Considerable attention is focused on how the maize germplasm is organized and genetic variation is distributed. A novel maximum likelihood method is developed to estimate the historical contributions for maize inbred lines. Chapter 3 covers a new method for optimal selection of a core set of lines from a large germplasm collection. The simulated annealing algorithm for choosing an optimal k-subset is described and evaluated using the maize germplasm as an example; general constraints are incorporated in the algorithm, and the efficiency of the algorithms is compared to existing methods. Chapter 4 covers a two-stage strategy to partition a chromosomal region into blocks with extensive within-block linkage disequilibrium, and to select the optimal subset of SNPs that essentially captures the haplotype variation within a block. Population simulations suggest that the recursive bisection algorithm for block partitioning is generally reliable for recombination hotspots identification. Maximal entropy theory is applied to choose optimal subset of SNPs. The procedures are evaluated analytically as well as by simulation. The final chapter covers a new software package for genetic marker data analysis. The methods implemented in the package are listed. A brief tutorial is included to illustrate the features of the package. Chapter 5 also describes a new method for estimating population specific F-statistics and an extended algorithm for estimating haplotype frequencies.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07182003-122001/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of cDNAs from Nicotiana benthamiana that encode proteins which interact with tomato golden mosaic virus AL2 protein in the yeast two-hybrid system</field><field name="creator">Yu, Ming</field><field name="description">The AL2 protein of tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) is multifunctional. It is required for derepression of the TGMV AR1 gene in phloem tissue, and for trans-activating the AR1 and BR1 genes in mesophyll cells. It also enhances virus susceptibility when expressed in transgenic plants. It is thought that TGMV AL2 protein accomplishes these functions by interactions with unknown host factors. In this study, cDNAs from Nicotiana benthamiana plants that encode proteins which interact with TGMV AL2 were characterized. A yeast two-hybrid assay identified two cDNA clones, Nb#51 and Nb#62, that specifically interacted with TGMV AL2, but not with negative control proteins. Sequences of these two cDNA clones were determined by primer walking, which revealed that Nb#51 appears to be a 3?-coterminal truncated version of Nb#62. Inspection of the amino acid sequences encoded by Nb#62 found the presence of both ankyrin-repeats and tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR). Deletion analysis showed that the TPR motif, together with its flanking regions, was sufficient to confer on Nb#62 the ability to interact with TGMV AL2, whereas the ankyrin-repeats were not required for this interaction. Nb#62-specific mRNAs were detected in N. benthamiana plants by northern hybridization in potato virus X (PVX) infection experiments, but not in heat-shock experiments. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) assays were used to investigate the possible function(s) of the Nb#62-encoded protein in normal plants and in the context of a TGMV infection. When PVX carrying a 618-bp fragment from the 5?-end of the Nb#62 cDNA was used as a silencing trigger in N. benthamiana plants, VIGS effectively targeted the transcripts which contained sequence similarity with the trigger fragment. However, the infected plants didn?t have difference in the phenotype when compared to the PVX vector infection. When TGMV carrying a 93-bp fragment from the 5?-end of the Nb#62 cDNA infected plants, viral DNA accumulation in the upper leaves was reduced, when compared to wild-type TGMV or a control TGMV construct containing a 95-bp fragment from the tobacco Sulfur gene.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07182003-150714/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the Protection of Link State Routing and Discovery of PKI Certificate Chains in MANET</field><field name="creator">Huang, He</field><field name="description">The growing awareness of the network vulnerability draws much attention to security from both the academic community and industrial society. Security is no longer a luxury but an independent and indispensable service to the current Internet. While various security mechanisms such as cryptographic and intrusion detection techniques have been proposed, designed, and even deployed in the field, the newly exposed network vulnerabilities and the emerging network technologies create new security challenges which make the existing security solutions either inefficient or insufficient. My Ph D research focuses on the efficient protection on link state routing and the self-organizing and self-dependent hierarchical public key certificate management in the emerging mobile ad hoc networks. The contributions of this thesis include two parts. In the first part, a cost reduced secure link state routing protocol with the capability of detecting disruptive links is proposed to efficiently protect the routing control messages (e.g., LSA) and trace the faulty intermediate routers; then a confidence extended routing mechanism enhanced with secure virtual links is designed to increase network reachability through selectively including the uncertain routers in packet relaying and further continuously monitoring the behaviors of those selected uncertain routers. A theoretical security analysis and an experimental evaluation are conducted to prove the feasibility and advantages of this new design under various rates of false alarms. In the second part, an approach is presented to discover the optimal PKI certificate path even without help from centralized certificate entities in the non-centralized and infrastructureless mobile ad hoc network and a secured and distributed certificate-chain searching protocol is developed to collect the needed certificates on the fly in the mobile ad hoc network.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07182005-123535/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of quality deer management on population demographics, social pressures, dispersal ecology, and the genetic mating system of white-tailed deer at Chesapeake Farms, Maryland.</field><field name="creator">Shaw, Jonathan Christopher</field><field name="description">Quality deer management (QDM) is widely accepted as a principled management practice, yet QDM implications for population processes are unclear. Our research primarily focused on components of (1) dispersal ecology and (2) the genetic mating system of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) under QDM at Chesapeake Farms, Maryland. The objectives of our dispersal ecology research were: (1) to compare pre- and post-QDM dispersal parameter estimates, and (2) evaluate inbreeding avoidance and sexual-competition hypotheses as mechanisms of dispersal. Emigration of yearling males pre-QDM was 0.70 + 0.07, and post-QDM was 0.54 + 0.10. Genetic maternity analysis indicated that dispersal of orphans and non-orphans was similar. Dispersers exhibited breeding competition with other yearling males more often than nondispersers, and yearling male antler points appeared to be related to dispersal status in both pre- and post-QDM populations. Overall breeding behaviors of yearling males decreased from pre- to post-QDM. Our results fail to support inbreeding avoidance and support sexual-competition as a cause of fall dispersal at Chesapeake Farms. Through QDM, an older male age structure may have suppressed breeding competition in yearling males and decreased dispersal rates. The objectives of our genetic mating system research were to evaluate: (1) age-specific male breeding success; (2) relationships of weight and antler size with male breeding success; (3) instances of multiple paternity in single litters; and (4) male and female mate selection. We observed higher breeding success of males &gt;3.5-years old in comparison to males &lt;2.5-years old; however, several males across age-classes bred; antler and body size were not important factors in breeding success; instances of multiple paternity of single litters occurred; and mate selection did not occur. Our results fail to support the prevailing observation-based mating system paradigm where few dominant males monopolize breeding opportunities. In populations with high estrous synchrony, dominant males fail to effectively monopolize tending bonds, and subordinate males may successfully breed surplus females via surreptitious fertilization.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07182005-164300/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Never Otherwise Than Analytic": Poe's Science of the Divine</field><field name="creator">Elder, Matthew Stephen</field><field name="description">When the writers of the American Romantic period were eschewing the Enlightenment values of reason and objectivity in favor of subjective, individual human experience, Edgar Allan Poe clung to rationality and claimed that it is a vital tool in the creation of art and in the quest for spiritual enlightenment. Critics, however, have long disputed whether Poe sincerely valued science and rationality or if he treated those concepts with irony and destabilized any knowledge that his characters acquire through rational, empirical truth seeking. This thesis seeks to explain how Enlightenment values figure in Poe?s vision of art and the cosmos and to dispute the postmodern interpretations that claim that Poe?s valorization of rationality and its products (namely science and technology) is ironic. To that end, I investigate, specifically, the connection of Poe?s positivistic (rather than phenomenological) philosophy to his theological vision. The successful application of rational principles by Poe?s narrators is consistently rendered in language and imagery suggestive of the divine, and it results in the spiritual enlightenment of the characters. Chapter one of this thesis examines Poe?s science fiction against the philosophical backdrop established by Eureka and ?Sonnet ? To Science? and argues that as the narrators apply rationality successfully, they come to resemble the God with whom they seek to commune. Chapter two reads Poe?s detective tales as allegories assigning cosmic significance to the concepts of reason, embodied by the God-like C. Auguste Dupin, and unreason, embodied by Dupin?s adversaries.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07182005-164910/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE TRANSYLVANIAN SCHOOL: ENLIGHTENED INSTRUMENT OF ROMANIAN NATIONALISM.</field><field name="creator">Sfirlea, Titus Gabriel</field><field name="description">The end of the eighteen and the beginning of the nineteen centuries represented a period of national renaissance for the Romanian population within the Great Principality of Transylvania. The nation, within a span of under fifty years, documented its Latin origins, rewrote its history, language, and grammar, and attempted to educate and gain political rights for its members within the Habsburg Empire?s family of nations. Four Romanian intellectuals led this enormous endeavor and left their philosophical imprint on the politics and social structure of the newly forged nation: Samuil Micu, Gheorghe &#170;incai, Petru Maior, and Ion-Budai Deleanu. Together they formed a school of thought called the Transylvanian School. Micu, Maior, and &#170;incai (at least early in his career), under the inspiration of the ideas of enlightened absolutism reflected in the reign of Joseph II, advocated and worked tirelessly to introduce reforms from above as a means for national education and emancipation. Deleanu, fully influenced by a combination of ideas emanating from French Enlightenment and French revolutionary sources, argued that the Romanian population of Transylvania could achieve social and political rights only if they were willing to fight for them.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07182005-174056/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nonlinear Finite Element Analysis of Pavements and Its Application to Performance Evaluation</field><field name="creator">Mun, Sungho</field><field name="description">This research documents the findings from the study of failure mechanisms of fatigue cracking in asphalt pavements using the finite element program that employs the viscoelastic continuum damage model for asphalt layer and a nonlinear elastic model for unbound layers.

Then, by using a bivariate vector error correction model (VECM), this thesis shows that the null hypothesis of linearity can be rejected against the alternative of nonlinearity for both lumber spot and futures prices in U.S. and oriented strand board (OSB) prices across regions in North America. The nonlinearity is identified by a transition variable that governs switching between two regimes: one within the transactions cost band and one outside of the band. In the empirical analysis, a bivariate smooth transition vector error correction model (STVECM) is used to test market efficiency for lumber spot and futures prices and for the law of one price (LOP) as pertains to OSB prices across six regions in North America. Results support the market eficiency hypothesis and the LOP in the forest commdity markets. Furthermore, the empirical analysis suggests that when price differences surpass transactions costs by a large margin or are far away from the transactions band, a faster adjustment to the long run equilibrium is observed in part due to adjustment costs. When price differences are within the transactions band, they follow a random walk as no trade takes place. The in-sample analysis indicates that the STVECM model performs better than the linear VECM. Results from generalized impulse response functions (GIs) analysis show that system shocks may, in fact, change the time paths of prices permanently.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07212005-080614/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular-based Models for Viscoelasticity of Polymers</field><field name="creator">Hood, Jeffrey Braidon</field><field name="description">Various models are developed to describe several different aspects of the dynamics of polymers. First, a model is developed which describes the dynamics of a single polymer chain, residing in a viscous fluid, in response to various stimuli. Next, constitutive models leading to reptation are developed, which determine the stress-strain relations for a system of physically constrained (PC) molecules residing within a chemically cross-linked (CC) system of molecules acting as a constraining tube for the PC system. These reptation models treat relaxation within the context of both intra-molecular and inter-molecular variability. Finally, a model is developed which combines the Rouse model of relaxing polymers and the stick-slip reptation model. This stick-slip/Rouse hybrid model incorporates parameters which were ignored in models developed in the earlier parts of the dissertation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computational Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07212005-210915/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Economic Effects of Federal Peanut Policy: The 1996 FAIR Act, the 2001 Farm Security Act, and the Federal Crop Insurance Program</field><field name="creator">Chvosta, Jan</field><field name="description">Government programs that restrict production and increase prices to particular groups of producers have a long history in the United States. The purpose of this research is to analyze the implications of such a program for peanuts in three independent essays. The first essay focuses on the development of a model of the effects of cross-county transfers on peanut quota after the 1996 farm bill. Using a spatial linear regression model, the hypothesis that the lifting of transfer restrictions tends to equilibrate lease rates across counties is tested. The results indicate that, after the 1996 bill, peanut quota moved out of counties that under produce their quota to overproducing counties, indirectly indicating a tendency for lease rates to equalize. The second essay studies the most recent changes to the peanut program, enacted by the U.S. Congress in 2002, and reviews important events that led to these changes. Several models are developed that analyze the costs and benefits of the revised program in domestic and foreign markets. It is concluded that farmers in most peanut producing states will incur losses due to the peanut program changes, with the exception of Texas and Florida. The impact of the transformation on the world price of edible peanuts is analyzed and shown to be theoretically ambiguous-- the world price could either increase or decrease depending on demand and supply elasticities. The essay explores numerically the influence of the relevant elasticities. The third essay reviews the U.S. federal crop insurance program and investigates its interaction with the peanut program. A model of a risk neutral profit maximizing farmer is developed and comparative static results are derived. The results show that in equilibrium peanut quota lease rates do not represent the full difference between the support price and world price and are affected by the cost of crop insurance.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural and Resource Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07222002-001808/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Is the Pacifique Sea my home?":John Donne's Hymns</field><field name="creator">Zumbach, Eric Hudson</field><field name="description">Scholars have traditionally regarded John Donne?s three Hymns as independent works of devotional or meditative verse. This study proposes that Donne?s Hymns are read properly as a tripartite sequence, one which addresses the poet?s desire for a spiritual union with Christ. Before that union may occur, Donne must ?tune the Instrument? of his soul by submitting his fallen will to the will of Christ. The Hymns are that ?tuning,? that labor of submission. As they unfold, the Hymns present the drama of Donne?s piety wrestling with his aggressive will, and his transformation from a self-serving rake dedicated to his ?Iland? of ?false mistresses? into a Christ-serving religious. Until the last line of the Hymns, Donne seems to have won spiritual security: he has prayed for release from his ?Iland,? he has ?embrace[d]? the body and blood of Christ, and he has confessed his ?sinne of feare,? despair. However, the final line of the Hymns, ?I have no more,? seems to unravel Donne?s spiritual work. His final perplexing, ambiguous line could indicate (among many other meanings) that he has fully transformed, or that he has abandoned the enterprise altogether. ?I have no more,? an enunciation of Donne?s fallen will, proves if anything that the work of the soul is never complete.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07222003-145320/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immersed-Interface Finite-Element Methods for Elliptic and Elasticity Interface Problems</field><field name="creator">Gong, Yan</field><field name="description">The purpose of the research has been to develop a class of new finite-element methods, called immersed-interface finite-element methods, to solve elliptic and elasticity interface problems with homogeneous and non-homogeneous jump conditions. Simple non-body-fitted meshes are used. Single functions that satisfy the same non-homogeneous jump conditions are constructed using a level-set representation of the interface. With such functions, the discontinuities across the interface in the solution and flux are removed; and equivalent elliptic and elasticity interface problems with homogeneous jump conditions are formulated. Special finite-element basis functions are constructed for nodal points near the interface to satisfy the homogeneous jump conditions. Error analysis and numerical tests are presented to demonstrate that such methods have an optimal convergence rate. These methods are designed as an efficient component of the finite-element level-set methodology for fast simulation of interface dynamics that does not require re-meshing. Such simulation has been a powerful numerical approach in understanding material properties, biological processes, and many other important phenomena in science and engineering.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Applied Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07222007-232136/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lidar-Aided Inertial Navigation with Extended Kalman Filtering for Pinpoint Landing</field><field name="creator">Aitken, Matthew Lawrence</field><field name="description">In support of NASA&#226;s Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology project, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) routine has been developed for estimating the position, velocity, and attitude of a spacecraft during the landing phase of a planetary mission. The EKF is a recursive algorithm for obtaining the minimum variance estimate of a nonlinear dynamic process from a sequence of noisy observations. The proposed filter combines measurements of acceleration and angular velocity from an inertial measurement unit with range and range-rate observations from an onboard light detection and ranging (LIDAR) system. These high-precision LIDAR measurements of distance to the ground and approach velocity will enable both robotic and manned vehicles to land safely and precisely at scientifically interesting sites. The robustness and accuracy of the Kalman filter were first established using a simplified simulation of the final translation and touchdown phase of the Apollo lunar landings. In addition, experimental results from a helicopter flight test performed at NASA Dryden in August 2008 demonstrate the merit in employing LIDAR for pinpoint landing in future space missions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07222009-105511/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic and Quantitative Analysis of Red Raspberry (Rubus idaeus) for Heat Tolerance and Longer Chilling Requirement</field><field name="creator">Molina Bravo, Ramon</field><field name="description">Despite the high level of interest for growing red raspberries (Rubus ideaus) in the southeastern US, production is limited by the lack of adapted, high quality cultivars. Breeding efforts are underway for increasing cultivar availability for this region, however breeding improvements in Rubus are slow and time-consuming. In order to expedite the slow, but effective, breeding process, more molecular breeding tools should be developed. Cultivars adapted to the southeastern US need to tolerate warm summers, and winters with temperature fluctuations. To address this issue, we have developed a genetic linkage mapping population from a cross that segregates for the tolerance of both conditions, (R. parvifolius &#195; &#226;Tulameen&#226;) &#195; &#226;Qualicum&#226;. This population was used for the construction of a genetic linkage map and for quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of heat tolerance, and chilling requirement for tolerance to fluctuating winter temperatures. As expected, seven linkage groups were created and were similar to the already published map. Because heat tolerance is a difficult trait to measure, a protocol was developed using chlorophyll fluorescence to assess heat tolerance. This protocol was used to measure tolerance in the population, and after QTL analysis, 3 QTL explained ~35% of the variation. Chilling requirements in the population were estimated by measuring bud break under greenhouse conditions. Quantitative analysis was performed on these estimates, and 3 QTL were found in two separate season evaluations, and in most cases co-localization occurred in the same region on the map. These regions explained the majority of the variation in the trait (100-64.5%). In summary, this research has established a protocol that measures heat tolerance in red raspberry, without relying on visual assessment, and has mapped important QTL for further molecular studies. Future research should focus on these regions to develop closely linked molecular markers for marker assisted breeding.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07222009-121741/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution of Tree Architecture in the Brazilian Cerrado</field><field name="creator">Lau, On Lee Annie</field><field name="description">The tropical savanna-forest boundary is commonly characterized by an abrupt transition in vegetation structure and in tree species composition. It has been hypothesized that differences in architecture between savanna and forest trees have an important role in determining the contrasting structural differences between savanna and forest ecosystems. Because of the importance the vegetation structure in determining the ecosystem properties of these systems, I performed a comparative study of tree architecture to examine differences in plant structure of savanna and forest species. To eliminate the potential bias from phylogenetic relatedness, I used congeneric species pairs containing trees of both habitat types that occur sympatrically in savannas of the Brazilian cerrado habitat at IBGE Ecological Reserve (RECOR). I found that relative to savanna species, forest species have larger crown volumes with more apical meristems and greater height for a given stem diameter. Other traits that influence patterns of light interception also differed, with savanna species exhibiting more convoluted leaf blades and shorter petioles. There was evidence that allometry and other traits are convergent in savanna and forest tree species across lineages, providing strong support for adaptive functions of these traits. Furthermore, the larger canopies of forest species imply that they play a role in reduced light in the understory and the exclusion of grasses, which potentially facilitates further expansion of forest tree species in the absence of fire.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07222009-141233/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biological and Operational Factors Causing Mortality in North Carolina's Soft-Shell Blue Crab Industry</field><field name="creator">Chaves, Juan Carlos</field><field name="description">Factors causing mortality in North Carolina's soft-shell blue crab industry were quantified and identified at 11 crab shedding systems across the state. Operators of crab shedding systems who shed peeler crabs (pre-molt crabs) that they had caught themselves (self-caught peeler crabs) experienced significantly lower crab mortality rates than operators who shed peelers that they had bought from different sources (purchased-peeler crabs). Molt stage had a significant effect on the mortality rates of self-caught peeler crabs, as early molt stage crabs (white-line peelers) suffered significantly higher mortality rates than late molt stage crabs (red-line peelers). Purchased male crabs experienced significantly higher mortality rates than purchased females crabs. Water quality did not have a significant effect on crab mortality. Male peeler crab mortality was not significantly affected by the presence or absence of female red-line peeler crabs. Male red-line peelers experienced significantly longer times to molt when male crab density was high. Results of this study may lead to improvements in crab shedding technology, increased profits, and better fishery management practices.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07232002-164130/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EFFECTS OF MILK FEEDING PERIOD AND ANTHELMINTIC TREATMENT ON FECAL EGG COUNTS AND GROWTH IN PASTURED DAIRY STEERS</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Bianca Merrick</field><field name="description">A 2 x 2 factorial trial with 2 phases was conducted to evaluate the effects of weaning age (6 wk vs 12 wk) and anthelmintic treatment (non vs dewormed) on average daily weight gain (ADG) in 36 Holstein and Jersey X Holstein crossbred steers born in fall (Oct - Nov) and winter (Dec ? Feb) 2003 ? 2004. Steers were blocked into 4 treatment groups by birth weight and breed. Calves of similar age were managed together in pastures regardless of treatment and group-fed 3.8 to 7.6 L of whole milk/d until weaning. Phase 1 extended from birth until July 15, 2004. Phase 2 started on July 15 and ended on Nov 18, 2004. Dewormed calves received 1 mL ivermectin pour-on formulation/ 10 kg body weight (BW) at 12 and 20 wk of age, and again on July 15 and Sept 23. Fecal samples and BW (birth to Nov 18, 2004) were taken from each calf at 4-wk intervals. Fecal egg counts (FEC), BW, and ADG (during Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phases 1 &amp; 2 combined) were compared among deworm, wean age, % Holstein, birth season, and their interactions. Parasite eggs were not detected until April and were lower in dewormed calves after July and Sept treatments. Fall-born calves usually had lower FEC than winter-born calves. Gains during Phase 1 were higher for fall-born calves. In Phase 2, dewormed calves actually had faster ADG than non-dewormed calves. Gain across Phase 1 and Phase 2 were higher in fall-born calves and tended to be higher in calves weaned at 6 wk. Gains and BW generally were higher with increasing % Holstein. Although steers that were not dewormed had higher FEC and differing ADG during parts of the trial, their overall performance was similar to those that received 4 doses of ivermectin.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07232005-183914/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dissecting the epigenetic regulation of V&#61538; recombination</field><field name="creator">Orcutt, Timothy Michael</field><field name="description">V(D)J recombination in developing lymphocytes is essential for producing a diverse repertoire of antigen receptors (TCR and Ig). During recombination, the proteins encoded by the recombinase activating genes (RAG1 and RAG2) bind specific DNA sequences flanking individual V, D, and J coding segments within each antigen receptor gene, and introduce double strand DNA breaks at the coding sequence/targeting sequence boundaries. These double strand breaks are then repaired by ubiquitous DNA repair machinery to generate novel coding segment joints. The ability of each developing lymphocyte to independently assemble unique V(D)J joints results in the enormous diversity of antigen receptors expressed by our immune system. Despite a conserved enzymatic activity in both B and T lymphocytes, the assembly of T cell receptors (TCRs) and Immunoglobulins (Igs) in T and B cells respectively follows a highly orchestrated program in which the accessibility of individual targeting sequences varies during lymphocyte development. For example, when the TCRb locus is rearranged, it initially assembles joints between D and J elements. Only after DJ joining do upstream V sequences become accessible and rearrange with the preassembled DJ?s. We have previously shown that DJ rearrangement requires modification of the chromatin structure surrounding individual D and J segments via the coordinated actions of D-associated promoters and a single downstream enhancer. Like the D elements, each V element in TCRb is associated with a transcriptional promoter. But the role these V promoters play in V-to-DJ recombination remains unknown. Similarly, because enhancer deletion ablates D-to-J assembly, the potential role of enhancer activity in V recombination has not been directly tested. We hypothesize that V-to-DJ rearrangement requires both enhancer and promoter-dependent changes in the chromatin surrounding the V&#61538; RAG binding site, as well as that surrounding the D&#61538; 5? binding site. To test this hypothesis, I have constructed a panel of recombination substrates which harbor unrearranged or prerearranged DJ elements downstream from a single V element. These ?miniloci? were stably transfected into the chromatin of a recombinase-inducible T cell line, and the chromatin status, expression and recombination potential of each was assessed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07232007-100353/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INFLUENCE OF CONFINEMENT PLATES ON THE SEISMIC PERFORMANCE OF REINFORCED CLAY BRICK MASONRY WALLS</field><field name="creator">Durham, Adrian Semaj</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on the behavior of clay masonry walls subjected to cyclic racking loading.

The objective is investigated by conducting seven tests on full-scale clay masonry walls with various longitudinal and confining reinforcing ratios under seismic excitation.

The implementation of the Food Quality Protection Act has eliminated the use of many organophosphate insecticides and encouraged the search for alternatives to organophosphates for control of Oriental fruit moth. Large and small plot studies were conducted to evaluate mating disruption as an alternative control tactic against Oriental fruit moth in North Carolina apple orchards during 2000-2002. The efficacy of Isomate-M 100 pheromone dispensers and microencapsulated sprayable pheromone was compared to insecticide-treated and non-managed orchards. Pheromone trap catches were significantly reduced in mating disruption blocks compared with conventional and non-managed orchards. Pheromone traps placed in the upper canopy captured significantly more moths than traps placed in the lower canopy across all treatments. Male OFM responded optimally to traps baited with 100 &#181;g lures compared with 30 and 300 &#181;g lures regardless of treatment. The loss of OFM pheromone from red rubber septa over a four-wk period exhibited a first-order release rate for septa loaded with 100 and 300 &#181;g pheromone, but a more constant release rate from septa loaded with 30 &#181;g pheromone. Based on pheromone trap captures, there was little difference among rates of sprayable pheromone ranging from 12.4 to 49.1 g (ai)/ha, but efficacy declined at 2.4 g (ai)/ha applied at monthly intervals. The 6.2 g (ai)/ha rate applied at 2-wk intervals was significantly less effective than monthly applications of 12.4 and 24.7 g (ai)/ha. Significantly fewer moths were caught in pheromone traps deployed in blocks treated in late May with Isomate-M 100, Isomate-M Rosso and Isomate-M 100 plus 3M sprayable pheromone compared with traps in conventional insecticide treatments, and Isomate-M 100 applied in late June. Overall, fruit damage by OFM larvae was quite low in mating disruption blocks.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07242003-225802/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Conservatory of Language</field><field name="creator">Nery, Carl</field><field name="description">Close reading and syntactical analysis are used as the foundation of a method that, through the language of music, seeks to describe a means by which Stein?s and Loy?s poetry creates meaning.

PBA fibers, and the related industrially produced PPTA (Kevlar), exhibit their most interesting ultra-high strength properties only when a considerably large DP (&gt;100) is attained. Use of cumbersome and expensive syntheses and solvents are required to attain DP in the range (~200-300) of industrial interest. Moreover, the fully covalent polymers thus far produced are highly insoluble in common organic solvents. On the other hand, easier processing becomes feasible if the DP of conventional PBA (prepared by the Yamazaki reaction) is increased by supramolecular bonding through ionic or hydrogen bond interactions. The effects of three different binding methods were first investigated on short rigid monomers with promising results the same binding was then used on rigid segments of PBA. The binding methods used two diamine binders triethylenediame (TED) and bipiperidine (Bipip) to form ionic bonds with the monomer, and polymer segments. The last method utilized a 2(6-iso cyanato hexylamino carbonyl amino)-6-methyl-4[1H]pyrimidinone (Upy) end group covalently bonded to the PBA polymer. This end group has the ability to form 4 hydrogen bonds with itself and thus could be used to increase the overall DP of the polymer starting material. This is believed to be the first recorded hydrogen bonded supramolecular interaction in amide type solvents. The novel and revolutionary idea of using low DP segments of PBA to increase the overall DP of polymer could be an industrially viable way to produce the highly sought after industrial polyamides.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07242005-213223/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entry Behavior and Financial Distress: An Empirical Analysis of the U.S. Domestic Airline Industry</field><field name="creator">Liu, Chia-Mei</field><field name="description">The present paper tests the empirical link between a firm?s financial structure and its entry decision in the US airline industry. The analysis of airline data from the top 500 airport-pairs during the period 1993-2003 shows that financially distressed air carriers with high leverage and low liquidity are generally less likely to enter a new airport-pair market. This is particularly true for US Airways, American, Alaska, Delta, Midway, America West, ATA, JetBlue, and AirTran. While the present paper does not find carriers with similar cost structures respond to financial distress in similar ways, when faced with worsening economic conditions, high cost carriers significantly reduce the probability of entering a new airport-pair, on the other hand, low cost carriers only decrease the probability of new entry at a marginally significance level. The finding that air carriers generally respond to financial distress by decreasing the probability of entry is consistent with literature showing that highly leveraged firms compete less aggressively. The evidence of a link between air carrier financial condition and entry decision indicates the important role of financial structure in airline entry.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07242006-202938/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BOND CHARACTERISTICS OF MICRO-COMPOSITE MULTI-STRUCTURAL FORMABLE STEEL USED IN REINFORCED CONCRETE STRUCTURES</field><field name="creator">Elagroudy, Hossam Aly</field><field name="description">The bond performance of a unique type of reinforcing steel rebars, claimed to have high corrosion resistance as well as high tensile strength, with concrete was studied. The objective was to investigate the bond behavior of straight rebars made out of this steel, named MMFX, embedded in concrete flexural members and to examine the applicability of the current expressions for bond force to predict the bond capacity of the MMFX bars embedded in concrete. Two phases of experimental investigation was conducted. In the first phase, four beam end specimens were tested and in the second phase eight splice beams were studied. The bond behavior of the MMFX steel bars was found to be similar to that of carbon steel. The bond strength of the MMFX is significantly reduced as the tensile stresses developed in the bar went beyond the proportional limit. Both the ACI code 318-02 equation for bond force and the current equation proposed by the ACI committee 408 for bond force gave conservative prediction for bond force for low stress levels. However, at high stress levels, the prediction of the two equations went to the unconservative side. The non linear behavior of the MMFX stress-strain curve was the reason behind the unconservative prediction. The above two equations were modified to ensure conservative prediction at high stress levels. A second degree best fitting curve was found to be the best to describe the relationship between the splice length and the bond force capacity for both # 6 and # 8 MMFX bars.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07252003-213630/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HabilisDraw: A Tool-based Direct Manipulation Software Environment</field><field name="creator">Horton, Thomas Eugene</field><field name="description">Direct manipulation interfaces already employ a weak analogy to the use of physical tools in the real world.

These films were analyzed using AES, XPS, NRA, RBS, SIMS, XAS, cathodoluminescence, spectroscopic ellipsometry, capacitance-voltage, and current-voltage techniques. Fixed charge was found to be present in all high-k films and was practically impossible to reduce in a significant way. Nitridation of the films was unsuccessful at reducing the charge, but was helpful in enhancing some electrical measurements. Sandwich stack structures showed enhanced tunneling which led to a novel approach of calculating the E&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;-m&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; product in the transmission probability equation.

The effects of various curing methods were also studied. This study covers the compressive strength, elastic modulus, Poisson?s ratio, and modulus of rupture of high-strength concrete. The study showed that extended curing beyond 7 days resulted in little or no increase in compressive strength. For predicting the elastic modulus of high-strength concrete, the ACI 318-02 or AASHTO-LRFD equation over-estimates the actual modulus while the ACI 363R-92 equation adequately predicts the measured value. The modulus of rupture equation in ACI 318-02 or AASHTO-LRFD gives a good approximation of the modulus of rupture of high-strength concrete when 1-day heat curing and 7-day moist curing are used. The equation from ACI 363R-92 gives a good estimate of modulus of rupture values for continually moist-cured specimens. The Poisson?s ratio of high-strength concrete is generally within the range of that reported for normal-strength concrete.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07252005-220433/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PMPT ? Performance Monitoring PEBS Tool</field><field name="creator">Beu, Jesse Garrett</field><field name="description">For many applications a common source of performance degradation is excessive processor stalling from high memory latencies or poor data placement. Performance degradations from program and memory hierarchy interactions are often difficult for programmers and compilers to correct due to a lack of run-time information or limited knowledge about the underlying problem. By leveraging the Pentium 4 processor's performance monitoring hardware, specific run-time information can be provided, allowing code modifications to reduce or even eliminate problematic code, resulting in reduced execution times. &lt;br&gt;Furthermore, many tools currently available to aid programmers are program counter centric. These tools point out which area of the code produce slowdowns, but they do not directly show where the problem data structures are. This is a common problem in programs that dynamically allocate memory. By creating a ?malloc-centric? tool, we can develop an interesting perspective of the memory behavior of the system, providing better insight into the sources of performance problems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07262006-133558/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Feed Additives on Aflatoxin in Milk of Dairy Cows Fed Aflatoxin-Contaminated Diets</field><field name="creator">Stroud, Jillian Summer</field><field name="description">Sixty lactating Holstein cows were used in a replicated block experiment to determine the efficacy of eight feed additives to reduce the transfer of aflatoxin (AF) from feed to milk. Six cows were allocated to each treatment group and 12 to a control group. All cows were fed the same aflatoxin-contaminated total mixed ration (TMR) with either no additive (control) or one of eight additives at 0.5% of the TMR dry matter (DM). Milk samples were collected twice daily to evaluate changes in milk AF concentration, milk AF excretion (milk AF concentration &#215; milk yield); and AF transfer from feed to milk (AF excretion as a percentage of AF intake). All changes were expressed as percentages and calculated relative to the control group which defined zero change. Four of the eight additives resulted in significant reductions (P &lt; 0.05) in milk AF concentration, secretion, and AF transfer ranging from 34.98-40.39%, 36.36-52.28%, and 34.45-48.44%, respectively. Dry matter intake (DMI) was significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.001) by the consumption of AF, while milk production was not affected during the same time period. Neither DMI nor milk production were affected by the addition of treatment products to the diet when compared to control (P &gt; 0.05).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07262006-181138/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical Investigation of the Mechanisms of Local Extinction Using Flame Kernel-Vortex interactions.</field><field name="creator">Kolera-Gokula, Hemanth</field><field name="description">The response of premixed flames to unsteady stretch is studied via kernel-vortex interactions. In this configuration a spark ignited kernel interacts with a vortex pair of variable strength. Both detailed and simple chemistry approaches are explored. In the detailed chemistry effort a dilute Hydrogen-air mixture is used. The vortex causes significant distortion of the kernel topography. Two distinct regimes; ?Breakthrough? and ?Extinction? are observed. A continuous increase in flame area and volumetric reaction rate values are observed throughout interactions in the breakthrough regime. However, corresponding consumption speed values are lower than 1-D laminar flame speed values. Detailed chemistry analysis of downstream interaction at the leading edge is carried out. During intermediate stages of the interaction, the mixture in between the interacting flames shows rich burning conditions. As the interaction proceeds the pool of products expands against the counter velocity gradient imposed by the vortex. The decrease in the temperature causes a steady decrease in the rates of reaction of the chain branching reactions causing. The behavior of various reaction layers is dictated to a large extent by their arrangement across the region of interaction. A simple two-step global reaction mechanism is formulated for lean methane combustion. These simple chemistry computations are carried out in an axis-symmetric configuration in a spherical frame of reference. Four distinct regimes of interaction: 1) the no-effect regime, 2) the wrinkling regime 3) the break-through regime, and the 4) global extinction regime are observed. Interactions in the no-effect regime show only minor deviations from unperturbed kernel values. Vortices in the wrinkling regime impose substantial stretch on the kernel causing major deviations from unperturbed kernel values. A sharp drop in the flame surface area and the integrated reaction rate is observed during breakthrough. The primary mechanism governing global extinction is downstream flame-flame interaction. A turbulent combustion diagram was derived for kernel-vortex interactions. Predominance of the breakthrough regime was observed. The turbulent combustion diagram represents an important contribution of this work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07262006-192222/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional Genomics of Stress Response in the Hyperthermophilic Crenarchaeon Sufolobus solfataricus and Role of vapBC Toxin-Antitoxin Loci in RNA Management.</field><field name="creator">tachdjian, sabrina</field><field name="description">Functional genomics tools were used to examine the dynamic stress response of the hyperthermophile Sulfolobus solfataricus subjected to thermal and pH shifts relative to growth under normal conditions. Whole genome oligonucleotide microarray analyses revealed substantial transcriptional changes in this crenarcheon upon temperature shifts from 80 to 90&#176;C at pH 4.0, and pH shifts from 4.0 to 2.0 at 80&#176;C. ORFs encoding heat shock proteins, molecular chaperones, and other known stress response elements responded in expected ways. However, genes involved in membrane adaptation, DNA repair mechanisms, transcriptional regulation, were also impacted, indicating that stress response is complex and implicating metabolic adjustments that go beyond the protective effect of stress proteins. It was also observed that, especially under heat shock, genes encoding insertion sequence (IS) elements were massively induced, suggesting that this microorganism increases genome plasticity as a strategy for dealing with thermal stress. In addition, 10 ORFs belonging to vapBC Toxin-Antitoxin (TA) loci were also implicated in the stress response of this archaeon. In silico analysis of the structural features of S. solfataricus two VapC toxins was conducted to examine the putative roles of Toxin-Antitoxin (TA) systems with respect to RNA management. Superimposition of predicted VapC structures on the T4 RNAse H template showed conservation of key catalytic residues as well as active site conformation, supporting their designation as ribonucleases. To confirm this biochemically, a recombinant version of VapBC-22, a heat shock-inducible and highly transcribed TA pair in S. solfataricus, was produced in Escherichia coli. Mass spectrometry confirmed that both protein members of this loci could be reovered in soluble forms and that they associate in vitro. Moreover, recombinant VapC-22 exhibited ribonucleic activity. A vapC-22 disruption mutant was constructed and transcriptional response analysis showed that toxin impacted RNA metabolism and translational functions under thermal stress. Possible connections to a putative archaeal RNA interference and/or non-sense mediated decay pathway were proposed. Furthermore, the connection between VapBC TA systems and translation inhibition was strengthened by the in silico identification of a conserved pattern in most archaeal genome sequences, whereby the gene encoding the gamma subunit of translation initiation factor 2 was found to overlap with a vapBC locus. The results of this study implicate vapBC loci in RNA management and suggest the intriguing possibility that TAs are connected to RNAi/NMD pathways in S. solfataricus and other archaea.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07262007-100850/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Long-term Response of Herpetofauna and Soricids to Prescribed Fire and Fuel Reduction Treatments in the Southern Appalachian Mountains</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Charlotte Esther</field><field name="description">Recent use of prescribed fire and fire surrogates to reduce fuel hazards has spurred interest in their effects on wildlife. Some studies of fire in the southern Appalachian Mountains have documented few effects on reptiles and amphibians. However, these studies were conducted after only one fire and for only a short time period (1 to 3 years) after the fire. From mid-May to mid-August 2006 and 2007, we used drift fences with pitfall traps to trap reptiles, amphibians, and shrews in western North Carolina and to asses their response to 3 fuel reduction treatments: 1) twice-burned (2003 and 2006), 2) mechanical understory cut (2002), and 3) mechanical understory cut (2002) followed by 2 burns (2003 and 2006), and a control. We captured significantly fewer salamanders in the mechanical + twice-burned treatment than in twice-burned and control treatments, but more lizards in the mechanical + twice-burned treatment. Higher lizard captures in mechanical + twice-burned treatments was likely due to increased ground temperatures and greater thermoregulatory opportunities. Higher and more variable ground temperatures and faster drying of the remaining litter and duff in mechanical + twice-burned treatments may have led to fewer salamander captures in these treatments. We captured significantly fewer southeastern shrews (Sorex longirostris) in the mechanical + twice-burned treatment than in the mechanical treatment in 2006, but southeastern shrew captures did not differ among treatments in 2007. Total shrew captures did not differ among treatments in either year. Decreases in leaf litter and canopy cover in the mechanical + twice-burned treatment may have led to decreases in moisture and therefore decreases in southeastern shrew captures. Our long-term results, after 2 prescribed burns, differ from results after 1 prescribed burn, after which eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus) captures were greater in mechanical + burn treatments but salamander captures did not differ among treatments. Low-intensity fuel reduction treatments in the southern Appalachian Mountains do not appear to greatly affect reptile, amphibian, or shrew populations. However, multiple (&gt;2) high intensity burns may benefit lizards but negatively affect salamanders and some shrew species, at least temporarily.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07262008-093401/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acute Toxicity of Ammonia and Nitrite to Yellow Perch, Perca flavescens.</field><field name="creator">Espey, James Lee</field><field name="description">A series of static toxicity tests were conducted to determine the tolerance of yellow perch to ammonia and nitrite on larvae, juvenile and adult fish.

The 96h LC50 for ammonia and nitrite to juveniles were 0.77 mg/L as NH3-N and 78.24 mg/l as NO2-N, respectively.

Consistent with previous research, older adults required longer to learn to use the PDA and committed more errors compared to younger adults.

Beck (1967) proposed that the essential component of a depressive disorder is a negative cognitive set; that is, the tendency to view the self, the future, and the world in a dysfunctional manner. In this study, depression was measured using Beck?s Depression Inventory. The results show that Muslims from Arab countries scored higher in depression relative to Muslims from non-Arab countries. According to Spielberger (1966, p. 41,) trait anxiety refers to relatively stable individual differences in anxiety-proneness; that is, differences between people in the tendency to perceive a stressful situation as dangerous or threatening, and to respond to such situations with elevations in the intensity of their state anxiety (S-Anxiety) reactions. This study found that Muslims from Arab and non-Arab countries differed significantly from Muslims form Arab countries for depression, state and trait anxiety. National and international circumstances and events may help account for these differences. Probable origins and possible diagnosis for depression and anxiety in Muslims who immigrated to America are discussed here.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Counselor Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07282005-105451/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resilient Data Aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks</field><field name="creator">Anantharaju, Srinath</field><field name="description">Sensor nodes are low-cost and low-power devices that are prone to node compromises, communication failures and malfunctioning of sensing hardware. As a result, some nodes may report outlying data values, introducing significant deviations in the aggregated sensor readings. This thesis presents a practical resilient outlier detection technique to filter out the influence of the outlying data reported by faulty or compromised nodes. The proposed outlier detection algorithm is based on event localization using minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation combined with threshold-based consistency checking to detect outliers. Data aggregation is one of the key techniques commonly used to develop lightweight communication protocols applicable to wireless sensor networks. The proposed approach handles localization of multiple events by grouping the sensor readings into spatially correlated clusters and performing an &lt;I&gt;event-centric&lt;/I&gt; detection of outliers. In the entire process of data aggregation, the outlier detection technique fits as a preprocessing stage for reducing the effect of outliers on the aggregated result. Suitable extensions to the basic outlier detection algorithm are proposed to effectively apply the algorithm to both centralized and decentralized sensor network architectures. This thesis further includes studies that test the effectiveness of the proposed approach, including the detection rate, the false positive rate, degree of damage and the resilience to malicious readings introduced by the attackers. The experimental results show that on average the proposed approach detects as high as 80-90% of the outliers while resulting in 5-15% false positive rate when the network consists of 40-45% outliers. The experiments also show that the extent of damage on the aggregated result is below 50% due to the elimination of outliers before aggregation. Finally, the resilient data aggregation process requires modest computational and memory requirements with zero communication overhead in the centralized case and about 20% overhead in the decentralized settings.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07282005-161557/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of Asphalt Concrete in Tension Using a ViscoElastoPlastic Model</field><field name="creator">Chehab, Ghassan Riad</field><field name="description">The objective of the research presented is to develop an accurate and advanced material characterization procedure to be incorporated in the Superpave performance models system. The procedure includes the theoretical models and its supporting experimental testing protocols necessary for predicting responses of asphalt mixtures subjected to tension loading. The model encompasses the elastic, viscoelastic, plastic and viscoplastic components of asphalt concrete behavior. Addressed are the major factors affecting asphalt concrete response such as: rate of loading, temperature, stress state in addition to damage and healing. Modeling strategy is based on modeling strain components separately and then adding the resulting models to attain a final integrated ViscoElastoPlastic model. Viscoelastic response, including elastic component, is modeled based on Schapery?s continuum damage theory comprising of an elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle and work potential theory. As for the viscoplastic response, which includes the plastic component, its characterization stems from Uzan?s strain hardening model. The testing program required for developing the models consists of complex modulus testing for determination of material response functions, constant crosshead rate testing at low temperatures for viscoelastic modeling, and repetitive creep and recovery testing for viscoplastic modeling. The developed model is successful in predicting responses up to localization when microcracks start to coalesce. After that, fracture process zone strains detected using Digital Image Correlation are used to extend the model?s ability in predicting responses in the post-localization stage. However, once major macrocracks develop, the currently developed model ceases to accurately predict responses. At that state, the theory of fracture mechanics needs to be integrated with the current continuum damage-based model.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07292002-182135/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional Genomic Characterization of the Anti-Adipogenic Effects of trans 10, cis 12-Conjugated Linoleic Acid (t10c12-CLA) in a Polygenic Obese Line of Mice</field><field name="creator">House, Ralph Lee</field><field name="description">We analyzed gene expression during t10c12-CLA-induced body fat reduction in a polygenic obese line of mice.

Body weight (BW) gain by day 14 was 12% lower in CLA compared to LA fed mice (P&lt;0.0001). By day 14, t10c12-CLA reduced weights of epididymal, mesenteric and brown adipose tissues as a percentage of BW in both lines by 30, 27 and 58%, respectively, and increased liver weight/BW by 34% (P&lt;0.0001). Total RNA was isolated and pooled (4-5 mice per composite) from epididymal adipose (day 5 &amp; 14) and liver (day 14) of the obese mice to analyze gene expression profiles using Agilent mouse oligo microarray slides (4 per tissue?day) representing &gt;20,000 genes.

I first assessed the effect of fishing on red drum abundance using 24 years of tagging data. The tag-return model incorporated all first returns from fish caught-and-released and accounted for age-dependent selectivities that varied by fate of the fish. Estimated fishing mortality rates (F) were high and variable before regulation changes in 1991, but decreased in magnitude and variability after 1991. A dome-shaped selectivity pattern was estimated to account for migration of older fish into coastal waters. To quantify the natural mortality rate and seasonal Fs for red drum, I conducted the first field test of a combined telemetry &#226; tag return approach. Estimated Fs were similar in seasonal pattern and magnitude between tagging and telemetry, but joint estimates were influenced primarily by tagging. Natural mortality rate was low and influenced primarily by telemetry. The combined approach provides a new tool to estimate mortality rates for myriad fish species. Next, habitat use of subadult red drum was quantified with a combination of fishery-independent sampling, telemetry, and generalized additive models. At a large scale, red drum were associated with shallow, nearshore waters, sometimes with seagrass. To determine the influence of prey, I examined red drum stomachs and used generalized additive models to relate physicochemical and prey attributes to telemetered red drum at a small scale. Telemetered red drum were negatively related to salinity and positively related to dissolved oxygen and total prey. Last, I used tagging and telemetry to quantify the large- and small-scale movements of subadult red drum. Movement rates and directions were influenced by age of fish and region and season of tagging, and suggest that the spatial scale of management and regulations currently employed in North Carolina are appropriate. Tagging and fishery-independent surveys have provided valuable information to improve red drum management.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07292008-115158/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fire in the Wildland-Urban Interface: An Examination of the Effects of Wildfire on Residential Property Markets.</field><field name="creator">Huggett, Robert James Jr.</field><field name="description">Housing markets near forests and wildland should capitalize into prices the value of forest amenities such as recreational opportunities, attractive scenery, and clean air. The expanding wildland-urban interface has made wildfire a frequently discussed and contentious public policy issue over the past decade. As residential communities expand into natural areas, more lives and property are placed at risk of death and destruction from wildfire. Housing markets are impacted by both the mere presence of fire risk as well as the damage to forest amenities and property that accompanies a wildfire. The purpose of this research is to empirically identify these responses. A data set comprised of residential housing sales from 1992-1996 in Chelan County, Washington was used to determine how the market responded to the 1994 fires in the Wenatchee National Forest that burned over 180,000 acres. The results indicate a decrease in the willingness to pay to live near the burned area for a six-month period in early 1995. There is no change in the willingness to pay to live near areas of relatively higher fire risk defined by higher fuel levels, which can be interpreted as a lack of support for collective protective measures that would reduce fuels. Additionally, the hedonic price for a fire-resistant roof increases gradually for 18 months before dropping to pre-fire levels in the second half of 1996. This result indicates that the subjective or perceived risk of property damage from wildfire behaved in a similar fashion and suggests either a risk threshold below which the household disregards the risk of fire or a general lack of awareness of risk.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07302003-165922/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene expression analysis in &lt;I&gt;Aspergillus flavus&lt;/I&gt; identified a gene, &lt;I&gt;ahpA&lt;/I&gt;, involved in protection against organic peroxides.</field><field name="creator">Schwartzburg, Kimberly Ann</field><field name="description">Secondary metabolism in some members of the genus &lt;I&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt; includes the production of aflatoxin, a secondary metabolite that is both immunosuppressive and carcinogenic to animals and humans. &lt;I&gt;A. flavus&lt;/i&gt;, in particular, is well known for its ability to contaminate stored food products and to accumulate high levels of aflatoxin in these products. The fungus is also able to infect plants such as corn, cotton, peanuts, and tree nuts long before harvest. Extensive research has been conducted on &lt;I&gt;A. flavus&lt;/i&gt; in areas such as population biology, ecology, pathogenicity, genetics, and genomics. The aflatoxin biosynthetic cluster has been sequenced, and researchers have identified regulatory mechanisms involved in the control of aflatoxin production. In spite of the large volume of research in this area, however, many unanswered questions remain concerning the genetic regulation of aflatoxin production and the molecular signals that intimately associate the synthesis of aflatoxin with specific environmental and nutritional conditions. In an effort to identify genes whose expression is affected by growth and aflatoxin production, a wild type strain of &lt;I&gt;A. flavus&lt;/i&gt; was compared to a &lt;I&gt;fadA&lt;sup&gt;G42R&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mutant strain using a cDNA microarray enriched for genes temporally differentially expressed with respect to aflatoxin production. HPLC measurements confirmed that the wild type strain produced high levels of aflatoxin, while the &lt;I&gt;fadA&lt;sup&gt;G42R&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mutant strain was unable to synthesize any detectable level of the toxin. Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes produced three clusters of genes induced in the wild type strain that contained known aflatoxin genes as well as other genes with no established role in secondary metabolism. A large cluster of genes induced in the &lt;I&gt;fadA&lt;sup&gt;G42R&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mutant strain included 15 ribosomal genes as well as genes showing homology to an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (Ahp1p) from &lt;I&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; involved in protection against oxidative stress.

Results indicated that although the protection was not as effective as that conferred by the native &lt;I&gt;AHP1&lt;/i&gt; gene, &lt;I&gt;ahpA&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;I&gt;A. nidulans AHP1&lt;/i&gt; homolog were able to protect the yeast cells against toxicity induced by exposure to TBHP.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07302004-202428/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High Speed Model Implementation and Inversion Techniques for Smart Material Transducers</field><field name="creator">Braun, Thomas R.</field><field name="description">Smart material transducers are utilized in wide range of applications, including nanopositioning, fluid pumps, high accuracy, high speed milling, objects, vibration control and/or suppression, and artificial muscles.

Brevetoxins have been linked to deaths in marine mammals, which are exposed through ingestion of organisms harboring high brevetoxin concentrations and through the inhalation of aerosolized brevetoxins. Humans are also at risk through the same routes of exposure. Evidence suggests that respiratory exposure to brevetoxins can lead to a severe inflammatory response. Brevetoxins exert their toxicity by interacting with neurotoxin receptor site five associated with domain IV of the alpha subunit of the voltage gated sodium channel. Brevetoxin binding to tissues that contain voltage gated sodium channels on excitable cells results in membrane depolarization, repetitive firing, and increase in sodium currents. The goal of the current research project is to determine how these marine toxins evoke an immune response, specifically by examining the effects of brevetoxin and brevetoxin antagonists on T cells. The hypothesis is that brevetoxins alter cell proliferation, cause DNA damage, disrupt normal signal transduction, and ultimately cause cell death, possibly through an apoptotic mechanism, and the natural and synthetic brevetoxin antagonists are able to prevent and reverse these deleterious effects, making them a useful pharmaceutical agent not only for brevetoxin exposure treatment, but also for human diseases exhibiting similar inflammatory congestion, like Asthma and Cystic Fibrosis. The effects of brevetoxins and antagonists were determined by cell proliferation assays, comet assays and examination of caspase activation, Poly ADP- ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and gene expression. Exposure of Jurkat E6-1 Cells to Brevetoxin 2, 3, 6, and 9 at doses of 10-5M severely inhibited proliferation. Further analysis revealed positive staining for apoptosis, PARP cleavage, caspase 3/7 and caspase 8 activation, decreased intracellular sodium and increased intracellular calcium concentrations. PCR array gene expression analysis revealed significant change in gene expression. The apoptosis PCR array yielded 30 up-regulated and 4 down-regulated genes divided into the following families: TNF ligand, TNF receptor, Bcl-2, caspase, IAP, CARD, death domain, CIDE, p53 and DNA damage response, and anti-apoptosis. The DNA Damage Signaling Pathway Array had 20 up-regulated genes and 5 down-regulated genes from the following families: apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, cell cycle checkpoint, DNA repair-damaged DNA binding, DNA repair-double strand break repair, DNA repair-mismatch repair, and other genes related to DNA repair. The Common Cytokine PCR array had 50 up-regulated genes from the following gene families: interferons, interleukins, bone morphogenic protein and TGF-&#239;&#162;, PDGF/VEGF, TNF Superfamily, and other growth factors/cytokines. Exposure of Jurkat E6-1 cells to brevetoxin in combination with the antagonists brevenal, alpha naphthoyl, and beta naphthoyl did not improve cell proliferation, which is in stark contrast to experiments conducted with CHO-K1 BH4 cells. This disparity may be due to the difference in voltage gated sodium channel subtypes that these cells possess. The results demonstrate that brevetoxins can induce apoptosis and DNA damage and that the antagonists may show selectivity based on VGSC subtype.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toxicology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07302008-152733/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determination of Particle Size Distribution of Particulate Matter Emitted from a Layer Operation in Southeast U.S.</field><field name="creator">Cao, Zihan</field><field name="description">This thesis reports a field study on characterizing particle size distribution (PSD) of particulate matter (PM) emitted from a commercial layer operation in the Southeastern U.S. across three seasons from October of 2008 to April of 2009. Six low-volume (1m3/h) total suspended particulate (TSP) samplers were used to collect PM samples in two high-rise layer houses. A laser diffraction particle size analyzer (LS13 320) at North Carolina State University (NCSU), a laser scattering particle size analyzer (LA-300) at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and a Coulter Counter Multisizer 3 (CCM 3) at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) or USDA-ARS cotton production &amp; processing unit in Lubbock, TX were used to measure PSD of PM samples collected by the TSP samplers. Particle size distributions measured by these three instruments were compared. Results of the study indicate that TSP concentrations across the three seasons ranged from 888 to 5333 &#194;&#181;g/m3. Total suspended particulate concentration was affected by season, animal activity, floor, and equivalent air flow rate factor. It was observed that TSP concentration in winter was higher than in spring; concentration on the second floor was higher than that on the first floor; the more active the animals were, the higher the TSP concentration; and the more the fans were on, the lower the concentration. Compared with PM concentration, PSD (characterized by the mass medium diameter, MMD, and geometric standard deviation, GSD) was affected by season, animal activity, floor and equivalent flow rate factor to a lesser extent. Overall MMDs of PM samples collected in fall, winter and spring, measured by the laser diffraction particle size analyzer were 19.21&#194;&#177;1.27 &#194;&#181;m, 17.13&#194;&#177;0.81&#194;&#181;m and 18.44&#194;&#177;1.44&#194;&#181;m, respectively. Geometric standard deviation (GSD) was relatively constant and not affected by those factors (season, animal activity, floor, and equivalent air flow rate factor). The overall GSD was 2.65&#194;&#177;0.08. Significant but constant differences in MMDs and GSDs were detected when comparing PSDs measured by the different instruments. In general, the LA-300 provided the largest MMDs, whereas the CCM 3 gave the smallest MMDs. The LS13 320 provided the largest GSDs, whereas the CCM 3 gave the smallest.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological and Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07302009-201630/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Postpartum Changes in Hormones and Metabolites During Early Lactation in Summer and Winter Calving Holstein Cows.</field><field name="creator">Nordbladh, Louise I.</field><field name="description">Changes in metabolites and metabolic hormones during the first 12 weeks postpartum in both summer and winter were analyzed on a total of 18 lactating, Holstein cows (summer, n=11; winter, n=7). The summer trial covered the months of August through October. The winter trial began in November and lasted through early February. Maximum and minimum temperature and humidity values were recorded daily. Blood was sampled in serum, fluoride and heparin tubes from the coccygeal vein once a week beginning at day of calving for 12 weeks. Concentrations of progesterone, cortisol, thyroxine, leptin, NEFA, cholesterol and insulin were analyzed from serum samples. The metabolites glucose, PUN and &#226;-HBA were analyzed with plasma collected from fluoride and heparin containing tubes. No significant seasonal differences were found between summer and winter calving groups for P4, T4, glucose, insulin, PUN and NEFA. However, leptin (P &lt; 0.01), cholesterol (CHL) (P &lt; 0.0001) and &#226;-HBA (P &lt; 0.0001) had significant seasonal differences between the two calving groups. The mild heat stress during the early part of the summer trial may not have been severe enough to detect significant changes in serum T4 or the animals had become acclimated to these temperatures. Summer calving cows may have experienced a drop in feed intake at calving (not measured) enough to increase their plasma ketone bodies (&#226;-HBA), but not enough to dramatically reduce circulating levels of glucose and insulin.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07312003-174200/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Monochromatic X-ray Area Beam for Application in Diffraction Enhanced Imaging</field><field name="creator">Kim, Chang Hyeuk</field><field name="description">Synchrotron-based Diffraction Enhanced Imaging (DEI) system has shown improved contrast images on low attenuation material. In a previous DEI study great potential to detect earlier stage breast cancer was reported. However, to apply DEI technique at the clinical level, a synchrotron source is not feasible for clinically-approved systems due to the size of the accelerator, and hence a compact x-ray source that can replace synchrotron is desirable. Development of an x-ray source compatible to synchrotron radiation is an essential part for a clinical DEI system. Some important features for the design of an x-ray source, based on synchrotron radiation, are the photon flux and beam collimation. The NCSU research group suggested a wide-beam x-ray source, which consists of concentric circular filaments producing electron flux onto a cylindrically-shaped oxygen-free copper stationary target with a thin layer of Molybdenum for x-ray production. This source design emphasizes large field of view, which can eliminate the line by line scanning process experienced in a DEI experimental setup. In this study, the proof of principle model of a wide beam x-ray source was used to study for control electron trajectory of the concentric filaments design, calculations of the produced x-ray flux, simulation of the DEI imaging, and estimation of the operation time with target?s active cooling system. The DEI images from the electron distribution were computationally generated by adopting a monochromator and an analyzer with a computationally generated dual cylindrical object. The image simulation showed that the wide-beam x-ray source based DEI images are highly dependent on the electron distribution at the target. Uniform electron distribution by electron trajectory optimization is carried out through independent powering of the filaments inside the focusing cup. For higher electron beam current the x-ray flux satisfies obtaining a successful DEI image scan, but such high current increases the heat loading on the target. The target cooling with a contact cold finger does not provide sufficient thermal management, and hence not enough scanning time. The impinging jet nozzle cooling option was investigated to maximize convective heat transfer, and has shown feasible thermal management and adequate operation time for DEI imaging.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07312007-125711/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Glycerol Combustion</field><field name="creator">Metzger, Brian</field><field name="description">As worldwide production of biodiesel fuel increases, one of the largest concerns is the abundance of waste glycerol. The price of crude glycerol has fallen drastically and many large biodiesel producers are currently paying to landfill this large waste stream. In the search to find a value added alternative, glycerol combustion may be one of the simplest solutions. Heat recovered from glycerol oxidation could easily be used to reduce heating costs inherent to large-scale biodiesel production. It has been stated ?Combustion of glycerol would be an elegant solution, if it worked?. Clean combustion of glycerol is difficult due to its high viscosity, high auto ignition temperature, and concerns of hazardous emissions. In particular, most in the biodiesel producing community share a fear that burning glycerol could produce acrolein, an aldehyde which is a thermal decomposition product of glycerol and is toxic at very low concentrations. This report will detail the design of a burner that can safely and easily burn crude glycerol for process heating. Emissions testing in the burner using glycerol sources of varying quality confirm that this burner design completely oxidizes the glycerol into CO2 and H2O with very low levels of pollutants, typical of other hydrocarbon fuels. These results show that safe, clean, and efficient combustion of a wide range of glycerol purities is possible with a properly designed burner.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07312007-153859/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enzyme Properties and mRNA Expression of an NAD+ Scavenging System: NatV and NadV of Vibrio parahaemolyticus Phage KVP40</field><field name="creator">Lee, Jae Yun</field><field name="description">KVP40 is a T4-like bacteriophage whose dsDNA genome (244,835 bp) has been sequenced (21). It infects Vibrio parahaemolyticus, which can cause disease in fish and shellfish, and gastroenteritis in humans when consumed in raw or under-cooked seafood (i.e., oysters). The KVP40 genome carries bacterial-like genes that have the potential to encode a pyridine nucleotide scavenging system for synthesis of NAD+. This is the first pyridine nucleotide salvage pathway predicted from a phage or eukaryotic viral genome (21). nadV and natV are the two genes that encode the hypothetical two-reaction NAD+ scavenging pathway. NadV, a nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, catalyzes the first reaction that converts nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). The NatV NMN adenylyltransferase activity yields NAD+. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential cofactor involved in fundamental processes in cell metabolism, and pathways for its synthesis are potential anti-microbial, therapeutic targets. The phage enzymes provide model targets for these studies. NatV, which catalyzes the second step of the pathway, also has a Nudix hydrolase domain in the C-terminal half. The purpose of this project was to characterize expression patterns of nadV and natV during KVP40 development in V. parahaemolyticus by using qRT-PCR; to characterize the enzymatic activity of NadV and NatV in a coupled-enzyme assay using alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to connect to fluorescent NADH; to identify possible substrates for the NatV Nudix hydrolase; and to use mass spectrometry to quantify product yields of the NatV reactions. qRT-PCR analysis showed that KVP40 nadV and natV were expressed early during infection relative to other phage genes used in this study. NadV-His6 and NatV-His6 enzymes were successfully purified by Ni2+ affinity HPLC and the levels of NADH produced were measured in a three step NadV-NatV-ADH reaction system. In the coupled assay, NatV-His6 converted NMN to 50 &#206;&#188;mole of NAD+/sec/&#206;&#188;g at 25&#194;&#176;C. NatV NMNATase activity was also confirmed by mass spectrometry, in this assay, the rate was 350 &#206;&#188;mole NAD+/sec/&#206;&#188;g NatV-His6 at 25&#194;&#176;C. NadV NAmPRTase activity was confirmed by producing 5.2, 4.9 and 5.0 &#206;&#188;mole NMN/sec/&#206;&#188;g NadV-His6 enzyme at 25, 30 and 37&#194;&#176;C, respectively. Purified NadV used in the coupled enzyme also produced 2.7, 1.5, 1.3, 1.8 or 1.5 &#206;&#188;mole NMN/sec/&#206;&#188;g NadV-His6, when 10, 25, 40, 50 or 100 pmole NadV-His6 was respectively used in the reaction at 25&#194;&#176;C. The &#226;Nudix&#226; activity of purified NatV was measured by a phosphate releasing assay and by mass spectrometry. Using the phosphate release Nudix hydrolase assay, ADP-ribose was identified as a preferred substrate for KVP40 NatV, followed by NAD+, NADH, and NADPH. In this assay, ADP-ribose as substrate yielded 0.6 &#206;&#188;mole phosphate/sec/&#206;&#188;g NatV-His6 at 37&#194;&#176;C, when Mg2+ was supplied as the required metal ion. Mass spectrometry verified the NatV Nudix hydrolase preference for ADP-ribose as substrate, yielding the same rate of 0.6 &#206;&#188;mole AMP/sec/&#206;&#188;g NatV-His6 at 37&#194;&#176;C in the presence of Mg2+. Together these data confirm the various enzymatic activities of key pyridine nucleotide scavenging enzymes encoded by phage KVP40. The time course of expression and in vivo activities suggest that pyridine nucleotide scavenging during KVP40 infection of V. parahaemolyticus is a functional and potential relevant pathway used by the phage.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07312008-124105/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three Essays on Dynamic Panel Data Estimation</field><field name="creator">Eryuruk, Gunce</field><field name="description">This dissertation consists of three essays, first two of which consider a new estimation method of dynamic panel data models and the last one considers an application of these models. The first essay (Chapter 1) offers empirical likelihood (EL) estimation of dynamic panel data models, which provide great flexibility to empirical researchers. EL estimation method is shown to have great advantages in usual settings, however little is known on the relative merits of these estimators in panel data models. With this essay, we try to fill that gap by establishing the asymptotic properties of the EL estimator for a dynamic panel model with individual effects when both the time and the cross-section dimensions tend to infinity. We give the conditions under which this estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. In the second essay (Chapter 2), via a Monte Carlo study, we assess the relative finite sample performances of EL, generalized method of moments, and limited information maximum likelihood estimators for an autoregressive panel data model when there are many moment conditions. We also extend our results to the many weak moments settings. Our results suggest that when the overall performances are concerned, in terms of median, interquartile range and median absolute error of the estimators, in both strong and weak moments settings, EL is more reliable. In the final essay (Chapter 3) we consider an application of dynamic panel data models to examine the determinants of the allocation of state highway funds using panel data for North Carolina's 100 counties for the years 1990 to 2005. We make two main contributions with this essay. First, although there have been numerous studies of highway funding at the state level, to our knowledge, there is no analysis at the sub-state or county levels. Second, by using dynamic panel data models and sophisticated methods to estimate them, we account for any potential persistence in the process of adjustment toward an equilibrium, besides, unlike most of the previous studies, we control for the unobserved county heterogeneity and time effects that explain spatial differences, which may cause omitted variable problem if ignored.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07312009-023153/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative Analysis of the Begomovirus AL2 Protein and the Curtovirus C2 Protein</field><field name="creator">Jernigan, Leigh Lashley</field><field name="description">Geminiviruses are a group of plant-infecting viruses that include the genera Begomovirus and Curtovirus. Although members of these two genera are similar in regards to their mechanisms of replication and encapsidation, they exhibit differences in movement as well as in transcriptional activation of late gene promoters. This study evaluated protein-protein interactions of the begomovirus AL2 protein and a curtovirus C2 protein using the yeast two-hybrid system. The AL2 proteins of TGMV, BGMV, and CabLCV were evaluated for their ability to self-interact, as well as to interact with heterologous AL2 proteins, and host proteins. The AL2 proteins tested were all shown to contain the ability to self-interact and to interact heterologously with one another. However, interactions between the AL2 proteins and the host proteins could not be assayed due to lack of expression of certain AL2 'bait' proteins. The BCTV C2 protein was also evaluated for self-interaction and interaction with the begomovirus AL2 proteins. Unlike AL2, C2 was not shown to contain the property of self-interaction and the preponderance of the evidence demonstrated that it also did not interact with AL2. However, the BCTV C2 protein was shown for the first time to possess transcriptional activation activity. In addition, self-interaction of TGMV AL2 was tested using a biochemical assay. However, technical problems prevented the detection of TGMV AL2 self-interaction using an immunocapture approach, although such self-interaction was observed using the yeast two-hybrid system.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08012003-153220/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Biologically Plausible Architecture for Shape Recognition</field><field name="creator">Shetty, Sanketh Vittaldas</field><field name="description">This thesis develops an algorithm for shape representation and matching.

However, pure DVS techniques do not perform well for dynamic systems where the execution times of different jobs vary significantly. A novel DVS scheme with feedback control mechanisms for hard real-time systems is proposed in this work. It produces energy-efficient schedules for both static and dynamic workloads. Task-splitting, slack-passing and preemption-handling schemes are proposed to aggressively reduce the speed of each task. Different feedback control structures are integrated into the DVS algorithm to make it adaptable to workload variations. This scheme relies strictly on operating system support. It is evaluated in simulation as well as on an embedded platform. For given task sets, simulation experiments demonstrate the benefits of this scheme with savings of up to 29\% in energy over previous work. This scheme exhibits up to 24\% additional energy savings over other DVS algorithms on the embedded platform. The feedback-based DVS scheme is further extended to be leakage aware, which considers not only dynamic but also static power consumption caused by leakage current in circuits. A combined DVS, delay and sleeping scheme is proposed for architectures where static power exceeds dynamic power in some cases. DVS is used when dynamic power dominates the total power consumption, while a sleep mode is entered when static power becomes dominant. The extended algorithm, DVSleak, shows 30\% additional energy savings on average over a pure DVS algorithm in the simulation experiment.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08022005-230539/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of Follistatin as a Candidate Gene for Litter Size in Pigs</field><field name="creator">Boyette, Keri Evelyn</field><field name="description">The objective of this study was to characterize follistatin (FOL) as a candidate gene for litter size in pigs. Litter size is a lowly heritable and sex-limited trait; therefore, response to selection may be enhanced by marker-assisted selection. Our approach for characterizing a region of SSC16, which includes FOL, was to utilize the candidate gene approach using type I and type II markers to determine if FOL had an association with the response to selection for increased litter size in the select line. Pigs genotyped were from a line selected for increased number of fully formed (FF) pigs and a contemporary control line. In generation nine, the estimated breeding value for litter size was 0.63 pigs greater in the select line than in the control line (Holl et al., 2003). A RFLP within FOL (n = 251) and the microsatellites, CGT27 (n = 224), S0363 (n=255), S0298 (n=260), and SW1661 (n=253) were genotyped. Effect of marker genotype on FF, number born alive (BA), number still born (SB), and number mummified fetuses (MUM) was tested. Data were analyzed by line with an animal model using MTDFREML. Fixed effects included year and marker genotype. In both the select and control lines, all markers had no significant affect on FF, BA, SB, or MUM when using the animal model. Therefore, follistatin is not likely to have a major effect on litter size in the population studied.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08032005-105553/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SYNTHESIS OF GOLD/POLYMER COMPOSITES, MICELLE/POLYMER COMPOSITES, AND POLYMER NANOCAPSULES.

First, a vector space method to reconstruct a surface given a gradient field is developed using the linear relationship between a surface and its gradient field in discrete surface domains. The developed gradient field representation is generalized to alleviate the common assumption of uniform integrability in gradient fields to partial integrability, allowing adequate reconstruction of surfaces with non-integrable gradient fields. In addition, the developed technique is further explored for gradient field noise reduction, by embedding multiscale properties providing sparse gradient field representations. Next, the ambiguity in possible surface gradients obtained by a two-image photometric stereo analysis is resolved using a cyclic projections algorithm based on the set of possible gradient fields and the previously developed gradient field representation. An algorithm that provides accurate surface reconstructions and surface type characterizations given two images of an unknown composite surface is established. We then apply this algorithm to Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images to extract specimen surface topography and material type information from a pair of Secondary Electron (SE) and Back-scattered Electron (BSE) images. We then use a similar cyclic projections algorithm to reconstruct a surface from a single image. The simulation results indicate that the developed algorithm solves this classical shape-from-shading problem in a robust and accurate manner for varying illumination conditions. Finally, we establish a unified surface reconstruction framework using previously developed techniques on a photometric stereo image triplet containing shadows. We categorize the surface pixels as those illuminated in all three images, only two images and only one image. We then establish through simulation results that the developed method uses the surface gradient information obtained from the brightness images efficiently and effectively, and provides an accurate surface reconstruction.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08042002-221210/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fine Mapping Quantitative Trait Loci Affecting Health and Reproduction in US Holstein Cattle on Chromosome 18</field><field name="creator">Muncie, Sarah Alissa</field><field name="description">Continued genetic improvement for milk production has been associated with decreased fertility in US Holstein cattle. A previous study (Ashwell et al., 2004) identified a putative quantitative trait locus (QTL) affecting daughter pregnancy rate at 54 cM on chromosome 18 in one Holstein grandsire family. The goal of this research is to determine the validity of the putative QTL using additional markers and an extended pedigree. Thirteen microsatellite markers located throughout the chromosome were genotyped in 973 animals that were descendants of the original grandsire in which the QTL was identified. Sons of the grandsire as well as six grandson and six great-grandson families of the original grandsire were selected for this study (range of 16 to 169 sons per family). In analysis of the sons using QTL Express, the same putative QTL affecting daughter pregnancy rate was detected and placed at 45 cM. In a joint analysis of thirteen of the largest families, each containing 10 or more sons, a significant QTL for daughter pregnancy rate was detected at 27 cM. QTL affecting daughter pregnancy rate was detected in two additional sub-families (Family II-5 and Family III-2), indicating a putative QTL affecting daughter pregnancy rate is most likely segregating within this pedigree. Across-family analysis also detected putative QTL on chromosome 18 affecting productive life at 35 cM, somatic cell score at 33 cM and percent difficult births at 72 cM. Analysis of individual families identified eight significant putative QTL and six suggestive putative QTL at the chromosome-wise level affecting somatic cell score, productive life, calving ease, percent difficult births, milk yield, fat yield, protein yield and fat percent. A complex pedigree analysis is underway to make full use of statistical power to refine the QTL region affecting fertility.

This process of network-based control (NBC) has potential profound impact in areas such as: teleoperation, healthcare, military applications, and manufacturing. However, limitations arise as the communication network introduces delay that often degrades or destabilizes the control system. Four methods have been investigated that alleviate the IP network delays to provide stable real-time control. A performance measure is defined for a case study on a DC motor with a networked proportional-integral (PI) speed controller with various network delays and noise levels. Matlab simulation results show that NBC combined with these techniques can successfully maintain system stability, allowing control of real-time applications.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08042005-160943/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics of Saturated Porous Media: Wave Induced Response and Instability of Seabed</field><field name="creator">Ulker, Mehmet Baris Can</field><field name="description">Problems in fields ranging from geomechanics to biomechanics require response of saturated porous media subjected to dynamic loading. An engineering problem requiring the true behavior of saturated porous medium should consider the coupling of both fluid and solid phases yielding the simultaneous analysis of flow of pore fluid and deformation of solid skeleton. Depending on the nature of loading vis-&#195;&#160;-vis the characteristics of the media, different formulations; fully-dynamic (FD), partially-dynamic (PD), quasi-static (QS) are possible. In this study, analytical solutions and numerical models are developed for the response of plane strain saturated porous media, and wave-induced response of seabed in free field and around a breakwater under pulsating/breaking waves. For each formulation, the results are presented with pore-pressure, shear and normal stress distributions within porous medium. The response is studied for various conditions and regions of applicability of formulations are identified in non-dimensional and actual parametric spaces. This can be used for a specific case with known loading and medium characteristics and may help engineers identify the necessary formulation to be used in a given problem. Effect of seabed-wave parameters and inertial terms on standing/breaking wave-induced pulsating/impact response of seabed-caisson system were investigated. The selection of the adequate formulation is decided depending upon the response variable and ranges of physical parameters. While FD formulation yields the minimum response in cyclic wave, for impacting wave it yields variable distributions in between the other two formulations. The areas of instantaneous liquefaction were identified inside the domain through contours of mean effective stress for both types of waves. Liquefied regions are concentrated at the front toe of rubble under cyclic wave which can initiate a vertical-horizontal movement and rotation towards the seabed causing structural failure. Liquefied areas in case of breaking waves are much larger compared to cyclic waves. Additional analyses made introducing a constitutive model for the inelastic behavior of soil to evaluate the nonlinear dynamic response of seabed reveal the importance of the inclusion of material nonlinearity effects.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08042009-161500/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analysis of the Physical Processes and Model Representation of Cold Air Damming Erosion</field><field name="creator">Stanton, Wendy Marie</field><field name="description">The occurrence of Appalachian cold air damming (CAD) is often associated with significant sensible weather impacts throughout the Carolinas and Virginia. CAD sensible weather, defined as below-normal maximum temperatures, overcast skies, fog, and reduced visibility, can often persist in the damming region for days. Furthermore, the confinement of a dome of low-level cold air along the eastern slopes of the Appalachians can create an environment ideal for freezing rain and sleet. Such potentially hazardous conditions necessitate accurate and timely forecasting in order to properly warn the public. Despite this need for reliable CAD prediction, accurate forecasting of the magnitude of sensible weather impacts and the timing of CAD demise are extremely challenging. Furthermore, many operational numerical weather prediction models do not accurately simulate CAD events. One of the more common problems associated with model forecasts is the premature erosion of the CAD cold dome and the underestimation of the duration of CAD sensible weather. A better understanding of the physical processes involved in cold dome erosion would lead to improved erosion forecasting by increasing forecaster awareness of the signs of CAD erosion and by isolating physical processes that may be poorly handled by operational models. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;One objective of this research is to describe the common synoptic patterns evident during the erosion period of CAD events. These synoptic erosion scenarios are representative of the physical mechanisms contributing to cold dome erosion. To accomplish this objective, 89 classical CAD events detected by the algorithm of Bailey et al. (2003) were grouped according to similarities in sea-level pressure and surface potential temperature fields. Composite maps of each group were created, resulting in five CAD erosion scenarios: (1) Northwestern Low, (2) Cold Frontal Passage, (3) Coastal Low, (4) Residual Cold Pool, and (5) Southwestern Low. High levels of statistical significance were associated with the dominant synoptic features in all scenarios except the Southwestern Low, suggesting that the remaining four scenarios effectively represented distinct erosion patterns. Several potential erosion mechanisms could be inferred from the evolution of dominant synoptic features in each erosion scenario. Multiple erosion mechanisms may be simultaneously contributing to cold dome erosion for any one given scenario. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The second objective involved detailed case studies of three CAD events in order to more closely examine erosion mechanisms. The first case was an example of the Coastal Low erosion scenario, the second case was representative of the Northwestern Low erosion scenario, and erosion of the third case was multi-faceted and not clearly classifiable. Detailed examination of observations and EDAS analyses revealed that multiple erosion mechanisms were contributing to the weakening of the capping inversion above the cold dome and promoting the erosion of the CAD event. In the Coastal Low case, cold advection aloft led to a decrease in the potential temperature difference across the inversion, indicating erosion from the top of the cold dome down to the surface. Comparatively, the inland progression of a coastal front, in association with surface divergence, corresponded to an increase in surface temperatures and a weakening of the inversion during the Northwestern Low case study. This development was more indicative of erosion from the surface upwards. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The performance of NCEP Eta Model forecasts during the three CAD events was evaluated. Consistent with the findings of previous research, the Eta Model eroded the cold dome prematurely for all three cases, and surface temperature were consistently overestimated. Control run simulations using the PSU/NCAR MM5 Model were performed for the Coastal Low and Northwestern Low cases. The control run simulations showed improved accuracy over the Eta Model forecasts in the representation of CAD erosion. However, erosion was still premature in comparison to observations. For both CAD events, overestimated values of shortwave radiation appeared to correlate with the decrease in model inversion strength. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Finally, two sets of sensitivity tests for the Coastal Low case using the MM5 model were designed to test the sensitivity of model performance to alterations in certain physics parameterizations. The first sensitivity test involved altering the model values of cloud albedo, based on speculations that the overestimation of surface temperatures in the Eta Model was a result of the interaction between clouds and shortwave radiation. As hypothesized, the simulation in which cloud albedo was decreased produced the warmest surface temperatures. The second sensitivity test involved altering the PBL schemes used in the MM5 control run. It was found that the simulated vertical structure of the atmosphere did vary according to the PBL scheme, as anticipated. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although some of the alterations made to the MM5 control run for the sensitivity tests did improve the representation of certain features, the model continued to erode the cold dome earlier than observed. Comparisons of the MM5 simulations to the corresponding Eta Model forecasts revealed that none of the alterations to the MM5 control run produced the magnitude of error evident in the Eta Model.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08052003-202239/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Faculty Satisfaction and Orgnizational Commitment with Industry-University Research Centers</field><field name="creator">Coberly, Beth Marie</field><field name="description">Faculty are an important part of cooperative research centers. However, their decision to become involved in a center is entirely voluntary. A center?s success is dependent on both the recruitment and retention of top-notch faculty. Knowing what contributes to a faculty member?s satisfaction, commitment, and ultimately decision to remain in the organization should be a high priority for center management. The purpose of this study was to examine the concepts of satisfaction and organizational commitment as they pertain to faculty involved in industry-university research centers. A model, which included the variables of intrinsic rewards, extrinsic rewards, satisfaction, commitment, and retention cognitions, was proposed. Data were collected from faculty at industry-university research centers nationwide via an Internet survey. Results showed support for the proposed model. In particular, the model shows that satisfaction is a significant predictor of commitment. Both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards were significant predictors of satisfaction. Intrinsic rewards also had a direct effect on commitment. Both satisfaction and commitment have a significant direct effect on retention cognitions. Implications of the model results for centers are discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08052004-152228/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Opto-electronic Technique For Error Fault Detection In Textile Joining Applications</field><field name="creator">Foster, Howard Allen Jr.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research has been to develop an opto-electronic method for detecting error faults in textile joining applications. The application of this study would be in on-line determination of skipped stitches in seam sewing operations. The research begins with a selection of materials that covers a range of textile materials commonly used, and then determining several physical parameters based upon industry standards. The next portion of the research is to determine the proper wavelength of light to use for the opto-electronics, using near infrared and visible spectrophotometric techniques for acceptable light reflection levels for qualitative analysis. This study then focuses on using NIR wavelength light at 1550nm, using an InGaAsP laser diode module with optics and corresponding Germanium photodiode detector with a wavelength-matched interference filter, to monitor a stitch line passed by the test apparatus to determine the presence of skipped stitches, or stitches where the top thread and looper thread do not properly catch and hold in the sewing of a seam. Due to the spot size of the manufactured laser diode module, a &#189;? basting stitch, commonly used to temporarily attach fabric pieces, is selected as the best stitch type to use to verify the hypothesis. After determining the ideal positions of the laser diode and photodiode assemblies using geometric optics arguments and extensive position-related intensity measurements, the assembly is mounted onto a linear slide table, and fabric samples, sewn with the &#189;? basting stitch to simulate a seam, are aligned and tested for variations in light levels based on the presence of a stitch or a space. It is then shown that this method for detecting skipped stitches is a viable alternative to the current visual inspection performed by factory employees.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08062002-183215/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feasibility Investigation of Laser Welding Aluminum Alloy 7075-T6 through the use of a 300 W, Single-Mode, Ytterbium Fiber Optic Laser.</field><field name="creator">Paleocrassas, Alexander Grant</field><field name="description">Aluminum alloys are important structural materials because of their high strength to weight ratio. Unfortunately, due to their high reflectivity and complexity in heat treatment, aluminum alloys are some of the hardest metals to be laser welded successfully and very high laser power is usually required. In this study, the feasibility of using a 300 W, Single-Mode, Ytterbium Fiber Optic Laser for aluminum welding is investigated. The objective is to explore an application area with low power and low welding speed. As the fiber laser offers much better beam quality (M2 less than 1.05), the results show that, with proper control of welding parameters, the success of aluminum welding can be achieved at considerably low laser power with minimal formation of typical welding defects (porosity, cracking etc.). However, the focusing becomes highly critical as exceeding a certain power density can lead to defects such as blowholes and porosity. The deepest penetration achieved was just over 1 mm at 300W and 2 mm/sec. Other welding processes achieve about three to four times as much penetration at the expense of seven times more power. Further development of this process can lead to a more efficient use of power.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08062005-173047/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lesbian Texts and Subtexts: [De] Constructing the Lesbian Subject in Charlotte Bront&#1105;?s Villette and Daphne Du Maurier?s Rebecca</field><field name="creator">Swift, Lindley N.</field><field name="description">The conflict between essentialist and constructionist standpoints constitute the primary division between proponents of lesbian literary theory and queer theorists. While essentialists view identity as fixed and innate, constructionists consider identity to be the unstable effect of social conditioning. Lesbian theorists argue that the destabilization of all identity categories, accomplished by queer theory, serves to undermine the importance of ?lesbian? as a political identity. However, the success of queer theorists, such as Judith Butler and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, in challenging the hegemonic power structures that reinforce compulsory heterosexuality should not be underestimated. For the purpose of this thesis, I intend to bridge lesbian studies and queer theory by focusing on what I perceive as their similar aims, primarily the act of reading between the lines of heterosexual narratives. In order to do so, I have chosen to explore Villette by Charlotte Bront&#235; and Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier from these two competing perspectives. I first examine Villette through the lens of lesbian theory in order to rethink binary oppositions, such as private/public and secrecy/disclosure, as they appear in the text to reveal the forbidden and thus transgressive expression of female same-sex desire or lesbianism and its subsequent repression to the metaphorical realm of the closet. I then use queer theory to deconstruct gender and sexuality in Rebecca in the hopes of demonstrating how representations of lesbian desire may serve to subvert naturalized, hegemonic definitions of both.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08062006-165710/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The achievement gap: effects of a resilience-based after school program on indicators of academic achievement</field><field name="creator">Nears, Kennard</field><field name="description">The present study examined the Wake County Super Opportunities with After-School Resources (SOAR) after-school program to determine its effectiveness concerning students? academic success. One thousand two hundred and four SOAR participants, including those students who were asked to attend, but did not, and 18,407 Wake County students who had not attended SOAR participated in the study using their End of Course (EOC) actual and expected scores. It was hypothesized that: (1) students involved with the SOAR after-school program would perform significantly better than students not involved with the program; (2) greater attendance in the SOAR after-school program would produce significant gains in academic achievement; (3) African American students involved in the SOAR program would perform significantly better than African American students in the same school district (Wake County) not involved in SOAR; and (4) African Americans students involved in the SOAR program would perform significantly better than European Americans students in the same school district (Wake County) not involved in SOAR. All hypotheses were supported. Participants in the SOAR program significantly outperformed students not involved in the program or attended once; students who attended ten or more times in the SOAR program significantly outperformed students who attended less than ten times. African Americans in the SOAR program who attended ten or more times, significantly outperformed European Americans in the SOAR program who attended ten or more times and African Americans and European Americans in Wake County not involved in SOAR. African Americans in SOAR did not outperform European Americans participating in SOAR when the entire sample was analyzed. This suggests that the group affect was greater for African Americans. The present study provides evidence that a well-designed after-school program, which focuses on increasing students? resiliency by building their academic skills, their sense of belonging, their sense of usefulness, and their personal potency can close the achievement gap between African Americans and European Americans and can yield positive results for all students involved in the after-school program.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Counselor Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08062007-152049/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Salinity Regulation of Prolactin Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis in the Euryhaline Teleost, the Tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus).</field><field name="creator">Strom, Chrisitna Nelson</field><field name="description">The euryhaline tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, has the ability to live in both freshwater (FW) and saltwater (SW) environments. Prolactin (PRL) is the most critical hormone to promoting life in FW, and without it tilapia loses the capacity to osmoregulate in hypotonic environments. Consistent with PRL&#226;s actions in FW adaptation, pituitary PRL synthesis, content, secretion, and cell activity are all elevated in FW compared to SW acclimated tilapia We found that the PRL region of a FW tilapia pituitary has a 3-fold larger volume than the PRL region of a SW pituitary. It is unclear whether this increased tissue volume is due to larger cells (hypertrophy) or more cells (hyperplasia). Therefore, we evaluated if PRL cell proliferation and apoptosis might be sensitive to salinity and could account for the greater abundance of PRL in FW versus SW fish. Freshwater tilapia were transferred to either SW or sham transferred to FW and SW fish were moved to either FW or SW over a time course of 7 days. Pituitaries were sampled over the course of salinity challenge and triple stained for determination of lactotroph cell density (nuclei staining with Hoescht dye), proliferation (BrdU labeling) and apoptosis (TUNEL assay). Lactotrophs were identified by immunostaining using tilapia specific PRL antisera. Lactotroph cell densities were 40% lower in FW than SW fish and declined when fish were transferred from SW to FW (P &lt; 0.001). The larger volume of the PRL cell region within the pituitary area combined with lower number of lactotrophs per unit area suggests that the cells are larger in FW than SW acclimated fish. There were negligible levels of apoptosis in lactotrophs and salinity was ineffective in regulating programmed cell death. By contrast, we found a dramatic effect of salinity on lactotroph cell proliferation. The pituitaries of FW tilapia show a higher rate of PRL cell proliferation than those of SW fish. During transfer from SW to FW proliferation increased by almost 20-fold compared with controls (P &lt; 0.001). When fish were transferred from FW to SW, proliferation declined within 1 day to levels observed in sham transferred SW fish. The enhanced proliferation combined with increased volume of the pituitary PRL cell region, decline in lactotroph cell density, and presumed increase in cell volume, suggests that the tilapia lactotroph undergoes hypertrophy and hyperplasia in FW environments. Apoptosis appears to play little role in regulating lactotroph density under different salinities. Overall, these results suggest that the elevated production and content of PRL critical to life in FW is mediated, in part, through enhanced lactotroph proliferation and hypertrophy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08062008-095001/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biomarkers of Lead Exposure in the Freshwater Mussel Elliptio complanata For Assessing Transportation Related Impacts</field><field name="creator">Mosher, Shad</field><field name="description">The first phase of this study involved examination of lead (Pb) concentrations in adult Eastern elliptio (Elliptio complanata) mussel tissue and sediment at 40 sites throughout North Carolina, ranging in average daily traffic count, land-use patterns and watershed characteristics. Data from these sites revealed an increased Pb concentration of about 2 &#206;&#188;g/g in sediment downstream of bridge crossings compared to upstream for high traffic areas of &gt;20,000 vehicle crossings/day (vc/d), as well as a significantly greater average Pb concentration in mussels from sites with traffic count &gt;500 vc/d compared to sites with &lt;500 vc/d. Two 28-d toxicity tests with Pb and adult Eastern elliptio mussels were conducted in the second phase of the study to compare the field-derived Pb bioaccumulation data and to examine sublethal biomarkers of Pb exposure and toxicity. Endpoints for the tests included mussel survival, metal accumulation, shell length and weight. For the first test, &#206;&#180;-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) inhibition was assessed as a biomarker of exposure and effect in mussel hemolymph. In the second test, Na+,K+-ATPase activity in mussel gill tissue was examined as a biomarker of exposure and effect, along with measurements of hemolymph ion concentrations. Pb was measured in mussel hemolymph in both tests at near-exposure levels, and at the greatest exposure concentration in the first test (396 &#206;&#188;g/L), the hemolymph Pb concentration was 4.5 times the amount present in test water. In contrast, the greatest exposure concentration in the second test (458 &#206;&#188;g/L), had hemolymph concentrations only 0.12 times the amount present in test water. This finding suggested a threshold effect concentration for Pb exposure and hemolymph concentrations. The average Pb concentration in mussel tissue was strongly correlated with Pb exposure concentration (R&#194;&#178;= 0.99) at day 28 for both tests. The enzyme ALAD was not present in measurable concentrations in freshwater mussel hemolymph, gill or mantle tissue. The Na+,K+-ATPase activity was found to be a strong biomarker of Pb exposure in freshwater mussel gill tissue (~50% of total ATPase) using a K-free salt solution for detection, and was found to be negatively correlated with average tissue Pb concentration (R2 = 0.85) on day 28. Pb accumulated rapidly in mussel tissue during the first two weeks of the second exposure, with lesser accumulation during the final two weeks, with only the 121 &#194;&#181;g/L treatment group changing significantly. Because Pb was being removed from the test water throughout the duration of exposure, I conclude that the mussels were approaching equilibrium with the aqueous environment and were eliminating the Pb in lysosomes and granulocytes through pseudo-feces. Although the major contribution of Pb to the environment from now-banned leaded gasoline is still evident in North Carolina, the concentrations measured in mussel tissue and sediment were not at levels which would cause immediate or short-term reductions in Eastern elliptio populations. Moreover, the sub-lethal effects of Pb on Na+,K+-ATPase activity, although a strong biomarker of exposure, appear not to be significantly effected at environmentally relevant concentrations of Pb. However, other species of freshwater mussels may be more sensitive to Pb contamination and further assessment is needed to verify the role Pb may be having in the overall declines in mussel species diversity being observed worldwide.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toxicology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08062008-130313/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Genetics of Phenotypic Variation in Arabidopsis thaliana</field><field name="creator">Ehrenreich, Ian Michael</field><field name="description">All organisms exhibit substantial quantitative trait variation within populations. Such variation is important because it can affect fitness and serve as the substrate for adaptive evolution. Identifying the quantitative trait genes (QTGs) responsible for phenotypic variation is necessary to understand the mechanisms that generate trait variation and to determine the historical action of natural selection on quantitative traits and QTGs. However, in most complex organisms, the genetic mapping of QTGs is difficult and presently not feasible to do systematically at a gene-level resolution. Model organisms that are both tractable in the laboratory and complex developmentally can serve as trial systems for developing broadly applicable methods for QTG mapping. Using the plant genetic model Arabidopsis thaliana, I have attempted to map QTGs for ecologically-significant quantitative traits &#226; shoot branching and flowering time &#226; through a combination of forward and reverse genetic methods. Three main research projects are reported here: i) candidate gene association mapping and linkage mapping of shoot branching; ii) regulatory network-wide candidate gene association mapping of flowering time; and iii) a survey of intra- and interspecific genetic variation at nearly half of the microRNAs (miRNAs) and their binding sites in the genome. These studies have identified strong candidate QTGs for traits that are determinants of A. thaliana fitness in the wild.

A new method has been adopted to generate 3-D geometry for modeling fibrous porous structures using ANSYS&#194;&#174; Parametric Design Language (APDL). Computation fluid dynamics has been used to simulate permeability of modeled 3-D fiberweb structures. The simulated permeability results are in good agreement with the models proposed by other authors. The experimental results were found to be slightly higher compared to simulated results and existing models due to the layered configuration of the samples. Permeability is found to be significantly influenced by fiber diameter, and porosity as well as fiberweb thickness. The relationship between air permeability and fiberweb thickness has been used to develop an indirect method for determination of tortuosity factor. Tortuosity factor has also been determined using a more direct method involving CFD simulation and Particle Tracking analysis. Different models established using the direct and indirect methods of determination show that tortuosity is significantly influenced by porosity, fiber diameter and fiberweb thickness, whereas the models available in the literature express tortuosity as a function of porosity only.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiber and Polymer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08062009-153236/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct bonding of gallium nitride to silicon carbide: physical, and electrical characterization</field><field name="creator">Lee, Jaeseob</field><field name="description">The direct bonding method is applied to the GaN/SiC system, and the processing conditions for successful direct bonding are clarified. Direct bonding of GaN/SiC is achieved at 900&#161;&#198;C. The direct bonding of GaN to Si-face SiC is very dependent on the choice of chemical treatments, but the bonding of GaN to C-face SiC is less dependent on surface preparation. If a native oxide is present when the bonded interface is prepared, the current through the interface is decreased, which is attributed to an energy barrier due to the presence of charged interface states. TEM images indicate 10nm spaced dislocations at the interface for the GaN/SiC (Si-face), and ~6nm for the GaN/SiC (C-face), which form to accommodate the lattice mismatch (3.4%) and twist (1~2&#161;&#198;) and tilt misfit (0.2&#161;&#198; for Si-face SiC and 3&#161;&#198; for C-face SiC). In some regions (~30%) an amorphous oxide layer forms at the interface, which is attributed to inadequate surface preparation prior to bonding. The strain of the GaN film with a Ga/C interface was ~0.1%, tensile strain, and that of GaN with a Ga/Si interface was ~0.2%, tensile strain.

Traditionally, access control policies have been specified in an ad-hoc manner, leaving systems vulnerable to security breaches. ACP specification is often isolated from requirements analysis, resulting in policies that are not in compliance with system requirements. This dissertation introduces the Requirements-based Access Control Analysis and Policy Specification (ReCAPS) method for deriving access control policies from various sources, including software requirements specifications (SRS), software designs, and high-level security/privacy policies. The ReCAPS method is essentially an analysis method supported by a set of heuristics and a software tool: the Security and Privacy Requirements Analysis Tool (SPRAT). The method was developed in two formative case studies and validated in two summative case studies. All four case studies involved operational systems, and ReCAPS evolved as a result of the lessons learned from applying the method to these case studies. Further validation of the method was performed via an empirical study to evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of the approach. Results from these evaluations indicate that the process and heuristics provided by the ReCAPS method are useful for specifying database-level and application-level ACPs. Additionally, ReCAPS integrates policy specification into software development, thus providing a basic framework for ensuring compliance between different levels of policies, system requirements and software design. The method also improves the quality of requirements specifications and system designs by clarifying ambiguities and resolving conflicts across these artifacts.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08072005-113622/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genomic Characterization of Two Models of Obesity in Mice: Divergent Selection for Epididymal Fat and the Effects of &lt;I&gt;trans&lt;/I&gt;-10, &lt;I&gt;cis&lt;/I&gt;-12-Conjugated Linoleic Acid</field><field name="creator">Ceddia, Ryan Patrick</field><field name="description">Obesity is rapidly becoming a major problem in the United States and throughout the world. Polygenic models of obesity are most similar to human obesity because few humans are genetically obese due to a mutation in a single gene. Numerous studies have selected mice for body size and growth rate as models for selection of agriculturally important species. One series of selection experiments produced lines of mice having differing epididymal fat (EF) masses but similar body weights. These mice may be used as a model for adipose deposition without confounding the effects of body weight. One method of studying these mice is to examine gene expression. Expression of thousands of genes can be investigated at one time using microarrays. We used microarrays and real-time RT-PCR to compare gene expression between the high epididymal (HE) and low fat (LF) lines of mice, which have dissimilar EF mass but similar body weights. Microarray analysis identified 19 genes with differential expression between the HE and LF lines of mice with 5 of these genes differentially expressed in both liver and EF tissues. We found differential regulation of genes known to play a role in glucose uptake and lipid metabolism. In addition, we identified a differentially expressed gene, &lt;I&gt;solute carrier family 22 member 4&lt;/I&gt;, located within the confidence interval of a quantitative trait loci associated with EF mass, making it a positional candidate. Furthermore, we identified a linked group of three genes (&lt;I&gt;Sortilin 1&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;guanine nucleotide binding protein alpha inhibiting 3&lt;/I&gt;, and &lt;I&gt;selenium-binding protein 2&lt;/I&gt;) on &lt;I&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/I&gt; chromosome 3 (MMU3), which may represent a genomic ?hot spot? for genes associated with EF mass. In this study, differential expression of several genes not previously associated with obesity or adipose deposition were identified and may represent new targets for further research. Another aspect of obesity currently being investigated is anti-obesity compounds. One such compound is &lt;I&gt;trans&lt;/I&gt;-10, &lt;I&gt;cis&lt;/I&gt;-12-conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). CLA has been reported to reduce body weight and adipose mass in many species. Numerous studies have reported an increase in size, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and fatty acid synthesis in liver of CLA fed mice. The livers of CLA fed mice gain mass due to lipid accumulation; however, the precise molecular mechanisms are unknown. To elucidate these mechanisms, we examined the fatty acid composition, histology, and gene expression profile of liver from a polygenic obese line of mice fed CLA. Using a Periodic acid-Schiff stain, histological evidence suggests that glycogen content is unchanged in the liver of the CLA fed mouse implying that hepatic cytoplasmic vacuolization is due to increased lipid content. Microarray analysis identified 1393 genes differentially expressed at a nominal P-value of 0.01. Following Bonferroni correction and excluding lowly expressed transcripts, 198 genes were identified as being differentially expressed with 17 genes having &#8805;2 fold change. Real-time RT-PCR showed up regulation of &lt;I&gt;acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 2&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2&lt;/I&gt; in CLA fed mice, both necessary for triglyceride biosynthesis. Expression of &lt;I&gt;B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 6&lt;/I&gt;, a nuclear transcriptional repressor, and &lt;I&gt;signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B&lt;/I&gt;, a transcription factor, were shown to be greater in the liver of CLA fed mice. Both genes are associated with immunoregulation. Comparing real-time RT-PCR to microarray data suggest a Bonferroni correction to microarray data is necessary in order to eliminate false positive data. Further verification of microarray results is needed to validate microarray data after a Bonferroni correction.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08072007-120016/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematic Analysis of Crosstalk in the PDGF Receptor Signal Transduction Network</field><field name="creator">Wang, Chun-Chao</field><field name="description">Intracellular signal transduction is traditionally characterized in terms of pathways, comprised of serial activation processes. Although it is appreciated that canonical signaling pathways are simply dominant routes of regulation embedded in larger interaction networks, relatively little has been done to quantify pathway crosstalk in such networks. Through quantitative measurements that systematically canvas an array of stimulation and molecular perturbation conditions, together with computational modeling and analysis, we have elucidated crosstalk mechanisms in the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor signaling network, in which phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathways are prominently activated. We show that, while PI3K signaling is insulated from crosstalk, PI3K enhances Erk activation in multiple ways. Whereas simultaneously blocking Ras and PI3K abolishes PDGF-stimulated Erk phosphorylation, each pathway makes an independent contribution to Erk activation, and PI3K affects Ras activation as well. The magnitudes of these effects depend strongly on the stimulation conditions, subject to saturation effects in the respective pathways and negative feedback loops. Motivated by those dynamics, a kinetic model of the network was formulated and used to precisely quantify the relative contributions of PI3K-dependent and -independent modes of Ras/Erk activation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08072008-162743/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental Investigations in 15 Centimeter Class Pulsejet Engines</field><field name="creator">Schoen, Michael Alexander</field><field name="description">Testing is performed on the 15 centimeter class pulsejet engine in order to develop, study, and explore the operational characteristics. Valved and valveless operation, hydrogen and propane fuels, various fuel injection methods, and a range of geometric configurations are investigated for operational feasibility. The scaling capabilities of a valveless 15 centimeter class pulsejet of conventional design are studied by methodically varying inlet length, exit length, exit geometry, and inlet area to combustor area ratio (Ai/Ac). Engine performance is defined by measuring chamber pressure, internal gas temperatures, time-resolved thrust, operational frequency, and fuel flow rate. The scaling capability is characterized by the success of self-sustained combustion for each corresponding geometric configuration. Tail pipe length is found to be a function of valveless inlet length and may be further minimized by the addition of a diverging exit nozzle. Chemical kinetic times and Ai/Ac prove to be the two prominent controlling parameters in determining scaling behavior.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08082005-095911/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Predictability of Simulation Models using Evolutionary Computation-Based Methods for Model Error Correction</field><field name="creator">Zechman, Emily Michelle</field><field name="description">Simulation models are important tools for managing water resources systems. An optimization method coupled with a simulation model can be used to identify effective decisions to efficiently manage a system. The value of a model in decision-making is degraded when that model is not able to accurately predict system response for new management decisions. Typically, calibration is used to improve the predictability of models to match more closely the system observations. Calibration is limited as it can only correct parameter error in a model. Models may also contain structural errors that arise from mis-specification of model equations. This research develops and presents a new model error correction procedure (MECP) to improve the predictive capabilities of a simulation model. MECP is able to simultaneously correct parameter error and structural error through the identification of suitable parameter values and a function to correct misspecifications in model equations. An evolutionary computation (EC)-based implementation of MECP builds upon and extends existing evolutionary algorithms to simultaneously conduct numeric and symbolic searches for the parameter values and the function, respectively. Non-uniqueness is an inherent issue in such system identification problems. One approach for addressing non-uniqueness is through the generation of a set of alternative solutions. EC-based techniques to generate alternative solutions for numeric and symbolic search problems are not readily available. New EC-based methods to generate alternatives for numeric and symbolic search problems are developed and investigated in this research. The alternatives generation procedures are then coupled with the model error correction procedure to improve the predictive capability of simulation models and to address the non-uniqueness issue. The methods developed in this research are tested and demonstrated for an array of illustrative applications.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08082005-105133/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Race, Gender, and Bullying Behavior: The role of perceived stereotypes</field><field name="creator">Farrar, Brandy Deneen</field><field name="description">In recent years, bullying among middle-school youth and adolescents has become a serious problem in American schools (Nansel et al. 2001). Researchers from a variety of different disciplines attempt to identify factors associated with bullying in order to develop effective intervention programs. However, many findings in relation to race, gender, and bullying are largely inconclusive. The present study employs a social constructionist framework to understand race and gender differences in adolescent bullying. Specifically, I explore how the meanings associated with race and gender in the form of popular stereotypes influence bullying behavior. The findings reported here are from the Gender and Middle School study conducted among 535 adolescents attending middle school in the southeast. The results of the analyses show significant relationships between race, gender, and bullying. Black students (compared to white and other minority) and male students (compared to female) reported higher frequencies of bullying. Further, perceiving that others stereotype you increases the frequency of participating in bullying behavior and explains the relationship between race and bullying. Lastly, the stereotype influence is greater for black males in the study than the effect for white males. These findings have implications for education officials as well as theory on the influence of stereotypes on adolescent behavior.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08082006-143628/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feed Intake Patterns in Crossbred Pigs and their Relationship to Production Traits</field><field name="creator">Lanier, Christian Lynn</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to evaluate line and sex differences in swine feeding behavior traits.

Feeding behavior traits considered were average daily feed intake (ADFI), average occupation time/day (AOTD), average feed intake/visit (AFIV), average number of visits/day (ANVD), average feeding rate/visit (AFRV), average occupation time/visit (AOTV), and residual average daily feed intake (RADFI). Electronic feeders were used to measure feeding behavior traits on two pens per feeder. Use of the feeder alternated between the two pens weekly. Feeding behavior traits differed by line and sex. Production traits that were used in the study included: average daily gain (ADG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), backfat (BF), loin depth (LD), percent lean (% LEAN), and average daily feed intake (ADFI). For this study, ADFI was treated as both a feeding behavior and performance trait. Feeding behavior traits were used to calculate principal components. Principal components were then treated as traits in terms of statistical analysis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08082006-232135/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simple Molecule Mercury Sensor</field><field name="creator">Wan, Yanjun</field><field name="description">Several molecules previously produced from a nitrile-based cascade cyclization were examined as potential mercury sensors.

In this situation, new surface-driven phases can appear, and phase transitions typical of bulk systems (gas-liquid, freezing) can be shifted to different conditions. A fundamental understanding of these phenomena is necessary for applications in separations, catalysis and nanotechnology. Studies of these phenomena can also provide important insights on the effect of surface forces, confinement and reduced dimensionality on the phase behavior of host molecules. We have performed two independent, but directly related studies: (1) freezing of carbon tetrachloride within multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) of different diameters, and (2) capillary condensation and freezing of krypton within templated mesoporous silica materials (MCM-41). MWCNT and MCM-41 are representative of materials with strongly and weakly attractive walls, respectively. In the first part of this project, the structure and thermodynamic stability of the confined phases, as well as the temperatures and the order of the phase transitions were determined using dielectric relaxation spectroscopy measurements and Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. A rich phase behavior with multiple transition temperatures was observed for such systems. In the second part of this project we developed realistic, atomistic models of MCM-41 type materials that include pore surface roughness and morphological defects in agreement with experimental results. Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations show that these variables have a profound influence on gas-liquid and freezing transitions in confinement.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08092005-232433/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying local creation and regional transport using a hierarchical space-time model of ozone as a function of observed NOx, a latent space-time VOC process, emissions, and meteorology</field><field name="creator">Nail, Amy Jeanette</field><field name="description">We explore the ability of a space-time model to decompose the 8-hour ozone concentration on a given day at a given site into the parts attributable to local emissions and regional transport, and ultimately to assess the efficacy of past and future emission control programs. We model ozone as created plus transported ozone plus an error term that has a seasonally varying spatial covariance. The created component uses atmospheric chemistry results to express ozone created on a given day at a given site as a function of the observed NOx concentration, the latent VOC concentration, and temperature. The ozone transported to a given day at a given site is expressed as a weighted average of the ozone observed at all sites on the previous day, where the weights are a function of wind speed and direction that appropriately distribute weight across redundant information. The latent VOC process model has a mean trend that includes emissions from various source types, temperature, a workday indicator variable, and an error term that has a seasonally varying spatial covariance. We fit the model using likelihood methods, and we compare our predictions to observations from a withheld dataset and to those predictions of CMAQ, the deterministic model used by EPA to assess emission control programs. We find that the model predictions based on the mean trend and the random deviations from this mean outperform CMAQ predictions according to multiple criteria, but predictions based on the mean trend alone underperform CMAQ predictions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08092007-123658/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of a Low Pressure UV reactor under Multiple Upstream Elbow Configurations using UV Sensitive Fluorescent Microspheres</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Xi</field><field name="description">Upstream piping configuration has been known to impact the UV reactor validation using biodosimetry tests. However, the influence of upstream configuration on the UV dose distribution has not been experimentally investigated. This research was performed to evaluate the UV reactor dose distribution under multiple upstream configurations using UV sensitive fluorescent microspheres. The upstream hydraulics configurations included two kinds of 90- degree bends and one straight pipe configuration. Experimental tests were performed at 51 gpm flow rate, 91% UV transmittance (UVT) on a single lamp low-pressure high-output (LPHO) UV reactor. The UV irradiation kinetics of the photo-chemically active fluorescent microspheres was performed with bench-scale collimated beam experiments. The correlation with microspheres fluorescence intensity distribution to UV fluence distribution was achieved by a statistical process involving Bayesian and Markov chain Monte Carlo integration technique. The results of this study showed that the straight pipe configuration produced a shift in UV fluence distribution to a higher UV fluence range compared to the two elbow configurations. No significant difference was formed between the two elbow configurations. The fluorescent microspheres Bayesian method can serve as an additional test to the traditional biodosimetry for UV reactor validation by providing sensitivity in detecting design parameter change and added confidence in the results by providing unbiased UV dose behavior.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08092007-131823/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Residence Time Distribution of Multiple Particles in Four Configurations of Holding Tubes</field><field name="creator">TANYEL, ZEYNEP</field><field name="description">Residence time distributions of multiple particles (as affected by process and system parameters) were investigated during non-Newtonian tube flow. Process parameters included flow rate, particle type, carrier fluid viscosity, and particle concentration. The system parameter of interest was the holding tube configuration. Polystyrene and acrylic particles were used as model food particles. Digital imaging analysis was used to obtain residence time data of particles. A novel type of holding tube (chaotic holding tube) was constructed. Comparisons among the straight, single helical, double helical, and chaotic holding tube were performed in terms residence time distribution (RTD) of particles. In addition, the effect of inclination angle (0 &#186; and 45 &#186;) of the chaotic holding tube was investigated. It was found that the narrowest RTD of particles was obtained in the single helical holding tube. RTstd in the chaotic holding tube was greater than that in the single helical holding tube, but lower than those in the straight and double helical holding tubes. The most significant process parameter affecting RTD was flow rate. The effect of flow rate was more pronounced for high density (acrylic) particles. Carrier fluid viscosity, particle type, and particle concentration did not have significant effects on the overall RTstd. Trends observed in the chaotic holding tube were similar to those observed in the single helical holding tube. However, there were some cases where use of chaotic holding tube resulted in narrower RTD of particles. Changing the inclination angle from 0 &#186; to 45 &#186; in the chaotic holding tube resulted in wider RTD of both types of particles.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08102004-124311/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Assessment of Ammonia Emissions from Water-holding Structures for Hog Farms: Lagoon and Spray Technology and Potential Environmentally Superior Technologies</field><field name="creator">Rumsey, Ian Cooper</field><field name="description">Globally, the largest source of atmospheric NH3 is domestic animal waste contributing 20-35 Tg of nitrogen per year. In North Carolina, hog waste accounts for 47% of all ammonia emissions in North Carolina. This is the result of a huge increase in hog population since the 1980?s from 3 million to 10 million. Currently swine waste is managed using Lagoon and Spray Technology (LST) also known as ?conventional? technology. A LST uses anaerobic lagoons to store the hog waste, and effluent from lagoons is sprayed on surrounding crops as a source of nutrients. This technology lead to a number sources of ammonia emissions, thus there are a number of environmental problems associated with swine facilities. The need for developing sustainable solutions for managing the hog waste problem is critical for shaping the future of hog farms in North Carolina. As a result of this, an agreement between the North Carolina Attorney General and several farming companies was reached to develop environmentally superior technologies (EST?s) for swine facilities. The objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the emissions from the water-holding structures at the two LST farms (Moore farm and Stokes farm) and the three EST farms, and to evaluate the effectiveness of each technology. The three potential EST?s were (1) EKOKAN: Up-flow Bio-filtration system, located at Brown?s of Carolina # 93, (2) BEST: Solids separation/gasification for energy and ash recovery centralized system, located at Corbett # 1,3,4 farms, and (3) Super Soils: Solids separation/nitrification-denitrification/soluble phosphorus removal/solids processing system, located at Goshen Ridge farm. Measurements of NH3 flux were limited to two, two-week long periods, representing warm and cold seasons. These were obtained by using a dynamic flow-through chamber system interfaced to a mobile laboratory containing the ammonia analyzer and the data acquisition system. During the sampling period, environmental parameters such as lagoon temperature, lagoon pH, and TAN were measured, as well as meteorological parameters such as wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation. In order to make a comparison of LST and EST?s, an adjustment for differing environmental conditions was needed. This was achieved by the development of a conventional observational statistical model, which was developed by multiple linear regression analysis based on continuous flux measurements from two conventional farms during a warm and cold season. Ammonia emissions from both conventional and EST farms were normalized to the nitrogen excretion (E) at the hog farms to express the emissions as % E. Potential reductions in ammonia were evaluated by comparing % EEST at EST farms with %ECONV at conventional farms. Overall, all three EST?s were found to be significant in reducing ammonia emissions. Super Soils was found to be the most effective, with NH3 emission reductions of 94.7% in the warm season, and 99% in the cold season. EKOKAN was found to be the next most effective, with reductions of 71.7 % and 42.7 % for the summer and spring sampling periods, respectively. The two BEST technologies were the least effective. There were large reductions for both Corbett # 1 and Corbett # 3,4 in the fall sampling period, 71.1% and 39.6% respectively. There were through extremely low reductions in the winter sampling period, with reductions of 13.6% for Corbett # 1 and 7.5% for Corbett # 3,4, respectively.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08102004-162005/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spectroscopic Study of the Interface Chemical and Electronic Properties of High-&#234; Gate Stacks</field><field name="creator">Fulton, Charles Clifton</field><field name="description">X-ray and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy has been combined with in-situ deposition to study the interface chemistry and electronic structure of potential high-&#234; gate stack materials. In addressing the interface stability of ZrO2 with respect to a Si substrate three issues are considered: 1) the development of the band offsets and electronic structure during the low temperature (T&lt;300&#176;C) growth processes, 2) variations in the band structure as effected by process conditions and annealing (T&lt;700&#176;C) and 3) the interface stability of Zr oxide films at high temperatures (T&gt;700&#176;C). To further explore low temperature effects, titanium, zirconium and hafnium oxides were deposited on ultra-thin (~0.5 nm) SiO2 buffer layers and metastable states have been identified which give rise to large changes in the band alignments with respect to the Si substrate. Also discussed is the band edge electronic structure of 1) nanocrystalline Zr, Hf and complex oxide high-&#234; dielectrics, and 2) non-crystalline Zr and Hf silicates and Si oxynitride alloys. Three issues are highlighted: Jahn-Teller term-splittings that remove band edge d-state degeneracies in nanocrystalline films, intrinsic bonding defects in ZrO2 and HfO2, and chemical phase separation and crystallinity in Zr and Hf silicate and Si oxynitride alloys. Finally, photoemission spectroscopy has been used to characterize a candidate gate stack including electron affinities and work functions, valence band maxima, band bending in the Si and fields in the oxide layers. The band offsets are constructed and the deviation from the Schottky-Mott (or electron affinity) model at each interface is discussed in terms of interface bonding and the resultant charge transfer.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08102005-081639/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Organic Acids on Escherichia coli O157:H7 Independent of pH under Acidified Food Conditions</field><field name="creator">Bjornsdottir, Kristin</field><field name="description">Outbreaks of illness caused by acid-tolerant bacterial pathogens in acid foods have raised questions about the safety of acidified foods. However, acidified foods have an excellent safety record which is in part due to the presence of organic acids. The objective of this research was to (1) a develop method that allowed rapid comparison of test acids on E. coli, (2) measure the effectiveness of acetic, malic, citric, and lactic acids to kill Escherichia coli O157:H7 independent of pH effects and (3) examine the mechanism of protection of D-lactic acid and on E. coli O157:H7. Gluconic acid (20 mM), which has been shown to be non-inhibitory to E. coli, was used to buffer solutions with 0 mM to 420 mM fully protonated concentrations of the test acids at various pH?s and temperatures, with ionic strength adjusted to 0.60-0.68. The effect of anaerobic incubation during acid challenges was examined. We found that using the 96 well microplate and determining viability by plating before and after acid challenge was consistent reproducible and efficient method which allowed us to evaluate up to 96 solution simultaneously. Compared to pH, acetic, malic, pyruvate, and particularly D-lactic acids had a significant protective effect on E. coli O157:H7 at low (1?20 mM) protonated acid concentrations. Citric acid was not found to exhibit any protective effect at similar concentrations. At higher concentrations L-lactic acid was the most lethal acid followed by acetic, citric and malic acids which had about equal degree of lethality against the O157:H7 strains. To our knowledge this is the first time organic acids have been observed to have a protective effect on pathogenic bacteria. D-lactic acid and pyruvate protected cells against 40 mM protonated acetic acid which has previously shown to reduce cells beyond detection during the acid challenge. These acids may protect the cells by inactivation of reactive oxygen radical species. These results showed that oxygen may play a major role in the effect of organic acids on E. coli O157:H7. It is important to understand the mechanism of this protective effect to be able to assure safety of acid and acidified foods. Additional research will be needed to understand acid specific effects on the survival of E. coli O157:H7 and other acid-resistant food pathogens in acid and acidified foods. In order to reliably and efficiently eliminate acid tolerant pathogens from acid and acidified foods we should have a clear understanding of the environmental factors that affect killing of these microorganisms. Thus, the role of oxygen during acid challenge studies must be determined to assure the safety of acid and acidified products.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08102005-144150/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Medium Access Control on the Capacity of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks</field><field name="creator">Xia, Heng</field><field name="description">As various wireless networks evolves into the next generation to provide better services, a key technology, mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), has emerged recently. The dynamic topology, multi-hop transmission, and the nature of wireless channels create many challenging research topics in the area of MANETs. Recently, there has been work on determining the capacity of MANETs. The effects of some factors, such as node mobility, number of nodes, and transmission range, on the capacity of MANETs have been considered. In this work, we define and investigate the capacity of MANETs, considering the effects of medium access control (MAC). Since all the nodes in MANETs use a single or multiple channels to communicate, MAC plays an important role in coordinating channel access among nodes so that information gets through from one node to another. The MAC affects the capacity of MANETs in two aspects: collisions and spatial reuse. Three basic mechanisms are adopted to eliminate the incidence of collisions and maximize spatial reuse, i.e., carrier sense, handshake, and back-off. We define and use persistent probability, sensing range and back-off time to represent the effect of these mechanisms. The characteristics of MAC are thoroughly examined and an analytical solution for capacity evaluation is proposed. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effects of MAC, including carrier sense, handshake and back-off mechanism on the capacity of MANETs in terms of persistent probability, sensing range, and back-off time.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08102005-235639/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining Plant-Available Nitrogen in Hog Anaerobic Lagoon Effluent Applied with Traveling Gun and Drag Hose Systems</field><field name="creator">Balla, Biswa Kumar</field><field name="description">Currently, the plant-available nitrogen (PAN) coefficient of hog anaerobic lagoon effluent does not differentiate for land application by broadcast (e.g. drag hose) or irrigation (e.g. traveling gun). There is a need to determine PAN coefficients for traveling gun and drag hose by measuring ammonia (NH3) emissions, and accounting for partial nitrogen (N) mineralization. Ammonia emissions were measured for four application periods (fall, spring, 2 summer) with the integrated horizontal flux (IHF) method on Bermudagrass grown on Cainhoy sand in Garland, NC. Ammonia concentration was measured using acid scrubbers. Nitrogen mineralization was estimated based on published literature. During application by traveling gun 3 to 9% of applied-N was lost as NH3 before it hit the ground (soil or canopy surface). Total NH3 emission from the ground ranged from 13 to 26% of applied-N, 96 h after start of the application. The first 4 h accounted for 65 to 81% of the NH3 emission. The N loss during application (in the trajectory) ranged from 4 to 11%. Due to uncertainties in the NH3 emission measurement, additional studies are needed with improved methods to account for losses in the trajectory and subsequent mist formation during application. Ammonia-N emission using the drag hose, ranged from 1 to 5%. Based on literature, the organic-N mineralization rate was assumed to be 50%. The PAN, thus obtained, was 0.65 for traveling gun, and 0.85 for drag hose. A model was used to simulate NH3 emission from hog lagoon effluent applied with both the traveling gun and drag hose. The model underestimated NH3 emission from traveling gun treated plot for all four periods. The model overestimated emissions from drag hose treated plot in two of the three periods. The model was sensitive to increase in soil pH and moderately sensitive to changes in all other selected parameters (total ammoniacal-N concentration and pH of effluent, linear partition coefficient of soil, and wind speed).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological and Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08102007-042235/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Confinement on Chemical Reactions</field><field name="creator">Santiso, Erik Emilio</field><field name="description">The goal of this project is to gain a fundamental understanding of the different factors that influence chemical reactions in confinement through the systematic study of simple model systems. For this purpose, we consider three different examples: (1) The rotational isomerization of small hydrocarbons in carbon nanopores, showing the impact of the steric hindrance imposed by the confining material on the reacting system; (2) The unimolecular decomposition of formaldehyde on carbon pores, as an example of the effect of physical interactions on a reaction?s mechanism and equilibrium; and (3) The thermal splitting of water over defective graphene and nanotube surfaces, showing how chemical interactions with a catalytic substrate can completely modify the chemical landscape and hence the equilibrium and dynamics of the system. Our main findings from these studies are: (1) In the molecular sieving limit, the steric hindrance imposed by the pore walls can cause dramatic changes in the potential energy surface of a reaction, with the rate varying as the double exponential of the pore dimensions; (2) Physical interactions with a catalytic support can alter both the thermodynamic properties of the confined molecules and the reaction dynamics, the latter being especially important in reactions with relatively low activation barriers; (3) Chemical modification of a carbon substrate can give rise to completely different reaction mechanisms, which could be exploited in the systematic molecular-level design of improved catalytic materials.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08102007-145433/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental Investigations of Mini-Pulsejet Engines</field><field name="creator">Kiker, Adam Paul</field><field name="description">An experimental 8 cm pulsejet was developed using scaling laws from research on both 50 and 15 cm pulsejets. The 8 cm jet operates in three different inlet configurations?conventional, perpendicular, and rearward. The rearward configuration features inlets facing in the opposite direction of the flight path and develops the maximum net thrust. Using a high frequency pressure transducer, the operational frequency of the pulsejet was obtained by monitoring the combustion chamber pressure. It was found that in the rearward configuration, the operational frequency of the jet decreases with increasing inlet length. In addition, the combustion chamber peak pressure rise per cycle increases significantly if the exhaust diameter is reduced.

Although methods have been suggested to measure certain physical properties of fabrics (mass, handle, strength, comfort, permeability), there has been no single method that is industrially accepted to characterize and quantify distribution of some of these fabric properties or non-uniformities. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to investigate and suggest a new method to fill this need. During this research, data about fabric properties were obtained either directly from images of fabric appearances or indirectly from on-line measurements of yarn diameters. The yarn diameters captured through a line-scan camera were mapped into a 2-D fabric matrix by assigning each point of the yarn to a specific location (x, y) within the 2-D fabric matrix. The gray-scale image of a 2-D fabric matrix was called a virtual fabric and provided the basic information on the uniformity of the fabric property. Variance-area curves were developed to characterize and quantify non-uniformity of actual and virtual fabrics in two dimensions. Certain irregularity features such as vertical and horizontal streaks and random cloudiness produced variance-area curves that are dependent on the shape of the unit area. Thus the difference between these curves became a new way to measure isotropy features of fabric properties. Theoretical relationships between yarns and their virtual fabrics were derived using only the internal correlation information of the given underlying yarns</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiber and Polymer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08112005-165814/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust Estimation via Measurement Error Modeling</field><field name="creator">Wang, Qiong</field><field name="description">We introduce a new method to robustifying inference that can be applied in any situation where a parametric likelihood is available. The key feature is that data from the postulated parametric models are assumed to be measured with error where the measurement error distribution is chosen to produce the occasional gross errors found in data. We show that the tails of the error-contamination model control the properties (boundedness, redescendingness) of the resulting influence functions, with heavier tails in the error contamination model producing more robust estimators. In the application to location-scale models with independent and identically distributed data, the resulting analytically-intractable likelihoods are approximated via Monte Carlo integration. In the application to time series models, we propose a Bayesian approach to the robust estimation of time series parameters. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate the parameters of interest and also the gross errors.

We used behavioral, physiological, and genomic approaches to investigate the factors which regulate expression of Kr-h1 in honey bees, and employed a comparative genomics approach to begin to characterize the molecular function of this protein. We demonstrated that brain expression of Kr-h1 is associated with permanent physiological changes that occur during behavioral maturation from nursing to foraging, rather than the acute expression of foraging behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Kr-h1 expression is modulated by cGMP, a key regulator of behavior maturation, and identified a potential cGMP response element in the promoter of Kr-h1. We then characterized the interactions between cGMP and QMP. cGMP inhibited behavioral and physiological responses to QMP, and partially inhibited expression changes of QMP-responsive genes in the brain. Treatment with these factors specifically altered expression of genes associated with GTPase regulator activity, phototransduction, and positive regulation of antibacterial peptide biosynthetic process. However, cGMP did not affect the expression of AmOr11, an odorant receptor specific for a major chemical component of QMP, suggesting that cGMP might work centrally rather than peripherally to modulate the response to QMP. Finally, we elucidated changes in gene expression that resulted from the absence of Kr-h1 expression during D. melanogaster development and discovered an associated motif in the promoter of the majority of the significantly expressed genes, which may mediate the effects of Kr-h1. Further analysis, however, showed that this motif is unlikely to be biologically relevant. These studies have demonstrated the ability of physiological factors to modulate responsiveness to social cues, and provided further information about the role of Kr-h1 in regulating behavior in bees.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08112009-122845/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applying Linear Regression and Neural Network Meta-Models for Evolutionary Algorithm Based Simulation Optimization</field><field name="creator">Propst, Michael David</field><field name="description">The increase in computing power over the last decade has led to an increase in the use of simulation programs to model real world optimization problems as well as the complexity with which these problems can be modeled. Once a model has been built, an experimental design is often used to determine the effects certain parameters have on the problem trying to determine the good settings that optimize a set of outputs. However, these problems often have a large number of variables or parameters that can be changed with wide value ranges and as these simulation models become increasingly more complex they become computationally expensive to run. Most of these problems are non-linear and may not have a true optimal solution based on the inherent variability in real-world applications and the stochastic simulation model. Evolutionary algorithms are a class of computational optimization techniques that harness the power of the computer to solve a problem. The application of evolutionary search techniques as a simulation optimization technique has yielded reasonable results. However, the algorithm can take a long time evaluating just one set of decision variables owing to replications and computational time of one simulation run and not to mention the sheer number of different sets that have to be evaluated to find good solutions for these complex problems. Linear regression and neural-network meta-models can be used to generate a surface model of the simulation. Evaluating the meta-model is very fast as compared to the simulation model. Therefore, this thesis combines the use of evolution algorithms, simulation models and meta-models to produce a more efficient simulation optimization technique. The two types of meta-models are tested to determine their effectiveness as a meta-modeling technique and the overall effectiveness of finding the best solution.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08112009-164218/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular and Physiological Mechanisms Underlying Chemical Communication in the Honey Bee, Apis mellifera.</field><field name="creator">Ayroles, Sarah DeLeigh</field><field name="description">From prokaryotes to vertebrates, the use of chemical signals is widespread. However, the underlying mechanisms that have led to the diversification of chemical communication are poorly understood. Here, I focus on the pheromonal communication system of the honey bee, Apis mellifera, and describe some of the molecular and physiological mechanisms that underlie pheromone production and response in this species. The mandibular glands of queen honey bees produce a pheromone (QMP) which modulates many aspects of worker behavior and physiology, and is critical for colony social organization. Chapters 1 and 2 examine how the mating process in queens can produce changes in queen behavior, physiology, and pheromone production. Chapter 3 demonstrates that these changes in pheromone production appear to be linked to differences in ovary development, and that workers are most attracted to the pheromonal blend of queens with the most activated ovaries. Chapters 4 and 5 explore how variation in pheromone response can mediate queen-worker interactions. In chapter 4, I document extensive variation in worker attraction to QMP, show that this variation is linked to individual reproductive potential, and describe some of the molecular processes that are associated with this variation. Finally, in chapter 5, I test whether variation in a pheromone receptor for the main QMP component can explain the observed variation in worker attraction to the queen, and then take a molecular evolution approach to begin to elucidate the selection pressures acting on this receptor. In addition to the work presented in this dissertation, linkage mapping studies are currently underway to identify the genetic components underlying worker attraction to QMP as well as a set of behavioral and physiological manipulations to identify the epigenetic and environmental factors that can also contribute to this variation. The results of these studies demonstrate that the chemical communication system between honey bee queens and workers acts a dialog, rather than a simple, static signal-response system, and that variation in pheromone production and response both play a critical role in modulating queen-worker interactions within the hive.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08112009-235911/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface Mechanisms in Low-Temperature Plasma Deposition of Silicon</field><field name="creator">Bray, Kevin R</field><field name="description">Dynamic scaling of surface roughness evolution during plasma deposition of amorphous silicon is utilized to characterize surface transport mechanisms. Different surface transport mechanisms leave distinct imprints in the surface that can be distinguished through fractal analysis. Surface roughness is characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the static and dynamic scaling coefficients a and b and the lateral correlation length Lc are extracted from the evolution of surface roughness and are used to identify surface mechanisms. Values of a = 1.0 and b = 0.3 have been obtained, which reveal that surfaces are smoothed through surface diffusion during film growth. Temperature dependence of the Lc is used to calculate diffusion barriers with values around 0.2 eV, consistent with the diffusion of a weakly bound physisorbed species. The effects of process conditions such as substrate temperature, diluent gases composition, process pressure, RF power density, and reactor configuration on the scaling parameters have been investigated. An amorphous silicon kinetic growth model has been developed that incorporates surface coverage dependent diffusion barriers. The model reproduces most experimentally observed results, although some deposition conditions are identified where the model is not valid.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08122002-155312/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM FRAMEWORK FOR DISASTERS</field><field name="creator">Pradhan, Anu Raj</field><field name="description">Three-tiered enterprise GIS architecture offers a robust, efficient, and secure mechanism as a potential revolution to disaster management systems.

Utilizing stream gage data from the United States Geological Survey combined with radar-estimated precipitation from the Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) KRAX near Clayton, NC, several statistical conclusions are drawn. These conclusions are based on relationships between the inputs ? rain rate and precipitation amount ? to the stream responses: the amount of time between when the stream began its rise and when the maximum stage was reached, the amount of time between the onset of precipitation and the initial response of the stream, the maximum stage reached, the change in height of the stream, and the rate of change of height of the stream. Results indicate that precipitation rate and amount tend to dominate the influence of stream response; however, in many situations, land-surface characteristics play an important role. The notable situations where precipitation rate and amount do not dominate are along the major rivers, in locations with sandy soils where infiltration is high, and in urban areas, where runoff occurs rapidly and streams thus respond quickly regardless of precipitation rate or amount. In addition, rain rate and precipitation amount do not necessarily have similar relationships with the stream response variables; rain rate has a stronger correlation with rate of change of stream rise, while precipitation amount has a stronger correlation with change in stream height. However, it is not enough to study rainfall rates and precipitation amounts if a flash flood warning is to be issued. The results of this research show that there is value and necessity in understanding the role of land-surface characteristics when determining if flash flooding is going to occur.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08122004-004241/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization and community analysis of three Carolina Bays in Bladen County, North Carolina</field><field name="creator">Lees, Britta</field><field name="description">Carolina Bays are unique elliptical depressional wetlands that are abundant in the Atlantic Coastal Plain, particularly in North Carolina. A large percentage of these bays have been ditched, drained, logged, or otherwise disturbed by humans in the past 200 years. Currently, Carolina Bay restoration provides a means for mitigating wetlands lost to development. The purpose of this study was to characterize compositional variation of vegetation relative to gradients of environmental conditions in three Carolina Bays in order to provide reference data for restoring impacted bays. Within three unaltered Carolina Bays, soil sampling, water table monitoring, and vegetation assessments were conducted. Four community types were identified: pond pine woodland, non-riverine swamp forest, high pocosin, and bay forest. Distributions of these community types were strongly correlated to depth of organic material and associated soil properties and hydrologic regimes. Pond pine woodland dominated mineral soils; both pond pine woodland and nonriverine swamp forest were found on histic and shallow organic soils; both high pocosin and bay forest were found on deep organic soils. Examination of the data included simple averaging, single factor analyses of variance, Fisher?s protected least significant differences, chi-square tests of independence, cluster analyses, and ordination procedures. The application of this material was intended for a North Carolina Department of Transportation Carolina Bay mitigation project and future Carolina Bay restoration projects in this region.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08122004-155502/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">LEAF EXTRACELLULAR ASCORBATE METABOLISM IN RELATION TO OZONE TOLERANCE IN TWO SOYBEAN CULTIVARS</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Fang-yi</field><field name="description">Antioxidants in the leaf apoplast have the potential to detoxify ozone (O3) and active oxygen species (AOS), and thus may play a role in preventing plant injury. To investigate this possibility, two experiments were conducted to compare antioxidant metabolism in the leaf extracellular spaces of O3-tolerant (Essex) and O3-sensitive (Forrest) cultivars of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. In the first experiment, a canopy profile consisting of the 2nd, 4th and 6th main stem trifoliates was sampled from plants grown for four weeks in a greenhouse supplied with charcoal-filtered air (CF) to assess genetic and leaf age effects under low stress conditions. In general, apoplastic ascorbate (AA) levels were low (&lt; 30 nmol AA g-1 FW) in both cultivars. Apoplastic dehydroascorbate (DHA) levels were higher (&gt; 50 nmol DHA g-1 FW) relative to AA, particularly in younger leaves (250-450 nmol DHA g-1 FW), resulting in a low ascorbate redox state. Ascorbate oxidase (AO) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity were found in leaf apoplast samples, suggesting that the enzymes played a role in maintaining ascorbate primarily in the oxidized state. In the second experiment, the second main stem trifoliates of four week-old plants were compared in the two genotypes following exposure to CF or elevated O3 conditions. Following a six-day treatment period with 77 ppb O3 for 7 h d-1, foliar injury was greater in O3-treated Forrest than in Essex, and total leaf guaiacol peroxidase activity was correlated with the greater O3 sensitivity of Forrest. Under both CF and elevated O3 conditions, there was a significantly higher apoplastic total antioxidant capacity in Essex than in Forrest correlating with greater O3 tolerance. Although reduced AA concentration was greater in apoplasts sample from O3-treated Essex than Forrest, the difference (6.5 nmol g-1 FW) was unlikely to play a major role in the differential O3 sensitivity of these two cultivars. Apoplast AA was generally less than 30% of the total antioxidant capacity found in apoplast samples, suggesting that other antioxidants might be involved in the detoxification of O3 in the extracellular space in these soybean cultivars.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08122004-224120/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical Improvement of Braithwaite?s Reintegrative Shaming Theory: Specifying Contingencies for the Process of Shaming</field><field name="creator">Botchkovar, Ekaterina V</field><field name="description">Reintegrative shaming theory has been one of the most undertested and the least empirically supported criminological theories. Drawing mainly on the predictions from self-control theory, general strain theory, and deterrence theory, I attempt to improve Braithwaite?s shaming theory by identifying conditions under which its causal process might be more effective in predicting misbehavior. Using data from the first self-report crime and deviance survey ever conducted in Russia, I put shaming theory to the test in its original and elaborated versions. In line with previous research, the study findings indicate that, contrary to the theory?s predictions, being reintegratively shamed is positively associated with projected deviance while participating in gossip is unrelated to projected involvement in deviant behavior. While disintegrative shaming was found to be positively associated with future misbehavior, this relationship was not statistically significant controlling for past deviance reports. Interdependency does not seem to enhance the effects of shaming variables. Contrary to shaming theory theory, although anticipated feelings of guilt and fear of losing respect from others for potential misbehavior predict projections of future misconduct, they do not seem to be the links between shaming experiences and projected misconduct. While some of the hypothesized contingencies seemed to condition the effects of shaming on projected deviance, none of these effects were consistent for all types of deviant behavior in this study. These results, in conjunction with the accumulated body of research, suggest that reintegrative shaming theory may be in need of further revision. Suggestions for the future refinement of shaming theory are provided. Overall, this study contributes to the literature in two ways. First, it strengthens shaming theory by specifying some of the boundaries for its explanatory scope. Second, this work provides an extensive empirical test to the original and elaborated statements of shaming theory using data from an unusual locale.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08122005-135532/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of In ovo Feeding on Turkey Embryos Development, Energy Status, Intestinal Maturation, Gene Expression and Post-hatch Development.</field><field name="creator">de Oliveira, Jean Eduardo</field><field name="description">Glycogen stored in liver and muscles are the main energy source during hatching of poultry. Turkey embryos are very sensitive to perturbations in energy metabolism because they have a wider hatching window than chicken embryos. Mortality of turkey embryos during late-term incubation is high relative to chickens, and many surviving hatchlings have compromised vitality. In ovo feeding (IOF) improves the energy status and gut development of perinatal poultry by supplementing the amnion with nutrients, which is then orally consumed by the embryo prior to hatch. A survey of amnion and embryonic development was done to determine the best time, maximum volume and solution characteristics for IOF. Several IOF formulations containing combinations of carbohydrates, proteins and enteric modulators were tested in turkey eggs, with emphasis on comparing hydrolyzed soy protein to egg white. IOF was found to improve energy status at hatch, but subsequent growth performance results were inconsistent. Therefore, further studies were designed to better understand late-term turkey embryo metabolism, using a customized focused oligonucleotide microarray. A gene expression survey using this array was performed on liver, pectoral muscle, hatching muscle, duodenum, and ileum of turkey embryos from 20 days of incubation until hatch. The embryos were found to switch from yolk fat to carbohydrate-based metabolism around 22 days of incubation, and potential substrates were identified to be tested in ovo. A nutritive solution containing metabolic co-factors was then formulated and tested in a subsequent IOF experiment. At hatch, poults treated with this latest IOF formulation exhibited better quality scores and more symmetric legs than controls. Gene expression patterns of liver, pectoral muscle, hatching muscle, duodenum and ileum confirmed IOF favored skeletal development of poults. This dissertation research clearly demonstrated that in ovo feeding technology can enhance energy status and advance the development of hatchlings, resulting in superior poult quality.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08122007-183816/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rule-based Computational Modeling of Modular Signaling Protein Interactions</field><field name="creator">Barua, Dipak</field><field name="description">Intracellular signal transduction pathways are comprised of complex interactions among cellular proteins and other biomolecules. The structures of signaling proteins/enzymes are often modular, with conserved domains that carry out specific interactions or catalytic functions, and their core activities are dictated through coordinated intra- and inter-molecular interactions. In collaboration with Prof. James Faeder (Computational Biology, University of Pittsburgh), we have applied a computational algorithm for generating large networks of kinetic equations based on a much smaller set of mechanistic rules. Using this rule-based approach, we have formulated kinetic models that account for the modular domain structure of specific signaling proteins, including Shp2 (Src homology-2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2), PI3K (phosphatidilinositol-3-kinase) regulatory subunit, and SH2-B (a Jak2 kinase activating adaptor protein). Analysis of these models reveals the combinatorial possibilities of reactions and interactions that might occur in living cells.

The solver blends a Menter BSL two-equation model for the RANS part of the closure with a Smagorisnky sub-grid model for the LES component. The solver uses a flow-dependent blending function based on wall distance and a modeled form of the Taylor micro-scale to transition from RANS to LES. Turbulent fluctuations are initiated and are sustained in the inflow region using a recycling/rescaling technique. A new multi-wall recycling/rescaling technique is described and tested. A spanwise-shifting method is introduced that is intended to alleviate unphysical streamwise streaks of high- and low-momentum fluid that appear in the time-averaged solution due to the recycling procedure. Simulations of sonic injection of air, helium and ethylene into a Mach 2 cross-flow of air are performed. Also, simulations of Mach 5 flow in a subscale inlet/isolator configuration with and without back-pressuring are performed.

It can survive in a wide range of environments, raw milk and poultry are major reservoirs. Survival of animal-derived Campylobacter strains, including six C. jejuni and six C. coli, was examined in raw and pasteurized milk at 4oC. Most (11/12) of the Campylobacter strains survived in both raw and pasteurized milk for at least 14 days. The most resistant strain, a C. jejuni from a dairy cow, retained its viability over eight weeks in pasteurized milk, while the most sensitive strain showed a &gt; 5-log10 CFU/ml reduction in raw milk after one week. The majority (9/12) of the strains survived better in pasteurized milk than in raw milk, while the opposite was observed for two C. coli strains. The findings indicate that Campylobacter spp. can survive in milk for at least 14 days at 4oC and that survival is strain-dependent. To elucidate mechanisms underlying such adaptation, we characterized the role of capsule in Campylobacter survival in milk and other media, and in chick colonization. Three capsule-deficient mutants (kpsM::kanr), C. coli 6979M2, C. jejuni BS142M2 and C. jejuni SC1453M2 were constructed by site-specific mutagenesis. Compared to the wild type strains, the colonies of the mutants were smaller, more convex, and shinier on agar media; the mutants were more sensitive to desiccation and two (C. coli 6979M2 and C. jejuni BS142M2) grew slower in broth. These two mutants were also more sensitive to certain antibiotics than their wild type counterparts. The survival of the mutants in distilled water, raw and pasteurized milk was comparable to survival of their wild type counterparts, as was the ability of the bacteria to transform to nalidixic acid resistance via transformation. In chick colonization experiment, C. coli 6979 M2 showed &gt; 3log10 reduced cell density in cecal contents than its parent strain. These results suggest that capsule is essential for C. coli in chick colonization and responsible for colony morphology on solid agar and can protect cells from desiccation, but its impact on growth rate, competence and antibiotic resistance is strain-dependent.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biotechnology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08122009-175128/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling Nutrient Uptake Process and Growth Kinetics of Duckweed Spirodela punctata 7776 for Nutrient Recovery from Swine Wastewater</field><field name="creator">Chaiprapat, Sumate</field><field name="description">Use of plants for swine waste management involves the removal of nutrients from the swine wastewater by the plants and the utilization of the plant biomass for other useful purposes such as feed supplement and soil amendment. Duckweed has gained much interest for this purpose in the past decades because of its high growth rate and high protein content. The goal of this research was to study the characteristics of duckweed growth and nutrient uptake from swine wastewater in order to improve the efficiency of duckweed nutrient recovery. In the first part of this research, nutrient distribution and transport in a quiescent duckweed-covered pond containing swine lagoon liquid were investigated and described mathematically. A superior duckweed strain for total protein production in swine wastewater Spirodela punctata 7776 was used as a subject of the study. Diffusive transport of ammonium was shown to be a limiting process in nitrogen removal by duckweed plants in static ponds. In addition, a pH profile developed along the depth of the pond, creating an additional barrier to ammonia volatilization from the pond covered with a duckweed mat. In the second part of the research, growth and nutrient uptake characteristics of Spirodela punctata 7776 in artificial swine medium were examined in sterile batch cultures. Growth of Spirodela punctata 7776 corresponded to the amount of nitrogen storage in its biomass rather than the nutrient concentration in the growth medium. The relationship followed Monod-like kinetics with a maximum specific growth rate of 0.2381 g/g/d. Reduction in the specific growth rate of Spirodela punctata 7776 was observed in the culture with higher crop density, which signified the adverse effects of surface crowding. A mathematical expression to represent the effects of crop density (mass per unit area) on specific growth rate was developed, which can be used in optimization of crop density management in duckweed nutrient recovery systems.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological and Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08132002-090507/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary and Functional Analysis of SlyA in Salmonella typhimurium</field><field name="creator">Boutt, Elizabeth Ann</field><field name="description">Salmonella species cause a variety of infections in humans and domestic animals, ranging from mild food poisoning-gastroenteritis Salmonella typhimurium to severe systemic disease Salmonella typhi. Salmonella is used as a paradigm to understand how intracellular pathogens withstand the onslaught of the host innate immune system, namely the professional macrophage. SlyA is a global transcriptional regulator that is necessary for the virulence of Salmonella typhimurium. In a mouse model system, a slyA mutant is profoundly attenuated for virulence and is unable to survive in macrophages. To understand the evolutionary history of SlyA in Eubacteria, a phylogenetic analysis was performed. Several alignments of amino acid sequences were constructed with MarR and also with known SlyA homologues. Searches for other SlyA homologues were undertaken using databases of unfinished and finished microbial genomes and more than 50 putative homologues were found. SlyA has been classified as a MarR-like transcriptional regulator by homology. This classification may not be appropriate given the differences in function. Therefore it is suggested that a new class of SlyA-like regulators be formed incorporating all of the homologues found in this study. In order to determine the extent of the SlyA regulon, studies were conducted to analyze the DNA-binding properties of SlyA. The target promoters from this study included genes that were shown to be either activated or repressed by SlyA by utilizing a Salmonella genomic DNA microarray. SlyA was shown to bind specifically to the promoters of clyA, pagC, pagK and mig-14. The approximate Kd values appear to be similar between each of the promoters indicating a similar propensity for SlyA to bind.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08132002-094341/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Terministic Screens and Cultural Perspectives: A Pentadic Analysis of the Attribution of Motive for the September 11th Event</field><field name="creator">Wicker, Emily Dunn</field><field name="description">The research in this project examines the motives attributed in different cultural perspectives for the September 11th attack on the United States using Kenneth Burke's rhetorical theory of Dramatism to examine speeches and articles that were published immediately following the attack. The dramatistic, or pentadic, analysis focuses on four different cultural perspectives: France as represented by Le Monde Diplomatique, Iran as represented by the Tehran Times, Israel as represented by the speeches of Ariel Sharon, and the United States as represented by the speeches of George W. Bush. In each perspective, five elements are defined and analyzed: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. The analysis is in hypertext. By doing the analysis in hypertext, one cultural perspective is not privileged over another. Thus the reader is able to see how one perspective describes the event, and can link either to another screen in that perspective or to a corresponding screen in another perspective. The analysis is preceded by a Critical Framework that explains key terms used in the analysis. A conclusion is also included to summarize findings in the analysis and to discuss implications arising from the analysis. The Conclusion shows how each perspective has a way of seeing and not seeing the event, and how we can learn from our observations.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08132003-161250/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Analysis of the Flow through a Model Rocket-Based Combined Cycle Engine with an Independently-Fueled Ramjet Stream</field><field name="creator">Bond, Ryan Bomar</field><field name="description">A new concept for the low speed propulsion mode in rocket based combined cycle (RBCC) engines has been developed as part of the NASA GTX program. This concept, called the independent ramjet stream (IRS) cycle, is a variation of the traditional ejector ramjet (ER) design and involves the injection of hydrogen fuel directly into the air stream, where it is ignited by the rocket plume. Experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are currently being used to evaluate the feasibility of the new design. In this work, a Navier-Stokes code valid for general reactive flows is applied to the model engine under cold flow, ejector ramjet, and IRS cycle operation. Pressure distributions corresponding to cold-flow and ejector ramjet operation are compared with experimental data. The engine response under independent ramjet stream cycle operation is examined for different reaction models and grid sizes. The engine response to variations in fuel injection is also examined. Mode transition simulations are also analyzed both with and without a nitrogen purge of the rocket. The solutions exhibit a high sensitivity to both grid resolution and reaction mechanism, but they do indicate that thermal throat ramjet operation is possible through the injection and burning of additional fuel into the air stream. The solutions also indicate that variations in fuel injection location can affect the position of the thermal throat. The numerical simulations predicted successful mode transition both with and without a nitrogen purge of the rocket; however, the reliability of the mode transition results cannot be established without experimental data to validate the reaction mechanism.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08132003-171258/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Algorithmic Enhancements to the VULCAN Navier-Stokes Solver</field><field name="creator">Litton, Daniel</field><field name="description">VULCAN (Viscous Upwind aLgorithm for Complex flow ANalysis) is a cell centered, finite volume code used to solve high speed flows related to hypersonic vehicles. Two algorithms are presented for expanding the range of applications of the current Navier-Stokes solver implemented in VULCAN. The first addition is a highly implicit approach that uses subiterations to enhance block to block connectivity between adjacent subdomains. The addition of this scheme allows more efficient solution of viscous flows on highly-stretched meshes. The second algorithm addresses the shortcomings associated with density-based schemes by the addition of a time-derivative preconditioning strategy. High speed, compressible flows are typically solved with density based schemes, which show a high level of degradation in accuracy and convergence at low Mach numbers (M &lt; 0.1). With the addition of preconditioning and associated modifications to the numerical discretization scheme, the eigenvalues will scale with the local velocity, and the above problems will be eliminated. With these additions, VULCAN now has improved convergence behavior for multi-block, highly-stretched meshes and also can accurately solve the Navier-Stokes equations for very low Mach numbers.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08132003-230354/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Passage from India: The East Indian Indenture Experience in Trinidad 1845-1885</field><field name="creator">Persad, Rajesh Surendra</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research has been to analyze the social relationships that developed during the formative years of East Indian indenture system in the Trinidad.

Human insight gained from FDA-required animal experiments has historically been limited, but in the case of gene expression measurements, proposed biological orthologies between mouse and human genes provide a foothold for animal-to-human extrapolation. We have investigated a five-component, multilevel, bivariate normal mixture model that incorporates mouse, as well as human, gene expression data. The goal is two-fold: to increase human differential gene-finding power; and to find a subclass of gene pairs for which there is a direct exploitable relationship between animal and human genes. In simulation studies, the dual-species model boasted impressive gains in differential gene-finding power over a related marginal model using only human data. Bias in parameter estimation was problematic, however, and occasionally led to failures in control of the false discovery rate. Though it was considerably more difficult to find species-extrapolative gene-pairs (than differentially expressed human genes), simulation experiments deemed it to be possible, especially when traditional FDR controls are relaxed and under hypothetical parameter configurations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08132008-130441/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Everyday Racism in the Context of Full-Service Restaurants</field><field name="creator">Brewster, Zachary W.</field><field name="description">Despite popular claims that racism and discrimination are no longer salient issues in contemporary society, racial minorities continue to experience disparate treatment in everyday public interactions. The context of full-service restaurants is one such public setting wherein racial minority patrons, African Americans in particular, encounter discriminate treatment. To further understand the pervasiveness and processes implicated in restaurant servers&#226; proclivity to discriminate against their racial minority customers, I analyze primary survey data derived from a local sample of servers (N=200) nested in eighteen restaurant establishments. Subjects were asked a series of questions ascertaining information about the racial climate of their workplaces. I utilize ordinary least squares regression and hierarchical linear modeling to assess the effects of both restaurant- and server-level variables on discriminatory server behaviors. Findings highlight the persistence of everyday racial discrimination in settings of public accommodations. A sizable number of sampled subjects self-reported to discriminate racially in their service delivery. Such discrimination can partially be understood as an adaptation to the economic uncertainty inherent in the institution of tipping. Results show that servers are motivated to discriminate statistically in their service delivery, to some extent, due to perceived differences in tipping and dining behaviors across racial groups. However, the economic motivation to provide discriminate service explains only a modest amount of the overall variation in servers&#226; self-reported discriminatory behaviors. Results also reveal a considerable amount of anti-black server discourse within the cultures of restaurant establishments and such discourse is shown to be an important factor towards understanding both within and between-restaurant variation in server discrimination. Contrary to my expectations, the proportion of minorities working as servers/bartenders was not shown be a salient organizational-level predictor of discriminatory server behaviors. These research findings are interpreted as reflecting processes of everyday racism in contemporary America. Implications of these findings for restaurant officials are discussed and directions for future research are outlined.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08132009-160038/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thrombosis and Thrombolysis: Emphasis on Hemophilia and Effect of Clot Dissolution with Plasmin</field><field name="creator">Landskroner, Kyle Alan</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to understand the mechanisms in which blood clots form and are degraded. The research studies examined the role of an endogenous protease, plasmin, which is found in all vertebrates, and the optimal doses of plasmin required to dissolve blood clots. When we investigated clot lysis with plasmin we examined blood clots from several species to which varying concentrations of plasmin were added, as well as varying methods of plasmin administration. The results of these studies not only highlighted important dose-response relationships of plasmin, but also demonstrated differences in the effect of human plasmin to dissolve blood clots compared to blood clot from the species tested. Porcine clots, in particular, were more resistant to lysis compared with human clots, while ovine clots had similar lysis compared with human clots. In addition, this research demonstrated that plasmin?s effectiveness to lyse thrombi increases with an increase in clot surface area, e.g, by fragmentation, or when plasmin is administered as an intrathrombic administration. In separate studies, to investigate clot formation, we uesd mice that lack the FVIII protein. For these experiments we investigated the formation of blood clot formation using rotational thromboelastography (ROTEG) that measures the formation of fibrin in whole blood. This method was shown to be extremely sensitive to low levels of factor VIII protein and may have applications to classify particular phenotypes of hemophilia patients, or as a research tool to evaluate novel FVIII molecules.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08142005-145317/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavior of FRP Repair/Strengthening Systems for Prestressed Concrete</field><field name="creator">Rosenboom, Owen Arthur</field><field name="description">This research study examines the behavior of prestressed concrete beams retrofitted with Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) materials. Due to deficiencies in the built environment, engineers may be asked to retrofit or upgrade the capacity of an existing concrete structural member. This could be a result of new demands on the structure, or a repair of damage from an unforeseen event. Retrofits are possible using the traditional building materials of concrete and steel. The cross-section of the structural element can be increased, or steel plates can be bolted or adhesively affixed to the structure to increase capacity. Many of these techniques are costly, and some perform poorly under service conditions. The main benefit for using FRP materials for the strengthening of existing structures is the lightweight nature of the composite material, which makes the use of extensive scaffolding (required in the installation of steel plates) obsolete. The objectives of this research are twofold. First, the overall structural behavior of an FRP strengthened or repaired concrete beam is studied. Two different loading conditions are examined: extreme loading simulated by a monotonic load to failure, and fatigue loading designed to simulate service loads. The structural behavior of the system is evaluated under these different conditions, and an analytical model is presented which predicts the flexural behavior of the system assuming certain failure modes. The second objective of this research is to evaluate the bond behavior of an FRP strengthened reinforced or prestressed concrete flexural member. A database of experimental failures was constructed, and an analytical model is proposed which predicts the bond failure of the FRP strengthening system.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08142006-093341/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three Essays on the Demand of Imported and Domestic Meat and Livestock in the United States</field><field name="creator">Boonsaeng, Tullaya</field><field name="description">This dissertation studies the demand for imported and domestic demand models for meat and livestock. The first essay focuses on the separability between import and domestic meat demand and the performance of static versus dynamic models of consumer behavior. A new dynamic system of demand functions is developed and used to test the separability restrictions on U.S. meat consumption data. Our results indicate that imported meat consumption is non-separable from the U.S. consumption and a dynamic specification of the AIDS model is superior to the static AIDS model. The second essay analyzes the demand for domestic and imported livestock by the US meat processing industry and explores the existence of long-run relationships in the derived demand models which are required for the specification of dynamic demand models. The results indicate that the static inverse input demand model performed better than the dynamic models for both the beef and pork processing industries. The results of this study indicate that there is not a long run relationship in the variables of the inverse demand models for livestock. The third essay investigates the impact of the discovery BSE in Canadian cattle on the imported and domestic demand for livestock and meat in the United States. The analysis is based on the results of the first and second essays of the dissertation. A multi-market partial equilibrium model is utilized to simulate the effects of policy-induced shifts in quantities of imports supplied from Canada on the meat and livestock industries. Our simulation results predict small effects on cattle and the results are similar to prediction from Armington type models even though separability strongly rejected.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08142006-103939/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethanol and Acetate Production from Synthesis Gas using Microbial Catalysts</field><field name="creator">Cotter, Jacqueline Louise</field><field name="description">The feasibility of inducing a resting stage in cultures of Clostridium ljungdahlii and Clostridium autoethanogenum was evaluated. Additionally, the effects of medium pH and benzyl viologen, a electron mediator, were tested separately for resting C. ljungdahlii cultures. Cells were grown on nitrogen-rich basal media, a modified Reinforced Clostridial Media and DSMZ 640 for C. ljungdahlii and C. autoethanogenum respectively, and then transferred to nitrogen-limited media to induce the resting stage. The performance of the resting cultures was evaluated by product formation (ethanol and acetate), culture stability, and cell viability. It was found that C. ljungdahlii was able to be induced into a stable non-growing stage with basal medium supplemented with vitamins and trace elements and devoid of the major nitrogen sources: yeast extract, beef extract, and proteose peptone, RCM.NA.SVE. However, there was no significant product formation in the resting cultures of C. ljungdahlii. Three pH levels, 6.8 (the control), 5.5, and 4.5, were tested for affects on C. ljungdahlii resting cell performance. The medium pH of resting cultures in NG.RCM.NA.SVE did not improve product formation of non-growing C. ljungdahlii cultures. The more acidic pH of the non-growing media reduced the culture viability from 100 % at pH 6.8 to 44.4 and 11.1 % at pH 5.5 and 4.5 respectively. Three levels of benzyl viologen concentration were tested for affects on C. ljungdahlii resting cell performance: 0, 50, and 100 part per million. The addition of benzyl viologen did not enhance the cultures? product formation capabilities. The benzyl viologen in the resting cell media also negatively affected the culture viability leaving only 33.3 and 55.5 % of the cultures viable with 100 and 50 ppm benzyl viologen respectively. C. autoethanogenum cultures were not able to be induced into stable non-growing cultures. With various nitrogen-source limitations from the basal medium cultures experienced either significant increases or decreases in culture density over time. The ethanol product selectivity in both non-growing and growing cultures of C. autoethanogenum in nitrogen-limited media was improved from the growing C. autoethanogenum in the basal medium. The ethanol to acetate production ratio was improved to 1:4.5 in two different nitrogen-limited media (one without yeast extract or trypticase peptone in which the culture density decreased, and only devoid of yeast extract in which the culture grew) from 1:7 in the basal growth medium. All cultures of C. autoethanogenum remained viable after transfer from the growth media to the non-growth media. From these studies it appears that ethanol is a primary metabolite for both C. ljungdahlii and C. autoethanogenum on sugar substrates.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological and Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08142006-111149/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lactoferrin Supplementation to Holstein Calves During the Preweaning and Postweaning Phases</field><field name="creator">English, Elizabeth Anne</field><field name="description">Sixty Holstein calves (30 bulls, 30 heifers) were used to examine the effects of supplemental lactoferrin on feed intake, growth, and health during the preweaning and postweaning periods.

Milk (3.8 L/d) was fed from bottles until weaning at 35 days. From days 36 to 56, lactoferrin supplements were added to water (15-25 mL) and fed from bottles. Lactoferrin supplementation did not have any significant effect on feed intake, body weight, average daily gain, heart girth, body temperature, fecal scores, respiratory scores, or haptoglobin concentrations. Calves were housed in individual pens in either an open-sided barn or hutches. Calves raised in the barn consumed more calf starter and therefore grew better than calves raised in hutches. In this study, lactoferrin supplementation was not beneficial.

Prior to this study, the subfamily contained approximately 450 species in 5 tribes and 73 genera distributed worldwide, but primarily in Australia, Africa, and the Indomalayan region. Several authors have suggested Ledrinae are not monophyletic, and recent studies based on molecular and morphological data have called the existing classification into question. The goals of this study were to collect and analyze morphological data under rigorous phylogenetic criteria in order to test the monophyly of Ledrinae, provide robust definitions for the subfamily and its tribes, and provide a phylogenetic framework for understanding relationships among these leafhoppers. New phylogenetic hypotheses are presented here regarding the monophyly of Ledrinae and its included tribes. A total of 235 morphological characters were coded for 60 species from 31 genera in the tribes Ledrini and Petalocephalini, 5 species from the tribes Stenocotini, Thymbrini, and Xerophloeini, and 10 species selected as outgroups from various other cicadellid subfamilies. Data were analyzed in PAUP* and resulted in a single completely resolved topology with many well-supported nodes. Ledrinae, as previously defined, was found to be polyphyletic with respect to Stenocotini, Thymbrini, and various ledrine genera, which were placed with the outgroup taxa. Stenocotini and Thymbrini were placed with Tartessinae, agreeing with results of other recent studies. Rubria, Hespenedra, and the Afrorubria genus group formed independent lineages within Ledrinae. Xerophloeini was placed as a basal lineage within Ledrinae closely associated with the Afrorubria group. Ledrini and Petalocephalini, as previously defined, did not form monophyletic lineages, but were randomly interspersed with respect to one another. Stenocotini and Thymbrini are here removed to the subfamily Tartessinae, and Petalocephalini is made a synonym of Ledrini. Three new tribes are described within Ledrinae. Taxa placed outside of Ledrinae in this analysis are removed to other subfamilies or considered unplaced within Cicadellidae. This newly revised classification strengthens hypotheses that the Ledrinae are a very old group within Cicadellidae. As here defined, the subfamily includes five tribes with a total of 37 genera.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08142006-171318/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching Geometric Reasoning: Proof by Pictures?</field><field name="creator">Hawkins, Matthew Lee</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate students? understanding of proof and proof writing using a new three-column method. The new three-column method consists of the traditional ?statements? and ?reasons? columns but also contains a ?picture? column in which students must draw a picture that corresponds to the ?statement.? It is believed that this third column will act as a blue print providing students with a visual representation of how the proof is constructed. By examining this blueprint students will understand which steps are needed to complete the proof as well as the proper order of those steps. Thus, students develop a deeper understanding of the proof writing process. The study was conducted in a suburban school in central North Carolina and involved two standard geometry classes. The study lasted for a week and a half and was instituted during a chapter involving different triangle congruencies (i.e. SAS, SSS, etc). The three-column proof was taught to a 3rd period class containing 31 students. Their test and quiz scores were compared to a 2nd period class containing 23 students. After examining the average quiz and average test scores for the chapter it was shown that the 3rd period class did not out score the 2nd period class. Thus, the use of a three-column picture proof is as effective as the traditional approach. An important question pursuant to this outcome is whether there are other teaching/learning benefits from using picture proofs. For example, interviews with the cooperating teacher indicated that the three-column proof was very helpful for several students and also provided good teacher feedback as to students? understanding of theorems and postulates used in proof writing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08142007-115743/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of Realistic Yield Expectations in the North Carolina Piedmont and Coastal Plain</field><field name="creator">Lohman, Mindy</field><field name="description">Realistic Yield Expectations (RYE) have been developed in North Carolina to assist in site-specific farming decisions that will improve N-use efficiency and reduce N contamination of ground- and surface water, especially in the Neuse River Basin.

To represent zones (transition zone or map unit interior), 20 m buffers centered on map unit boundaries were created in order to investigate these highly unique and variable areas. Soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield data was collected for two site-years in one Piedmont field, while wheat and corn (Zea mays L.) were sampled for one site-year in the two remaining Piedmont fields. Soybean and wheat yield data was collected for three site-years in two Coastal Plain fields. Interpolated nutrient maps showed visual correlations between soil map units and soil K values in the Coastal Plain, but no other relationships between soil chemical properties and soil map units or zones were visually apparent for either location. Yield maps showed visual relationships with soil map units in the Coastal Plain but not in the Piedmont. Various statistical models were utilized to analyze the data and the spatial covariance model was determined to be more efficient than the independent and identically distributed fixed effects model in capturing a significant proportion of the variability for tested soil chemical properties and crop yield in both locations. Remapped and original soil map units were also studied to determine their effectiveness in capturing the variability of soil chemical properties and crop yield. The remapped soil map units were more effective than the original soil map units in capturing this variability in most cases. Soil K was highly significant among the remapped soil map units in the Field 7 in the Piedmont where r2=0.82. In all locations, other investigated parameters also displayed significance, but none as highly significant as soil K in Field 7. RYEs were found to be greater than actual yields for all crops harvested in both locations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08152004-201104/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and Characterization of Antibacterial Poly(ethylene glycol) Hydrogels</field><field name="creator">Kloxin, April Morris</field><field name="description">Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels containing tertiary amines were synthesized by thermally-initiated free-radical copolymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA), poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA), and 2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA). The mass fraction of each monomer was varied from 0 to ~1 to determine the composition for optimum mechanical properties and maximum tertiary amine content. Dry films were characterized by attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), elemental analysis, dynamical mechanical analysis (DMA), tensile testing, swelling, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The film composition with highest strength, elasticity, swelling, and amine content was found to be 30 wt% PEGDMA due to limited polymerization of DMAEMA with PEGDMA. Films composed of 10 wt% PEGDMA were subsequently quaternized with alkyl bromides of varying chain length (C8, C12, and C16) to impart antibacterial properties to the network. Quaternized films were characterized by elemental analysis, swelling, DSC, and a surface antimicrobial assay. The minimum quaternized DMAEMA concentration for antimicrobial activity was 22 wt% quaternized with C8Br and 30 wt% quaternized with C12Br and C16Br. The most potent alkyl bromide was C8Br followed by C12Br and C16Br. These quaternized PEG-co-poly(DMAEMA) hydrogels show promise as antibacterial materials for biomedical applications.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08152004-202806/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal Loading and Uncertainty Analysis of High Level Waste in Yucca Mountain</field><field name="creator">Nicholson, Mark A</field><field name="description">Based on the current discharge rate of nuclear reactors the total inventory of SNF in the U.S. will exceed the current design capacity of the Yucca Mountain repository by 2010. This leaves no room for future SNF discharged from the current nuclear fleet or reactors that potentially will be built. Expansion of the Yucca Mountain repository would provide a large economical benefit as siting and developing a second repository would be a drawn out, divisive and expensive process. The goal of this work is to analyze the thermal loading of SNF into Yucca Mountain in order to investigate the feasibility of repository capacity increase without exceeding the thermal limitations set by the DOE. To examine the feasibility of repository capacity expansion, the concept of variable drift spacing using uniform loading and the concept of variable drift thermal loading using a non-uniform following were investigated. To support the work, a thermal analysis model, SRTA, was employed to describe the temperature changes in the rock around the waste packages against thermal design limits as a function of spent fuel characteristics and composition. Results indicated that, by implementing the scheme of variable drift spacing or variable drift thermal loading, the capacity of the repository could be increased from the legislative limit of 70,000 MTU without violating the thermal limits of the drift wall (200&#730;C) and the limit midway between the drifts (96&#730;C). By implementing different loading criteria it was found that the capacity of the repository could be increased by as much as 48% based on the mean estimate. This thesis does not include capacity increases that could result from extending the repository footprint, the number of levels in the repository or the appropriateness of the thermal design limits.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08152007-200121/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel Approaches to Fiber formation from Hydrogen Bond forming Polymers</field><field name="creator">Gupta, Amit</field><field name="description">Hydrogen bond forming polymers such as aliphatic polyamides and polyvinyl alcohol are important engineering plastics with good mechanical properties, high melting point and good chemical resistance. However, any further attempt at improving their mechanical properties gets thwarted due to the presence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Many approaches have been attempted in the past to suppress hydrogen bonding in aliphatic polyamides and have met with little or no success. These include, plasticizing the structure, dry spinning, wet spinning, gel spinning, and zone drawing/annealing. We have employed a new technique that involves the dry-jet wet spinning and drawing of GaCl3/nylon 66 complex. This new method allows traditional low draw ratios for nylon 66 to be increased by disrupting the interchain hydrogen bonded network. Fibers with a high modulus were obtained when high molecular weight nylon 66 was used. Further, we have also reviewed the concept of thermoreversible gelation and its application for gel spinning of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene fibers. We developed high strength and modulus nylon 6 and PVA fibers from the gels of these polymers in N-methyl pyrrolidinone. High molecular weight is essential for achieving more drawing of polymer chains which leads to high molecular orientation. Electrostatic spinning or electrospinning has received considerable research attention in recent years. It involves the application of an electric filed to a polymer solution or melt to facilitate production of fibers in the sub-micron down to nanometer range. We have investigated the complexation of GaCl3 with nylon 6 and developed porous nanofibers via the technique of electrospinning. Pores are generated by removal of salt from the as spun nanofibers via dipping in water. Researchers have tried in the past using a highly volatile solvent, or selective removal of one polymer from a bicomponent nanofiber for developing pores in nanofibers. However, using a metal salt proved to be a simple and fast approach for generating pores in electrospun nanofibers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiber and Polymer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08152008-135907/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selection and Rapidly-Evolving Genes</field><field name="creator">Barrier, Marianne</field><field name="description">Rapidly-evolving genes which exhibit an increased rate of amino acid substitution, resulting in greater amino acid sequence difference, often provide insight into the mechanisms of adaptation and speciation. In this dissertation research, the evolution of rapidly-evolving genes under selection was examined. Homologues to the &lt;I&gt;Arabidopsis APETALA3 (ASAP3/TM6)&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;APETALA1 (ASAP1)&lt;/I&gt; floral regulatory genes and the &lt;I&gt;CHLOROPHYLL A/B BINDING PROTEIN9 (ASCAB9)&lt;/I&gt; photosynthetic structural gene were isolated from species in the Hawaiian silversword alliance, a premier example of plant adaptive radiation. The two floral homeotic genes are found in duplicate copies within members of the Hawaiian silversword alliance and appear to have arisen as a result of interspecific hybridization between two North American tarweed species. Molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest that the interspecific hybridization event involved members of lineages that include &lt;I&gt;Carlquistia muirii&lt;/I&gt; (and perhaps &lt;I&gt;Harmonia nutans&lt;/I&gt;) and &lt;I&gt;Anisocarpus scabridus&lt;/I&gt;. Next, rates of regulatory and structural gene evolution in the Hawaiian species were compared to those in related species of North American tarweeds. Molecular evolutionary analyses indicate significant increases in nonsynonymous relative to synonymous nucleotide substitution rates in the &lt;I&gt;ASAP3/TM6&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;ASAP1&lt;/I&gt; regulatory genes in the rapidly evolving Hawaiian species. By contrast, no general increase is evident in neutral mutation rates for these loci in the Hawaiian species. Finally, a group of potential rapidly-evolving genes were identified in &lt;I&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/I&gt; using a powerful evolutionary expressed sequence tag (EST) approach. One indicator of adaptive selection at the molecular level is an excess of amino acid replacement fixed differences per replacement site relative to the number of silent fixed differences per silent site (&lt;font face="symbol"&gt;w&lt;/font&gt; = Ka/Ks). The evolutionary EST approach was used to estimate the distribution of &lt;font face="symbol"&gt;w&lt;/font&gt; among 304 orthologous loci between &lt;I&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Arabidopsis lyrata&lt;/I&gt; to identify genes potentially involved in the adaptive divergence between these two Brassicaceae species. Twenty-one of 304 genes (7%) were found to have an estimated &lt;font face="symbol"&gt;w&lt;/font&gt; &gt; 1 and are candidates for genes associated with adaptive divergence. A hierarchical Bayesian analysis of protein coding region evolution within and between species also indicates that the selection intensities of these genes are elevated compared to typical &lt;I&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/I&gt; nuclear loci.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08162002-062003/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactions Between Phytophthora spp. and Castanea spp. and the Creation of a Genetic Linkage Map for the F1 Parent in a First-Generation Backcross Family of Castanea spp.</field><field name="creator">Bowles, Mollie Ellen</field><field name="description">Efforts are underway to restore the American chestnut, Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh, to its original range within the United States. The American Chestnut Foundation has traditionally focused on introducing blight resistance of the Chinese chestnut, C. mollissima Blume, into their breeding stock. Now, however, they are encountering problems with a root rot caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands, and the threat of a potential disease caused by Phytophthora ramorum Werres, De Cock, and Man in?t Venld. In order for the Foundation to breed for resistance against the effects of these pathogens, much more needs to be discovered regarding their interactions within Castanea. This thesis is part of the effort to understand these interactions. The first chapter provides a literature review of interactions for two Phytophthora species and Castanea spp. The second chapter presents experiments investigating the mode of inheritance and number of loci controlling resistance to each of these Phytophthora species. Initial experimentation appears to suggest that resistance to P. cinnamomi may be controlled by a single dominant gene in chestnut, but conclusive evidence from subsequent experiments was not found; possible causes are discussed. A series of screening assays based on leaf disk assays using P. ramorum also failed to provide conclusive evidence that a single locus controls the degree of response, but statistically significant differences were noted among seedlots in each trial, suggesting some level of genetic control. The third chapter presents a genetic linkage map developed from amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) markers for the F1 parent in a backcross family ((C. mollissima ?Mahogany? x C. dentata ?RCF1? = ?KY115?) x C. dentata ?WB348?). This purpose of this map is to correlate future resistance segregation patterns from controlled P. cinnamomi inoculation trials with specific marker loci. This would provide a foundation for future genetic research regarding the number of loci controlling resistance to root rot caused by P. cinnamomi and its relationship with other traits of interest in chestnuts.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08162006-093218/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hyaluronic Acid-based Nanofibers via Electrospinning</field><field name="creator">Young, Denice Shanette</field><field name="description">Electrospinning is a novel technology that uses an electric field to form fibrous materials from a polymer solution. Unlike traditional spinning techniques, electrospinning can produce fibers, on the order of 100 nm, that can be utilized in applications where nanoscale fibers are necessary for specific applications, including tissue engineering and filtration. Outside of a smaller fiber diameter, electrospun nanofibers are also advantageous for biomedical applications because they have a larger surface area and pore size which promotes cell growth. A number of polymers have been electrospun successfully, including polyethylene (PEO) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which are two the most investigated electrospun materials. For the purpose of this study, hyaluronic acid (HA), a widely used biopolymer found in the extracellular matrix, was the chosen polymer to investigate the successful production of HA nanofibers for use in tissue engineering. Few studies have been conducted on electrospinning HA. Indeed, when this project was initiated, no investigations on electrospinning HA had been published. The goal of this research was to produce continuous fibrous strands of HA to be used as a mesh or scaffolding material. The high viscosity and surface tension of HA make it challenging to electrospin, as both are important parameters in successful production of nanofibers. To promote HA fiber formation by electrospinning, the effects of salt (NaCl), which is used to reduce the viscosity of aqueous HA solutions; molecular weight of the HA; and an additional biocompatible polymer (e.g., PEO) were investigated.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08162006-095122/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurements and Modeling of Emissions, Dispersion and Dry Deposition of Ammonia from Swine Facilities</field><field name="creator">Bajwa, Kanwardeep Singh</field><field name="description">Ammonia has recently gained importance for its increasing atmospheric concentrations and its role in the formation of aerosols. Studies have shown increasing atmospheric concentration levels of NH3 and NH4+, especially in the regions of concentrated animal feeding operations. Atmospheric inputs of reduced nitrogen as ammonia and ammonium by dry and wet deposition may represent a substantial contribution to the acidification of semi natural ecosystems and could also affect sensitive coastal ecosystems and estuaries. The anaerobic lagoon and spray method, commonly used for waste storage and disposal in confined animal feeding operations (CAFO), is a significant source of ammonia emissions. An accurate emission model for ammonia from aqueous surfaces can help in the development of emission factors. Study of dispersion and dry deposition patterns of ammonia downwind of a hog farm will help us to understand how much ammonia gets dry deposited near the farm, and how remaining ammonia gets transported farther away. An experimental and modeling study is conducted of emissions, dispersion and dry deposition of ammonia taking one swine farm as a unit. Measurements of ammonia flux were made at 11 swine facilities in North Carolina using dynamic flow-through chamber system over the anaerobic waste treatment lagoons. Continuous measurements of ammonia flux, meteorological and lagoon parameters were made for 8-10 days at each farm during each of the warm and cold seasons. Ammonia concentrations were continuously measured in the chamber placed over the lagoon using a Thermo Environmental Instrument Incorporated (TECO) Model 17c chemiluminescnce ammonia analyzer. A similar ammonia analyzer was used to measure ammonia concentrations at selected locations on the farm. Barn emissions were measured using open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectroscopy. A 10 m meteorological tower was erected at each site to measure wind speed and direction, temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation. Data collected from field measurements made at hog waste lagoons in south eastern North Carolina, using the flow through dynamic chamber technique, were used to evaluate the Coupled Mass Transfer and Chemical Reactions model and Equilibrium model. Sensitivity analysis shows that ammonia flux increases exponentially with lagoon temperature and pH, but a linear increase was observed with an increase in total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN). Ammonia flux also shows a nonlinear increase with increasing wind speed. Observed ammonia fluxes were generally lower in the cold season than in the warm season when lagoon temperatures are higher. About 41% of the Equilibrium model predictions and 43% of the Coupled model predictions are found to be within a factor of two of the observed fluxes. Several model performance statistics were used to evaluate the performance of the two models against the observed flux data. These indicate that the simpler Equilibrium model does as well as the Coupled model. The possible effects of the ?artificial? environment within the chamber, which is different from that in the ambient atmospheric conditions above the open lagoon surface, on the measured fluxes are also recognized. Actual layout of barns and lagoons on the farms was used to simulate dry deposition downwind of the farm. Dry deposition velocity, dispersion and dry deposition of ammonia were studied over different seasons and under different stability conditions. Dry deposition velocities were underpredicted by AERMOD when compared with observed dry deposition velocities. Dry deposition velocities were the highest under near neutral conditions and lowest under stable conditions. The highest deposition at short range occurs under nighttime stable conditions and the lowest deposition occurs during daytime unstable conditions. Significant differences in model predicted depositions over crop and grass surfaces are found under stable conditions. Wind orientation at the farm can also affect deposition of ammonia downwind of the farm.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08162006-140754/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural Features of the Guide:Target RNA Duplex Required for Archaeal C/D sRNA Guided Nucleotide 2?-O-methylation.</field><field name="creator">Appel, Cathryn Denise</field><field name="description">Archaeal box C/D sRNAs guide the 2?-O-methylation of target nucleotides in both ribosomal and tRNAs. These small non-coding RNAs are characterized by conserved terminal box C/D and internal C?/D? RNA motifs. Each RNA motif binds three core proteins to establish individual RNP complexes that catalyze the site-specific 2?-O-methylation of target nucleotides. Specificity of nucleotide modification is determined by target RNA base pairing with complementary sRNA D or D? guide sequences. The fifth target nucleotide upstream from the D or D? box within the guide:target RNA is then methylated by the core proteins. In vitro assembly of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii sR8 box C/D RNA with recombinant core proteins, L7, Nop56/58, and fibrillarin produces a methylation-competent sRNP complex. This model box C/D sRNP has now been used to determine the structural features of the guide:target RNA duplex that are important for sRNA-guided nucleotide methylation. Watson-Crick pairing of guide and target nucleotides was essential for nucleotide methylation. Mismatched bases within the guide:target RNA duplex also disrupted target nucleotide methylation. Nucleotide methylation required that the guide:target duplex consist of an RNA:RNA helix as target deoxy-oligonucleotides possessing a target ribonucleotide were not methylated. Methylation specificity at the base paired guide:target nucleotide was compromised by elevated Mg2+ concentrations. In high divalent cation concentrations, target nucleotides not hydrogen bonded to the guide nucleotide were nevertheless methylated. Interestingly, D and D? target RNAs were methylated to different levels when deoxynucleotides were inserted within the target RNA or when target methylation was carried out in elevated Mg2+ concentrations. These results suggested that structural features unique to the box C/D and C?/D? RNPs affect their nucleotide methylation capabilities. Finally, the ability of the sR8 box C/D sRNP to methylate target nucleotides positioned within highly structured RNA hairpins suggested an intrinsic ability of this archaeal RNA:protein enzyme to unwind double-stranded target RNAs prior to nucleotide modification.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08162006-142559/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Realistic Molecular Models for Disordered Porous Carbons</field><field name="creator">Pikunic, Jorge</field><field name="description">The complex pore morphology and topology of many non-graphitizable porous carbons is not captured by the current molecular models that are used in analysis of adsorption isotherms. We present a novel constrained reverse Monte Carlo method to build models that quantitatively match carbon-carbon pair correlation functions obtained from experimental diffraction data of real nanoporous carbons. Our approach is based on reverse Monte Carlo with carefully selected constraints on the bond angles and carbon coordination numbers to describe the three-body correlations. Through successive Monte Carlo moves, using a simulated annealing scheme, the model structure is matched to the experimental diffraction data, subject to the imposed three-body constraints. We modeled a series of saccharose-based carbons and tested the resulting models against high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data. Simulated TEM images of the resulting structural models are in very good agreement with experimental ones. For the carbons studied, the pore structure is highly convoluted, and the commonly used slit pore model is not appropriate. We simulated adsorption of nitrogen and argon at 77 K using grand canonical Monte Carlo, and diffusion of argon at 300 K using canonical molecular dynamics simulations. The isosteric heats of adsorption at 77 K are in excellent agreement with experimental results. The adsorption isotherms and heats of adsorption in these models do not resemble those for fluids in slit pores having the same pore size distribution. We found that diffusion in the structural models is non-Fickian. Instead, a strong single-file character is observed, revealed by the proportionality of the mean square displacement to the square root of time at relatively long times. The single-file mode is a consequence of the small sizes of the quasi one-dimensional pores in the adsorbent models.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08172003-203233/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Revealed Preference and Time Series Analyses of U.S. Macroeconomic Aggregates</field><field name="creator">Maia Filho, Luiz Flavio</field><field name="description">This research extends the literature on the revealed preference analysis of macroeconomic aggregates in multiple ways. The relevance of recent methodological changes in data construction is our first topic, as Varian?s (1982, 1983) nonparametric tests are run on U.S. consumption series built under NIPA?s old and new methods. The results indicate that previous conclusions on the overall GARP-consistency of data and on weak separability of particular aggregates are affected by the methodological changes in data. Additionally, test results are observed to be sensitive to the adoption of series at different frequencies. The issue of temporal aggregation is examined in two ways. We initially show that those changes do not seem to have significantly altered the univariate time-series properties of aggregates or previous conclusions about the impacts of temporal aggregation on those properties; therefore, the aggregation of economic flows into annual figures is once more found to involve significant losses of information about the dynamic behavior of higher-frequency data. The power of the GARP test in datasets of different frequencies is then investigated from analytical and empirical standpoints. Time aggregation is found to reduce the power of the GARP test. Finally, we apply Varian?s tools to study for the first time a dataset including the value of nonmarket services produced inside the household. The modification involves a more detailed picture of consumers? allocation of time, alternatively a source of utility (leisure) or a resource in household production. We observe that the changing number of hours spent on average in household production ? due to the increasing participation of women in the civilian labor force over recent decades ? can be characterized as a rational decision made by the representative agent in a standard utility maximization model.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08172004-145905/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AFLP-based Genetic Diversity Assessment of Global Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas (L.)

Germplasm Resources: Progress Toward The Development of a Sweetpotato Core Collection.</field><field name="creator">Bruckner, Adam Wesley</field><field name="description">Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam) is an extremely diverse and important crop ranking seventh in terms of global production. It is grown throughout the world as a staple crop, and is particularly important in tropical developing countries due to its wide adaptability as well as its enormous potential for preventing malnutrition. The International Potato Center (CIP) in Lima, Peru and the USDA-ARS Plant Genetic Resources Conservation unit (PGRCU) in Griffin, Georgia are the most important sweetpotato gene banks worldwide. Roughly 7,000 and 750 accessions are present in each, respectively. Both collections have been characterized for many phenotypic traits of economic importance, and they are very important in terms of germplasm conservation, as they represent a vital resource for breeders seeking future genetic improvement of sweetpotato. The molecular genetic diversity present in each collection, however, is poorly understood. In this study, 775 accessions from the PGRCU collected from various countries were sampled and fingerprinted using AFLP markers derived from 10 primer pair combinations. A total of 183 polymorphic and clearly scorable bands were generated. Using polymorphisms and phylogenetic software (PAUP and NTSysPC), we were able to clearly distinguish a different banding pattern for each of the 775 accessions. A Neighbor-Joining phylogram was constructed and revealed 6 base clades with no region specificity. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was carried out using the software program Arlequin. The within-region variation at 97.94% was the major source of molecular variance. Pairwise genetic distances between regions were calculated and the smallest distance was between the Caribbean and Central America and the greatest distance was between the Pacific Islands and South America. Principle coordinate analysis (PCO) was performed by NTSysPC and several clusters of germplasm were noted. This research indicates that there is an abundance of genetic diversity present in sweetpotato.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08172004-152323/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contagion in Financial Markets: Two Statistical Approaches</field><field name="creator">Rao, Harshavardhana</field><field name="description">Financial markets in different countries undergo crises at one point in time or another.

This per-path distortion is particularly significant in outdoor UWB applications, where line-of-sight (LOS) or non-distorted reflected signals might not be available at the receiver (for example, in a canyon-like street). In these cases, the dominant propagation mechanisms involve shadowing (diffraction) and reflection by small objects (e.g. signs or lamp-posts). In this dissertation, a physical model is developed to investigate the position-dependent distortion of the UWB pulse. The results indicate that both the shadowed pulse and the reflected pulse (by small objects with dimensions bounded by the wavelengths present in the signal) are distorted. Design of optimal and suboptimal templates for the correlation receiver are investigated. The UWB pulses that accommodate robust template choice given by the transmit pulse shape for all propagation conditions and satisfy the FCC spectral mask for outdoor channels are identified. Finally, we analyze the frequency-dependent propagation gain of the UWB channels in various outdoor conditions. This knowledge quantifies the potential benefits of adapting the transmitted signal to the dominant propagation mechanism.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08172006-145718/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Networking in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks</field><field name="creator">Jun, Jangeun</field><field name="description">In modern communication systems, wireless ad hoc networking has become an irreplaceable technology where communication infrastructure is insufficient or unavailable. An ad hoc network is a collection of self-organizing nodes that are rapidly deployable and adaptable to frequent topology changes. In this dissertation, the key problems related to the network layer (i.e., forwarding, routing, and network-layer topology control) are addressed. The problem of unfair forwarding in ad hoc nodes is identified and cross-layer solutions are proposed. Because a typical ad hoc node functions both as a router and a host, severe unfairness occurs between originated and forwarded packets which eventually leads to a serious starvation problem. The results show that, to restore the fairness and enhance the capacity efficiency, non-traditional queueing schemes are required where both the network and the MAC layers should be considered together. Routing is a critical protocol, which directly affects the scalability and reliability of wireless ad hoc networks. A good routing protocol for wireless ad hoc networks should overcome the dynamic nature of the topology arising from unreliable wireless links and node mobility. In ad hoc networks, it is very important to balance the route accuracy and overhead efficiency. A number of routing protocols have been proposed for wireless ad hoc networks, but it is well known that current routing protocols scale poorly with the number of nodes, the number of traffic flows, the intensity of mobility. The main objective of this dissertation is to provide efficient routing protocols for different types of wireless ad hoc networks including wireless mesh networks (WMNs), mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), and wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Since each category has different assumptions and constraints, different solutions should be considered. WMNs and WSNs have low mobility and centralized (one-to-any) traffic patterns while MANETs have relatively high mobility and uniform (any-to-any) traffic patterns. WSNs are highly resource-constrained while WMNs are not. A new routing protocol specially designed for WMNs is proposed. Simulation experiments show that the protocol outperforms existing generic ad hoc routing protocols. This improvement is enabled by the essential characteristics of WMNs, and as a result, the protocol does not rely on bandwidth-greedy flooding mechanism. For MANET routing, an existing de facto the standard Internet intra-AS (autonomous system) routing protocol is extended to enhance the scalability in ad hoc environments. When extended for MANETs, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is expected to provide the benefits of maturity, interoperability, and scalability. The scalability extension is two-fold: the notions of distance effect and multiple areas are explored as extensions. Both approaches provide significant gain in scalability by efficiently reducing flooding overhead without compromising routing or forwarding performance. Finally, a new scalable and reliable sensor network routing is proposed. Since WSNs are the most resource-constrained type of ad hoc networks, the protocol should be very simple yet reliable. The proposed WSN routing protocol is designed to provide reliability (via multi-path redundancy), scalability (with efficiently contained flooding), and flexibility (source-tunable per-packet priority), which are achieved without adding protocol complexity or resource consumption. The protocol is implemented on real sensor motes and its performance is tested through outdoor sensor field deployments. The results show that the protocol outperforms even sophisticated link estimation based sensor network routing protocols.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08172006-150002/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the Effect of Lime on Performance of Hot Mix Asphalt using Advanced Testing and Modeling Techniques</field><field name="creator">Lee, Sangyum</field><field name="description">The benefits of using hydrated lime as an additive in asphalt concrete are well known. When added to asphalt concrete mixtures hydrated lime shows the beneficial effects of filler, while also improving resistance to moisture damage. This study presents findings from four studies into the impact of hydrated lime, the impact of lime introduction method on the volumetric optimums, and the performance evaluation of unmodified and lime-modified hot mix asphalt (HMA) mixtures at varying asphalt contents using Simple Performance Tests developed from the NCHRP projects 9-19 and 9-29 and the viscoelastic continuum damage (VECD) finite element analysis. The performance characteristics evaluated in this study include fatigue cracking and rutting behavior in both dry and moisture-conditioned states. Test methods adopted in this evaluation are: the dynamic modulus test for stiffness characterization; the triaxial repeated load permanent deformation test for rutting characterization, and the direct tension test for fatigue cracking characterization. From the experimental investigation it is found that the method of lime introduction can have an important effect on the optimum volumetric asphalt content. Regarding dynamic modulus it is found that hydrated lime has a minimal impact on the mixtures in this study. However, the findings from this study support conventional understanding of the effects of asphalt content, lime modification, and moisture conditioning on the fatigue cracking and rutting performance of HMA mixtures. That is, as asphalt content increases, the resistance to fatigue cracking improves and rutting performance worsens. Another accepted fact is that lime modification reduces the susceptibility for moisture damage in terms of both fatigue cracking and rutting. The contribution of this paper, therefore, is to demonstrate advanced test methods and models that can be used in the performance evaluation of various mixtures. With additional validation and calibration, the comprehensive methodology described in this paper may serve as the foundation for a performance-based HMA mix design and performance-related HMA specifications.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08172007-011334/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Egyptian Red Slip Pottery at Aila</field><field name="creator">Williams, Cheri Lynne</field><field name="description">The Roman Aqaba Project, an archaeological investigation of a Roman port on the Red Sea in southern Jordan, recovered over 500 sherds of Egyptian Red Slip Ware (ERS). This included both ERS A (presumably from the Aswan region of Upper Egypt) and ERS B (from various production centers along the Nile valley). ERS was the second most common imported fine ware found at Aila from the Late Roman and Byzantine periods (3rd through early 7th centuries A.D.), trailing far behind African Red Slip Ware (from Tunisia) but easily exceeding imports of Cypriote Red Slip and Phocaean Red Slip (from the Aegean). The most striking fact about the ERS at Aila is its chronological distribution. In most parts of Palestine and Jordan ERS appears in quantity only in the late 6th and 7th centuries. But at Aila both ERS A and ERS B wares begin appearing in securely attested 3rd century contexts and are most common in the 4th century, long before their appearance in the remainder of the Levant, generally in late 6th and 7th centuries.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08172009-104842/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimating the Effectiveness of Special Education Using Large-Scale Assessment Data.</field><field name="creator">Ewing, Katherine Anne</field><field name="description">The inclusion of students with disabilities in large scale assessment and accountability programs has provided new opportunities to examine the impact of special education services on student achievement. Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (1998, 2002) evaluated the effectiveness of special education programs by examining students&#226; gains on a large-scale assessment of student achievement in Texas as they entered and exited special education programs. They found that special education placement resulted in an overall increase in the achievement scores of students with disabilities. The current study aimed to replicate and extend Hanushek et al.&#226;s research using scores from the End-of-Grade Tests of Reading Comprehension and Mathematics for 396,828 students with and without disabilities who participated in special and/or general education programs over 5 academic years in the state of North Carolina. Results of multiple regression analyses revealed support for the effectiveness of special education programs. After controlling for school characteristics, cohort, regression to the mean, and accommodations use, entry into special education programs remained a significant predictor of students&#226; gain scores on large-scale assessments of reading and mathematics. Students with disabilities made significantly larger gains when enrolled in special education programs than when enrolled in general education programs, and gains were found for most of the subgroups of special education students examined in the study. A discussion of the implications for practice, limitations of the study, and suggestions for future research are provided.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08172009-171328/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nestmate recognition and population genetic structure in the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile.</field><field name="creator">Buczkowski, Grzegorz Andrzej</field><field name="description">The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, is a widespread invasive species characterized by reduced intraspecific aggression within its introduced range. To gain an understanding of mechanisms underlying nestmate recognition in the Argentine ant, I studied its population genetic structure and the role of genetic vs. environmental cues on aggression. I combine behavioral, genetic, and analytical data to explore the role of exogenous cues and recent changes in the population genetic structure on nestmate recognition in this ant. In Chapter II, I examined population genetic structure and intercolony aggression in two portions of the Argentine ant introduced range: California and the southeastern U.S. I describe factors that may have contributed to the present-day differences in genetic diversity between these two regions and I also suggest ecological factors that may have contributed to regional differences in current distribution patterns of the Argentine ant. In Chapter III, I examined the context-dependency of nestmate discrimination in the Argentine ant and the effect of action thresholds on exogenous cue recognition. I also tested hypotheses that explain a change in action thresholds as well as factors that affect action thresholds. I examined changes in intraspecific aggression in various discrimination contexts. I tested the importance of isolated nest referents on aggression thresholds. In Chapter IV, I examined the impact of different diet-derived hydrocarbons on intraspecific aggression in the Argentine ant and the potential of shared, diet-derived hydrocarbons to produce colony uniformity where intercolony genetic and/or environmental differences exist. In Chapter V, I examined the role of environmental cues on nestmate recognition in two populations of the Argentine ant. I tested the hypothesis that there is geographical variation in the response of Argentine ants to nestmate recognition cues derived from prey. In Appendix I, I use the Argentine ant to compare four aggression bioassays for consistency between replicates, similarity between assays, and ability to predict whole colony interactions. I tested four different aggression assays with two or three scoring methods per assay. I also determined whether isolated aggressive encounters could predict whole colony interactions.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08182003-091509/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling and Control of Piezoceramic Actuators for Nanopositioning</field><field name="creator">Zhong, Jinghua</field><field name="description">Actuators from piezoceramic materials have established themselves in a large number of applications, especially nano-scale positioning tasks because of their high-frequency response behavior and their essentially infinite resolution. However, the potential of these actuators has been impaired by the lack of adequate hysteresis models and control methods to compensate the undesirable non-linear, hysteretic and rate-dependent behavior of piezoceramic materials. In this thesis, representative actuation experiments are conducted on a typical commercially available piezoceramic stack actuator to characterize the rate-dependence of its hysteretic behavior over a large stroke under different loading rates. A strongly physics oriented energy model is implemented to verify its ability in modeling dynamic hysteretic behaviors. By extending this model, a computationally efficient implementation is developed with a drastic improvement in speed. Finally, a preliminary version of the energy model for the piezoceramic material is implemented in an optimal control program to illustrate the features and potential of the method. The implementations constitute the basis for future development of advanced realtime control algorithms for piezoceramic actuators.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08182003-201924/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analytical tools for population-based association studies</field><field name="creator">Liu, Youfang</field><field name="description">Disease gene fine mapping is an important task in human genetic research. Association analysis is becoming a primary approach for localizing disease loci, especially when abundant SNPs are available due to the well improved genotyping technology during the last decades. Despite the rapid improvement of detection ability, there are many limitations of association strategy. In this dissertation, we focused on three different topics including haplotype similarity based test, association test incorporating genotyping error and simulation tool for large data set. 1) Previous haplotype similarity based tests don&#226;t have the ability to incorporate covariates in the test. In chapter 2, we proposed a new association method based on haplotype similarity that incorporates covariates and utilizes maximum amount of data information. We found that our method gives power improvement when neither LD nor allele frequency is too low and is comparable under other scenarios. 2) In chapter 3, we proposed a new strategy that incorporates the genotyping uncertainty to assess the association between traits and SNPs. Extensive simulation studies for case-control designs demonstrated that intensity information based association test can reduce the impact induced by genotyping error. 3) In chapter 4, we described simulation software, SimuGeno, which is used to simulate large scale genomic data for case-control association studies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08182008-161113/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Data Clustering via Dimension Reduction and Algorithm Aggregation</field><field name="creator">Race, Shaina L</field><field name="description">We focus on the problem of clustering large textual data sets.

It is well understood that local project assessment approaches fail to identify, or worse quantify, indirect or cumulative effects, when they do not provide an appropriate baseline framework to understand the local and the regional environment as a connected entity. A conceptual approach based on several environmental assessment and spatial analysis tools suggests that we need to consider multi-scale methods that can help describe the different processes that occur within a region. This would help project managers and researchers to better evaluate ongoing regional policies by retrieving a wide characterization of the application and impacts of policies within the whole geographical spectrum. Within each policy assessment, these methods could evolve into a framework for environmental management practices at both local and regional scales that could be updated with new information through time. We analyze two regional policy case studies: poverty targeting in Sri Lanka, and payments for ecosystem services in Costa Rica.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08182008-212000/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Patellar Height of the Cranial Cruciate Ligament Deficient Canine Stifle Following Three Tibial Osteotomy Procedures.</field><field name="creator">Crimi, Christopher Scott</field><field name="description">The cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) plays a significant role in providing functional stability to the canine stifle joint and has been the topic of an increasing amount of attention in the veterinary community. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of CCL deficiency and common procedures for treatment of a ruptured CCL on patellar location within the trochlear groove. Five identical and anatomically accurate physical models of the left hind limb of a healthy dog were constructed using a combination of rapid-prototyping technologies and casting techniques. One model remained the intact control, one simulated a CCL deficient stifle and each of the remaining models underwent one of the three tibial osteotomy procedures to be examined: the Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy (TPLO), Tibial Tuberosity Advancement (TTA), and the Triple Tibial Osteotomy (TTO). Physical testing via a custom testing apparatus was carried out for five stifle positions (75&#194;&#186;, 96&#194;&#186;, 113&#194;&#186;, 130&#194;&#186;, 148&#194;&#186;) representing the normal range of motion of a large-breed dog. Confirmation of a cranial translation following transection of the CCL was in good agreement with literature. Cranial cruciate transection also caused a slight proximal shift of the patella with respect to the trochlear groove. The results of the models further suggest that both the TPLO and TTO procedures result in a more proximally located patella with respect to the trochlear groove, while the TTA results in a more distally located patella.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08182008-225839/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stresses in the Cranial Cruciate Ligament Deficient Canine Stifle Following Three Tibial Osteotomy Procedures: A Finite Element Analysis.</field><field name="creator">Crimi, Christina Marie</field><field name="description">Cranial cruciate rupture remains one of the most widely diagnosed and threatening conditions to stifle stability and rear limb function in dogs. The objective of this research was to evaluate the post-operative effects of three commonly practiced corrective surgeries for a CCL deficient canine stifle. A fully three-dimensional, anatomically accurate, quasi-static, nonlinear computer model of the entire left hind limb of a healthy dog was analyzed via finite element analysis. This model was then modified to simulate CCL deficiency and subsequent treatment by means of three different surgical procedures: the Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy (TPLO), Tibial Tuberosity Advancement (TTA) and the Triple Tibial Osteotomy (TTO). Analysis was carried out for three stifle positions (75&#194;&#186;, 113&#194;&#186;, 148&#194;&#186;) representing the normal range of motion of a large-breed dog. An increase in stress on the CaCL was apparent in flexion and in good accordance with literature and physical testing. The results of the models suggest that throughout the range of motion the TPLO increased the stress in the patellar ligament to a higher degree than did the TTA or TTO. Additionally, the TTA appeared to increase the stress of the CaCL more than the TPLO or TTO did at 75&#194;&#186; of stifle flexion and, overall, the TTO resulted in a more consistent stress distribution. These results will give veterinary orthopedic surgeons a better understanding of the effects of these procedures on the geometry and function of the canine stifle throughout a normal range of motion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08182008-225840/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hierarchical Bayesian application to instantaneous rates tag-return models</field><field name="creator">Krachey, Matthew James</field><field name="description">Natural mortality has always been a challenging quantity to estimate in harvested populations. The most common approaches to estimation include a regression model based on life history parameters and more recently tag-return models. In recent years, Bayesian methods have been increasingly implemented in ecological models due to their ability to handle increased model complexity and auxiliary datasets. In this dissertation, I explore the implementation of Bayesian methods to analyze tag-return data focusing on natural mortality. Chapter 1 is focused on the addition of two components to the tag-return model framework: random effects and auxiliary data. Auxiliary information on the instantaneous rate of natural mortality is provided through Hoenig's equation relating lifespan to natural mortality, and also implemented through a hierarchical prior. A simulation study validates the performance of the model while an analysis of the classic Cayuga Lake trout dataset demonstrates its use. Chapter 2 adds a change-point allowing for the estimation of two levels of natural mortality and the timing of the discrete-time shift in mortality. Analysis is focused on a Chesapeake Bay striped bass tagging dataset of fish tagged at six years of age and older from 1991-2002. Results show the ability to account for shift in timing. Contrasting with Jiang et al.'s study on the same striped bass dataset, the timing of the change-point was different between the two studies, likely because the Jiang study assumed a fixed tag-reporting probability of 0.43 whereas estimates seem to indicate it may be closer to 0.3. Chapter 3 introduces a change-point allowing for a shift in the tag-reporting probability while assuming a constant natural mortality rate. High reward tags are included in a subset of the data time-series to improve estimation. A factorial simulation design was used to investigate the model performance with different reporting rate and high reward tag scenarios. In general, the model performed very well with little bias except in the case of no high-reward tags. The model performed surprisingly well in a six year study. The results suggest the importance of high reporting rates and/ or auxiliary data sources such as high reward tags.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08182009-100250/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variations on the Accelerated Failure Time Model: Mixture Distributions, Cure Rates, and Different Censoring Scenarios</field><field name="creator">Krachey, Elizabeth Catherine</field><field name="description">The accelerated failure time (AFT) model is a popular model for time-to-event data. It provides a useful alternative when the proportional hazards assumption is in question and it provides an intuitive linear regression interpretation where the logarithm of the survival time is regressed on the covariates. We have explored several deviations from the standard AFT model. Standard survival analysis assumes that in the case of perfect follow-up, every patient will eventually experience the event of interest. However, in some clinical trials, a number of patients may never experience such an event, and in essence, are considered cured from the disease. In such a scenario, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve will level off at a nonzero proportion. Hence there is a window of time in which most or all of the events occur, while heavy censoring occurs in the tail. The two-component mixture cure model provides a means of adjusting the AFT model to account for this cured fraction. Chapters 1 and 2 propose parametric and semiparametric estimation procedures for this cure rate AFT model. Survival analysis methods for interval-censoring have been much slower to develop than for the right-censoring case. This is in part because interval-censored data have a more complex censoring mechanism and because the counting process theory developed for right-censored data does not generalize or extend to interval-censored data. Because of the analytical difficulty associated with interval-censored data, recent estimation strategies have focused on the implementation rather than the large sample theoretical justifications of the semiparametric AFT model. Chapter 3 proposes a semiparametric Bayesian estimation procedure for the AFT model under interval-censored data.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08182009-102357/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of Hybrid Strains of Saccharomyces pastorianus for Desiccation Tolerance and Fermentation Performance</field><field name="creator">Layfield, Johnathon Blake</field><field name="description">Dry yeast can be utilized in both ale and lager beer production to provide an inexpensive source of large amounts of viable cells for fermentation. This study examines the desiccation tolerance of different strains of S. pastorianus and the subsequent fermentation performance in comparison to S. cerevisiae. The use of active dry brewer&#226;s yeast (ADY), Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as a starter for the production of ales has been gaining popularity within the brewing industry, spurring manufactures to also produce active dry lager yeast (ADLY), S. pastorianus. The drying process is known to have a greater negative effect on the cell viability and physiology of ADLY than that of ADY, possibly due to the fastidious growth, low production temperature and poor thermotolerance of S. pastorianus. This may result in lower cell viability and concentration of ADLY starter cultures, which could lead to stuck or slow fermentations. S. pastorianus is a hybrid organism resulting from a cross between S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus. It has been proposed that it can be categorized into two distinct groups: Group 1 (S. pastorianus- Saaz type) has lost a significant amount of the genomic content contained within S. cerevisiae and is therefore closer to S. bayanus; while Group 2 (S. pastorianus- Frohberg type) has retained almost all of the genomic content of S. cerevisiae. To investigate whether these two groups differ in their tolerance to desiccation, both groups of S. pastorianus were spray dried at 140oC and rehydrated in phosphate buffer at 25oC for 30 minutes. The viability of the rehydrated cultures was determined using microscopic and viable cell counts. The fermentation performance of the cultures was tested by inoculating equal counts of viable rehydrated cells into brewer&#226;s wort and monitoring changes in cell count, carbohydrate and alcohol concentration until completion. The findings suggest that the S. pastorianus- Frohberg type is less tolerant to desiccation than either S. cerevisiae or S. pastorianus- Saaz type. The Frohberg type shows evidence of membrane damage which could delay the onset of fermentation. Utilization of the correct strain of ADLY could reduce the possibility of contamination or extended lag phases leading to stuck fermentations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08182009-130032/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Copenhagen: A Brechtian Play</field><field name="creator">Crowdus, Cynthia Marie</field><field name="description">The purpose of this essay is to indicate the Brechtian elements of Michael Frayn's Copenhagen.

Five scenarios were developed assuming a significant percentage of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles to compare different feedstock fuels and technologies to produce hydrogen. The five hydrogen scenarios are: Central Natural Gas, Central Coal Gasification, Central Thermochemical Nuclear, Distributed Natural Gas, and Distributed Electrolysis. The Basecase used to compare emissions was the Annual Energy Outlook 2006 Report that estimated vehicle and electricity mix in year 2030. A sixth scenario, High Hybrid, was included to compare vehicle technologies that currently exist to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles that commercially do not exist. All hydrogen scenarios assumed 30% of the U.S. light-duty fleet to be hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in year 2030. Energy, greenhouse emissions, and criteria pollutant emissions including volatile organic compounds, particulate matter, sulfur dioxides, nitrogen dioxides, and carbon monoxide were evaluated. Results show that the production of hydrogen using thermochemical nuclear technology is the most beneficial in terms of energy usage, greenhouse gas emissions, and criteria pollutant emissions. Energy usage decreased by 36%, greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 46% or 9.6 x 108 tons, and criteria emissions were reduced by 28-47%. The centrally-produced hydrogen scenarios proved to be more energy efficient and overall release fewer emissions than the distributed hydrogen production scenarios.

Physical and chemical variables were measured at numerous points in the streambed of a 0.26 km reach: hydraulic conductivity (K) and head gradient (J), and concentrations of NO3- and other N species in the streambed groundwater, from which water (v=KJ) and N fluxes (e.g., fNO3=v[NO3-]) through the streambed were computed, mapped, and integrated in space. The result was a novel set of streambed maps of the linked variables (K, J, v, N concentrations and fluxes), showing their spatial variability and how it varied over a year (based on 7 bimonthly sets of maps). Mean fNO3 during the study year was 154 mmol m-2 day-1; this NO3- flux, together with that of DON (fDON = 17 mmol m-2 day-1) accounted for &gt;99% of the total dissolved N flux through the streambed. Repeat measurements at the same locations on the streambed show significant temporal variability in fNO3, largely controlled by changes in v rather than changes in [NO3-]. One of the clearest and most temporally-persistent aspects of spatial variability was lateral variability across the channel from bank to bank. K and v had &#226;center-high&#226; patterns (greater values in the center of the channel); this distribution of K (ultimately a reflection of sediment dynamics in the channel) apparently focuses groundwater discharge toward the center of the channel. The opposite &#226;center-low&#226; pattern was found for J, [NO3-], and (to a lesser extent) fNO3. Contrary to suggestions in some prior work, J was not a good index for v. fNO3 was characterized by localized zones of high and low values that changed in size and shape over time but remained in basically the same locations (the same was true of K, J, [NO3-], though less so for v), with 70% of NO3- flux occurring through about 38% of the streambed area. Lateral distributions of the physical hydrologic attributes (K, J, v) were highly symmetrical across the channel, while those of [NO3-] and fNO3 showed higher values on the right than left, likely a reflection of different N use on opposite sides of the stream. These and other results show the streambed-based approach taken here can offer a number of insights not possible with reach mass-balance approaches in which net exchange between a stream reach and surrounding groundwater is calculated using surface water data.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08192008-131832/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distal Histidine Conformational Flexibility in Dehaloperoxidase from Amphitrite Ornata</field><field name="creator">Chen, Zuxu</field><field name="description">The enzyme dehaloperoxidase (DHP) from the terebellid polychaete Amphitrite ornata is a heme protein, which has a globin fold, but can function as both a hemoglobin and a peroxidase. As a peroxidase, DHP is capable of converting para-halogenated phenols to the corresponding quinones in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. As a hemoglobin, DHP cycles between the oxy and deoxy states as it reversibly binds oxygen for storage. Herein, we report that the distal histidine shows a large conformational flexibility in the deoxy form. Crystals of deoxy ferrous DHP were obtained by reducing the ferric wild-type DHP in sodium dithionite solution and the structure was determined at 100K to a resolution of 1.22&#195;. The heme iron in the deoxy ferrous DHP is five-coordinate and has an out-of-plane displacement of 0.23 &#195; for the heme iron relative to the oxy form. The distal histidine, H55 is observed in conformations, which are analogous to the open and closed forms of myoglobin. In the closed conformation, H55 is located inside the distal pocket, but does not penetrate as deeply into the distal pocket as in the metaquo ferric or oxy ferrous structures. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that H55 interacts with heme iron ligands through hydrogen bonding in the closed conformation. There are two open or solvent-exposed conformations, in which H55 is more than 9.5 &#195; away from the heme. The comparison of the deoxy structure with the other structures provides new insight into the correlation between the heme iron ligation and the conformation of distal histidine in the DHP.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08192008-155102/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analyzing Security Attacks to Generate Signatures from Vulnerable Architectural Patterns</field><field name="creator">Gegick, Michael</field><field name="description">Current techniques for software security vulnerability identification include the use of abstract, graph-based models to represent information about an attack. These models can be in the form of attack trees or attack nets and can be accompanied with a supporting text-based profile. Matching the abstract models to specific system architectures for effective vulnerability identification can be a challenging process. This thesis suggests that abstract regular expressions can be used to represent events of known attacks for the identification of security vulnerabilities in future applications. The process of matching the events in the regular expression to a sequence of components in a system design may facilitate the means of identifying vulnerabilities. Performing the approach in the design phase of a software process encourages security to be integrated early into a software application. Students in an undergraduate security course demonstrated a strong ability to accurately match regular expressions to a system design. The identification of vulnerabilities is limited to known attacks of other systems and does not offer descriptions of what new attacks are possible to a future application. Extending the approach to incorporate new attacks is an avenue of future work.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08202004-171053/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What Disappears and What Remains: Representations of Social Fluidity in the Post-Apocalypse</field><field name="creator">Smith, Christina Jean</field><field name="description">Humanity has long been enamored by the notion of our own demise. Recent events, however, have altered our end-of-the-world imaginings. Suddenly we have the ability to split an atom and destroy whole cities, whole countries - making us gods capable of bringing about our own end. With this knowledge, a new breed of apocalyptic tale has emerged, the post-apocalyptic novel. This study aims to look at three such works and examine the ways in which various authors have, in the past sixty years, envisioned humanity's fate after the end of the world - focusing specifically on the concepts of social fluidity and change as they play out in these landscapes that are both sterile and living at the same time. Chapter one of this thesis deals with Walter Miller's A Canticle for Leibowitz and examines the deterministic techno-primitive social cycle that Miller, a mere decade removed from the dropping of the A-bomb, saw playing out in a post-apocalyptic world. Chapter two looks at Cormac McCarthy's The Road and shows the "society of two", a father and son, who manage to maintain notions of family and society by carefully incorporating fragments of the old, rotting society into their schema of feral domesticity. Chapter three examines a short story, "Speech Sounds" by Octavia Butler, and discusses the paradoxically moving but stunted social landscape of Butler's silent, post-apocalyptic realm.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08212007-162538/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prophylactic enrichment of enterocyte phospholipids with polyunsaturated fatty acids fed to suckling piglets.</field><field name="creator">Hess, Holly Aline</field><field name="description">Infant formula companies began fortifying formulas with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in 2002, including arachidonic acid (AA) at ~ 0.5% of total fatty acids. This study is the first in a series that will examine effects of supra-physiological supplementation of AA on intestinal health. The objective was to determine the time specific effects of dietary AA on fatty acid composition of enterocyte phospholipids and on the mRNA abundance of hepatic &#8710;6- and &#8710;5-desaturases. One d old pigs (N=96) were fed a milk-based formula for 4, 8, or 16 d. Diets contained either no PUFA (0%AA, negative control), 0.5%AA, 2.5%AA, 5%AA, or 5% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) of total fatty acids. Growth (299 +/- 21 g/d) was unaffected by treatment (P&gt;0.1). By day 16, ileal enterocyte phospholipid concentrations of AA were enriched 176%, 280%, and 355% in pigs fed the 0.5%AA, 2.5%AA, and 5%AA diets, respectively, compared with the 0%AA control (P&lt;0.05). Concentration of AA within enterocytes of the 5% EPA fed group was similar to that of the 0%AA fed pigs, while EPA concentration increased by &gt;8 fold. As pigs aged from birth to 16 d of age, there were no differences in the desaturase mRNA abundance (P&gt;0.1), measured in pigs fed 0.5% or 5%AA. Abundance also was similar among AA-supplemented pigs, but was elevated by 60-80% in the 0%AA-fed pigs compared to those fed 2.5% (P&lt;0.05). These data demonstrate a dose-dependent response in enterocyte AA concentration to dietary AA and show that supra-physiologic supplementation of AA is not detrimental to growth or desaturase gene expression.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08222006-165814/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel Chiral Diamines and (S)-6-Chloronicotine Derivatives as Catalysts for Asymmetric Synthesis</field><field name="creator">Capracotta, Sonja Siefert</field><field name="description">Many enantiomerically pure products with biological activities are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry due to their effectiveness. As such, procedures that produce stereochemically pure compounds are highly desirable. Asymmetric synthesis using chiral compounds has become the preferred way to make enantiopure material. For example, selectively synthesizing secondary alcohols that are ubiquitous in natural products and pharmaceuticals can be achieved through the catalytic asymmetric addition of an alkylzinc to an aldehyde. In the Comins group, we have developed new chiral diamines, amino alcohols, and amino phosphines to test in asymmetric reactions, such as the catalytic addition of diethylzinc to benzaldehyde, and palladium-catalyzed allylic alkylation. Each of these catalysts has a nitrogen containing heterocycle and is synthesized in a few steps from commercially available materials, such as ephedrine and (S)-nicotine. Overall, the amino alcohol derivatives provided the best results in the catalytic asymmetric addition of diethylzinc to various aldehydes, while the amino phosphines showed promise in the palladium-catalyzed allylic alkylation of racemic 1,3-diphenylpropen-2-yl acetate with dimethyl malonate. However, these nicotine&#226;based catalysts did not show great selectivity or usefulness in other metal&#226;catalyzed reactions, such as zinc alkynylations to aldehydes, copper&#226;catalyzed 1,4&#226;additions, the Henry reaction, and allylic oxidations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08222008-144938/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DIfferences in Sediment Organic Matter Composition and PAH Weathering Between Non-Vegetated and Recently Vegetated Fuel-Oiled Sediments</field><field name="creator">Gregory, Samuel Thorne III</field><field name="description">Previous results have shown a strong correlation between vegetation and dissipation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contamination over long time frames. Evidence of phytoremediation over shorter time frames is difficult to detect, particularly in sites where overall PAH concentrations have not begun to significantly decrease. This study assessed the impact of vegetation on a highly contaminated sediment over a short time frame in order to track the effects of plant derived organic carbon (PdOC) in a variety of sediment compartments. The Indiana Harbor Canal is an industrialized area with historic petroleum contamination of near-shore sediments. In 2002, near-shore sediments were planted with hybrid poplar and willow trees as part of a phytoremediation treatability study. Site disturbance allowed for colonization by cattails and Phragmites. In 2004, non-vegetated and vegetated oiled-shore sediments were collected and analyzed for 42 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), total organic carbon, and percent modern carbon (&#61508;14C radiocarbon). Sediments were collected from several locations, field-composited, homogenized, sieved, and chemically fractionated. There is a significant input of modern carbon in both labile and recalcitrant fractions of vegetated sediments that is absent in the non-vegetated control. Phragmites sediments contained more modern carbon (plant carbon) and more weathered PAH ratios than willow, cattail, and non-vegetated sediments. Organic carbon-normalized PAH concentrations were greater in Phragmites humin than other sediments. Humin fractions of willow trees were more weathered than non-vegetated humin, but modern carbon values were not always different. Cattail humin contained more modern carbon than non-vegetated humin, but only de-ashed humin was more weathered than non-vegetated de-ashed humin. Results show that sediment composition and PAH weathering indices are not indicative of reduced PAH concentrations. Instead, PAH weathering appears related to increased modern carbon (plant carbon) content. Substantial increases in modern carbon content were observed after two years of plant growth. These results suggest that PdOC is diffusing into a variety of sediment compartments where it may be enhancing carbon cycling and beginning to mitigate PAH concentrations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toxicology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08232007-163859/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flavor Formation in Skim Milk Powder and Flavor Carry-Through into Ingredient Applications</field><field name="creator">Caudle, Alissa Dawn</field><field name="description">Skim milk powder (SMP) is commonly used as a food ingredient.

Individual strains of L. monocytogenes were initially surveyed for their ability to attach to surfaces and form biofilms under a variety of conditions. Five strains of L. monocytogenes were then screened for optimal cell attachment and biofilm formation. Significant differences in surface attachment and biofilm formation were observed among the different strains of L. monocytogenes. The biofilms of the five-strain mixture of L. monocytogenes were formed on surfaces that are commonly used in food processing facilities, such as stainless steel and Teflon&#174;. The biofilms were subjected to the SFP system in sequential 24-h daily cycles. Conditions of the SFP system included: starvation, washing, rinsing, and sanitation that routinely occur in a food processing plant. Cell survival in biofilms was determined during the time course of the experiment. The susceptibility of the cells in biofilms and detached cells to different sanitizers was measured. The morphology of the cells in biofilms and the planktonic cells detached from biofilms was observed. The study indicated that the progressive resistance developed by L. monocytogenes biofilms to a sanitizer could protect the cells in biofilms from this and other sanitizing agents. The progressive resistance and cross protection was observed in biofilms, but not in detached cells. These findings could provide a basis for further research on the mechanism of progressive resistance to stresses by L. monocytogenes in biofilms under food processing conditions.

In the laboratory, the suitability of an alternative prey species balsam woolly adelgid (BWA), Adelges piceae Ratz., for predator feeding, oviposition, immature development, and long-term survival was compared to the primary prey HWA. The BWA was found to be a suitable host to support predator feeding and development but was found to negatively influence S. tsugae survival. Field studies of S. tsugae tested the utility of multi-point, low-density, confined releases in mesh sleeve cages as an alternative to a routinely utilized single-point, high-density, free release for introducing the predator to forest and ornamental sites in Western North Carolina. The studies found that S. tsugae will reproduce inside sleeve cages and can survive for up to one month in confinement, but field establishment of the predator could not be confirmed. In the greenhouse a method for artificially inoculating hemlock seedlings with HWA and comparing levels of host resistance among hemlock species was tested. Using this method, initial infestation rates and fecundity of HWA were compared among three species of hemlock native to North America: eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), Carolina hemlock (T. caroliniana), and western hemlock (T. heterophylla). Infestations were significantly and four-fold higher on eastern hemlock compare to those on Carolina and western hemlock that did not differ. A second greenhouse trial assessed the rooting ability of softwood stem cuttings from mature specimens of eastern and Carolina hemlock. The study found that eastern hemlock cuttings rooted best with no hormone applications and at higher rates than Carolina hemlock which required very low concentrations of auxin.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08252008-094603/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vocational Status as a Moderator of Substance Abusers? Employability</field><field name="creator">Karuntzos, Georgia Tryphon</field><field name="description">In response to a congressional mandate, the National Institute on Drug Abuse funded the Training and Employment Program (TEP) research study to evaluate a vocational program for methadone treatment clients. As part of the TEP study, the researchers developed the Vocational Readiness Screener (VRS), which was administered to 184 treatment clients participating in that study. This study used a structural equation modeling approach to evaluate the employability framework on which the VRS was based by testing the hypotheses that employability is comprised of multiple underlying factors and that vocational status moderates employability. The empirical evidence that supported the study hypotheses included estimates of test-retest and composite reliability, estimates of factor validity, and group differences in the covariance and inter-factor correlation matrices for the job-ready and non job-ready groups. The results showed differences in the factor loadings and in the structure of each of the latent factors in the employability model, which appear to be aligned with stages of vocational readiness. From a methodological perspective, these findings represent an analytic shift from prediction to latent variable analysis and allow for a better understanding of the moderator effects of vocational status at progressive stages in the rehabilitation process. Treatment implications for the substance abuse and vocational rehabilitation fields are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08262002-111957/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Levitation</field><field name="creator">Shia , Christine R</field><field name="description">In 1893, Sabine Lavecque attends to her dying mother and is asked to perform a final task.

Furthermore, the closed-loop control systems can become unstable. The purpose of this research has been to develop a control methodology to handle network-induced delay effects using optimal gain scheduling on existing controllers. The proposed gain scheduling technique adapts controller gains externally by modifying a controller output to enable the controller for uses over a data network. Since existing controllers can still be utilized, the proposed methodology can reduce control system reinstallation and replacement costs. First, the effectiveness of the proposed gain scheduling technique on networked DC motor speed control using a PI (Proportional-Integral) controller is investigated. Also, the concept of network traffic condition measurement to select optimal controller gains is presented. Then, a middleware framework to measure network traffic conditions on an IP network based on delays and delay variations and to modify controller gains is described. Suggestion of using neural network in the gain scheduling scheme is also given. Finally, the gain scheduling technique with the middleware framework is then extended to mobile robot path-tracking control.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08282003-105850/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Age Differences in the Effects of Conscious and Unconscious Thought on Decision Making</field><field name="creator">Queen, Tara Licciardello</field><field name="description">Recent research has suggested that young adults make the most optimal decisions when the problem is weighed at the unconscious level, or when they engage in little deliberation (Dijksterhuis, 2004). This is an intriguing finding with important implications for older adults&#226; decision making given normative age-related declines in deliberative processing. In the current study, I investigated age differences in the benefits of unconscious relative to conscious thought. I also examined the extent to which these benefits interact with the processing demands of the decision task, and further if age-related benefits associated with unconscious processing might be specific to certain decision making tasks. For example, if the decision task requires selective attention to relevant material, rather than simple evaluation, conscious thought may be more beneficial than unconscious thought and aging may negatively affect performance. Using a procedure developed by Dijksterhuis, young and older adult participants (N = 125) engaged in unconscious or conscious thought processing before selecting a choice from information regarding apartments and banks. The information was presented as intuitive (i.e., optimal choice contained the most positive attributes) or deliberative (i.e., optimal choice based on a subset of information). The results of the study reveled that young adults performed well on the decision task when unconsciously processing intuitive information and consciously processing deliberative information. Older adults were more influenced by the type of information rather than thought processing, which lead them to perform better when they received intuitive information rather than deliberative information, regardless of thought condition. Additionally, both young and older adults displayed choice supportive memory, whereas neither age nor thought condition affected choice satisfaction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08282008-154259/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Elliptical Vibration Assisted Machining with Single Crystal Diamond Tools</field><field name="creator">Negishi, Nobuhiko</field><field name="description">Optical quality surfaces on non-ferrous materials are commonly produced with single crystal diamond tools and precision turning machines. To add ferrous and brittle materials to the list of diamond turnable materials, a process know as elliptical vibration assisted machining (EVAM) has been developed. EVAM combines a small, less than 50 &amp;#181m size, oscillatory tool path to the linear motion of standard orthogonal cutting. EVAM reduces cutting forces and tool wear by reducing chip thickness and bringing the tool tip out of contact with the workpiece 75% of the time. These characteristics may increase tool life and work piece material compatibility with single crystal diamond tools. A non-resonant piezo electric stack driven tool actuator was designed and built for a large range of operating frequencies (0-5KHz) and tool path dimensional flexibility (ellipse motion up to 50 x 9 &amp;#181m). The diamond tool is mounted to a kinematic linkage. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to aid the design of a light weight, high stiffness tool holder/kinematic linkage for high frequency operation. The effects of heat generation caused by high voltage, high frequency operation of piezo stacks were simulated using FEA and finite difference programs. These simulations were used to design and develop an efficient active cooling system. Tool path geometry and its effects on sliding distance, chip geometry, and surface finish were modeled with Maple software. Calculated chip geometry was successfully used to predict cutting and thrust forces. Force predictions were compared with measured forces for 6061 aluminum. A method generated for precision contour grinding was implemented to accurately predict theoretical surface roughness for EVAM machined surfaces. EVAM machining tests with brittle workpiece materials, such as silicon carbide, produced optical quality surfaces.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08292003-175201/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of the Presidency: Civil Religion and the Public?s Assessment of Candidates and Incumbents</field><field name="creator">Woolley, Donald Patrick</field><field name="description">Robert Bellah introduced the concept of American civil religion more than thirty year ago. While interest has waxed and waned over time, there has been an increase in the level of attention paid to civil religion in the United States since the beginning of the 21st Century. Much of this interest has been rhetorical however, and very little actual research has taken place. This study examines the relationship between the civil religious beliefs of the American public and the public?s perception of the presidency. Randomly selected subjects from stratified samples in Raleigh, North Carolina were collected during two separate, yet similar, studies in 1984 and 1998. Data from then 1984 Reagan-Mondale presidential contest are used to examine presidential electoral preference for candidates who are seen as more civil religious. It is contended that the candidate who is seen as more civil religious will have an electoral advantage. Further data collected during the fall of 1998 are used to look at the relationship between civil religious beliefs and feelings of outrage or betrayal at the perceived actions of President Clinton leading to his impeachment trial are explored. In this case it is contended that the stronger a member of the public?s feelings of civil religiosity, the greater their feelings of outrage. It would appear from the results of these studies that the lens of civil religion is used by the public in their perception of the presidency. It would also appear that the traditional view of American civil religion has changed since Bellah?s original thesis. The implications of these findings, in terms of theory methodology and policy are discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08292004-154503/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MICROWAVE-ASEPTIC PROCESSING OF SWEETPOTATO PUREES: DIELECTRIC PROPERTIES AND MICROBIAL INACTIVATION EVALUATION</field><field name="creator">Brinley, Tiffany Ann</field><field name="description">MICROWAVE-ASEPTIC PROCESSING OF SWEETPOTATO PUREES: DIELECTRIC PROPERTIES AND MICROBIAL INACTIVATION EVALUATION</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08292006-130008/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamental Limits and Joint Design of Wireless Systems with Vector Antennas</field><field name="creator">Krishnamurthy, Sandeep Humchadakatte</field><field name="description">Multiple-antenna systems have generated tremendous research interest in the recent past mainly because of their promise of significant gains in capacity and performance as compared to single-antenna systems. Most work on multiple antennas has focused on the design of coding and modulation schemes, channel estimation algorithms and decoding architectures. Information is sent by the transmitter as electromagnetic (EM) waves which subsequently undergo multipath fading before they reach the receiver. The EM properties of the antennas and the nature of the scattering environment jointly impact the performance of communication algorithms. However, there are relatively few works in the literature that consider this interrelation in the design of transmitter-receiver architectures. In this dissertation we study three such problems: the dependence of capacity on the EM properties of antennas and the scattering environment, the limits on performance of parameter estimation algorithms at the receiver and finally, the fundamental limits on the capacity that volume-limited multiple-antenna systems can achieve. We first consider the joint design of multi-element antennas and capacity-optimal signalling for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channel. We use EM theory and ray-tracing methods to derive a channel propagation model for antennas that can detect or excite more than one component of the electric field vector (known as vector antennas) in a discrete-multipath channel environment. This model provides insights into the inter-relation between the spatial multiplexing gain and the nature of the multipath environment for vector antennas. We then generalize this model to the case of antennas with more general electric-field patterns in a fading environment with clusters of scatterers. Capacity-optimal signalling and the impact of antenna electric field patterns on capacity are studied. We focus on joint antenna-signal design and derive optimality criterion for multi-element antenna systems for maximizing the ergodic capacity. We show that antennas that have orthogonal and equal norm electric-field patterns maximize the ergodic capacity. Vector antennas satisfy this criteria, but a uniform linear array does not. We next consider the problem of positioning and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation with ultrawideband (UWB) vector antennas. Due to the wideband nature of the antenna response and directional sensitivity of vector antennas, precise ranging and DOA estimation of a transmitting source can be jointly performed. We first derive a frequency-domain Cramer-Rao Bound formula in the asymptotic case of a large number of observation samples in stationary noise. We apply this formula to two UWB vector antennas and obtain closed-form lower-bound expressions for the ranging and DOA error covariances. A criterion based on the linearized confidence region is used to design signal pulses that give uniform resolving capability to the antennas for any DOA. Finally, we consider the fundamental capacity limits that a multi-element antenna system that is restricted to occupy a finite volume can achieve. For simplicity, we consider the problem of a spherical volume current source radiating into space with a receiver in the far-field capable of detecting the electric field on a concentric spherical surface. The system is first described as a linear operator, and the exact singular values of the system are derived in closed form. The singular values and hence the capacity is shown to depend on the transmitter volume only through its radius. We calculate the capacity of such a system, and provide capacity formulas that are accurate at high signal-to-noise ratio.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08302005-191341/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinetic Studies of Dehaloperoxidase-Hemoglobin From Amphitrite Ornata</field><field name="creator">Gilvey, Lauren Brenna Galvagni</field><field name="description">The focus of this research was to determine how three different factors affect the kinetics of the reaction between Dehaloperoxidase ? Hemoglobin (DHP-Hb), a halogenated phenol substrate, and a peroxide co-substrate. The factors examined were the order of addition of the substrate and co-substrate, the pH of the solutions, and the difference between using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and m-Chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA) as the co-substrates. The order of addition studies were carried out on a stop-flow apparatus. The results presented here demonstrate that the substrate must bind to DHP-Hb prior to the addition of the peroxide co-substrate. The effect of pH was examined using stop-flow and photodiode array spectrometry. These studies show how the pKa of the substrate affects the mechanism of the reaction. The kinetic results actually depend on the pKa of the substrate used. Stop-flow studies and UV-Vis assays were used to compare H2O2 and MCPBA as co-substrates.

The use of H2O2 as the co-substrate results in a larger amount of product formation at all pHs studied, with the exception of pH 6.0.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08302006-104458/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three-Dimensional Microphysical and Dynamical Structures of Winter Storms in the U.S. Pacific Northwest</field><field name="creator">Payne, Matthew J</field><field name="description">Frequent rainfall during the winter months in the Portland, Oregon region is associated with extratropical cyclones modified by the Coastal and Cascade Ranges. Operational WSR-88D radar observations from Portland, OR and upper-air soundings from Salem, OR over a 3-year period (2003-2006) from 1 November ? 31 March are used to determine a 3D climatology of winter storms. 84 % of the 117 storm events had a low-level wind direction from the south or southwest, between 158&#176; - 248&#176; azimuth. Stability varied between storms, with most storms being neutral to slightly stable. Wind direction was found to be more important in determining the geographic pattern of precipitation in the PNW. For S-SW flow storms, increasing the storm volume is primarily related to increasing precipitation frequency rather than precipitation areal coverage. Local maximum in precipitation frequency is seen typically at mid-windward slope rather than at the Cascade Range crest. 3D radar observations were also compared to MM5 output for the 2005-06 and 2006-07 winter seasons. Storms were grouped by their prevailing low-level wind direction and two individual cases (2005 Dec 29-31; 2006 Nov 6-7) to compare their radial velocity, precipitation frequency, and standard deviation of radial velocity. Errors were found in the standard deviation of Vr, with the model showing more variable wind speed and direction than the observations. The spatial pattern of precipitation frequency between the radar observations and model output were found to be similar, but the magnitudes were found to usually be larger in the model output.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08302007-145441/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Weave-Room Performance Decision-Making Process in Textiles: Mapping An Information Engineering Methodology</field><field name="creator">Karpe, Yatin Surendra</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to understand, define and map the weave-room performance decision-making process, and to develop an Information Engineering methodology for studying and analyzing decision-making processes in textile manufacturing departments. A preliminary Decision Cycle Model was developed using knowledge management principles, resulting in a definition of Information Engineering, which was ?a technique for extracting the meaning contained in the information so as to allow the understanding needed by the user to make an informed decision?. A case study approach, in conjunction with a process-modeling tool called IDEF0, belonging to the IDEF (Integrated Definition language) family of modeling techniques, has been used. Case studies were conducted at three weaving plants, resulting in the development of the three AS-IS models. These case studies provided the framework to compare with, and become the underlying basis for, the proposed Best Practices TO-BE model of the weave-room performance decision-making process. Additionally, both the AS-IS and TO-BE models lead to the development of ten key performance-improving tasks that could potentially assist in enhancing the decision process as well as providing the background for analyzing the usability of IDEF0 as an effective process-mapping tool, by means of a SWOT analysis. Finally, a generic Information Engineering methodology was developed that could be used for mapping manufacturing-related decisions. The research deliverables resulting from the Information Engineering methodology would eventually lead to the development and creation of a kind of Digital Decision Dashboard (D3), which could potentially prove to be a valuable tool for decision-making in textiles, thus addressing a critical need presently facing the textile industry.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Technology Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-08312006-095818/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The intracellular targeting of cPLA2</field><field name="creator">Harris, Virginia Gail</field><field name="description">HARRIS, VIRGINIA GAIL The Intracellular Targeting of cPLA2. (Under the direction of Scott M. Laster). Tumor necrosis factor-&#225; (TNF) is an inflammatory cytokine that can induce apoptosis in virus-infected cells, susceptible tumor cells, and cells whose transcriptional or translational processes have been disrupted. The apoptotic pathway that is activated by TNF is dependent on the activity of the enzyme cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). This enzyme cleaves arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipid, which in turn causes mitochondrial dysfunction leading to cell death. The goal of this research project was to identify the specific intracellular membrane to which cPLA2 binds during TNF-induced apoptosis. The membrane site for cPLA2 interaction during apoptosis would be a possible target for anti-apoptotic drug development. Three methods were tested in an attempt to identify the membrane location, including; immunofluorescence, biochemical fractionation, and GC/MS. Our results with immunofluorescence suggested that cPLA2 translocates to the nuclear membrane during apoptosis. The identity of the nuclear membrane was confirmed by staining with an antibody to the nuclear pore complex. In addition, cPLA2 staining was noted within the nucleus, perhaps indicating an interaction with chromatin, and small areas of punctate staining were noted in the perinuclear region. Biochemical fractionation indicated that the association of cPLA2 with the nuclear membrane was calcium-dependent since this association could not be stabilized in the absence of calcium. GC/MS, which was used in an attempt to find amputated phospholipids remaining in membranes as a result of cPLA2 activity, instead revealed higher levels of arachidonic acid suggesting that cells may increase the synthesis or repair of arachidonic acid containing membranes following the activation of cPLA2. Finally, our results revealed several novel, lower molecular weight forms of cPLA2 that were associated with nuclei in a calcium-independent fashion. Taken together these results suggest that it will be important to understand the mechanisms controlling the association of cPLA2 with nuclei.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09012002-190214/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative Analysis of RNase P</field><field name="creator">Gantt, John Arthur</field><field name="description">This Master?s Thesis contains a description of the results of two research projects that were worked on over the course of two years.

Additional techniques including scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering explored the specific role of PASP in the dissolution process. Using this approach, rates of dissolution were evaluated as a function of pH, rotating speed, polymer concentration and molecular weight. In this research, it was determined that PASP is an effective dissolving agent for calcite mineral over a range of pHs (3.5-10.0), rotating speeds (150-1500 rpm), PASP concentrations (0.001-0.1M) and PASP molecular weights (3,000 and 10,000 Mw). An enhancement factor, ?&#216;enh, was developed to quantify the effect of PASP on dissolution behavior. It is defined as the rate of dissolution in PASP over the rate in water. Maximum enhancement was observed at pHs in the range of 4-5 for high concentrations and low molecular weights of PASP. Results demonstrate that dissolution is governed primarily by interfacial phenomena, including adsorption and surface reaction, at high pHs (&gt;7), while limited chiefly by mass transport at low pHs (&lt;7). Dissolution at high pHs proceeds via a surface complexation mechanism involving the chelation of calcium by PASP. At the high pHs, dissolution is inhibited by small amounts of PASP (0.001-0.01M) and enhanced by large quantities (0.1M) of PASP. In contrast, at low pHs, dissolution occurs predominantly by acid attack, or the reaction of hydrogen ion with calcite. At low pHs, PASP enhances dissolution over the entire concentration range (0.001-0.1M). For the two molecular weights studied, the lower molecular weight (3,000) is the most efficient dissolving agent at low pH, while both molecular weights dissolve calcite at comparable rates at high pH. Finally, a model was developed based on fundamental calcite and sequestration chemistry to predict the dissolution kinetics of calcite in the presence of PASP at pHs above 7. The model agrees closely with experimental dissolution rates at pH 10 and shows that the water reaction with calcite dominates dissolution at low PASP concentrations while the PASP ligand reaction with calcite is the primary interfacial reaction at high PASP concentrations.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09022002-161459/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Terrain and Convection on Microfront Formation Leading to Severe Low-Level Turbulence</field><field name="creator">Cetola, Jeffrey David</field><field name="description">Two low-level convectively-induced turbulence (CIT) events east of the Appalachian Mountains are investigated utilizing observations, satellite, radar, and numerical simulations. Both events had an inordinate amount of low-level turbulence reported, but one event had more than twice as many severe or greater reports. The events were compared?to include the 72 hours leading up to the turbulence reports?and similarities and differences at the various scales from the synoptic to meso-alpha, meso-beta, meso-gamma, and microscale are noted. The case of weaker turbulence featured a meridional wave pattern with ridging over the East Coast and a single upper-level jet closely coupled with the large-scale frontal system. The stronger turbulence case possessed a zonal wave pattern with a vortex over eastern Canada and both a polar jet and subtropical jet. These differences are reflected in the low-level temperature and potential vorticity patterns and affected the hydraulic structures as well?with the stronger turbulence environment more prone to a blocking-type regime. Hydrostatic mountain waves were observed for both events. Stronger cross-mountain flow combined with a strong low-level leeside inversion resulted in a more vigorous mountain wave with a stronger downstream isentropic upfold (mid-level cold pool) in the stronger turbulence event. This mid-level cold pool was deformed by the large-scale jet resulting in a mid-level cold front (downstream from the surface cold front), surface pressure rises to the lee of the Allegheny Mountains, and ultimately a surface cold surge (edgewave) that merges with warm air from the south. The phasing of the mid-level cold pool and the convergence with the northerly cold surge and southerly warm air results in kata-frontogenesis and cellular convection that transits the severe turbulence location in space and time. Convection in the weaker turbulence case was lineal in structure and tied to the large-scale cold anafront. Vorticity, enstrophy, turbulent kinetic energy, and Richardson number analyses indicated maxima were lineal in structure and upstream from the convection in the weaker case and arc-like in appearance and downstream from convection in the stronger case. A turbulence index was formulated based on three-dimensional vorticity (enstrophy), vertical wind shear, and static stability.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09022003-233653/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular mechanisms of etomoxir-induced toxicity</field><field name="creator">Merrill, Christine Lee</field><field name="description">Etomoxir (ET) is a member of a family of substituted 2-oxirane-carboxylic acids that inhibit mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO), ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis. Once converted to its CoA ester, ET irreversibly binds to the CPT-1 catalytic site and prevents long chain fatty acids from entering the mitochondrion. Along with this inhibition of FAO, ET causes a shift in energy substrate utilization from fatty acids to glucose, leading to systemic hypoglycemia, hypoketonemia, and hypotriglyceridemia. These effects make ET potentially useful in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The compound has been shown to induce cardiac and hepatic hypertrophy in animals and, therefore, has not been fully developed as an antidiabetic agent to date. It is well established that ET activates the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPAR&#225;) which can cause both oxidative stress and dysregulation of the cell cycle control gene program. The goal of this research was to evaluate the ET-induced alterations in gene expression profiles in hepatocytes to elucidate the possible role of cell growth dysregulation and/or oxidative stress in ET-induced hepatic toxicity. In HepG2 cells treated with a high dose of ET, gene expression strongly suggestive of oxidative stress was observed and this was supported by decreased levels of reduced glutathione, reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG), concurrent increase in oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and superoxide generation. A significant decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels implicated impairment of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Other gene expression findings suggested activation of p53, DNA repair and cell cycle arrest. In rats, ET induced a strong mitogenic response in the livers of rats 24 h after administration of one 25 mg/kg dose, that was consistent with the cell proliferation caused by peroxisome proliferators. This finding was coincident with a predominance of cell proliferation/growth-related gene expression alterations. Oxidative stress genes were down regulated; suggesting that this is not a viable etiologic mechanism for induction of ET-induced hepatic hypertrophy. PPAR&#225; appears to play a role in ET-induced hepatic hypertrophy, as shown by the early cell proliferation followed by increased level of PPARA mRNA, peroxisome proliferation and increase of PPAR&#225;-related genes.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09062002-134236/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and Characterization of Electronically Labile Molecules</field><field name="creator">Bin-Salamon, Sofi</field><field name="description">Valence tautomers are molecules that change electronic states as a function of an external stimulus such as temperature, pressure and light. The purpose of the dissertation research has been to explore different aspects of the behavior of valence tautomeric molecules. The research work is divided into three exploratory avenues: 1) Intermolecular contributions to the behavior of surface-confined valence tautomers, 2) the effects of structural changes to the intramolecular coupling in dinuclear valence tautomeric systems, and 3) the synthetic control of the intramolecular delocalization of the semiquinonate-catecholate donor-acceptor pair. For the first project it was discovered that intermolecular interactions in surface-confined valence tautomers change the thermodynamic parameters of the valence tautomeric conversion. The second project yielded results that conclusively demonstrated that large spin-density distribution on the ligands of valence tautomers and small through-bond distance between valence tautomeric centers are necessary in order to electronically couple multinuclear valence tautomers. Finally, it was shown that it is possible to synthetically control the delocalization of the semiquinate-catecholate donor-acceptor pair of the low-temperature mixed-valent valence tautomeric state by substituting the bipyridine counterligand with different functional groups.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09062005-045329/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Age-Dependent Tag Return Models for Estimating Fishing Mortality, Natural Mortality and Selectivity</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Honghua</field><field name="description">We extend the instantaneous rates formulation of fisheries tag return models to allow for age-dependence of fishing mortality rates in Chapter 1. This is important in many applications where tagged fish vary over a large range of ages (and sizes). We focus on a model based on assuming selectivity by age is constant over years and that above a certain age selectivity is fixed at 1. We show that it is possible to allow natural mortality, M, to vary by age and year. We allow for incomplete mixing of tagged fish and for fisheries to be pulse, continuous or continuous over part of the year. We focus on the case where all or most age classes are tagged each year. We investigate model identifiability and how well parameters can be estimated using analytic and simulation methods. Results show that some models with the tag reporting rate estimated are singular or near-singular. The age-length key method commonly used for age specification may produce substantial errors in converting size to age, especially for the older fish. To reduce such errors, in Chapter 2 we propose two alternative sampling designs to the standard one of tagging all age classes: one where only age 1 fish are tagged, another where both age 1 and age 2 fish are tagged. Catch-and-release fisheries have become very important to the management of overexploited recreational fish stocks. Tag return studies where the tag is removed regardless of fish disposition have been used to assess the effectiveness of restoration efforts for these catch-and-release fisheries. In Chapter 3, we extend the instantaneous rate formulation of tag return models introduced in Chapter 1 to catch-and-release tagging studies. We illustrate the methods using multiple age class tag return data on striped bass (Morone saxatilis) from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MDNR). We found evidence that M is age dependent and that M has increased since 1999 possibly due to an outbreak of the disease (mycobacteriosis) in striped bass in the Chesapeake Bay.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09072005-085405/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clock Tree Insertion and Verification for 3D Integrated Circuits</field><field name="creator">Mineo, Christopher Alexander</field><field name="description">The use of three dimensional chip fabrication technologies has emerged as a solution to the difficulties involved with the continued scaling of bulk silicon devices. While the technology exists, it is undervalued and underutilized largely due to the design and verification challenges a complex 3D design presents. This work presents a clock tree insertion and timing verification methodology for three dimensional integrated circuits (3DIC). It has been designed in the context of and incorporated into the 3DIC design methodology also developed within our research group. The 3DIC verification methodology serves as an efficient means to perform all setup and hold timing checks harnessing the power of existing commercial chip design and verification tools. A novel approach is presented in which the multi-die design is temporarily transformed to appear as a traditional 2D design to the commercial tools for verification purposes. Various parasitic extraction algorithms are examined, and we present a method for performing accurate 3D parasitic extraction for timing purposes. We offer theoretical insight into the optimization of a 3D clock tree for power savings and coupling-induced delay minimization. A practical example of the 3DIC design and verification flow is detailed through the explanation of our research group?s test chip, a nearly 140,000 cell 3D fast Fourier transform chip currently awaiting fabrication at MIT?s Lincoln Labs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09072005-193841/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling Impact of and Mitigation Measures for Recurring Freeway Bottlenecks</field><field name="creator">Clark, Zachary Thomas</field><field name="description">Recurrent congestion is a continually growing problem on urban freeways. Facility expansions cannot keep pace with the growing vehicle demand. Low-cost mitigation measures are one way to alleviate the congestion at recurring bottleneck locations. Low-cost measures typically have a life of approximately 10 years and costs ranging from $8,000 to $2.45 million. While benefits have been realized in field applications, there hasn?t been a lot of study regarding the performance of these measures in terms of added capacity. While modeling has long been a tool for planning and analyzing freeway networks, there has been little reported regarding its use for estimating the benefits of low-cost freeway improvements. In this study, the author tested proposed treatments at two sites using both a macroscopic and microscopic model. Because empirical performance information of these measures is not available, a quantitative analysis would not be reasonable since confidence in the values reported would be low. Current bottleneck identification methods typically either predict breakdown in real-time, or analyze detector data off-line. In order to identify bottlenecks from recorded aggregated data in an off-line model, criteria were generated to identify active bottlenecks and analyze the models? performance in an empirical and qualitative manner. Application of the criteria has been shown to provide reliable bottleneck identification to the calibrated pre-treatment case and expected results in the post-treatment cases.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09072007-122248/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Cotton Production Margins through Management Decisions and Use of New and Standard commercial Products to Improve Quality and Profits</field><field name="creator">Nuti, Russell C</field><field name="description">Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is a perennial plant managed as an annual crop to optimize yield and fiber quality while managing inputs to maximize profit. Transgenic improvements have simplified cotton production. Resistance to the non-selective herbicide glyphosate and in-plant production of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) endotoxin are two such advances. Cultural practices including use of mepiquat chloride (MC), and optimizing planting date contribute to crop uniformity and decrease risk involved with environmental stresses. Comparisons between conventional and transgenic weed and insect management systems, optimal and late planting dates, overhead sprinkle irrigation and drip irrigation, and use of MC were evaluated. Optimal-planted cotton had better yield than cotton planted late. Mepiquat chloride did not always provide an advantage, however never caused an undesirable response. At times, cotton plants treated with MC showed improved micronaire, compensation for boll loss, and earlier maturity. Broadcast glyphosate at the eight-leaf stage reduced yield of optimal-planted cotton in 1 of 3 years and 2 of 3 years in late-planted cotton. Glyphosate contact after the four-leaf stage in 2 of 3 years shifted the majority of bolls above node 10. Lint yield results were variable between overhead sprinkle and drip irrigation systems. Mepiquat chloride did not affect yield in irrigated cotton, however did control plant height, and improve fruit retention and cotton maturity. Non-labeled glyphosate applications reduced maturity in each irrigation system in 1 of 3 years. Cotton injury caused by conventional herbicides resulted in yield loss and poor returns compared to glyphosate systems. Early-season weed competition from low input herbicide programs caused cotton biomass reduction. High costs of conventional herbicide programs offset the available profit margin compared to glyphosate systems when yields were similar. Glyphosate systems provided excellent control of all weed species, while conventional herbicides gave acceptable control in most cases. Glyphosate resistant cotton cultivars with had better yield and returned more profit than the same cultivars treated with conventional herbicides.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09092004-101557/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and the effects of nitric oxide production in endotoxin-induced uveitis</field><field name="creator">Pittman, Kristianna Marie</field><field name="description">Pittman, Kristianna Marie. Exploring the regulation of iNOS and the effects of NO production in endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU). (Under the direction of Janice B. Allen and Kenneth Adler). In this study, we hypothesized that during anterior uveitis NF-kappaB activity and subsequent iNOS gene expression increase as a result of the decrease in TGFbeta2 activity. Increased iNOS expression leads to increased NO activity and production of peroxynitrite. We further proposed that exogenous administration of TGFbeta2, i.e. increasing TGFbeta2 activity or scavenging peroxynitrite may protect against EIU. Scavenging of peroxynitrite was examined by using the peroxynitrite scavenger, ebselen. All studies were undertaken using either the in vivo model of anterior uveitis, endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) or the in vitro system of iris ciliary body cells stimulated with IL-1beta. Results demonstrated that TGFbeta2 decreases iNOS expression during EIU, however, the mechanism is NF-kappaB-independent. Exogenous administration of TGFbeta2 did not protect against EIU. These studies identified peroxynitrite as a component of EIU, through the identification of nitrated MnSOD, a peroxynitrite target. Scavenging of peroxynitrite by the compound ebselen did protect against EIU. Ebselen mediated inhibition of EIU by scavenging peroxynitrite, inhibiting the recruitment of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes and suppressing NF-kappaB activation. This study demonstrated that TGFbeta2 negatively regulates iNOS expression during EIU and that iNOS, NO, and peroxynitrite are key mediators in the pathogenesis of EIU. Attentuation of uveitis occurs when suppression of these mediators is coupled to PMN suppression and inhibition of NF-kappaB activation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09102002-154530/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Watershed management and riparian buffer analyses using remotely sensed data</field><field name="creator">Halley, James</field><field name="description">The physical parameters of past experimental riparian buffer studies were used to develop a riparian buffer classification framework (RBCF) that uses high resolution remotely sensed data to identify the physical parameters of a riparian buffer and assign an estimate of total suspended solids (TSS) removal efficiency.

When oxidants reach levels that overcome the ability of antioxidants to eliminate them, it results in damage to cellular macromolecules. The damage to DNA, lipids and protein initiates a cascade of physiological events in response to the oxidative stress. Researchers have been studying these cellular responses by analyzing gene expression and protein activity for many years. Recently, new technologies have emerged that allow scientists to analyze the differential expression of extremely large sets of genes in response to oxidative stressors and other toxicants. Most experiments performed to date have involved a single dose of a chemical and a single timepoint for analysis. However, gene expression has proven to be a dynamic process with many transcriptional changes over a relatively short timecourse. In order to study the dynamic nature of gene expression and its effects on cellular physiology, experiments were performed to analyze the effects of oxidative stress on HepG2 cells over a 24 hour timecourse with a range of doses of the glutathione depletor, diethylmaleate (DEM). Using Clontech microarrays, TaqMan RT-PCR, and assays to measure reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations and to determine cell cycle status, an overall picture of the effects of oxidative stress in relation to dose and time was created. DEM caused GSH depletion to the extent that cells treated with 1.25mM DEM for 4 hours contained less than 20% of the GSH levels in untreated cells. The redox imbalance caused the transcription of genes that initiate cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and induction of stress proteins. The p53-independent induction of p21 initiated a cascade of events including the decreased transcription of cyclins that resulted in cell cycle arrest. Additionally, the transcription of stress induced genes such as HSP70 and heme oxygenase-1 exhibited significant time and dose-dependent increases in reponse to DEM. While the genes exhibiting differential expression remained generally the same between doses, it was the time taken for these gene changes to occur that varied greatly from the highest dose to the lowest dose of DEM. These experiments demonstrate the importance of analyzing an effective dose range over an extended time period when using differential gene expression to study the mechanisms of toxicity.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09132002-161850/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Graduate Education Experience and Career Paths of Women Faculty in Higher Education Administration</field><field name="creator">Haley, Karen Jean</field><field name="description">Although there has been a concerted effort on the part of colleges and universities to increase women?s representation as faculty in higher education, equal representation in all disciplines has not been realized.

We evaluated high-density grass carp stocking in a reservoir for control of parrot-feather (Myriophyllum aquaticum, an invasive aquatic plant that is not preferentially consumed by grass carp) and the associated effects on water quality and native fishes. Lookout Shoals Lake, a piedmont North Carolina reservoir, was stocked with triploid grass carp at a density of 100 fish per vegetated hectare. Parrot-feather biomass in the lake was significantly reduced three months after grass carp stocking, compared to biomass in in-situ exclosures. During the second year after grass carp stocking, parrot-feather biomass in the lake compared to biomass in in-situ exclosures indicated continued control, but unexplained lack of growth within most experimental exclosures precluded biomass analyses. Increases in ambient water chlorophyll a, reactive phosphorus, and nitrate-nitrite concentrations were measured after grass carp stocking. We evaluated the native fish community using seasonal shoreline electrofishing before and after grass carp stocking. Total catch for all fish species in aggregate at shoreline transects was not significantly different after grass carp stocking by number or biomass. Catch rates of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, and redbreast sunfish Lepomis auritus were not significantly different after grass carp stocking, but yellow perch Perca flavescens catch rates were significantly lower. The biological significance of fish distribution changes and long-term effects on lake biota remain undetermined. Our results demonstrate that intensive grass carp stocking can control an invasive aquatic plant that is not preferentially consumed by grass carp, and reveal associated changes in water quality and fish distributions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09132008-145505/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unraveling the pathway of lipid oxidation in the young pig: Assessment of hepatic &#226;-oxidation and characterization of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I)</field><field name="creator">Lyvers Peffer, Pasha A</field><field name="description">Hepatic &#226;-oxidation and liver and skeletal muscle carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) activity and mRNA expression were evaluated in the pig. In the first study, newborn pigs were allotted to one of four dietary regimens: artificial milk replacer with long chain triglycerides (LCT) as the fat source (Control), the Control diet with 0.5% clofibric acid (CA), the Control diet with medium chain triglycerides replacing LCT as the fat source (MCT), or the Control diet with 40 ppm isoproterenol (ISO). There were no differences between Control and MCT or ISO supplemented groups in total, mitochondrial, or peroxisomal &#226;-oxidation of [1-&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]-palmitate (1 mM). Total and peroxisomal &#226;-oxidation increased 134 and 186%, respectively, with CA supplementation. Hepatic malonyl-CoA sensitive CPT activity increased (p &lt; 0.05) in pigs receiving CA. Changes in relative expression of hepatic LCPT I and skeletal muscle MCPT I mRNA amounts following clofibrate supplementation were not detected, while a modest effect on acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) relative mRNA amounts was observed (p=0.08). In the second study, hepatic and skeletal muscle CPT I kinetics in pigs during different stages of development were evaluated. Activity of CPT I increased 109 and 67% between birth and 1 wk of age in liver and skeletal muscle, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Realtive expression of hepatic CPT I mRNA in the 24 hr old pig was 7% of the amount detected in the newborn (p &lt; 0.001); while hepatic CPT I apparent Km for carnitine decreased 48% from birth to 3 wk of age. The apparent Km for carnitine in skeletal muscle decreased from birth to 1 wk of age, then increased 200% between 1 and 5 wk of age (p&lt; 0.01).

High relative expression of &#227;-butyrobetaine hydroxylase (&#227;BBH) in the kidney indicated high capacity for de novo carnitine synthesis by this tissue.

Our objective is to study the measurement process and determine the real-time utilization of a link, and use these measurements to determine the admission of new flows into the network, while providing statistical guarantees on the QoS ensured for the existing admitted flows. First we survey the vast amount of existing literature in the field and identify the components of a measurement-based admission control system, and the various factors which affects the performance of an algorithm. We use the ns-2 simulator to simulate some of the proposed (though not all) algorithms and test the performance of these algorithms for various arrival processes at the connection level. We use the results from these simulations to verify the performance claims of the various algorithms, and use the performance tuning parameters to find optimal performance regions. We study the buffer dynamics at the burst level and analyze the loss caused by admitting excessive flows. Our work extends from the existing literature in studying the effect of different arrival processes on the blocking probabilities of new flows and surveying an ad-hoc mix-and-match approach of the estimation technique and decision process to explore a higher performance benchmark.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09152002-022405/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical Simulation of the Internal Two-Phase Flow within an Aerated-Liquid Injector and its Injection into the Corresopnding High-speed Crossflows.</field><field name="creator">Tian, Ming</field><field name="description">Aerated-liquid atomization, which is produced by the introduction of gas directly into a liquid flow immediately upstream of the injector exit orifice to generate a two-phase flow, has been shown to produce well-atomized sprays in a quiescent environment with only a small amount of aerating gas at relatively low injection pressures. A time-derivative preconditioning method using the Low-Diffusion Flux-Splitting Scheme (LDFSS) has been extended to a ?mixture? model of two-phase flow and applied to simulate the structure of internal two-phase flow for aerated-liquid injectors, with each phase governed by its own equation of state. The Continuum Surface Force (CSF) model of Brackbill, et al. is adapted to model compressible fluid flow influenced by interfacial surface tension. A sub-iterative time integration method based on a planar Gauss-Seidel partitioning of the system matrix is used with implicit source terms as a means of solving the three-dimensional, time-dependent form of the governing equations. The calculations are parallelized using domain-decomposition and Message-Passing Interface (MPI) methods, and are optimized for operation on the 720 processor IBM SP-2 at the North Carolina Supercomputing Center (NCSC). Simulation results for 2-D aerated-liquid injector flowfields at gas-to-liquid (GLR) mass ratios of 0.08% and 2.45% are discussed. In accord with experimental visualization data, the results for GLR = 0.08% indicate a combination of slugging and core-annular two-phase flow in the injector. Results at GLR = 2.45% indicate that a core-annular flow mode dominates, again in agreement with experimental results. The effects of the choice of reference velocity and the level of surface tension on the injector flowfield solutions are also examined.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09162002-133800/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection of Ammonia-Oxidizing Beta-Proteobacteria in Swine Waste Treatment Systems.</field><field name="creator">Smith, Jennifer Mary</field><field name="description">In order to obtain supporting evidence for biological denitrification in anaerobic lagoons degenerate ?&#210;-Proteobacterial AOB primers were used to create and sequence clone libraries to detect the presence of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria at three field sites.

However, these primers did verify the presence of ammonia-oxidizers at one site, although their presence was not verified at the other sites. The presence of ammonia-oxidizers at the Battelle site implies that aerobic ammonia-oxidation is occurring. Clones were created and sequenced that were significantly different from other known sequences and tended to form very closely related phylogenetic groups. These phylogenetic groups were not isolated to one field site, and often more than one site had representatives in a closely related group.

They also provided their understandings of the impact of institutions, faculty, staff, and others on their academic success. Previous literature suggests that students with blindness and visual impairments as well as students with other disabilities were academically successful in college because of institutional support and the positive attitude of faculty and peers (Baggett, 1994; Branker, 1997; Enberg, 1999; Fichten, 2005; and Roy, 2000). Findings from this study demonstrate that participants&#226; understandings and experiences with blindness varied and their subsequent adjustment and transition also differed. Participants described several factors that facilitated the creation of positive educational experiences during their undergraduate programs: positive exposure to a new region of the country, positive peers, supportive departments and professors, financial opportunities, and welcoming and diverse campus environments. As these students transitioned to the university, they utilized accommodations and services provided by Disability Students Services (DSS) to facilitate their access to the academic environment. The undergraduate students also described challenging experiences, including feeling academic discrimination, a sense of isolation, limited campus accessibility, and peer interaction issues. There were other support systems that facilitated participant academic success, such as mentors, family, administrators, and staff. This study concluded that blind and visually impaired undergraduate students were more likely to succeed academically when they felt a sense of connectedness with the university academic system. DSS is most responsible for facilitating that connectedness. Quality contact and collaboration with faculty were also important, as well as the attitudes of faculty, administration, and staff. The disconnectedness between study participants and the university system was fostered through inflexible bureaucratic procedures; the attitudes of faculty, staff, and administrators; and isolation from peers. Implications for policy include a recommendation for additional funding of technology-related assistance programs, in-service training on disability issues awareness for faculty and staff, and campus-wide committees on university accessibility. This study suggests future research is needed on the academic success of this population in community colleges and at the graduate level. There is a need for more empirical research and research on the population&#226;s social integration. The study recommends that higher education programs develop self-advocacy programs for blind and visually impaired students, in-service training for faculty, and peer mentorship programs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Higher Education Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09162009-131538/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationship Among Behavior, Social Cognition, and Peer Acceptance in School-Identified Children with Learning Disabilities</field><field name="creator">Andreassi, Cristina Lynne</field><field name="description">This study examined the relationships among social cognition, externalizing behavior, and social acceptance in children with and without learning disabilities. It was hypothesized that social-cognitive accuracy and externalizing behavior would mediate differences observed in social acceptance between children with and without learning disabilities. School-identified children with learning disabilities (N = 55) in grades 3 through 5 were compared to their non-identified peers (N= 631) in terms of social acceptance. Social acceptance was determined using peer nominations of liked most and liked least, which were converted into an overall social preference score for each child. When it was determined that children?s learning disability status accounted for a small but significant portion of the variance in children?s social acceptance (1.3%), mediation tests were conducted to determine if externalizing behavior or social cognitive accuracy functioned as mediators in the observed relationship. Externalizing behavior was assessed through teacher report on the Child Behavior Checklist. Social-cognitive accuracy was determined by calculating the extent to which individual children?s reports of peer groups in their classrooms matched the social groups derived through Social Cognitive Mapping. The results indicated that externalizing behavior partially mediated the relationship between learning disabilities and social acceptance. No evidence was found that social-cognitive accuracy functioned as a mediator. Limitations, implications for improving children?s social functioning, and future research on the social functioning, behavior, and social cognition of children with learning disabilities were discussed in light of these findings.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09172007-184508/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reducing Costs and Optimizing the Timing of Agronomic Inputs for Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in North Carolina.</field><field name="creator">Collins, Guy David</field><field name="description">Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) grown in North Carolina requires intensive management for achieving optimal yields in an early-season environment. Recent increases in production costs require cotton producers to adopt practices that allow yield potential to be reached, while reducing input costs or optimizing the timing of agronomic inputs. Six experiments were conducted in North Carolina from 2006 to 2008 to investigate various production practices that could potentially reduce production costs and to define optimal timings of agronomic inputs. The first experiment investigated precision application of in-furrow insecticides for cotton planted in a hill-dropped configuration. The second experiment investigated application rates and timings of mepiquat chloride (MC) for cotton grown in conditions that promote excessive vegetative growth. The third experiment investigated the effects of MC applied at various rates and timings on the correlation (regression) between two techniques for measuring light interception and canopy coverage: the light quantum sensor method and the overhead digital imagery method. The fourth experiment investigated the effects of MC applied at physiological cutout, in terms of defoliation, regrowth, maturity, and yield. The fifth experiment investigated the effects of preconditioning defoliation treatments for tall cotton portraying dense canopies which improve standard defoliation practices and the timeliness of harvest. The sixth experiment investigated the effects of ethephon rate in defoliant mixtures on harvest date, with regard to defoliation timing and prior MC treatment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09182009-043001/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrogen and Phosphorus Availability and Liming Effect of Poultry Layer Manures in North Carolina Coastal Plain and Piedmont Soils</field><field name="creator">Montalvo Grijalva, Daniela Fernanda</field><field name="description">Nutrient availability from poultry manures can be affected by soil types and manure processing. Estimates of nutrient release from manures are important when recommending their use. Three separate laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate N and P availability, and liming value of poultry layer manures (fresh, composted, and pelleted) with surfaces samples of three NC soils: Belhaven (loamy, mixed, dysic, thermic Terric Haplosaprists), Cecil (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults), and Lynchburg (fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Aeric Paleaquults). The N incubation compared N mineralization from poultry manures and urea, applied at a rate of 133 &#194;&#181;g N cm-3 soil (200 kg ha-1) and incubated for 90 days. Net N mineralized from the manures was described by a single pool first order kinetic model. Potential available N, estimated as the proportion of applied N, was greater for the fresh and composted manures than for the pelleted source in the three soils investigated. Nitrogen availability in fresh, composted, and pelleted manures for the Belhaven soil was 57, 53, and 46 % of total N applied, respectively; 83, 73, and 61 % of total N applied in the Lynchburg soil; and 41, 33, and 25 % for the same order of manure sources in the Cecil soil. The 21 day lime incubation compared poultry manure rates of 1333 and 2667 &#194;&#181;g cm-3 of soil (2 and 4 t ha-1) with multiple rates of CaCO3. Liming materials in all the manures were just as effective in neutralizing soil acidity as equivalent amounts of CaCO3. Nitrification of manure N, however, can reduce the net liming effect by the release of H+. The 21 day P incubation experiment compared available P from the manures applied at rates of 1333 and 2667 &#194;&#181;g cm-3 of soil (2 and 4 t ha-1) with multiple rates of Ca(H2PO4)2. A linear relationship across all P sources and rates was the best estimator of the increase in Mehlich-3 extractable P per unit of P added. These results suggested that P from the manures behaved similar to inorganic P fertilizer. Treatments in a subsequent greenhouse experiment were designed to evaluate millet [Urochloa ramosa (L.) T. Q. Nguyen] response to N, P and lime supplied in manures. Plant available N from the manures, estimated from the urea-N fertilizer equivalence of plant N accumulation, followed the decreasing order of fresh &gt; composted &gt; pelleted. This ranking among manures is similar to that obtained in the N incubation study. Millet dry matter and nutrient accumulation at targeted levels of N supply and soil values of Mehlich-3 P and pH were similar between treatments of manure supplemented with P fertilizer and lime, and treatments receiving only inorganic fertilizers and lime. These results indicate that optimum plant growth in manure amended systems requires the appropriate identification and correction of soil N, P and/or acidity constraints. Type of manure processing affects total N availability, and soil properties such as texture and buffer capacity can influence N mineralization and soil available P.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09192008-165401/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF NOVEL DIELECTRIC MATERIALS FOR MICROELECTRONICS</field><field name="creator">Hunt-Lowery, Alisa</field><field name="description">This research analyzes the re-oxidation annealing process of Barium titanate thin films on copper foils made by Chemical Solution Deposition. During this anneal, the temperature and oxygen pressure settings must be optimized to ensure the elimination of oxygen vacancies without oxidizing the copper foil substrate. This research utilizes Design of Experiments (DOE) to study the impact of re-oxidation furnace temperature and pressure on the dielectric loss tangent response. Two designs of experiments were run. The first experiment, a 32 DOE, examined a large range of temperature and pressure levels. Due to the high susceptibility of uncontrollable factors such as humidity and film position in the crystallization anneal furnace, an adequate model could not be developed. However, the temperature at 550&#186;C and a pressure of 10-5 Torr yielded a lower mean and standard deviation of the loss tangent response. A second and smaller scale experiment, a 22 with a center point, was run around 550&#186;C and 10-5 Torr to determine if more optimal temperature and pressure settings existed in the local area. Two second order response surface models were developed from two crystallization anneals that were statistically significant. The most significant finding was that the optimum level for temperature and pressure in the re-oxidation anneal furnace in this experiment is 550&#186;C and 2x10-5 Torr. While the models concluded that the temperature, pressure, temperature quadratic, and interaction between pressure and temperature were important effects in the model, there were differences in the curvature of the models due to the temperature quadratic effect.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09212004-100243/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Prior Trap</field><field name="creator">Smith, Karl</field><field name="description">Basic economic theory suggests that the decision to go to college should be based only on the expected costs and benefits of college.

Parallel logistic regression models are run to explore the role of race, sex, religion and gender ideology in explaining attitudes towards both same sex marriage and multiracial marriage. The results suggest that the processes that influence white attitudes are similar for both types of relationships. However, the attitudes of the black sample are not so easily predicted. While the lack of statistical significance within the black population may partially be explained by a small sample size, the results do suggest that the processes leading to negative attitudes towards both types of relationships may be different for blacks and whites.

High performance switching DC-DC converter must meet requirements of high current, low voltage tolerance, fast transient response, high power efficiency, small profile and low cost. The conventional PWM control with constant switching frequency has limitation to improve both transient response and power efficiency because there is a conflicting requirement on switching frequency. The control scheme with variable frequency has promising features to achieve better overall performance, but the issues in the reported design approaches limit their usefulness in the practical applications. This dissertation reviews and summarizes the issues and the design considerations in the high current switching DC-DC converters. To improve the system performance, novel control architecture with variable switching frequency and novel implementation of the integrated controller are proposed in this dissertation. The proposed control architecture is modeled and analyzed. Fully differential circuits are designed to implement the control core functions. The design methodology and the design considerations are discussed. The control concept and the proposed circuits are verified by the prototype controller chip.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09242006-211828/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Donor-Acceptor Contributions to Ferromagnetic Exchange Coupling within Heterospin Biradicals</field><field name="creator">Brannen, Candice Leigh</field><field name="description">The evaluation of new Donor-Acceptor heterospin biradicals is carried out within this thesis: SQ-Gal, SQ-Ph-Gal, SQ-E-NN, and SQ-TNN. A molecular orbital and spin density analysis is performed in order to predict the exchange coupling within these biradicals. A Valence Bond Configuration Interaction model is used to describe exchange coupling in a Donor-Acceptor-type Semiquinone-NitronylNitroxide (SQNN) biradical ligand. Within this framework, a SQ &#174; NN charge transfer state is responsible for the experimentally determined ferromagnetic coupling in the ground state, and the intraligand exchange parameter is correlated with the single-site Coulomb repulsion integral (U), the singlet-triplet gap (2K) of the CT excited state, and the electronic coupling matrix element, Hab. This charge transfer transition is observed spectroscopically, and probed using resonance Raman spectroscopy. Importantly, if the crystal structure of the Donor-Acceptor biradical is known, this Hab can be directly linked to the molecular conformation determined by X-ray crystallography. We suggest how our methods could be extended to any bridge fragment for SQ-Bride-NN complexes. This model is useful for designing new strongly exchange coupled systems, for using electronic structure theory to study exchange in organic systems, and for correlating exchange coupling parameters with elements of electron transfer theory.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09252006-111623/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reality and Representations: How Americans Think About Agriculture</field><field name="creator">Fulkerson, Gregory Malone</field><field name="description">The purpose of this dissertation is to identify representations of agriculture in America and to develop models that predict the different representations. It is concluded that social representation theory?as it has been formalized here?is useful for explaining how Americans think about agriculture, particularly alternative representations of structure and technology. While past research on attitudes and paradigms has emphasized that personal characteristics and socioeconomic status are important predictors, this research finds that they play less of a role when controlling for variables operationalizing the propositions of social representation theory?trust of networks, personal perceptions, and pre-existing ideas. Future research should incorporate additional sets of questions operationalizing pre-existing ideas such as the way Americans think about economic efficiency and productivity as well as science and technology, as these may improve the explanatory power of the conventional representations models. Finally, a disparity between representations and reality is argued to exist that makes the current state of agricultural policy unrepresentative and therefore undemocratic.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09252006-185347/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A "fitter" Text of John Donne's "The Good Morrow"</field><field name="creator">Massey, Lara</field><field name="description">The purpose of this paper has been to explain the process by which I established the text of John Donne?s ?The Good Morrow.?

Further study of genistein?s effects on the ovary revealed inhibition of neonatal oocyte nest breakdown; oocytes were still attached by intercellular bridges and the normal progression of apoptosis was attenuated. Mechanistic studies of MOF formation revealed alterations in cell adhesion molecules. In addition, genistein is not unique in its ability to cause ovarian disruption; other environmental estrogens caused MOFs as well as altered cell adhesion molecule expression. Further, these effects appear to be exacerbated by preferential binding to ER&#226;. Assessment of reproductive function showed that mice treated with genistein (0.5 and 5 mg/kg) showed signs of early reproductive senescence while mice treated with genistein (50 mg/kg) exhibited infertility characterized by fewer, smaller, implantation sites as well as reabsorptions; ovaries from these mice had no corpora lutea. Stimulation with exogenous gonadotropins restored ovulation, suggesting problems with the hypothalamic-gonadal axis. These data taken together demonstrate that neonatal exposure to genistein at environmentally relevant doses causes adverse effects on the developing reproductive system and in particular on the ovary.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toxicology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09262005-095720/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recovering Preferences for Public Goods from a Dual-Market Locational Equilibrium</field><field name="creator">Kuminoff, Nicolai V.</field><field name="description">This research extends the existing literature on revealed preference models of location choice by developing a ?dual-market? sorting framework that uses information on households and their location choices in the housing and labor markets to infer their demand for local public goods. It also recognizes that households may differ in their relative preferences for those public goods. Four interrelated objectives are addressed. First, the analysis develops a theoretical model that relates households? location choices in the housing and labor markets to the levels of local public goods provided by each of a finite set of communities. Second, it generalizes Epple and Sieg?s (1999) empirical model to recognize that: (i) households make a joint job-house choice and (ii) households differ in their job skills and in their relative preferences for different public goods. Third, the analysis uses the empirical model to develop a general equilibrium framework to simulate how households and markets would adjust to a large-scale change in the provision of a public good. Finally, the new dual-market estimation and simulation frameworks are used to analyze the welfare implications of a hypothetical air quality improvement that would allow the San Francisco-Sacramento region of Northern California to meet the state?s recently revised standards for ambient concentrations of ground-level ozone.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09272006-090248/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an Optical Profilometer and the Related Advanced Signal Processing Methods for Monitoring Surface Quality of Wood Machining Applications</field><field name="creator">Lemaster, Richard L</field><field name="description">The research described here provides the technology and theory to quantify surface quality for a variety of wood and wood-based products. This technology provides a means of monitoring trends in surface quality which can be used to discriminate between Agood@ products and Abad@ products (the methods described in this research are not intended to provide ?grading? of individual workpieces) as well as provide information to the machine operator as to the source of poor quality machined surfaces. The analysis can be done either on-line at industrial speeds or off-line as a periodic quality control tool. Although the surface quality can be quantifiably measured, the determination of the best feature from the surface profile (root mean square, peak amplitude, average wavelength, frequency content, Joint Time and Frequency Analysis (JTFA) and Wavelet Analysis results, etc.) for the quantification of surface Adefects@ is highly dependent on the application. This research consisted of three broad areas: (1) determination of an optimal hardware configuration for both laboratory and industrial surface scans of wood products, (2) determination of the optimal set of surface descriptors as well as the development of advanced signal processing techniques such as the wavelet transform to accurately describe the quality of a surface as well as provide information to the machine operator on the cause of the loss of surface quality, and (3) development of a software interface to distill the advanced signal processing techniques into a readily obtainable and readable format for the machine operator as well as provide assistance for process decisions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wood and Paper Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09282004-152158/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NON-CONTACT OBJECT TRANSPORTATION USING NEAR-FIELD ACOUSTIC LEVITATION INDUCED BY ULTRASONIC FLEXURAL WAVES</field><field name="creator">Yin, Yanbo</field><field name="description">Handling and processing precision products, such as Compact Discs, LCDs, LSIs and silicon wafers requires strict conditions to keep the products from acquiring tiny defects, scratches and stains. A non-contact transportation system using Near-Field Acoustic Levitation (NFAL) will satisfy these conditions. An initial experiment was firstly set up to check the validation of NFAL Phenomenon. A system consisting of an aluminum beam, two piezoelectric actuators and a mechanical horn was experimentally and theoretically analyzed. With an input of 300 Vp-p, a flat object weighing 4g could be levitated and transported with the speed up to 17 cm/s. The transportation direction can be reversed by adjusting the phase angle difference between the two actuators. Computational fluid dynamics simulation was performed to obtain the time average speed in acoustic streaming. Sliding Film Theory was then utilized to investigate the mechanism of transportation, where the shear force induced by the acoustic streaming was found to be the main source of driving the floating object. To extend the transportation, transportation over a curved path and Module-to-Module connection were experimentally performed. A beam with a shape of 90 degrees of arc was found to have uniform mode shapes and experiment results confirmed its feasibility to change transportation direction. For Module-to-Module connection, a speed threshold was discovered beyond which the transportation would be smooth without any problems. Cylinder rolling induced by the acoustic streaming was also performed to find out the dynamics of the cylinder. To optimize the system performance, the mechanical parts were analyzed in frequency domain. A close-loop system, which consists of the transportation module, vision module, and instrumentation module, was proposed. PID, Single Neuron Method and Sliding Mode Control were adopted to investigate the control effects and the performance results were mixed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09282007-091302/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Real-time Photorealistic Stereoscopic Rendering of Fire</field><field name="creator">Rose, Benjamin Michael</field><field name="description">We propose a method for real-time photorealistic stereo rendering of the natural phenomenon of fire. Applications include the use of virtual reality in fire fighting, military training, and entertainment. Rendering fire in real-time presents a challenge because of the transparency and non-static fluid-like behavior of fire. It is well known that, in general, methods that are effective for monoscopic rendering are not necessarily easily extended to stereo rendering because monoscopic methods often do not provide the depth information necessary to produce the parallax required for binocular disparity in stereoscopic rendering. We investigate the existing techniques used for monoscopic rendering of fire and discuss their suitability for extension to real-time stereo rendering. Methods include the use of precomputed textures, dynamic generation of textures, and rendering models resulting from the approximation of solutions of fluid dynamics equations through the use of ray-tracing algorithms. We have found that in order to attain real-time frame rates, our method based on billboarding is effective. Slicing is used to simulate depth. Texture mapping or 2D images are mapped onto polygons and alpha blending is used to treat transparency. We can use video recordings or pre-rendered high-quality images of fire as textures to attain photorealistic stereo.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09282007-170133/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time-Frequency Effects in Wireless Communication Systems</field><field name="creator">Mazzaro, Gregory James</field><field name="description">Time-frequency effects in wireless communication systems caused by narrowband resonances and coupled with device nonlinearities are revealed as new sources of co-site interference, exploited for the metrology of bandpass circuits, and employed to linearize amplitude-modulated transmissions. The transient properties of bandpass filters are found to last much longer than traditional time/bandwidth rules-of-thumb. The cause of this long-tail behavior is attributed to the coupled-resonator structure of the filter circuit. A solution method which uses lowpass prototyping is developed to reduce, by a factor of two, the complexity of the differential equation set describing a narrowband filter's transient response. Pulse overlap caused by the frequency dependence of long tails produced by filters is shown to cause intersymbol interference and intermodulation distortion in RF front-ends during frequency-hopped communications. The same properties which cause the ISI and IMD are used to develop three new transient methods for measuring resonant circuit parameters and a one-port method for extracting the operating band of a filter. A new signal-processing technique which combines time- and frequency-selectivity, Linear Amplification by Time-Multiplexed Spectrum, is developed to reduce IMD associated with amplitude modulation. Distortion reduction is demonstrated experimentally for multisines up to 20 tones.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09292009-115014/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct Detection of Microcalcification Pairs in Simulated Digital Mammograms</field><field name="creator">Zeigler, Gary Boyce</field><field name="description">Using the MCMIS (Monte Carlo for Mammography Image Simulation) code, several possible scenarios of microcalcification images were simulated for the Fischer SenoscanTM digital mammography system, which has been approved for clinical use by the F.D.A. The cases simulated included detectors that have 100 ?&#221;m x 100 ?&#221;m, 50 ?&#221;m x 50 ?&#221;m, and 25 ?&#221;m x 25 ?&#221;m pixels in order to determine how much improvement can be obtained through decreased pixel size in the detection of microcalcification clusters in mammograms. Breast thickness was also varied for each modality from 4 to 7 cm in order to determine the effect that reduced breast compression will have on image quality under ideal conditions. The breast phantom used for each simulation included a region of microcalcification pairs of varying size and pair spacing. This microcalcification cluster phantom was designed such that simulated images would indicate the minimum required size and spacing for microcalcification clusters to become distinctly discernable in each of the modalities under scrutiny. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed for each simulated image produced. A decrease in detector pixel size did not show the expected result of significant improvement in cluster detection ability, even under ideal conditions. However, for the range of breast thickness studied, results indicate that decreasing the amount of compression during a mammogram did not significantly affect the image quality in terms of image resolution or contrast for all detector modalities tested. These results suggest that new detector modalities incorporating smaller detector pixel sizes may not show significant improvement over current modalities. However, they also suggest that doctors may be able to make the mammogram process less painful for the patient while maintaining image quality.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09302002-095022/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SOCIAL SUPPORT AND MENTAL WELL-BEING: THE INTERSECTIONALITY OF AGE, RACE, GENDER, AND CLASS</field><field name="creator">Mair, Christine Armstrong</field><field name="description">Aging literature often links social support to higher levels of mental well-being for older adults. Findings concerning variations in the impact of social support on mental well-being according to race, age, gender, and class, however, are not consistent. This paper argues that the reason for these inconsistencies is due to a lack of attention to the intersectionality of inequality in older populations and resulting cumulative disadvantages. I employ an intersectionality perspective to examine how processes of social support (marriage, children, frequency, proximity, and perceptions) interact with race, age, gender, and class to produce differential outcomes in terms of mental well-being. Using data from the 2004 wave of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), I use split samples to test the effect of social support and intersections of inequality on the depressive symptoms of adults over the age of 50. Findings indicate that there is a clear interaction between social support and inequality. Contrary to many theories, women and minorities in this sample are more different than similar. Individuals aged 80 and older of all race and gender groups are less responsive to social support than other age groups. Black men, in particular, emerge as a group particularly at risk for higher depression. The findings demonstrate the necessity of using an intersectionality perspective when studying (increasingly diverse) aging populations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-09302007-220612/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling Thermal Protection Outfits for Fire Exposures</field><field name="creator">Song, Guowen</field><field name="description">A numerical model has been developed that successfully predicts heat transfer through thermally protective clothing materials and garments exposed to intense heat. The model considers the effect of fire exposure to the thermophysical properties of materials as well as the air layers between the clothing material and skin surface. These experiments involved characterizing the flash fire surrounding the manikin by measuring the temperature of the flame above each thermal sensor in the manikin surface. An estimation method is used to calculate the heat transfer coefficient for each thermal sensor in a 4 second exposure to an average heat flux of 2.00cal/cm2sec. A parameter estimation method was used to estimate fabrics dynamic thermophysical properties. The skin-clothe air gap distribution of different garments was determined using three-dimensional body scanning technology. Multi-layer skin heat transfer and a burn prediction models are used to predict second and third degree burns. The integrated generalized model developed will validated using the "Pyroman" Thermal Protective Clothing Analysis System with Kevlar/PBI&#174; and Nomex&#174;?A coverall garments. A parametric study conducted using this numerical model indicated the influencing parameters on garment thermal protective performance in terms of burn damage subjected to 4 second flash fire exposure. The importance of these parameters is analyzed and distinguished. These parameters includes fabric thermophysical properties, Pyroman&#174; chamber generated flash fire characterizes, garment shrinkage and fit factors, as well as garment initial and test ambient temperature.

A natural class of objects for study are the close binary stars that contain compact objects such as neutron stars or black holes. These systems are bright X-ray emitters, allowing us to study the circumstellar gas within them. We use numerical hydrodynamic modeling to study mass transfer processes in the high-mass X-ray binaries, including the evolutionary sequence between wind fed and disk fed systems, elliptical orbit X-ray binaries, and the global dynamics of LMC X-4 in 3D.

In order to demonstrate effective and efficient optical communication for robots, the research had first to address the problem of expanding the field of view of retroreflectors. Experimentation shows that the device is beneficial for robotics navigation and localization, and for underwater optical communication. The retroreflector is similar to other conventional cat?s-eye retroreflector designs, but the use of a fisheye lens and compensating lens to collimates the light before it enters a spherical retroreflector was found facilitate a wider field of view. Using this approach the retroreflector FOV was increased to 180 degrees although at the expense of divergence angle due to spherical aberration. The combination of both a laser transceiver unit and the retroreflector formed a very useful device for several short-range wireless optical communication scenarios including robot to robot communication in situations whereby navigation and localization was executed for collaborating robots and potentially underwater optical communication in turbid water. For ease in testing and implementation visible and near infrared wavelengths were used with a relatively low speed, polarization independent, liquid crystal modulator. While the data rate and range of the tested system are limited, the results of the project indicate that with high speed optical modulators and a suitable pointing and tracking system that collaborative robot activities and robot to robot communications can be substantially advance by using free space optical communications with wide field of view retroreflectors.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10012006-175414/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Industry Technology Roadmap for the Flushable Pre-moistened Nonwoven Wipes Industry</field><field name="creator">Kim, Mun Jung</field><field name="description">The body of this research seeks to create an Industry Technology Roadmap for one segment of the U.S. textile and apparel industry, specifically, the flushable pre-moistened wipes industry. Industry Technology Roadmapping is a new type of strategic planning method. Previous technology forecasting methods allowed planners to identify several alternate future states or scenarios and provided uncertainty in either product needs or technological developments. In contrast, Industry Technology Roadmapping allows a company or an industry to proactively plan and prepare for its future by offering future goals, critical requirements and, finally, solutions to achieve the future goals. In addition, Roadmapping works as an effective organizational learning and knowledge creation tool and induces collaboration and new partnerships among companies as well. Currently, flushable pre-moistened nonwoven wipes emerge as new textile products and attempt to expand their future markets. During this research, industry expert interviews and surveys, consumer surveys, heavy user surveys, creation of an Internet blog, and literature review including a patent analysis were conducted for data gathering. The resulting Roadmap provides the nonwoven wipes industry valuable information about the potential future markets, required properties, the current environment of flushable wipes, including challenges, strength, and opportunities, and the solutions. These can help the U.S. nonwoven wipes industry to do informed investment into research, development and manufacturing facilities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Technology Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10012009-081723/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Leading-Edge Flame Behavior on Flame Stabilization and Blowout</field><field name="creator">Moore, Nancy Jennings</field><field name="description">The goal of this work was to identify the mechanisms that effect stabilization of hydrocarbon jet flames. Methane, nitrogen, and co-flowing air were regulated and directed through a burner that created fully-developed fuel flow with concurrent air. The behavior of the reaction zone at the leading-edge was analyzed from digital images obtained from a camera optimally positioned to capture the movements of the entire flame front. Low Reynolds number flows allowed for the investigation of hysteretic behavior. The hysteresis regime refers to the situation where the jet flame has dual positions favorable to flame stabilization: attached and lifted. Results indicate that flame height in hysteresis is significantly impacted by high velocities of co-flow and that past a critical value a local minimum will be created. Fully turbulent lifted flames were also studied to determine the fluctuations in the height of lifted methane flames in the presence of air co-flow. The partially-premixed flame front of the lifted flame fluctuates in the axial direction, with the fluctuations becoming greater in flames stabilized further downstream. These fluctuations are also observed in flames where blowout is imminent. The height and rate of these fluctuations are studied with respect to average height, flow velocities, and Reynolds number. Additionally, the mechanisms that cause jet-flame blowout, particularly in the presence of air co-flow, are not completely understood. Two types of experiments are described, and the data report that a predictor of blowout is the prior disappearance of the axially-oriented flame branch which is consistently witnessed despite a turbulent flame&#226;s inherent variable behavior. The conclusions are supported by experiments with nitrogen-diluted flames. A blowout parameter is also calculated for methane flames in co-flow and diluted methane flames that can be used to predict at what flow velocities blowout will occur. This work analyzes flames near the burner, in the far field, and approaching blowout. The comprehensive study allows for the realization that the mechanisms of flame stabilization differ throughout the combustible field.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10012009-135737/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Equidistance Errors in a Reduced Cue Environment</field><field name="creator">Kaufmann, Karl Alexander</field><field name="description">The equidistance tendency (ET) is the tendency of an observer to misperceive the depth interval between objects in a scene as being smaller than it actually is, particularly in the absence of strong depth cues and as the lateral separation between the objects decreases (Gogel, 1965). The present experiment was an attempt to create a display that would evoke a change in the influence of the ET as the lateral separation of display objects was varied. The display configuration used replicated (with updated equipment) that of a previous study (Hill and Mershon, 1985) which had reliably produced the desired effect. However, one property of the new equipment resulted in the appearance of a faintly visible background behind the main display objects that was not present in the previous experiment. In the present experiment, the display object with the poorest depth cues, which was expected to vary in perceived distance due to the ET effect, did not vary in apparent distance. Instead, one of the other objects, with stronger depth cues, varied in apparent distance. The results suggest that the presence of the faint background may have acted as an additional display object, despite its low contrast with the wider background of the visual field. This implies that even objects that are very low in salience can have a significant effect on perceived distances.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10012009-220516/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving The Dye House Through The Removal Of Unwanted Bottlenecks By Modernization And Energy Conservation</field><field name="creator">Hollar, Edward Eugene</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research has been to find ways to improve a package dye house through modernization and energy conservation. The research involved six months of floor studies done at the dye house, two assessments done by the Industrial Assessment Center, and research into ways to save energy and increase productivity. The dye house does not have any energy conservation systems in place, and there is a lot of opportunity to save energy if one was in place. This thesis details an energy conservation program that will help conserve energy with very little cost. The total energy savings recommended for this program is 18,579 MMBtu per year. The total cost savings is $81,258 per year. In addition to the energy conservation program, this thesis recommends a major modernization project. The dye house produces 200,000 lb a week, but its limiting factor is not the dye machines. The dryers at this facility control production levels. These dryers are very old and inefficient. The dye house should install two super dryers to replace all existing dryers. The project will take less than 3 years to implement and presents a simple pay back of 3 months. The energy savings are 84,856 MMBtu per year. This is a cost savings of $481,711 per year. In addition to the energy savings, the super dryer will save an estimated $3,141,759 per year in productivity savings. The total cost savings for this project is $3,623,470 per year.

The goal of this research was to characterize phosphate sorption in single- and mixed Fe- and Al-oxide systems using XANES (X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy). The specific objectives of this research were: 1) To determine the quantitative distribution of phosphate between Fe-and Al-oxide minerals in mixtures containing these minerals; 2) To assign XANES spectral features for phosphate associated with Fe(III) or Al(III) to specific electronic transitions; and 3) To characterize adsorption versus surface precipitation in single- and binary mixtures of Fe- and Al-oxide minerals. Phosphate was sorbed in single-mineral aqueous suspensions of ferrihydrite (ferric hydroxide), boehmite (aluminum oxyhydroxide), goethite (iron oxyhydroxide), or non-crystalline (non-xl) Al-hydroxide, and mixtures of ferrihydrite/boehmite, goethite/boehmite, and ferrihydrite/non-xl Al-hydroxide at pH 6. Samples were reacted at 22 degrees Celsius for 42 h. Phosphate sorption isotherm trends for mixed-mineral systems were L-curves and were intermediate to those of the respective minerals in the mixture. Phosphorus K-XANES spectra for phosphate on Fe- vs. Al-oxide minerals differed in that a weak doublet peak was observed for Fe-oxides on the low-energy side of the P K-edge, i.e., in the pre-edge region. The quantitative distribution of phosphate between ferrihydrite and boehmite in mixtures of these minerals was determined using linear combination fitting (LCF) analysis of the XANES pre-edge region. Results showed that phosphate essentially distributed itself in proportion to the maximum phosphate sorption capacity of each of these minerals. Using a XANES fitting procedure, phosphate was found to show a greater apparent preference for boehmite and non-xl Al-hydroxide minerals in goethite/boehmite and ferrihydrite/non-xl Al-hydroxide mixtures, respectively. To interpret XANES spectra based on molecular bonding configuration, spectral features were assigned to specific electronic transitions using bonding arguments supported by extended Huckel (EH) model computations of molecular orbital energies (projected density of states-PDOS). Experimental evidence (both XANES and UV-visible spectroscopy) was given for the white-line peak in Fe(III)/phosphate systems being caused by a dipole allowed transition of a P 1s electron to a P(3p)-O(2p) antibonding molecular orbital. Similarly, the white-line peak in Al-phosphate systems was assigned to a dipole allowed transition into a Al(3p)-O(2p)-P(3p) antibonding molecular orbital. The pre-edge feature in XANES spectra was assigned to a dipole allowed transition into a Fe(4p)-O(2p) antibonding molecular orbital. Using these XANES spectral assignments, the increase in FWHM (full width at half maximum height) of the white-line peak in XANES spectra indicated precipitation. Based on a linear increase in FWHM with increasing sorbed phosphate concentration, Al-phosphate surface precipitation occurred in boehmite and non-xl Al-hydroxide systems. On the contrary, no evidence was found for Fe-phosphate precipitation in single-mineral systems of goethite and ferrihydrite. Surface precipitation occurred in goethite/boehmite mixtures following similar trends as in boehmite, but no evidence for surface precipitation was found in ferrihydrite/non-xl Al-hydroxide mixtures over the range of phosphate studied (up to 1230 mmol/ kg). In these mixtures, mineral interactive effects apparently inhibited Al-phosphate precipitation as occurred when phosphate was reacted with non-xl Al-hydroxide alone. Furthermore, phosphate showed a trend of affinity preference for non-xl Al-hydroxide with increasing adsorbed P concentrations in the ferrihydrite/non-xl Al-hydroxide mixtures.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10032003-114015/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Protein Concentration and Temperature on Flavor Delivery of 2,4-Dimethylbenzaldehyde and Ethyl Butyrate in Whey Protein Isolate Solutions</field><field name="creator">Spicer, Valerie Denise</field><field name="description">The development of reduced fat foods is a continual challenge in the food industry. Among the many attributes fat contributes to food products is flavor. Fat replacers are used to regain some of these lost attributes as fat is removed from foods. These fat substitutes affect the rate and concentration at which flavor molecules are released during mastication. Whey is a source of protein for protein-based fat replacers. The effects this ingredient has on flavor intensity was studied utilizing 2,4-Dimethylbenzaldehyde (DMB) and Ethyl Butyrate (EB). The objective of this project was to develop a headspace gas chromatography method to measure the changes in volatility of these two flavor compounds in various concentrations of WPI solutions and to compare these results to sensory findings. There was a significant decrease in the volatility of DMB with increases of protein concentration from 0 to 2%. Aroma and taste intensity also decreased with increasing protein concentration.

Participants consisted of 120 (60 = female, 60 = male) college students. The study design was a 2 (Gender) X 2 (Justification) X 3 (Procedure) factorial between-groups experimental design. Based on social exclusion theory, individuals may experience high levels of negative affect when they perceive a threat of exclusion from a group (Baumeister &amp; Tice, 1990). It was hypothesized that a procedure designed to validate ethnic membership will result in social exclusion threat negative affect. A procedure designed to validate ethnic membership was hypothesized as being evaluated as unfair (Thibaut, Walker, LaTour, &amp; Houlden, 1974; Lind &amp; Tyler, 1988; Tyler, 1990, 1994; Tyler &amp; Lind, 1994; Walker, LaTour, Lind, &amp; Thibaut, 1974). Justifications (Bies, 1987a, 1987b, 1989; Bies &amp; Moag, 1986; Bies &amp; Shapiro, 1987, 1988; Brotheridge, 2003; Skarlicki, Folger &amp; Gee, 2004) before the procedure was tested as the rationale for the procedure introduced as procedural justification. Of two procedural justifications, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Science Foundation (NSF) justification was hypothesized as being perceived fairer. The results suggest that procedures designed to validate ethnic membership were evaluated as unfair. Additionally, the results indicated that procedural justifications might affect perceptions of fairness of the procedure. The data strongly supports the notion that these procedures may create an environment of negative affect with respondents evaluating the procedures as unfair.

The pair-edge approximation is a moment-closure method that is effective in predicting persistence criteria and invasion speeds on a homogeneous lattice. Here the effectiveness of the pair-edge approximation is evaluated on a spatially heterogeneous lattice in which some sites are unoccupiable, or ?dead?. This model has several possible interpretations, including a spatial SIS epidemic model, in which immobile host-species individuals occupy some sites while others are empty. As in the homogeneous model, the pair-edge approximation is found to be significantly more accurate than the ordinary pair approximation in determining conditions for persistence. However, habitat heterogeneity decreases invasion speed more than is predicted by the pair-edge approximation, and the discrepancy increases with greater clustering of dead sites. The accuracy of the approximation validates the underlying heuristic picture of population spread and therefore provides qualitative insight into the dynamics of lattice models. Conversely, the situations where the approximation is less accurate reveal limitations of pair approximation in the presence of spatial heterogeneity.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10072002-180540/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NANOSCALE INVESTIGATION OF THE PIEZOELECTRIC PROPERTIES OF PEROVSKITE FERROELECTRICS AND III-NITRIDES</field><field name="creator">Rodriguez, Brian Joseph</field><field name="description">Nanoscale characterization of the piezoelectric and polarization related properties of III-Nitrides by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) and scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) resulted in the measurement of piezoelectric constants, surface charge and surface potential. Photo-electron emission microscopy (PEEM) was used to determine the local electronic band structure of a GaN-based lateral polarity heterostructure (GaN-LPH). Nanoscale characterization of the imprint and switching behavior of ferroelectric thin films by PFM resulted in the observation of domain pinning, while nanoscale characterization of the spatial variations in the imprint and switching behavior of integrated (111)-oriented PZT-based ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM) capacitors by PFM have revealed a significant difference in imprint and switching behavior between the inner and outer parts of capacitors. The inner regions of the capacitors are typically negatively imprinted and consequently tend to switch back after being poled by a positive bias, while regions at the edge of the capacitors tend to exhibit more symmetric hysteresis behavior. Evidence was obtained indicating that mechanical stress conditions in the central regions of the capacitors can lead to incomplete switching. A combination of vertical and lateral piezoresponse force microscopy (VPFM and LPFM, respectively) has been used to map the out-of-plane and in-plane polarization distribution, respectively, of integrated (111)-oriented PZT-based capacitors, which revealed poled capacitors are in a polydomain state.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10072003-122453/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Homeschooling as Reflexive Modernity</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Earl</field><field name="description">Although still a substantial minority, there now exists a sizable and growing population of parents in the United States making the decision to educate their children themselves, in their own homes. Curiosity, skepticism and often misperceptions abound about this group of people. Scholarly inquiries into the world of homeschooling have tended to focus on parental motivations to homeschool, characteristics of homeschoolers, homeschooling methods and homeschooling outcomes, usually measured by standardized test scores. Perhaps the largest body of research has sought to sort and classify homeschoolers according to various typologies. Research to date has shed a great deal of light on what appears to many a somewhat shadowy niche of American society. While helpful, many of these studies are severely limited and have sometimes produced, I will argue, misleading results. Using in-depth qualitative interviews with homeschooling families in North Carolina, I explore some of these issues. I will argue that none of the various homeschooling typologies work when compared to the lived experiences of actual homeschooling families. I suggest that a concentration on what homeschoolers have in common is more useful than attempts to subdivide and force them into ill-fitting typologies. I explore the connections between sociological theories of modernization and homeschooling. Specifically, I adapt and expand theories of reflexive modernity and argue that homeschoolers are best understood as social innovators at the micro-level through a practiced reflexive-modernization. I conclude with a discussion of the implications of designating homeschoolers as &#226;reflexively modern&#226;.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10082008-160408/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#226;Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Can See&#226;: An Analysis of Workplace Surveillance, Resistance and Consent</field><field name="creator">Payne, Julianne</field><field name="description">Since the 1990s, workplace surveillance has become a popular topic of sociological investigation.

I find that workers neither consent wholeheartedly to surveillance, nor do they uniformly resist their control. Instead, my analyses reveal that the form of workplace surveillance employed&#226;direct supervision, electronic surveillance, peer monitoring, customer surveillance&#226;affects whether work groups resist or consent to managerial control.

Knowledge of the equilibrium between the supercritical fluid and polymer phases may be applied to understanding the mechanisms involved in heterogeneous polymerizations in scCO2. Several experimental systems were developed and/or utilized for measuring the phase equilibrium. These included a system for measuring the swelling of solid polymer particles in the presence of scCO2, a system for measuring the mass sorption and diffusion of supercritical fluids into the polymer phase, and a system for measuring the partitioning of reactant species between the polymer and supercritical fluid phases. The sorption and swelling of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) was measured at conditions similar to those of the polymerizations. The Sanchez-Lacombe equation of state was applied to modeling the binary and ternary phase equilibria for the VF2-CO2-PVDF system. Carbon dioxide exhibits a favorable interaction with PVDF that is enhanced at increasing fluid densities. Additionally, the monomer exhibits a favorable interaction with PVDF that improves the mass sorption into the polymer phase and expands the tunability of the fluid to change the polymer properties. The impact of the phase equilibrium on the precipitation polymerization of vinylidene fluoride in scCO2 is discussed. The bimodal molecular weight distribution of PVDF synthesized in CO2 could be due, in part, to the sorption of VF2 into the polymer phase and the plasticization of the polymer to facilitate propagation of the polymer chains to high molecular weights within the polymer particles. This dissertation provides a foundation for understanding the impact of the phase equilibrium on heterogeneous polymerizations in supercritical carbon dioxide. It provides techniques for identifying and improving conditions for polymerizations in supercritical carbon dioxide and optimizing CO2-based processes of a heterogeneous nature.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10092003-214255/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrogen Use Efficiency and Yield Effects of Urea Formaldehyde Polymer (UFP) Fertilizer in Winter Wheat and Maize</field><field name="creator">Cahill, Sheri Ms.</field><field name="description">The potential for improved fertilizer nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) and yield in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) was tested using a new, controlled release urea formaldehyde polymer (UFP). This polymer was compared with conventional aqueous urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) [(NH2)2CO?NH4NO3] fertilizer during a two-year field experiment in North Carolina from 2004 to 2006. The crops were grown on three soils: Candor (sandy, siliceous, thermic Grossarenic Kandiudult), Portsmouth (fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Umbraquult) and Cape Fear (fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Umbraquult). The sandy soil was irrigated as needed to avoid drought stress. Treatments were N source (UAN and UFP) and N rate (0, 50, 78, 106, 134, 162, and 190 kg N ha-1 or 0, 45, 70, 95, 120, 145, and 170 lb ac-1 for wheat and 0, 39, 78, 118, 157, 196, and 235 kg N ha-1 or 0, 35, 70, 105, 140, 175, and 210 lb ac-1 for maize) arranged as randomized complete blocks with four replications. The UAN and UFP were applied as a split application for wheat, while maize received UFP at planting and split UAN. Timing of the materials was determined either by label (UFP) or prior experimental experience (UAN). Harvest biomass, grain, and mid-season soil sampling were performed to assess N availability. For both crops, UAN performed statistically similar to or better than UFP at both sites with regards to yields and NUE. Also, soil sampling and incubation results showed no consistent difference between N sources, implying the slow release properties of the UFP were not seen under the site and laboratory conditions. The release time for both sources at both sites was approximately 14 days (2 weeks). Since the cost of UFP is substantially greater than UAN and form did not significantly affect yield, UFP may not be as economical as UAN, depending on pricing of the different fertilizers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10092006-092341/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithm for Phylogeny Inference</field><field name="creator">Lin, Yu-Min</field><field name="description">Phylogenetics is the study of evolutionary relations between different organisms. Phylogenetic trees are the representations of these relations. Researchers have been working on finding fast and systematic approaches to reconstruct phylogenetic trees from observed data for over 40 years. It has been shown that, given a certain criterion to evaluate each tree, finding the best fitted phylogenetic trees among all possible trees is an NP-hard problem. In this study, we focus on the topology searching techniques for the maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood phylogeny inference. We proposed two search methods based on tabu search and genetic algorithms. We first explore the feasibility of using tabu search for finding the maximum-parsimony trees. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated based on its efficiency and accuracy. Then we proposed a hybrid method of the tabu search and genetic algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the hybrid method can provide maximum-parsimony trees with a ggood level of accuracy and efficiency. The hybrid method is also implemented for finding maximum-likelihood trees. The experimental results show that the proposed hybrid method produce better maximum-likelihood trees than the default-setting dnaml program in average on the tested data sets. On a much larger data set, the hybrid method outperforms the default-setting dnaml program and has equally good performance as the dnaml program with the selected jumble option.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10092008-235130/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing nitrogen from swine and poultry manure in North Carolina.</field><field name="creator">Allen, Mark Benjamin</field><field name="description">With increasing pressure to regulate land application of animal manure, North Carolina faces a difficult dilemma, given the number of large-scale animal production facilities currently in operation. Poultry and swine industries in the state generate large volumes of animal manure that must be properly managed in order to avoid loss of N to ground water and surface water bodies. Using swine manure as an N source for soybean production is not commonly practiced due to soybean&#161;&#166;s ability to fix N, but recent research suggests that soybean may be a suitable receiver crop of anaerobic swine lagoon effluent. The objectives of this research were twofold: (1) determine the quantity of swine effluent-derived N taken up by soybean and estimate the degree of inhibition of symbiotic N-fixation and (2) determine how soil pH affects N mineralization, nitrification and immobilization when soil is amended with broiler litter. Swine effluent was spiked with (15NH4)2SO4 in order to attain a mean final 15N enrichment of 5.765 atom % 15N. The enriched effluent was applied 6 times at weekly intervals to nodulating and nonnodulating soybean growing in one-meter deep lysimeters at a rate of 185 kg PAN ha-1. Additional lysimeters with nodulating and nonnodulating soybean received no applications of effluent. Leachate was collected on a weekly basis and analyzed for 15N and total N. Soybean were harvested near maturity and analyzed for 15N and total N. Biological N-fixation in soybean was not completely inhibited when swine effluent was added and accounted for 55% of the total N in the shoot. Nodulated and nonnodulated soybean shoots recovered similar amounts of effluent N (36.6% and 33.4%, respectively). The addition of effluent and nodulation were both important sources of N for soybean growth, although the results suggest that nodulating and nonnodulating soybean behaved differently when they received effluent additions, as indicated by significant interactions. The experimental data showed that less than 1% of the added effluent N was accounted for in the leachate. An N budget of the plant-soil-water system showed that, of the effluent N added to nodulated soybean, 37% remained in the soil after the soybean were harvested, while 33% remained in the effluent-treated nonnodulated soybean. These results suggest that soybean can serve as an N receiver crop when swine effluent is the N source. To determine the effects of soil pH on N transformations in broiler litter amended soils, Wagram loamy sand with a pH of 4.4 was collected from a forested area near Clayton, NC, and sub-samples were limed to pH 4.8, 5.3, 5.8, 6.4, and 7.0. Broiler litter was added at a rate of 155 kg PAN ha-1 to the limed soils and incubated at 25?&#223;C and 60% of field capacity for 112 d. Total inorganic N was measured at 0, 7, 14, 28, 56, 77, and 112 d. Cumulative net N mineralized was fitted to a first order model to determine potentially mineralizable N. Although nitrification rates increased as soil pH increased, there were significant inverse relationships between soil pH and net N mineralized, as well as soil pH and potentially mineralizable N. Isotope dilution measurements showed that gross and net mineralization rates were equivalent, refuting the notion that relatively more NH4 immobilization had occurred in the high pH soils. The results indicate that N mineralization was enhanced at low soil pH, a phenomenon that presently is not fully understood.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10102003-082155/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE INCORPORATION OF IDENTITY: ALIENATION AND THE MARKETPLACE IN MELVILLE, SALINGER, AND CREWS</field><field name="creator">CURRAN, TYLER JENNINGS</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how the history and development of capitalism affect the characters in Herman Melville?s Moby-Dick (1851), J.D.

In particular, it examines the ways in which the individual copes with the alienating economic pressures of the mid-nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. Relying on historical and sociological perspectives, this project reveals the degree to which these novels elucidate a marked tension between capitalism and democracy ? between private interests and the public trust. The introduction contextualizes the novels and provides a historical account of corporate capitalism?s development from the Civil War to the present. The subsequent chapters present analyses of the novels that are informed by history. They demonstrate that the alienation and existential dread experienced by Melville?s, Salinger?s, and Crews?s characters are exacerbated by the dominance of capitalism over social life. Finally, this project examines the ways in which these novels scrutinize systems of social organization and it finds that these novels encourage readers to evaluate systems of social organization for points of revision, reform, or potential improvement.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10102006-121848/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Concurrency control in distributed caching.</field><field name="creator">Dev, Kashinath</field><field name="description">Replication and caching strategies are increasingly being used to improve performance and reduce delays in distributed environments.

Anecdotal and mass media accounts suggest that social networks are responsible for differences in occupational outcomes for black and white coaches. The relatively small amount of academic research on the issue relies upon additive assumptions regarding the relationship between race and social networks. As a result, this research assumes that similar network structures and resources lead to similar occupational outcomes for black and white coaches (see Sagas and Cunningham 2005). The purpose of this research is to build upon previous work by testing these additive assumptions by examining the interactive effects of race and social networks on college football coaches? careers. Using Sagas and Cunningham?s (2005) data on 328 assistant football coaches at the Division I-A level, OLS regression and race by network interaction terms are used to examine their interactive effects on occupational status and mobility. The results show that the proportion of same race ties, higher status ties, and strong ties have different effects on occupational mobility for white and black coaches.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10112007-143128/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ranking Theory with Application to Popular Sports.</field><field name="creator">Govan, Anjela Yuryevna</field><field name="description">The rank of an object is its relative importance to the other objects in a finite set of size n. Often a rank is an integer assigned from the set { 1,2,...,n}. Ideally an assignment of available ranks ({1,2,...,n}) to n objects is one-to-one. However in certain circumstances it is possible that more than one object is assigned the same rank. A ranking model is a method of determining a way in which the ranks are assigned. Typically a ranking model uses information available to determine a rating for each object. The ratings carry more information than the ranks; they provide us with the degree of relative importance of each object. Once we have the ratings the assignment of ranks can be as simple as sorting the objects in descending order of the corresponding ratings. Ranking models can be used for a number of applications such as sports, web search, literature search, etc. The type of ranking investigated in this work has close ties with the Method of Paired Comparison. Oftentimes the information that is the easiest to obtain or naturally available is the relative preference of the objects taken two at a time. The information is then summarized in a weighted directed graph and hence as the corresponding matrix. A number of ranking models makes use of the matrix representation of paired comparisons to compute ratings of the individual objects. Two ranking models proposed and investigated in this work start with forming nonegative matrices that do represent certain pairwise type comparisons. The models have different approaches to computing the rating scores. The Offense-Defense Model makes use of the Sinkhorn-Knopp Theorem on equivalence matrix balancing, whereas the Generalized Markov model is based on Markov Chain theory. Both models are then used to compute the ratings of the National Football League teams, National Collegiate Athletic Association football and basketball teams. The ratings are used to perform game predictions. The proposed models are not specific to sports and can be applied to any situation consisting of a set of objects and a set of pairwise information. However, picking team sports as a ranking application allows for unrestricted access of free and abundant data. The game predictions experiments consisted of both foresight and hindsight predictions. All the experiments included the proposed models as well as several current sports ranking methods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10132008-235403/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial Analysis of In-Season Site-Specific Nitrogen Management Effects on Groundwater Nitrate and Agronomic Performance</field><field name="creator">Hong, Nan</field><field name="description">In-season, site-specific (SS) N management based on remote sensing (RS) has been suggested as a way of reducing groundwater NO3-N contamination. In-season N management seeks to match the temporal variability of crop N needs by applying appropriate amounts of N at critical crop growth stages. Site-specific N management attempts to match the spatial variability of crop N requirements by applying appropriate, spatially variable N rates within fields. We evaluated the environmental and agronomic benefits of two in-season, RS-informed N management strategies applied on a uniform field-average (FA) or SS basis. We compared these to current uniform N recommendations based on "Realistic Yield Expectations" (RYE) in a typical coastal plain cropping system. We also sought to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of shallow groundwater NO3-N. An additional objective was to develop a statistical procedure for the analysis of spatially dense, georeferenced subsample data in randomized complete block designs, a common characteristic of precision agriculture research. The experiment was established in a 12-ha North Carolina field with a 2-yr winter wheat double-crop soybean-corn rotation. The three N management treatments were applied to 0.37 ha plots in a randomized complete block design with 10 replications. Groundwater NO3-N and water table depth were measured every two weeks at 60 well nests (two per plot) sampling 0.9- to 1.8-, 1.8- to 2.7-, and 2.7- to 3.7-m depths from 2001 to 2003. We developed a statistical procedure for selecting an appropriate covariance model in randomized complete block analyses in the presence of spatial correlation. When warranted, incorporating spatial covariance in the statistical analysis provides greater efficiency in estimating treatment effects. Elevations, soil organic matter (SOM), and water table elevations (WTE) were spatial covariates used for explaining NO3-N spatial correlation. Compared to RYE, SS achieved: (i) less groundwater NO3-N by reducing fertilizer N and increasing the harvest N ratio (the ratio of N harvested in grain or forage to the total fertilizer N applied) for wheat in 2001; (ii) increased yield associated with higher N applied and decreased harvest N ratio for corn in 2002; and (iii) increased yield associated with similar fertilizer N and increased harvest N ratio for wheat in 2003. Overall, FA performed similarly to SS for wheat, but differed greatly for corn due to an overapplication of N at tasselling. These results indicate that RS-informed SS and FA might improve groundwater quality with no sacrifice in yield, or increase grain yield with similar fertilizer N compared to RYE-based N recommendations in the Coastal Plain. Mean NO3-N concentrations averaged over sampling depth at each well nest showed clear temporal fluctuations and were positively correlated with WTE. Groundwater NO3-N was frequently spatially correlated and spatial covariance structure changed periodically. The spatial correlation range varied over time from 46 to 551 m, and appeared to follow the trend of the mean water table depth. Blocking alone or together with elevation, SOM, and WTE frequently explained NO3-N spatial correlation. Our data suggest that to assess the environmental efficacy of N management, frequent and periodic monitoring of groundwater NO3-N, especially after significant rainfall, is essential to capture in-season treatment effects. Simultaneous measurement of precipitation and water table depth facilitate understanding of these effects. The traditional sampling of NO3-N only at or after harvest is likely to be insufficient to capture the entirety of treatment effects throughout the growing season. This is especially true in coastal plain and other coarse-textured soils where in-season NO3-N leaching may be pronounced. Our data also suggest that residual effects of differential N management may appear long after N application, even on these coarse-textured soils, indicating a need for longitudinal sampling.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10142004-170424/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Promoting Fluency in English Language Learners: The Effects of a Small-Group and a One-On-One Reading Intervention</field><field name="creator">Ross, Sarah Gwen</field><field name="description">Currently, Hispanic students score significantly lower than White, non-Hispanic students in reading throughout their elementary school years. Although several evidence-based fluency techniques exist for students who speak English as a first language (e.g., Repeated Reading, Listening Passage Preview, and Phrase Drill) research has insufficiently evaluated their effects with English language learners. This study used an alternating treatments design to examine the differential effects of a one-on-one (1/1) and small group (SG) reading fluency intervention, implemented with Spanish-speaking, English language learners. Each intervention condition was also compared to a no-treatment control condition (NTC). Students&#226; words read correct per minute (WCPM) served as the primary dependent measure, though standardized reading assessments and an experimenter-developed vocabulary assessment were also administered to measure student reading progress. WCPM scores were evaluated with visual analysis, standard-error of measurement (SEM) analysis, and randomization test analysis. Compared to the NTC, all students made significant WCPM gains as a result of receiving the 1/1 condition, whereas only two students significantly outperformed the NTC as a result of the SG condition. Standardized test gains and vocabulary gains were variable across students and conditions. Overall, the study offers preliminary evidence supporting two fluency-based reading interventions for Spanish-speaking, English language learners, each of which appear differentially useful depending on the time and resources available within a particular school setting.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10142009-135521/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Evolution of Cultural Competence in Transracial Adoptive Parents</field><field name="creator">Fleming, Latoria Savon</field><field name="description">As the number of minority children listed with adoptive services continues to increase, the instances of transracial adoptions become more frequent. Numerous researchers have found that cultural competence and parenting behaviors of transracial adoptive parents are important in helping with this process. Cultural competence can be viewed as a process that comes as a result of life experience and encounters that make an individual aware of the many cultural groups around them. For this study, a cross-sectional research design was chosen to measure the changes in cultural competence over the first five years of adoption. Sixty participants from various ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds were administered the Transracial Adoption Parenting Scale. Data were collected from participants across 27 states. Of the 60 participants, 30.5% had been adoptive parents for less than 1 year, 27.78% had been adoptive parents for 1-2 years, 27.78% had been adoptive parents for 3-5 years, and 13.89% had been adoptive parents for five years or more. The &#226;number of years as an adoptive parent&#226; variable was identified for each participant through a demographic questionnaire prior to administration of the scale. The frequency of responses to the cultural competence variables was then recorded to help determine the presence of a relationship to the &#226;number of years as an adoptive parent&#226; variable. Results of the study indicated that the progression of stages from &#226;1 to 2 years&#226; to &#226;5 or more years&#226; showed significant differences in cultural competence. The area of cultural competence that appeared to have the most significant difference was that of Multicultural Planning suggesting that as transracial adoptive parents progress through the stages, they continuously become more racially aware, and thus more sensitive in this area.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Counselor Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10152008-124650/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#226;Once a Home, Now a Memory:&#226; Dispossession, Possession and Remembrance of the Landscape of the Former Seneca Army Depot</field><field name="creator">Bruno, L.

It explores both the changes in the people who claimed the land, and the changes in the natural landscape. Seneca County, a region forged in the fires of war, continues to be a region influenced by the relics and echoes of military and political conflict. Since the closing of the Seneca Army Depot at the end of the Cold War, the current residents of Seneca County have engaged in a fierce debate over the future of the former Depot lands. Whoever wrests ownership of this landscape will determine its future use and influence how its past will be celebrated and remembered.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10152008-133804/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'The Hamburger Connection' and Deforestation: A Test of Ecologically Unequal Exchange Theory</field><field name="creator">Austin, Kelly F.</field><field name="description">This study explores Norman Myers&#226;s concept of the &#226;hamburger connection&#226; as a form of ecologically unequal exchange, where more-developed nations are able to misappropriate the environmental costs of beef consumption to less-developed nations. OLS (ordinary least squares) regression is used to test if deforestation in less-developed nations is associated with the vertical flow of beef to more-developed nations. An interaction term is also used to test if this relationship is more pronounced for Latin American nations, as posited by Myers. The sample includes all non-desert, less-developed nations for which there is available data across all indicators and for either measure of deforestation, total forest change or natural forest change. Overall, the results confirm the tested hypotheses.

When a tufted carpet is installed by the stretch method, it experiences stress relaxation over time which can cause the carpet to buckle, wrinkle and become loose with the only option being a costly re-stretching of the carpet. Since woven carpets seldom require re-stretching, the carpet buckling problem seems to be linked primarily to the tufted construction. This research seeks to analyze the various components of the tufted carpet composite structure and identify the role each component plays in the phenomenon of stress relaxation. Since a carpet is always stretched in both dimensions simultaneously during installation, understanding its biaxial stress decay is important. To this end, a biaxial loading system has been used to test various samples of the primary backing alone (before tufting), primary backing after tufting (with tufts), the secondary backing alone, and the finished carpet after attaching the backings with various binder weights per area. The four variables under consideration include: primary and secondary backing constructions, tufting density, and latex weight, with the secondary backing and latex weight expected to have the greatest effects on stress decay. In order to collect the most information, the biaxial test system was connected to a computer-based data acquisition system to continuously monitor stress levels and generate stress relaxation curves over a 20-hour testing period. A viscoelastic model that included representations of each component in the carpet structure was used to analyze and understand the influence of the components on the stress relaxation of carpets.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Technology Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10162002-173021/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ASSESSMENT OF SUPERPOSITION AS A DESIGN FRAMEWORK FOR THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF SOIL IMPROVEMENT AND FOUNDATION REMEDIATION</field><field name="creator">Manke, Jonathan Peter</field><field name="description">The problem of pile foundation reuse provides an ideal opportunity to evaluate the validity of superposition as a design paradigm for ground intervention and ground reinforcement (GIGR) techniques when used in combination with in situ foundations.

While much has been written about women in school and district administration, less is known of women who fill the top posts in administration at the state level. This study examines five such women leaders? lives and careers in detail. The study is conducted from a feminist point of view, using a life history approach. The women who participated in this study shared stories of their childhood and upbringing; they described their early schooling experiences, and they talked about the significant relationships in their lives. They spoke of obstacles and opportunities, and of pivotal events that shaped them. The research resonates with their voices and focuses on the role of gender, diversity and gender equity in educational leadership. Findings reveal the values, perspectives, goals, and behaviors of a group of women who range in age from 45 to 60. The study explores their early perceptions of gender, race and class, and how each influenced their lives and careers. Each woman provides her input in defining a feminine leadership style. The study concludes with a discussion of post-heroic leadership, feminization of an organization, and a leadership primer for girls and boys and their parents, based on the findings from the life history research.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational Research and Policy Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10172003-140656/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The formation and maintenance of a hybrid zone of &lt;i&gt;Aesculus&lt;/i&gt; L. (Sapindaceae) in the southeastern United States</field><field name="creator">Modliszewski, Jennifer Louise</field><field name="description">Hybrid zones have long been touted by plant evolutionary biologists as an unrivaled phenomenon through which the mechanisms of evolution may be studied as they are occurring. Speciation, introgression, and adaptation may all occur as a result of their formation and thus their study may provide new insight into how these processes occur. The purpose of this study is to determine the manner in which a broad hybrid zone of &lt;i&gt;Aesculus&lt;/i&gt; was formed, through the use of chloroplast DNA analysis. This hybrid zone encompasses parts of central and northern Georgia and includes hybrids among three species of &lt;i&gt;Aesculus&lt;/i&gt; sect. &lt;i&gt;Pavia&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Aesculus flava&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;A. pavia&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;A. sylvatica&lt;/i&gt;. These species currently have distinct geographic distributions, with both &lt;i&gt;A. pavia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A. flava&lt;/i&gt; absent from the hybrid zone. Previous hypotheses have purported that the &lt;i&gt;Aesculus&lt;/i&gt; hybrid zone was formed through either 1) secondary contact of previously isolated species or 2) recurrent long-distance pollen dispersal via the ruby-throated hummingbird, &lt;i&gt;Archilochus colubris&lt;/i&gt;. It is also possible that the zone may have originated through a combination of both of these forces. This study consists of two parts, the first involving the verification of maternal inheritance of chloroplasts in &lt;i&gt;Aesculus&lt;/i&gt;, and the second involving the assessment of the hypothesis of historical secondary contact, based on patterns of cpDNA variation in hybrid and parental populations. Verification of the inheritance of chloroplasts was accomplished through the sequencing of the &lt;i&gt;matK&lt;/i&gt; gene from the parents and progeny of 17 crosses among various &lt;i&gt;Aesculus&lt;/i&gt; species. The relative contribution of historical secondary contact to the formation of the hybrid zone was accomplished through PCR-RFLP analysis of three loci in the chloroplast genome: &lt;i&gt;matK&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;trnD&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;trnT&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;trnH&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;trnK&lt;/i&gt;, from 29 natural populations of &lt;i&gt;Aesculus&lt;/i&gt; located within, adjacent to, and broadly separate from the hybrid zone. Haplotypes identified from RFLP analysis of the three loci were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic and population genetic analyses. Results from the sequencing of the &lt;i&gt;matK&lt;/i&gt; gene from controlled crosses verified that chloroplasts are inherited maternally in &lt;i&gt;Aesculus&lt;/i&gt;, as in most angiosperms. Twenty-one unique haplotypes were identified via analysis of RFLPs, indicating that the chloroplast genome of &lt;i&gt;Aesculus&lt;/i&gt; is highly polymorphic. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses of sequence and restriction site data revealed that cpDNA haplotypes do not correlate with either spatial or taxonomic boundaries. Haplotypes of &lt;i&gt;A. pavia&lt;/i&gt;, a species that is presently physically absent from the hybrid zone, were detected in hybrid populations. Additionally, most populations were fixed for a single haplotype that was unique to that population. These results suggest that while secondary contact has played a historical role in the formation of the hybrid zone, current gene flow via seeds is highly restricted among populations. Furthermore, multiple types of cpDNA, originating from the last common ancestor of the group, are maintained in hybridizing species, suggesting that the common ancestor of species of sect. &lt;i&gt;Pavia&lt;/i&gt; was polymorphic. Comparison of these results to those of previous analysis of allozyme markers suggests that intermittent long-distance pollen dispersal has helped to maintain the hybrid zone while localized gene flow due to secondary contact of divergent species was responsible for the initial formation of the hybrid zone. Future studies of the &lt;i&gt;Aesculus&lt;/i&gt; hybrid zone might focus on the fitness of hybrid individuals as a determining factor in the continued maintenance of the hybrid zone, as well as genotype-by-environment interactions that may be influencing the physical shape and geographic location of the &lt;i&gt;Aesculus&lt;/i&gt; hybrid zone. This study could lead to the development of a new hybrid zone model, which would be particularly well-suited for plants capable of long-distance dispersal.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10172005-221504/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transport Properties of Polystyrene Solutions Swollen with Carbon Dioxide</field><field name="creator">Whittier, Rachel Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The viscosity and diffusion coefficient of polystyrene (PS) in decahydronaphthalene (DHN) were measured in the presence of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to investigate the effect of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the transport properties of polymers in solution. The viscosity of 1-15 wt% PS in DHN was measured, using a moving piston viscometer. The effects of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure (0 to 3000 psi), polymer concentration (1-15 wt%), temperature (33-150&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C), and molecular weight (126 to 412 kDa) on viscosity were investigated. Viscosity measurements of PS in DHN showed the viscosity increase with increasing concentration was described by the Martin equation. Addition of 30-40 wt% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; resulted in the maximum viscosity reduction for all temperatures, polymer concentrations, and molecular weights. Viscosity reduction was greatest for high molecular weight polymer, high polymer concentrations, and low temperatures. At the highest CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressures, the viscosity of all polymer solutions converged to approximately 1-3 cp. The viscosity of PS/DHN/SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; was also measured. The viscosity reduction with SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; was approximately the same as that with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, the diffusion coefficient of 0.5- 1.25 wt% 412,000 M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; PS in DHN was measured from 25-150&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. The diffusion coefficient results were extrapolated to zero concentration to determine the infinite dilution diffusion coefficient, D&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The hydrodynamic radius was calculated from D&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The hydrodynamic radius increased with temperature, indicating an increase in solvent quality of DHN with increasing temperature. Upon addition of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to 0.75-1 wt% 412,000 M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; PS in DHN, the diffusion coefficient increased, approximately doubling in value.

Hardness and yield strength have been found to increase with decreasing grain size in the nanocrystalline regime down to at least 15 nm on the basis of Hall-Petch mechanisms. Below grain sizes of ~10 nm, the strength decreases with further grain refinement, leading to the inverse Hall-Petch effect. Although the experimental evidence has found these deformation responses in nanocrystalline materials, the underlying mechanisms are not well identified. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for uniaxial tensile straining of two-dimensional columnar microstructures of aluminum (Al) and aluminum-lead (Al-Pb) alloys. Pure Al has a critical grain size at dc &#8776; 15 to 20 nm, the crossover from ?normal? to ?inverse? Hall-Petch effect, accompanied with intra-grain mechanisms by partial dislocations and twins as grain sizes increases. With increasing grain size there exists a transition in plastic deformation mechanism from inter-grain processes to one that consists of both inter-grain and intra-grain processes. For Al-Pb alloys with a 10 nm grain size, Pb segregates completely to the grain boundaries and the grain boundaries become wider and more disorganized as the Pb content increases. A softening effect was observed in agreement with, but less than that found experimentally. As the Pb content increases, partial dislocation nucleation at grain boundaries is completely suppressed and the plastic strain is accommodated by mechanisms other than dislocation slip. As the grain sizes increase up to 15 or 20 nm, dislocation generation at grain boundaries is also suppressed. However, dislocation generation is not entirely suppressed at 3 equivalent at% Pb, compared to the 10 nm grain size showing complete suppression.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10182007-151340/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parental warmth and socioeconomic status as predictors of social competence among abused children</field><field name="creator">McPherson, Andrea Vise</field><field name="description">Studies of the effects of physical abuse on child adjustment have documented numerous adverse consequences on young children?s physical, cognitive, psychological, and social functioning. Given the overwhelming negative effects that maltreatment can have on a child?s life, it is remarkable that some victims prevail despite physical abuse. The present study was designed to investigate factors that predict individual differences in functioning of 78 children with substantiated histories of abuse. It was expected that parental warmth and socioeconomic status would significantly predict membership in ?resilience groups? (high, medium, and low). Children?s social adjustment was measured by teacher reports and peer interactions via direct observation. The Hollingshead Index of Social Status was used to measure SES. A Nurturing Parenting Style composite was used as an indication of parental warmth and was formulated based on a 30-minute interaction session between parents and their children. Separate ordinal logistic regression analyses were conducted to test hypotheses. Predictions were not supported.

The results show that it is important to incorporate the wave-current interaction effect into coastal circulation, storm surge and inundation models. At the same time, it should consider effects of depth-induced wave breaking, wind field, currents and sea surface elevation in prediction of waves. Specially, we found that: (1) Depth-induced wave breaking plays an important role in wave field in shallow water areas; (2) To more properly model the hurricane induced wave field, it is important to consider the asymmetric structure of the hurricane wind field, the changes in the hurricane translation time history, and the incorporation background wind field into hurricane wind field; (3) For SWH, it will be decreased when waves propagate in the following current direction. On the other hand, current will increase the SWH when waves propagate countercurrent direction. The change of wave propagation direction after crossing Gulf Stream depends not only on refraction, but also on others (e.g. trap waves effect). (4) It is important to introduce wave-current effects into any storm surge and inundation prediction modeling system. Specially, the consideration of wave-induced wind stress, bottom shear stress, and 3-D radiation stress in storm surge and inundation modeling can significantly improve the correctness of the prediction.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10192006-144755/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Initiation and Evolution of Multiple Modes of Convection Within a Meso-Alpha Scale Region</field><field name="creator">French, Adam James</field><field name="description">On 30 March 2006 a convective episode occurred featuring isolated supercells, a mesoscale convective system (MCS) with parallel stratiform (PS) precipitation, and an MCS with leading stratiform (LS) precipitation. These three distinct convective modes occurred simulataneously across the same region in eastern Kansas. Multi-modal events are especially challenging for forecasters given the wide range of severe weather threats that accompany the different modes. In order to better understand the mechanisms that govern such events, this study examined the 30 March 2006 episode through a combination of an observation-based case study and numerical simulations. From the results of this study we conclude that, for this event, localized environmental variations were largely responsible for the eventual convective mode, with the method of storm initiation having only limited effects. The resultant mode was very sensitive to both the environmental thermodynamic and shear profiles, as variations in either led to different convective modes within the numerical simulations. Finally, we conclude that while the individual modes each developed within an environment distinctly favorable for that mode, they were able to persist in close proximity to one another due to a "middle ground" environment permissive of all three. Strong vertical shear and moderate instability led to the development of supercells in western Oklahoma and similarly strong shear oriented parallel to a surface dryline coupled with dry air in the middle and upper levels led to the development of the PS linear MCS in central Kansas. Meanwhile, moderate wind shear coupled with high instability and strong linear forcing led to the development of the LS MCS in eastern Kansas. Without this linear forcing, the moderate shear environment was supportive of both linear and isolated supercell modes, resulting in the storms that moved into this region maintaining their original organization.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10192007-180611/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating the Assessment Component of the HELPS Program</field><field name="creator">Whitehouse, Mary Hollings</field><field name="description">The purpose of the research was to examine the assessment component of the Helping Early Literacy with Practice Strategies (HELPS) Program which is similar to curriculum-based measurement (CBM). CBM has demonstrated usefulness with determining student growth and intervention effectiveness, as well as predicting student outcomes on state-mandated assessment. The current study utilized data from one academic year of implementation of the HELPS Program with second grade students at an elementary school. The purpose was to evaluate whether the assessment data from HELPS indicated gains in students&#226; reading fluency and whether those gain scores predicted student outcomes on the Gray Oral Reading Test (GORT) for fluency and comprehension. Students&#226; scores were evaluated in terms of generalization of passage gains (initial reading of a new passage), immediate passage gains (gains within one session with one passage), and retention of passage gains (gains from one session to the next). Scores were evaluated with both linear and quadratic multi-level models. Results indicated that students&#226; generalization of passage gain scores were most meaningful in terms of determining growth over time and predicting students&#226; outcome scores. Immediate passage gains, however, can also be useful in evaluating students&#226; growth over time.

Low density pockets in the ejecta effect a rise in the turbulent energy of the system, a decrease in the effectiveness with which ejecta are decelerated and a large spread in the temperature of emitting gas.

As such, identity hinges on a combination of acts, (Sedgwick, 1990), hierarchical social categories (Butler, 1999), culture (Kellner, 1995, 2003), history, difference, representation, social institutions, and stories that define and shape the self through recursive and self-reflexive processes.

This dissertation explores some methods and algorithms in this area, especially in pedigrees. The first chapter gives an introduction to human genetics and disease gene mapping. Existing linkage and association methods are introduced and compared. Probabilities of genotypic data from multiple linked marker loci on related individuals are used as likelihoods of gene locations for gene-mapping, or as likelihoods of other parameters of interest in human genetics. With the recent development in genetics and molecular biology techniques, large-scale marker data has become available, which requires highly efficient likelihood calculations especially for complex pedigrees. Algorithms for likelihood calculations for pedigree data are reviewed in chapter 2. Besides exact likelihood calculation methods and MCMC, a Sequential Importance Sampling (SIS) approach has been proposed to enable calculations for large pedigrees with large numbers of markers. However, when the system gets large, the variance of the importance sampling weights increases while both efficiency and accuracy of the method decrease. We propose an optimization algorithm for calculating the likelihood of general pedigrees in Chapter 3. We incorporate a resampling strategy into SIS to reduce the variance inflation problem. A successful linkage analysis may identify a linkage region of interest containing hundreds of genes at a magnitude of perhaps ten to thirty centiMorgans. A follow-up association (or so-called linkage disequilibrium) analysis can provide much finer gene-mapping but is subject to greater multiple testing problems. In Chapter 4, we present a method for determining whether an association result is responsible for a non-parametric linkage result for binary traits in general pedigrees. The correlation between family frequency of a variant of interest and family LOD score is used as a measure of whether the association between a given variant at a marker and the disease status can help to explain a significant linkage result seen in the collection of families in the region around the marker.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10212004-142157/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oral and Written Symbol Comprehension Testing: The Benefit of Cognitive Interview Probing</field><field name="creator">Brantley, Kimberly Anne</field><field name="description">Traditionally, symbol comprehension is tested using open-ended, written responses. However, responses are often so brief that they may fail to indicate a participant?s true understanding of some symbols. In the present study, several test methods were compared to the standard written method to determine if they produce better symbol comprehension performance. The four alternative methods included: written test with probe questioning after all responses were provided, oral test without probe questioning, oral test with probe questioning after responses for all symbols were provided, and oral test with probe questioning after each partially correct or incorrect response. The probe or follow-up questioning technique is taken from the cognitive interview procedure used in eyewitness identification research to elicit more detailed responses. Participants reported their interpretations of 31 safety symbols in one of the five test method conditions. Results showed that the test methods that included follow-up questioning elicited more information from participants, and increased comprehension rates in both oral and written test formats.

A hierarchical S-curve trending method is developed to conduct the basic forecast. Due to uncertainties of the electric load data, the results from the computerized program may conflict with the nature of the load growth. Sometimes, the computerized program is not aware of the local development because the land use data lacks such information. A human-machine co-construct intelligence framework is proposed to improve the robustness and reasonability of the purely computerized load forecasting program. The proposed algorithm has been implemented and applied to several utility companies to forecast the long-term electric load growth in the service territory and to get satisfying results.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10212008-105450/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Activin induction of the ovine follicle-stimulating hormone beta-subunit is mediated by Smad4 and a forkhead box transcription factor</field><field name="creator">Gore, Arnold Jesse</field><field name="description">Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a a/b glycoprotein produced in pituitary gonadotropes of all vertebrates and is required for egg maturation, and optimal sperm performance. Activin potently induces FSH by inducing transcription of its rate-limiting b-subunit (FSHB). Four nucleotides of the oFSHB promoter (&#226;168 bp to &#226;165 bp) are necessary for 99.9 % of oFSHB expression in vivo and 70 % of its progressive induction by activin in LbT2 gonadotropes over a 24 hr period. These 4 nucleotides form part of a putative forkhead box (FOX) binding site juxtaposed upstream to a single-copy (4 bp) Smad binding element (SBE), both of which are associated with activin action. Smad4 from LbT2 cells did not bind the wild type oFSHB SBE in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, but did bind a palindromic SBE derived from the oFSHB SBE. Binding increased 2.6-fold over 20 h without or with activin (25 % additional increase with activin) and was competed 85 % with the native oFSHB sequence indicating Smad4 has high affinity for the native promoter. Additionally, a dominant negative inhibitor of Smad4 reduced activin induction of oFSHB in LBT2 cells by 62 %, indicating that Smad4 is important for activin induction. A second Smad, Smad3, bound transiently to the palindromic SBE (6-fold increase by activin at 2 h). Dominant negative inhibition of Smad3 (3SA) and depletion of Smad2 by siRNA did not alter activin induction of oFSHB suggesting Smads 2 and 3 may not be involved. A p38 inhibitor blocked induction of oFSHB after 8 h, dividing the 24 hr induction by activin into two phases. This suggested that an activin-regulated early gene product is required for the second phase of oFSHB induction. It was found that one forkhead gene, FOXQ1, was increased 4.5-fold 8 h after activin treatment which correlated nicely with the second phase of oFSHB induction uncovered by the p38 inhibitor. FOXQ1 is only one of 43 FOX family members, however, so further studies are required to prove that FOXQ1 is a key driver of FSH production and that it partners with Smad4 to induce oFSHB transcription.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10212008-161604/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Use of Objective versus Subjective Measures of Role Demand in Explaining the Relationship between Work/Family Roles and Psychological Distress.</field><field name="creator">Vulpis, Mindy Lara</field><field name="description">This thesis analyzes a subsample of 935 men and women from the 2002 National Study of the Changing Workforce, all of whom hold the simultaneous roles of parent, spouse, and worker. Its purpose is to examine some of the differential effects that objective role demands and subjective experiences of role demands have on psychological well-being for those juggling multiple roles. Specifically, I investigate the hypotheses that a) subjective experiences of role demand, including perceived work-family interference and perceived role strain, will have independent effects on psychological distress even when considered alongside more objective circumstantial variables, including the amount of time required or flexibility afforded by a role or roles; b) perceptions of work-family interference or role strain will interact with these objective variables when predicting distress; and c) these effects will vary by gender based on differing internalized expectations related to role performance. OLS regression analyses suggest that perceived work-family interference and role strain do have independent effects on psychological well-being, and that the perception of work-family interference interacts with the amount of time spent on home chores to predict distress. Separate analyses by gender produced some additional effects, but they were not always in the predicted directions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10212009-141522/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abiotic pathogen suppression: physiology and biology of aluminum toxicity to soilborne fungi</field><field name="creator">Fichtner, Elizabeth Jeanne</field><field name="description">An interdisciplinary approach was utilized to study the toxicity of aluminum (Al) to soilborne plant pathogens with the goal of developing a pathogen-suppressive potting medium containing non-phytotoxic, Al-organic matter complexes. Toxicological studies addressed the toxicity of monomeric Al species to &lt;i&gt;Thielaviopsis basicola&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora parasitica&lt;/i&gt; and documented the sensitivity of these organisms to the metal. Until recently, research on Al-toxicity to fungi has only focused on the trivalent Al cation (Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) which is also considered the most phytotoxic Al ion. The toxicity of Al-hydrolysis species to fungi were tested by modeling in vitro test solution equilibria using GEOCHEM-PC and correlating the predicted values of Al-species activities with reduction in spore production of the two pathogens. Chlamydospore production of &lt;i&gt;T. basicola&lt;/i&gt; was negatively correlated with Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; activity, whereas inhibition of sporangia production of &lt;i&gt;P. parasitica&lt;/i&gt; was related to the activity of multiple monomeric Al species. Toxicity of Al to &lt;i&gt;T. basicola&lt;/i&gt; was observed in solutions containing &amp;#8805 20 micromolar Al. Sensitivity of &lt;i&gt;P. parasitica&lt;/i&gt; to Al was observed at &amp;#60 1.0 micromolar Al, suggesting that &lt;i&gt;P. parasitica&lt;/i&gt; is more sensitive to Al than &lt;i&gt;T. basicola&lt;/i&gt;. Using fluorescence microscopy, the localized accumulation of Al in pathogen tissues was detected using lumogallion, an Al-specific, fluorescent stain. Accumulation of Al was observed under various chemical conditions, ranging from salt solutions to more complex systems containing Al-peat complexes. An ecological approach was applied to study the dynamic interactions of soil chemical and physical properties with soil microflora for the suppression of &lt;i&gt;P. parasitica&lt;/i&gt; in a medium amended with Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and composted swine waste (CSW). Abiotic and biological mechanisms of pathogen suppression were incorporated into the CSW-amended medium. Al-mediated suppression resulted in reduction of sporangia production in medium exhibiting K-exchangeable Al levels &amp;#62 2 micromolar Al. Biological suppression also resulted in reduction of sporangia production and this suppression was maintained after Al levels dropped below the threshold necessary for abiotic suppression. The incorporation of abiotic and biological control mechanisms into a potting media may facilitate suppression of a wide range of soilborne pathogens and enhance applicability of disease-suppressive media in a disease management strategy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10222003-020101/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SPIN DIFFUSION NMR INVESTIGATIONS OF AMORPHOUS POLYMER ORGANIZATION IN THE SOLID STATE</field><field name="creator">Jia, Xin</field><field name="description">We report a general method, based on intramolecular spin-diffusion, for the measurement and calculation of spin-diffusion coefficients in amorphous polymers and their blends using only NMR data. The basic structural unit that defines 1H polarization density in polymers is the monomer unit. Using appropriately selected internal reference distances calculated from energy-minimized chain dimension simulations, timescales for the redistribution of 1H polarization within amorphous homopolymers may be used to independently calculate maximum values of the spin diffusion coefficients D. This strategy represents an attractive alternative to current methods employed for domain size measurements in polymer blends, which require calibration of spin diffusion coefficients based on comparisons of similar NMR data obtained on model compounds analyzed previously using scattering or microscopy techniques. In this way, many more polymer systems become amenable to study by NMR spin-diffusion methods, since X-ray scattering or microscopy calibrations on representative standards are no longer necessary to define quantitative limits on spin-diffusion coefficients. Experimentally, the fate of proton magnetization is followed with high selectivity using 2D 1H-13C solid-state HETCOR sequences incorporating controlled periods of 1H-1H spin-diffusion.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10222004-112929/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cybersupervision of Entry Level Practicum Supervisees: The Effect on Acquisition of Counselor Competence and Confidence</field><field name="creator">Chapman, Russell Alan Dr.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this dissertation paper is to propose and implement a research study in Cybersupervision (Watson, 2003).

PCR primers for such screens are commonly designed via a method described by Sells and Chernoff (1995). This standard design method does not make use of information about the evolutionary relationship between the known genes. The present study investigated the efficacy of using information about evolutionary relationships (inferred from the sequence data) in the design of PCR primers. This study compares the standard primer design method (represented herein by a modified multinomial distribution) with evolutionary model based primer design methods. The primer design method that, given an alignment of known sequences with one sequence left out, assigned a higher probability, on average, to the left-out sequence, was defined as the better method. By this measure of relative performance, an evolutionary model based primer design method sensitive to states correlated across sites of a sequence, outperformed the standard method, on the alignments studied.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10232003-122816/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Statistical Methods for Identifying X-linked Genes Associated with Complex Phenotypes</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Li</field><field name="description">Genetic association studies aim to detect association between one or more genetic polymorphisms and complex traits, which might be some quantitative characteristic or a qualitative attribute of disease. In Chapter 1, we introduce the development of methods for association mapping in the past decades and present the rationale behind our X-linked method development. Family-based association methods have been well developed for autosomes, but unique features of X-linked markers have received little attention. In Chapter 2, we propose a likelihood approach (X-LRT) to estimate genetic risks and test association using a case-parents design. The method uses nuclear families with a single affected proband, and allows additional siblings and missing parental genotypes. We also extend X-LRT from a single-marker test to a multiple-marker haplotype analysis. Our X-LRT offers great flexibility for testing different penetrance relationships within and between sexes. In addition, estimation of relative risks provides a measure of the magnitude of X-linked genetic effects on complex disorders. In Chapter 3 and 4, we fill the methodological gaps by developing two approaches (X-QTL and X-HQTL) to test association between X-linked marker alleles/haplotypes and quantitative traits in nuclear family design. We adopt the orthogonal decomposition which provides consistent estimates of the additive genetic values of marker alleles/haplotypes. Joint estimation of the linkage variance component in the association model reduces type I errors to nominal expectations. Dosage compensation models provide a simple relationship of X-linked additive effects between sexes. In Chapter 2, 3, and 4, our simulation results demonstrate the validity and substantially higher power of our approaches compared with other existing programs. We also apply our methods to MAOA &amp; MAOB candidate-gene studies of family data with Parkinson disease. In Chapter 5, we discuss some issues relevant to the design and execution of our X-linked family-based association studies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10232007-163904/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Correlated ecophysiological and growth related leaf traits among Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes</field><field name="creator">Habinck, Emily Marie</field><field name="description">Across plant taxa there are large-scale correlations among ecophysiological leaf traits: Specific leaf area (SLA), maximum photosynthetic rate (Amax), Leaf nitrogen content (NL), and leaf lifespan (LL). Suite syndromes of leaf traits are associated among r and K-selected species and Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes exhibit groth syndromes similar to the r and K-selection theory and range from a wide variety of latitudes of origin. The purpose of this study was to determine if the ecoyphysiological leaf traits: SLA, Amax, Nl, LL and other growth-rleated traits were correlated across A. thaliana ecotypes from a wide range of latitudes of origin. Fifteen A. thaliana ecotypes were grown in an experimental growth chamber to determine if these ecophysiological and other growth-related leaf traits such as leaf initiation rate and bolting time were correlated across the ecytpes. Results indicate that SLA, Amax and NL were correlated across the ecotypes as consistent with global trends while LL was not significantly correlated. The life history trait, bolting time, was correlated with leaf tratis. There was a wide range of leaf age and change in longevity among the leaves, making leaf lifespan difficult to determine. The results from this study indicate that A. thaliana will be a good model in order to understand the developmental and genetic links with these correlations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10232008-204631/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Postsecondary Education for the Underserved in America: A Study of Highly Non-traditional Students in Community Colleges</field><field name="creator">Freeman, Jerrid P.</field><field name="description">High paying and low skilled industrial jobs are diminishing, while low skilled and low paying service jobs are increasing. Those who are out of work or underemployed and lack the necessary education to fill higher paying jobs will be unable to fill a needed role in the economy. This change signifies a changing economy, the new economy, where globalization and evolving technology have facilitated a rapidly changing knowledge and skill base. If those who are unable to fill a role do not to gain the necessary knowledge and skills, not only will they lack economic self-sufficiency, but also they will be a drain on the American economy and society. New economy theory postulates a call to balance the needs of the economy and the needs of individuals, or the well being of society, individuals, and the economy will deteriorate. Education is the primary avenue to meet the needs of a changing workforce and the needs of individuals, especially those underserved. Community colleges are the most able to supply the education for these underserved students (Carnevale &amp; Desrochers, 2001; Carnoy, 2000; McCabe, 2000). Through the perceptions and experiences of students who are ?beyond the margins,? the data supplies guidance on how to effectively meet the needs of this population for the benefit of these individuals, society, and the economy. These suggestions follow from the experiences and perceptions of over sixty students interviewed at three community colleges in different regions of the U.S. that were theoretically appropriate (Mason, 1996). The major conclusion identified was the lack of consciousness that ?beyond the margins? students exhibit. These students reveal their lack of awareness through their limited knowledge and understanding of society, work, money, and education. It was also identified that underserved students must receive individualized and specific assistance through a well-designed educational support system to accomplish their academic and work aspirations. The students interviewed noted the value of additional support by faculty and staff, various support services, student tracking systems, multiple course-taking pathways, policies and procedures, institutional initiatives and priorities, and funding to encourage their academic success.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Higher Education Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10242005-085729/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digesting Devotion: Food As Sustenance And Sacrament In Milton's &lt;em&gt;Paradise Lost&lt;/em&gt;</field><field name="creator">Brown, Sherri Lynne</field><field name="description">Milton?s story of the original sin of Adam and Eve and the resulting fall of mankind is a story that is bound up in food imagery and the language of consumption.

During this study, eighteen participants completed semi-structured interviews. Data was analyzed using an approach derived from phenomenography. Six changes in society, as well as specific changes in students, were identified as significantly impacting participant?s teaching. Participants stressed that, as a result of the changes taking place, a new world was opening for them and a new model of higher education was emerging in post-Soviet Kazakhstan. While some teachers found a renewed interest in teaching, most found teaching more difficult as a result of cultural change, with some deciding to leave the profession altogether. The study?s participants also shared their understandings of effective teaching, identifying two goals and describing six approaches effective teachers use in teaching. Differences emerged between Soviet and post-Soviet teachers with respect to their commitment to the curriculum, their ability to adapt to changing teaching situations, and the effect of increased economic pressure on them. The study concludes that: (a) participants? normative expectations, or their roles, relationships, and responsibilities were most affected by change; (b) participants? pedagogical procedures were largely determined by how they learned to teach; (c) participants desired and were able to change their pedagogical procedures to adapt to changing contexts; (d) Soviet teachers had more difficulty adapting their teaching practices than their post-Soviet colleagues; (e) the context for teaching constrained teachers in their ability to adapt to cultural changes; and (f) while most beliefs about teaching were rooted in Soviet Kazakhstan, beliefs about teacher?s roles and relationships were changing in response to changes in Kazakhstan.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult and Community College Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10242006-165519/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the Design, Modeling, and Control of a Hybrid Pump System for Dynamic Pressurization of Explanted Mammalian Hearts</field><field name="creator">Dugan, Sean Patrick-Michael</field><field name="description">A hybrid electromechanical pump system is proposed to mimic left ventricular blood pressure in a living mammalian heart.

In addition, even high-functioning children with autism, such as those with Asperger Syndrome, demonstrate significant delays in Theory of Mind. Nelson and Fivush?s (2004) comprehensive model of the development of autobiographical memory assigns central importance to the child?s social interactions and emerging theory of mind. Children with Asperger Syndrome, however, have normal IQs and show no language delays. Thus, there was reason to suspect that children with Asperger Syndrome would show differences in their autobiographical memories when compared to typically developing children. A better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses in autobiographical memory found in children with Asperger Syndrome will help future intervention efforts. The present investigation examined the factors that influence the content and structure of emotional memory narratives in 7- to 13-year-old children with and without Asperger Syndrome. Children with Asperger Syndrome had a particularly difficult time self-generating negative memory narratives compared to their typically developing peers. Typically developing children infused a good deal of positive emotion in their self-generated negative memories, whereas children with Asperger syndrome did not. Children with Asperger Syndrome were also more likely to include negative emotions such as fear and anxiety in their narratives, regardless of memory type, than typically developing children. This group difference disappears when controlling for working memory, suggesting that children with higher levels of working memory are more likely to be able to bring meaning to an event for themselves. Finally, children with Asperger Syndrome provided less coherent memory narratives than their typically developing peers. Together, these findings suggest that children with Asperger Syndrome may be engaging less frequently in meaning-making activities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10242007-122129/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maintaining a Positive Outlook: Developmental Differences in the Use of Subjective Temporal Distance</field><field name="creator">Styers, Mary Koenig</field><field name="description">Adults? use of subjective temporal distance, defined as a psychological distancing mechanism that allows individuals to maintain positive self-views by perceiving threatening events as being farther away in time and affirming events as being closer in time, has been the subject of extensive research attention in recent years. No research to date, however, has examined how children and adolescents utilize subjective temporal distance. This study investigated the extent to which older elementary and middle school students utilize subjective temporal distance as they remember positive and negative academic experiences. One hundred 4th/5th graders and 90 7th/8th graders provided ratings of their recollections and personal experiences concerning two academic events, receiving a satisfying and a disappointing grade or test score. The participants at both age levels reported that the positive event seemed closer in time than the disappointing event, an effect not explained by the reported actual time since the events. In contrast to expectations, no effects of grade or gender on subjective distance were observed. Further, contrary to prior investigations with adults, there was no relation between global self-worth and subjective distancing. Both the reported emotional intensity of the event and the amount of reported co-rumination with peers influenced subjective distancing. The findings are interpreted as indicating that subjective temporal distance in childhood reflects a different process than the internal, individual coping mechanism observed in adulthood. Further research should examine the role of interactions with adults and peers in children?s use of subjective distancing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10242007-181541/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Allelopathy in Rye (Secale cereale)</field><field name="creator">Brooks, Ashley Meredith</field><field name="description">Allelopathy is an ecological phenomenon in which chemicals produced by and released from a plant affect the germination or growth of another plant. A possible exploitation of allelopathy is the use of allelopathic cover crops for weed management. Organic farming systems can utilize allelopathy as an alternative to synthetic herbicides and conventional farming can reduce reliance upon pre-emergence herbicides. Rye (Secale cereale) is a cover crop species known to be allelopathic to many weeds. In addition to allelopathic activity, rye is a successful cover crop because of prolific biomass, high germinability and winter hardiness. The objective of this research was to investigate the potential to develop a rye cultivar with increased allelopathy through a conventional breeding approach. A population of 150 half-sib families of rye was grown in two North Carolina locations. Above ground tissue was utilized to assess rye allelopathic activity. To assess allelopathy in the population, we aimed to develop a greenhouse bioassay which utilized a rye incorporated soil media and redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus) as the indicator species. It is necessary to identify a screening protocol to quantify variation in allelopathic activity and to identify high performing lines. The greenhouse bioassay was fast, inexpensive and able to screen the large number of genotypes in the rye population. Results of redroot pigweed fresh weight biomass were reproducible and were utilized to estimate genetic parameters for allelopathy in the rye population. Estimates of genetic variation, genotype x environment interaction and narrow sense heritability help plant breeders develop an appropriate breeding program for the trait of interest. The estimates also give an idea of the rapidity at which progress can be made with selection. Genetic variation for rye allelopathy was not significant across locations but was significant within each location. Redroot pigweed fresh weight biomass was normally distributed indicating that allelopathy in rye is a quantitative trait. Heritability estimates were low on a per-plot basis and moderately low on an entry mean basis. A petri dish bioassay was also utilized to estimate genetic parameters for allelopathy in rye. Redroot pigweed germination and root length measures were utilized to quantify allelopathic activity. Genetic variation was not significant across locations for germination or root length. Analysis of variance within each location detected variation among the genotypes grown at the Kinston location but not at the Clayton location. Measures of redroot pigweed germination and root length were normally distributed. Heritability estimates were low on a per-plot basis and on an entry mean basis. This study demonstrates that allelopathy in rye is under genetic control and that it is a quantitative trait. Results suggest that a conventional breeding approach may be used for the development of a highly allelopathic rye cultivar.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10242008-090411/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental Characterization and Modeling of Electro-Mechanically Coupled Ferroelectric Actuators</field><field name="creator">York, Alexander</field><field name="description">Piezoelectric actuators used in nano-positioning devices exhibit highly non-linear behavior and strong hysteresis.

In addition, the creep behavior at different constant levels of the electric field is observed. These experiments provide evidence of kinetics being characterized by strongly varying relaxation times that can be associated with different switching mechanisms. Finally, an electro-mechanically coupled free energy model for polycrystalline ferroelectrics is presented that is based on the theory of thermal activation. It is capable of predicting the hysteretic behavior along with the frequency-dependence present in these materials. The electro-mechanically coupled model also predicts the behavior of spring coupled actuators under various pre-stress levels. The model will be coupled with a SDOF model of a commercial nano-positioning stage (Nano-OP30, Mad City Labs) and is the basis for future control applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10242008-112938/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complex Modulus Determination of Asphalt Concrete Using Indirect Tension Test</field><field name="creator">Momen, Mostafa</field><field name="description">MOMEN, MOSTAFA HASSAN. Dynamic Modulus Determination of Asphalt Concrete Mixtures Using Indirect Tension Test. (Under the direction of Dr. Y. Richard Kim). The purpose of this research is to present the results from an analytical/experimental study on the dynamic modulus testing of hot mix asphalt (HMA) using the indirect tension (IDT) mode. The analytical solution for dynamic modulus determination in IDT was developed by Kim (14) using the theory of linear viscoelasticity. To verify the analytical solution, temperature and frequency sweep tests were conducted on 24 asphalt mixtures commonly used in North Carolina, using both axial compression and IDT test methods. In doing so, a modified dynamic modulus test protocol is introduced that reduces the required testing time by using more frequencies and fewer temperatures based on the time-temperature superposition principle. A comparison of results from the axial compression and IDT test methods shows that the dynamic modulus mastercurves and shift factors derived from the two methods are in good agreement. It was also found that Poisson?s ratio is a weak function of the loading frequency; its effect on the phase angle mastercurve is discussed. After verification of the analytical solution, another study was conducted to evaluate the effect of aggregate size on the variability of test results, where the coefficient of variation (CV) was computed for each aggregate size and the results were compared. It was found that mixes with a larger nominal maximum size of aggregate (NMSA) had a greater CV than those with a smaller NMSA. Digital image Correlation was used to further support the findings and reveal physical explanations for the results obtained from this statistical analysis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10252004-040231/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive Core Simulation</field><field name="creator">Abdel-Khalik, Hany Samy</field><field name="description">The work presented in this thesis is a continuation of a master?s thesis research project conducted by the author to gain insight into the applicability of inverse methods to developing adaptive simulation capabilities for core physics problems. Use of adaptive simulation is intended to improve the fidelity and robustness of important core attributes predictions such as core power distribution, thermal margins and core reactivity. Adaptive simulation utilizes a selected set of past and current reactor measurements of reactor observables to adapt the simulation in a meaningful way that is reflected in higher fidelity and robustness of the adapted core simulators models. We propose an inverse theory approach in which the multitudes of input data to core simulators, i.e. reactor physics and thermal-hydraulic data, are to be adjusted to improve agreement with measured observables while keeping core simulators models unadapted. At a first glance, devising such adaption for typical core simulators models would render the approach impractical. This follows, since core simulators are based on very demanding computational models, i.e. based on complex physics models with millions of input data and output observables. This would spawn not only several prohibitive challenges but also numerous disparaging concerns. The challenges include the computational burdens of the sensitivity-type calculations required to construct Jacobian operators for the core simulators models. Also, the computational burdens of the uncertainty-type calculations required to estimate the uncertainty information of core simulators input data presents a demanding challenge. The concerns however are mainly related to the reliability of the adjusted input data. We demonstrate that the power of our proposed approach is mainly driven by taking advantage of this unfavorable situation and show that significant reductions in both computational and storage burdens can be attained for a typical BWR core simulator adaption problem without compromising the quality of the adaption.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10252004-094938/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of poultry age, season, litter quality, and nutritional intervention strategies on Salmonella prevalence and populations, serotypes, genotypes, and antibiotic resistance profiles</field><field name="creator">Santos, Fernanda Botaro de Oliveira</field><field name="description">Poultry-related salmonellosis is an on-going problem that the poultry industry must continue to address. To address these challenges, Salmonella populations present on litter and fecal samples of brooder and grow-out turkey farms were assessed using a quantitative procedure. Furthermore, serotyping, genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and antibiotic resistance-susceptibility analyses were used to investigate the diversity of the Salmonella serotypes present on these farms. Additionally, alternative on-farm pathogen intervention strategies including feeding whole or coarsely ground grains, increasing insoluble fiber content of the diet and use of an alternative non-litter cage-based housing design (Broilermatic System) were evaluated. Salmonella litter populations averaged 2 logs higher in 3-wk turkey samples compared to samples from 19-wk birds. Turkey age also influenced Salmonella serotypes, genotypes and antibiotic resistance profiles. Only serovars Javiana and Mbandaka were common between 3 and 19-wk old turkeys. A higher frequency of multidrug resistance was observed in Salmonella isolates recovered from samples of 3-wk birds, on average isolates were resistant to &gt;4 antibiotics tested. Supplementing coarse ground corn and increased insoluble fiber (wood fiber) content into the turkey diet did not adversely impact body weights. However, the treatments did not influence Salmonella colonization or fecal shedding of turkeys. To examine the impact of housing design and addition of whole or coarsely ground grains on performance, intestinal microbial diversity and Salmonella colonization, broilers were reared on four diets consisting of finely or coarsely ground corn and finely ground or whole triticale to market age and Salmonella populations measured. Whole grain supplementation decreased Salmonella cecal populations while rearing broilers on litter floor as opposed to the Broilermatic System resulted in significant reductions in Salmonella cecal populations. Moreover, feeding whole triticale presumably encouraged the proliferation of bacterial populations which may have competitively excluded Salmonella in the ceca of broilers. In conclusion, highly variable Salmonella populations and serotypes were detected across all commercial turkey farms and the use of alternative feed ingredients such as triticale may help to reduce Salmonella colonization in poultry. Moreover, diet composition and grain coarseness as well as housing design can influence the diversity of the commensal intestinal microflora which may help in the control of Salmonella colonization in broiler intestines.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science and Poultry Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10252006-084211/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What it Means to Remember: Children's Reports of Their Earliest Memories</field><field name="creator">Siceloff, Ellen Rebekah</field><field name="description">Although a great deal of research has focused on adults? earliest memories (see Pillemer &amp; White, 1989 for a review), limited research has examined children?s earliest memories (see Wang, 2004; Peterson, Grant, &amp; Boland, 2005). The purpose of the current investigation is to contribute to this limited body of research and to our understanding of age-related change in earliest memory recall across the childhood years by examining the earliest memories of children in three age groups: pre-kindergarten, first grade, and third grade. In addition, this research adds to the extant literature by scaffolding children?s understanding of what it means to remember an event. Assessing participants? ability to apply their understanding of the mental state term, remember, to scenarios about a fictional character, the present study revealed that by third grade, children have at least a nascent appreciation of the distinction between being able to remember an event and merely knowing about it. With regard to participants? earliest memories, there were no age-related differences in age at earliest memory using child estimates of age. In contrast, parental estimates of age at earliest memory revealed an age-related difference, with third grade children recalling events that occurred earliest in time and children in pre-kindergarten recalling the most recently-occurring events. In addition, whereas participants in the two youngest age groups recalled more positively valenced memories, third graders recalled both positive and negative events with equal frequency. Together the results of this investigation suggest that younger participants? recall of more recent events, based on parental age estimates, may reflect their more limited understanding of what it means to remember. By third grade, however, children?s more well-developed understanding may permit a more meaningful search of their autobiographical past to identify their earliest memories.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10252007-003249/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refining the Phosphorus Loss Assessment Tool for the Organic Soils of North Carolina</field><field name="creator">Dell'Olio, Laura Ashley</field><field name="description">Phosphorus (P) runoff and leaching from agricultural fields have been identified as major environmental concerns for the health of aquatic ecosystems. North Carolina has responded by implementing the Phosphorus Loss Assessment Tool (PLAT). The goal of the PLAT is to determine relative P losses from agricultural fields based on several site factors and characteristics, including Mehlich-3 P (M3P) soil test values. Based on previous research, the current version of PLAT is programmed to predict greater soluble P losses from organic soils than from mineral soils with the same M3P values. However, recent research specific to North Carolina?s organic soils has indicated decreased soluble P release in the presence of high Al concentrations. Our objectives were to determine (i) the Al content of Typic Haplosaprists and Terric Haplosaprists of North Carolina?s Lower Coastal Plain, and (ii) how the Al in these soils affects P retention. We sampled four organic soil series and determined M3P, Mehlich-3 Al (M3Al), Mehlich-3 Fe (M3Fe), water-soluble P (WSP), total P, pH, particle size distribution, and the organic matter content (OM). Water-soluble P and M3P were also measured in a 21-d incubation study in which P was added at a rate equivalent to 150 kg P ha-1. Total CuCl2 extractable Al and inorganic soil P fractions were identified in an Al and inorganic P fractionation study, respectively. According to the results of the incubation, multiple regression, and fractionation studies, Al was the main cation responsible for P retention; the mean topsoil M3Al concentrations (1926 mg kg-1) in these organic soils were much higher than those observed in another study of mostly mineral NC soils. The concentration of M3Fe was low in every series and was not correlated to any P characteristics. Mehlich-3 P was not consistently correlated to P retention and WSP; however, OM, M3Al, and total CuCl2 extractable Al were correlated with P retention. In the incubation study, the percentage of applied P that was adsorbed was greater in soils with lower OM and/or higher M3Al. Increased OM was associated with increased WSP and lower total P, as well as decreased P retention. The opposite effect was observed with increasing M3Al concentrations; however, the ratio of OM to M3Al showed increased correlation to P retention and WSP than when OM and Al were used alone. These results indicate that soils with higher OM and lower Al did not retain P as well as soils with lower OM and higher Al contents. Furthermore, as more Al bound P was extracted by M3P (causing higher M3P/Al-P %), WSP increased, and coincided with decreased total CuCl2 Al. The results from this study show that in high OM soils, the concentration of extractable Al controlled the solubility of P. North Carolina?s PLAT could be modified to include M3Al concentrations to more accurately predict P losses in the organic soils of the lower coastal plain, thus potentially reducing P runoff and leaching into our aquatic ecosystems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10262006-141107/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What is Your Bench Strength? An Exploration of Succession Planning in Three Large School Districts in a Southeastern State</field><field name="creator">Riddick, Francine Piscitelli</field><field name="description">Large school districts face a number of challenges due to their sheer size. One of these challenges involves staffing the role of the principal. With Baby Boomers reaching retirement age, large school districts, especially those experiencing growth, have to fill numerous leadership positions. In order to fill these positions efficiently and effectively, many school districts are beginning to develop and implement succession planning programs to expand their internal pool of leadership candidates. Succession planning strategies have been utilized in the business world for years and the education realm is beginning to realize their value. This study explores three large school districts in a southeastern state and their efforts to implement effective succession planning systems. While all three districts have a variety of strategies in place, none of the districts have a comprehensive, written succession plan and corresponding evaluation. Other similarities across the three districts include administrator certification programs, coaching programs, the predominant use of self-selection into succession planning initiatives, the principal position as the focal point, and the value of utilizing the cohort concept. Some differences across the three districts are the departments and positions responsible for succession planning initiatives, the categorization of some strategies as succession planning, and an additional position as a secondary focal point.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational Administration and Supervision</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10262009-194332/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ON THE SOLVABLE LENGTH OF ASSOCIATIVE ALGEBRAS, MATRIX GROUPS, AND LIE ALGEBRAS</field><field name="creator">Wood, Lisa M</field><field name="description">Let A be an algebraic system with product a*b between elements a and b in A. It is of interest to compare the solvable length t with other invariants, for instance size, order, or dimension of A. Thus we ask, for a given t what is the smallest n such that there is an A of length t and invariant n. It is this problem that we consider for associative algebras, matrix groups, and Lie algebras. We consider A in each case to be subsets of (strictly) upper triangular n by n matrices. Then the invariant is n. We do these for the associative (Lie) algebras of all strictly upper triangular n by n matrices and for the full n by n upper triangular unipotent groups. The answer for n is the same in all cases. Then we restrict the problem to a fixed number of generators. In particular, using only 3 generators and we get the same results for matrix groups and Lie algebras as for the earlier problem. For associative algebras with 1 generator we also get the same result as the general associative algebra case. Finally we consider Lie algebras with 2 generators and here n is larger than in the general case. We also consider the problem of finding the dimension in the associative algebra, the general, and 3 generator Lie algebra cases.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Applied Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10272004-164622/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance Analysis of Reliable Adaptive Transmission for Mobile Radio Slow Frequency Hopping Channels Aided by Long Range Prediction</field><field name="creator">Lei, Ming</field><field name="description">Due to correlated fading in frequency hopping (FH) wireless communication systems, it is possible to predict the future channel state information (CSI) for one frequency based on the channel observations of other frequencies. As a result, the performance of slow FH systems can be improved by utilizing adaptive transmission techniques. We propose the optimal Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) Long Range Prediction algorithm for slow FH systems that employ coherent detection. A recursive autocorrelation update method and a simplified prediction algorithm are explored to reduce the complexity. Statistical model of the prediction accuracy is developed and used in the design of the reliable adaptive transmission systems. We investigate the performance of adaptive transmission for high-speed data transmission in SFH systems based on the proposed Long Range Prediction algorithms. For slow frequency hopping communications in the presence of partial-band interference, we propose to employ adaptive transmitter frequency diversity and adaptive modulation to mitigate the effects of partial-band interference and fading. Both standard Jakes model and realistic physical model are used to test the performance. Analysis and simulation results show that significant performance gains can be achieved relative to non-adaptive methods.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10272004-222632/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of the hydrologic regime of four Carolina Bay plant communities.</field><field name="creator">Caldwell, Peter V</field><field name="description">Successful restoration of a wetland requires that wetland vegetation be established at the site. Unfortunately, the hydrologic regime of restored wetlands is frequently incompatible with these communities and the vegetation can not survive. This is sometimes a result of improper hydrologic design, but in many cases it is due to a lack of understanding of the hydrology required by these plant communities. The objective of this study was to provide quantitative data describing the long-term (40 yr) hydrology associated with the Pond Pine Woodland (PPW), Nonriverine Swamp Forest (NRSF), High Pocosin (HP), and Bay Forest (BF) plant communities found in three undisturbed Carolina Bays on the North Carolina Coastal Plain. This objective was achieved by simulating water table depths in the various plant communities in the bays over a 40 yr period with calibrated DRAINMOD hydrologic models. The hydrology of the PPW community differed significantly from that of the NRSF, HP, and BF communities in that water tables were deeper in the soil profile, water was ponded on the surface less often and for shorter durations, and the water table dropped to mineral soil horizons more frequently for extended periods of time. Further, the PPW received an average of 15% of its water input from groundwater inflow, whereas the other communities did not exhibit groundwater inflow. The source of the groundwater inflow is not known but it is believed to be a local phenomenon. The water could enter the bays either laterally from adjacent uplands or vertically from confined aquifers below. A confined artesian aquifer below one of the bays was likely the source of inflow for that bay. The hydrology of the NRSF, HP, and BF communities were very similar. The water table in the NRSF and HP occasionally dropped to mineral soil horizons, which may provide them with additional fertility relative to BF. The results of this study will enable wetland restoration engineers to better approximate the natural hydrology of these plant communities at a restoration site, thereby improving vegetation establishment success.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10272005-141352/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characteristics of Innovative 3-D FRP Sandwich Panels</field><field name="creator">Reis, Engin Murat</field><field name="description">Foam and honeycomb core sandwich composites are widely used in structural applications. Nevertheless, possibilities of core-to-face sheet delamination, crushing and buckling instability are major concerns. This study presents an innovative system for FRP panels designed to overcome delamination problems typically encountered in traditional FRP panels. The panels consist of GFRP laminates and foam core sandwich where top and bottom skin GFRP layers are connected together with through-thickness fibers. Addition of the through-thickness fibers increases the out of plane properties of the panel, delays delamination-type failures, allows low cost manufacturing and ensures full utilization of the panel strength. Fundamental material properties in tension, compression, flexure and shear are evaluated both experimentally and analytically. Failure modes and mechanisms are investigated. The influence of the panel thickness, through thickness fiber configuration and density and other parameters on the tension, compression, flexure and shear behavior of the panels will be discussed. Application of sandwich beam theories, Elementary Sandwich Theory and Advanced Sandwich Theory, are studied in the full behavior of the 3-D FRP sandwich beams. A finite element model is developed to be able to predict the behavior of sandwich panels with different panel thicknesses, through thickness fiber configurations, facing sheet thicknesses and different material properties.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10272005-152005/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NATURAL TRANSFORMATION-MEDIATED TRANSFER OF ERYTHROMYCIN RESISTANCE IN &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter coli&lt;/i&gt; AND &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt;</field><field name="creator">Kim, Joo-Sung</field><field name="description">&lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; is the most common bacterial agent causing human gastroenteritis and is mainly transmitted through foods. &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; is a zoonotic agent, and commonly colonizes poultry and other meat animals. Whereas erythromycin resistance in &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; rarely occurs, erythromycin resistance in &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter coli&lt;/i&gt; from meat animals is frequently encountered, and could represent a substantial barrier to antibiotic treatment of human infections. Erythromycin resistance in &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; has been associated with a point mutation (A2075G) in the 23S rRNA gene, acting synergistically with the CmeABC efflux pump. However, the mechanisms responsible for possible dissemination of erythromycin resistance in &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; remain poorly understood. In this study we investigated transformation-mediated acquisition of erythromycin resistance by genotypically diverse &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; strains from turkeys and swine, with total genomic DNA from erythromycin-resistant &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; used as donor. In addition, we studied the effects of environmental factors and species (&lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; vs. &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt;), and fitness costs of erythromycin resistance in transformants. Overall, transformation to erythromycin resistance was significantly more frequent in &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; from turkeys than in swine-derived strains (P&lt;0.01) with frequency of transformation 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; in turkey-derived strains, but 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; or less in &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; from swine. Transformants harbored the point mutation, A2075G in the 23S rRNA gene. Erythromycin resistance was stable in transformants following serial transfers, and most transformants had high MIC values (&gt;256&#181;g/ml), as did the &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; donor strains. In contrast to results obtained with transformation, spontaneous mutants had relatively low erythromycin MIC (32-64&#181;g/ml) and lacked the A2075G mutation. Temperature profoundly affected frequency of transformation to erythromycin resistance in &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; and transformation frequency at 42&#176;C was significantly higher than at 25&#176;C, 32&#176;C and even 37&#176;C. However, transformation to nalidixic acid resistance was not significantly affected by temperature. No significant difference in transformation frequency was detected between microaerobic (5-10% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and aerobic conditions. Starvation conditions did not affect transformation frequency to nalidixic acid resistance. Increasing incubation time from 3-4h to 15-17h significantly increased transformation frequency to erythromycin resistance (P&lt;0.05). Transformation of &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; using genomic DNA from erythromycin resistant &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; revealed that transformation frequency of &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; to erythromycin resistance was lower than &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting that erythromycin resistance in &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; may not be disseminated via transformation in &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; as frequently as in &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt;. Transformants derived from &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt;, however, had high erythromycin MIC values (&gt;256&#181;g/ml) and harbored the A2075G transition, similarly to &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; transformants. When grown separately at 42&#176;C, an erythromycin-resistant transformant derived from &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; strain 961 had a similar growth rate as its erythromycin-sensitive parental strain, whereas an erythromycin-resistant transformant derived from &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; strain SC49 had a significantly longer generation time compared to its parental strain. In competitive growth studies, however, the &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; transformant was at competitive disadvantage in relation to its parental strain in stationary phase, whereas the &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; transformant was at a slight fitness advantage after 14days. Furthermore, in the mixed culture the generation time of the &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; transformant was not significantly different from that of the parental strain. In conclusion, natural transformation has the potential to contribute to dissemination of high-level resistance to erythromycin among &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; strains colonizing meat animals and temperature can greatly affect transformation to erythromycin resistance, but not to nalidixic acid resistance. These findings suggest that ecological attributes may play an important role and exert differential impact on the potential of the organism to acquire antimicrobial resistance determinants via natural transformation. However, further study is necessary to characterize the fitness of erythromycin resistant transformants in &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; and identify possible mechanisms underlying the relatively low frequency of erythromycin resistance in &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt;.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10272005-170447/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of the Impact of Literacy Training on Performance Gaps in the Computer Skills of Low-Performing Eighth Graders</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Rollinda Alicia</field><field name="description">This research effort investigates relationships among factors that typically impact student performance in computer skills.

A limiting factor for many current SHM methods is that in order to locate damage, modeling of the structural response is required. The structural model can introduce significant errors, in addition to those in the sensor data, both through limitations in the mechanical models and manufacturing variations. This work presents a method of localizing damage that eliminates the requirement for an independent structural model. The method is based on generating flexibility parameters of the structure in pre- and post- damage states. In order to determine these parameters, a technique of loading the structure at each sensor location with actuators and subsequently measuring the displacement at all sensors has been developed. This allows the required information to be constructed from only sensor and actuator data. From the sensor data, a set of damage location vectors are determined. These vectors allow one to localize damage in one of two ways. The first analysis reapplies each set of damage location vectors as applied forces to the structure and locates the lowest regions of stress. The second approach, more applicable to real-time health monitoring, locates the lowest values of the damage location vectors. Both techniques have the ability to locate progressive damage. Simulations on a plate structure are performed for two sensor meshes (eight and thirty-two sensor locations). The results demonstrate excellent damage localization, and some indication of damage severity. Finally, an experimental demonstration of the method utilizing eight sensors surface mounted to an aluminum plate is presented for four applied damage cases.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10282003-143823/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social Support, Social Skills, and Educational Setting and their Relation to the Perceived Self-Concept of Children with Learning Disabilities</field><field name="creator">Getty, Kimberly Chapman</field><field name="description">This study examined student-perceived teacher and classmate support, teacher- and peer-preferred social skills, and educational setting and their relation to student-perceived scholastic competence and social acceptance. Sixty children in fourth and fifth grades who were diagnosed with a learning disability (LD) in reading or written language participated in the study, as well as students' language arts teachers. Four research questions were posed. The first two questions asked whether educational setting was related to students' perceptions of teacher support and classmate support. The third question asked if student-perceived teacher support, teacher-preferred social skills, and educational setting were related to student-perceived scholastic competence. The last question asked whether student-perceived classmate support, peer-preferred social skills, and educational setting were related to student-perceived social acceptance. Two one-way ANOVAs indicated that student perceptions of teacher and classmate support were not related to educational setting. The third and fourth questions were answered using a parallel statistical procedure involving standard multiple regression analyses. Results indicated that social support and social skills were related to aspects of self-concept, and educational setting was related to self-concept. Implications of these findings regarding the role of school psychologists and the development of children with LD were discussed, emphasizing the importance of social processes within the classroom as well as how children with LD formulate their self-perceptions.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10282003-210833/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rapid Mortality of Pest Arthropods by Direct Exposure to a Dielectric Barrier Discharge</field><field name="creator">Bures, Brian Lee</field><field name="description">The spread of arthropods due to trade of agricultural commodities and travel of humans is a significant problem in many countries.

The arthropods are directly exposed to a 5.0 cm helium discharge with power densities on the order of 60 mW/cm3. Direct measurement of chemical species and ambient gas temperature shows the DBD treatment remains effective when the chemically reactive species are suppressed by helium, and when the ambient gas temperature of the discharge is below 40 &#176;C. In addition to gas temperature measurements and chemical species identification, the electron temperature and electron density were measured using the neutral bremsstrahlung continuum technique. This study is the first successful implementation of the neutral bremsstrahlung continuum emission diagnostic to a barrier discharge. The primary advantages of the diagnostic for barrier discharges are the measurement is passive and the spatial resolution is only limited by the collimation of the light and the sensitivity of the detector. Although the electron temperature (1.0-1.5 eV) and electron density (~108 cm-3) are modest, non-chemical dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) treatment of arthropods has proven effective in significantly reducing the population of some arthropods including human body lice, green peach aphids, and western flower thrips. However, the treatment was not universally effective on all arthropod species. German cockroaches and citrus mealy bugs showed substantial resistance to the treatment. The study has shown the treatment does not always induce instant mortality: however, the mortality increases over a 24 hr-period after treatment. Based upon visual observation and the time after treatment to reach maximum mortality, the mode of action is either direct damage to the nervous system or changes to the hydrocarbon layer that protects the arthropods from dehydration.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10282004-131510/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Stability and Control of an Aircraft with an Adaptive Wing</field><field name="creator">Vosburg, Victor Jay</field><field name="description">With increasing interest in the use of adaptive lifting surfaces for improved aircraft performance, it is necessary to study the stability and control characteristics of an aircraft with an adaptive wing. This research builds on recent development of an automated cruise flap for adapting a wing shape to achieve low drag over a large lift range. Such an automated cruise flap system was shown to have unusual lift and pitching moment curves, which prompted the need for studying the effect on aircraft stability and control. In this thesis, the static stability considerations are used to show that when an automated cruise flap is used on an airfoil to continuously adjust the flap to the optimum angle, there is a need for an accompanying controller that achieves the desired lift coefficient by adjusting the airfoil angle of attack. Likewise, when an automated flap is used on an aircraft wing, there is a need for an accompanying airspeed controller to adjust the elevator. The thesis presents Simulink models for analyzing the dynamic behavior of an aircraft with an automated flap. Two schemes were studied for the flap and elevator controllers. The most desirable results were obtained when the flap and elevator controllers were coupled so that trim changes due to the flap are immediately compensated by adjustment of the elevator angle. The results of the simulation show that the aircraft does not exhibit any undesirable behavior with the automated cruise flap. The study, therefore, provides the confidence needed to implement the system on an uninhabited aerial vehicle.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10282004-154253/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intelligent Context-Sensitive Help for Dynamic User and Environment Contexts</field><field name="creator">Ramachandran, Ashwin</field><field name="description">The problem of providing help for complex application interfaces has been a source of interest for a number of researcher efforts. As the computational power of computers increases, typical applications not only increase in functionality but also in the degree of interaction with the computational environment in which they reside. There are powerful software tools available today used for both specialized and non-specialized tasks that are often used by novice users who attempt tasks without significant training or knowledge of the application?s interface. These kinds of applications are diverse and complicated in the variety of functionality they provide, often interacting with other applications on the user?s system. With current platforms (Windows, Macintosh, Linux etc) providing extensive multi-tasking facilities, interaction with these applications is sometimes affected by the context of the environment itself (e.g., application windows being minimized, maximized or obscured by those of other applications). The interdependencies between applications and their environments increase the difficulty of providing effective context-sensitive help when building an application?s help documentation. The purpose of this research is to create an Intelligent Help System, which incorporates these interactions and affecting factors when providing help. The SmartAid&#232; system, which was developed as part of this effort, works on the premise that the user has a goal when interacting with the application. This document will provide a detailed overview of the architecture of the system along with the underlying design decisions. The system was then evaluated against traditional application help documentation to test its effectiveness. The results and analysis of this evaluation have been enumerated.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10282004-202721/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying Phylogenetic Conservation in Protein Molecular Evolution</field><field name="creator">Fernandes, Andrew Dellano</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the problem of quantifying amino acid conservation in proteins molecular evolution. Ideally, this conservation is quantified by inferring the rate of evolution at each amino acid site of a multiple-alignment. However, current rate-inference methods have three problematic assumptions. The methods assume that (a) the rates of all sites are independent, (b) the rates are drawn from a known prior distribution, and (c) the mean rate across sites is approximately one. The problems are two-fold. First, the assumptions of site-rate independence and known mean rate are contradictory. To see the contradiction, consider a two-site alignment with known rate of ~0.5 at site one. The rate at site two is unknown under the independent-sites assumption, but is ~1.5 by the assumption of known mean rate. Second, if the rates are drawn from a known prior distribution, the assumption of known distribution implies the question ?which distribution??. Previous work has focused only on selecting better families of rate distributions, often at the expense of additionally parameterizing the evolutionary model. Herein, I develop a method of inferring rates requiring only the assumption of known mean rate, and not requiring additional parameterization. Thus a model of evolution based on our method is a more general framework for inferring rates than previous work. Since a known mean rate is required to distinguish evolutionary rate from time, our method is arguably the most general possible that allows rate and time to be fully and independently identified. The method is assessed by investigating conservation in the Myc, Max, and p53 transcription-factor families.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10282006-130129/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adrift</field><field name="creator">Mishra, Shailen</field><field name="description">"Adrift" is a story of love and aspirations equally complicated by the traditional order of the old and the unchecked ambitions of the modern India.

Kennedy attempted to create a vast network of public and private fallout shelters across the United States. The North Carolina Civil Defense Agency (NCCD) during this period focused instead on emergency preparedness. Fallout shelters were a fa&#195;&#167;ade, providing funding that allowed the NCCD to quietly focus its efforts on emergency preparedness. While the state managed to provide fallout shelters for only eight percent of the population, this failure was not as damning as most scholars have assumed. In fact, the state agency used available federal funding to prepare the state for natural disasters and isolated, minor emergencies. State civil defense officials implemented improvements in communication networks, emergency rescue squads, and the professionalizing of fire and police departments state-wide. Citizens did not criticize the civil defense agency in North Carolina; following the Cuban Missile Crisis, there was no public backlash against the state agency. The crisis, on the contrary, validated the state&#226;s approach to civil defense. By focusing on emergency preparedness instead of investing in fallout shelters, local civil defense agencies were able to operate in accordance with the specific demographic, geographic, and financial needs of the county residents. Most people assume that the fading yellow and black &#226;Fallout Shelter&#226; signs are the only residue of the civil defense program in North Carolina. In fact, the professional development of the state&#226;s rescue squads, police and fire departments harkens back to the efforts of civil defense offices in the early 1960s.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10282008-171921/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bayesian Analysis of Circular Data Using Wrapped Distributions</field><field name="creator">Ravindran, Palanikumar</field><field name="description">Circular data arise in a number of different areas such as geological, meteorological, biological and industrial sciences. We cannot use standard statistical techniques to model circular data, due to the circular geometry of the sample space. One of the common methods used to analyze such data is the wrapping approach. Using the wrapping approach, we assume that, by wrapping a probability distribution from the real line onto the circle, we obtain the probability distribution for circular data. This approach creates a vast class of probability distributions that are flexible to account for different features of circular data. However, the likelihood-based inference for such distributions can be very complicated and computationally intensive. The EM algorithm used to compute the MLE is feasible, but is computationally unsatisfactory. Instead, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with a data augmentation step, to overcome such computational difficulties. Given a probability distribution on the circle, we assume that the original distribution was distributed on the real line, and then wrapped onto the circle. If we can "unwrap" the distribution off the circle and obtain a distribution on the real line, then the standard statistical techniques for data on the real line can be used. Our proposed methods are flexible and computationally efficient to fit a wide class of wrapped distributions. Furthermore, we can easily compute the usual summary statistics. We present extensive simulation studies to validate the performance of our method. We apply our method to several real data sets and compare our results to parameter estimates available in the literature. We find that the Wrapped Double Exponential family produces robust parameter estimates with good frequentist coverage probability. We extend our method to the regression model. As an example, we analyze the association between ozone data and wind direction. A major contribution of this dissertation is to illustrate a technique to interpret the circular regression coefficients in terms of the linear regression model setup. Regression diagnostics can be developed after augmenting wrapping numbers to the circular data (refer Section 3.5). We extend our method to fit time-correlated data. We can compute other statistics such as circular autocorrelation functions and their standard errors very easily. We use the Wrapped Normal model to analyze the hourly wind directions, which is an example of the time series circular data.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10292002-150812/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Task-based Framework for the Quantitative Evaluation of Input Devices</field><field name="creator">Dulberg, Martin S.</field><field name="description">This research describes the development of a conceptual framework and methodology that will permit the evaluation of input devices in graphical user interfaces in a more meaningful context than previous studies.

In this case study, videotapes of six distance learning classes were used to observe student behaviors and use of real objects during a program from the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. Additionally the students and teachers from those classes completed surveys about their experiences. Before using the objects, the students appear uncertain about the program, and disinterested. After receiving the objects, the students appear to be engaged in learning. Later when presented with a live animal that is only seen remotely, the students continue to be active participants in the program. At the conclusion of class, the students frequently identify using the realia as a significant part of class, although in the surveys completed after class, the technology was listed as the most important part. The teachers rated the hands-on materials as significant on their surveys. The use of real objects changes the student behaviors in class. The objects generate multiple forms of interactions, support student dialogue with the instructor and each other, and decrease the sense of separation experienced by the students in distance learning.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Math, Science and Technology Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10292003-131544/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Jetting Techniques for Pile Installation and Environmental Impact Minimization</field><field name="creator">Smith, Walter Alex</field><field name="description">Development of a comprehensive laboratory experimental program provided insight into the effects of jetting parameters (i.e. water volume flowrate and jet nozzle velocity) on maximum pile insertion depth, pile insertion rate, volume of debris transported to the ground surface, and the extent of the debris zone area (installation characteristics).

A four-year cultivar rotation study was conducted in three fields to assess how different levels and types of resistance affected the race structure and population dynamics of the pathogen. In a mixed race field, the high level of partial resistance in ?K 346? was most effective in reducing disease and race 1 populations decreased. The deployment of complete resistance in ?NC 71? resulted in intermediate levels of disease, and race 1 increased. ?K 326?, with a low level of partial resistance, had the highest levels of disease, and race 0 was dominant. In a field where no race 1 was detected initially, disease incidence was high with the use of partial resistance. Complete resistance was very effective in suppressing disease, but race 1 was recovered after only one growing season. By the end of the third growing season, race 1 was recovered from most ?NC 71? treatments. In a field where race 1 was predominant, a high level of partial resistance was most effective in controlling disease and race 0 increased rapidly. A rotation of single-gene resistance and a high level of partial resistance was the most effective rotation for disease management and it minimized race shifts in the pathogen. This may serve to prolong the usefulness of the Ph gene. Populations of race 1 decreased relative to race 0 when cultivars with partial resistance were rotated with complete resistance, suggesting that race 1 isolates are not as fit as race 0 isolates. Experiments were conducted to compare their pathogenic and ecological fitness. Forty isolates of race 0 and 20 isolates of race 1 were used to inoculate tobacco cultivars with low, moderate, and high levels of partial resistance. Race 0 isolates were more aggressive than the race 1 isolates; incubation period was shorter and root rot severity greater with race 0 isolates than with race 1 isolates. Isolates of race 1 caused greater stunting of plants than race 0 isolates. Field microplots were infested with either a single race or an equal mixture of each race. Soil samples were collected and populations determined at the end of each growing season and again the following spring. There were no statistical differences in survival between races, but over both years of the study there was a trend for race 0 to survive better than race 1. One-hundred ninety five isolates of P. parasitica var. nicotianae were subjected to amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis to characterize the genetic diversity among isolates and within pathogen races 0 and 1. Isolates included 20 diverse isolates and an additional 175 isolates obtained over years from a field in Duplin Co., N.C. From all isolates evaluated, 256 of 304 markers (85%) were polymorphic and provided 106 AFLP profiles. The AFLP phenotypes initially detected within each plot were maintained throughout the study but additional phenotypes were recovered over years. At least 6 race 0 and race 1 isolates collected from a single test plot were similar and clustered together in the unweighted pair-group mean analysis phenogram. Examination of the AFLP profiles showed race 0 and race 1 isolates differed by only 2 to 4 markers. Results indicated that P. parasitica var. nicotianae is diverse and that the multiple occurrences of race 1 that were recovered throughout this field over years were independent events where race 1 was selected from within the pathogen population.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10292004-152059/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic analyses of the federally endangered Echinacea laevigata using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) ? Inferences in population genetic structure and mating system</field><field name="creator">Peters, Melinda Dean</field><field name="description">Echinacea laevigata is a federally endangered species and a close relative of the medicinally important E. purpurea. The species has 24 recognized populations restricted to four states (VA, NC, SC, GA). To determine the population structure and outcrossing rate across the range of the species, we conducted AFLP analysis using four primer combinations for 22 populations. The genetic diversity of this species was found to be high based on the level of polymorphic loci (200 of 210 loci; 95.24%) and Nei?s gene diversity (ranging from 0.1398 to 0.2606; overall 0.2611). There was significant population genetic differentiation (GST of 0.2941), suggesting possible adaptation to local environments. Results from the AMOVA analysis suggest that a majority of the genetic variance is attributed to variation within populations (70.26%). These results are congruent to a previous allozyme study that examined the genetic makeup of 11 of the 24 populations, excluding any Georgia populations. An isolation by distance (IBD) analysis indicated that genetic differentiation among populations is a function of geographic distance, although long-distance gene dispersal (LDGF) between some populations was suggested based on the NJ tree. An estimate of the outcrossing rate based on genotypes of progenies from six of the 22 populations using a multilocus estimate was 0.833-1.2, where 1.2 is considered complete outcrossing, suggesting that the species is predominantly outcrossing. The remaining populations of E. laevigata have significant levels of population diversity, which is encouraging because the long-term survival of this species will depend on moderate to high levels of genetic diversity and management efforts can focus on other issues instead of increasing the genetic diversity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10292005-111050/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic Shifts in Textile Production 1994-2006</field><field name="creator">Ji, Yan Ms.</field><field name="description">In order to better understand the changes and trends in the increasingly competitive dynamics of global textile complex, this research focuses on analyzing the rate of change in country of production origin for fiber, yarn, fabric and end-use products in the past decade.

This superfluous iron may come from feedstuffs naturally high in iron, or from the consumption of soil, though bioavailability of iron from soil is unknown. Additionally, excess iron in cattle diets has been shown to negatively impact the metabolism of manganese and copper, though the molecular mechanism behind this interaction is unclear. The purpose of this research was threefold: 1) to determine the effect of ensiling on bioaccessibility of iron from soil contamination of corn greenchop, 2) to identify proteins important in iron metabolism in bovine and swine, and 3) to determine if these proteins are affected by dietary iron concentration. The results reported herein suggest that bioaccessibility of iron from soil contamination is greatly increased when soil undergoes a prolonged exposure to a low pH environment, such as that found with fermenting forages. These data indicate that very little iron from soil is available to the animal if no prior exposure to an acidic environment occurs. Also, for the first time we report that several proteins known to be essential to iron metabolism in rodents are present in bovine small intestine and liver. Specifically, the iron importer divalent metal transporter 1, the iron exporter ferroportin, and the multi-copper ferroxidase hephaestin were all present in bovine duodenum. In the bovine, reduced iron status, as induced by a primary deficiency of copper, resulted in increased gene expression of divalent metal transporter 1 and ferroportin in duodenum and decreased expression of the ferroportin regulatory hormone hepcidin and divalent metal transporter 1 in liver. Protein expression of ferroportin and hephaestin were also increased in duodenum due to reduced iron status. The addition of excessive amounts of iron to the diets of young calves also appeared to regulate protein expression of transporters important in iron metabolism. Specifically, high iron tended to decreased duodenal protein levels of divalent metal transporter 1 and reduced ferroportin protein levels, though no effect on hephaestin was observed. We also examined iron metabolism in the young pig, in order to examine the effect of an iron deficient diet on expression of these proteins. We found that hephaestin protein in the duodenum was lowered by feeding a high iron diet, and levels of both ferroportin and divalent metal transporter 1 tended to be reduced by high dietary iron compared to pigs fed a low iron diet. Additionally, we found that feeding a high iron diet to pigs negatively impacted liver concentrations of manganese. And feeding a high iron diet to either pigs or calves reduced duodenal concentrations of manganese, suggesting that high dietary iron reduces manganese absorption. Because high iron diets fed to both pigs and calves tended to reduce duodenal levels of divalent metal transporter 1, a protein known in rodents to transport both iron and manganese, it appears that the observed reductions in duodenal manganese concentrations may be a result of reduced transporter availability. Collectively, our data suggest that high dietary iron may negatively affect manganese absorption, and because the iron content of livestock diets is often high, further research is warranted.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10292008-130736/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining Poverty and Working Poverty in North Carolina Counties: The Role of Spatial Location, Local Opportunity Structure, and Household Composition</field><field name="creator">Teixeira-Poit, Stephanie Marie</field><field name="description">My research employs structural and human capital approaches to examine poverty and working poverty.

After collecting cross-sectional data for North Carolina counties, I replicate previous research that examined the effects of the quantity of job opportunities, quality of job opportunities, structure of the labor market, and relative power of labor on poverty, as well as on working poverty. Additionally, I extend past studies by improving the measures of the quantity of jobs, quality of jobs, structure of the labor market, and relative power of labor and adding measures of spatial location and household composition.

Four data mining tools, principal component analysis, cluster analysis, recursive partitioning, and discriminant analysis, were used to explore the major factors that contribute to ends down in a rotor spinning manufacturing process. Principal component analysis was used to explore the research question about whether the large number of cotton properties used to classify cotton could be reduced to a significant few. Cluster analysis was used to gain insight about whether there were groups of gins, counties, or classing offices that produced better raw material than others and led to less ends down. The important research question of what raw material properties were affecting ends down was explored with both recursive partitioning and discriminant analysis. Additional research investigated the effect of cotton variety and atmospheric conditions on spinning productivity. Each of the four data mining tools used was informative and offered a different perspective to the overall research question. Several significant factors emerged including humidity, temperature, %DP 555, and uniformity in addition to micronaire and the color properties (+b and Rd). With these results the researcher developed an improvement plan for better control and increased spinning productivity in future operations.

The activated species, an isonicotinoyl radical, couples to NAD+/NADH forming an isoniazid-NADH adduct that ultimately confers anti-tubercular activity. In order to better understand the mechanisms of isoniazid activation as well as the origins of KatG-derived INH-resistance, we have compared the catalytic properties of the wild-type enzyme to twenty-three KatG mutants which have been associated with isoniazid resistance in clinical M. tuberculosis isolates. Neither catalase nor peroxidase activities, the two inherent enzymatic functions of KatG, were found to correlate with isoniazid resistance. Furthermore, catalase function was lost in mutants which lacked the Met-Tyr-Trp crosslink, the biogenic cofactor in KatG which has been previously shown to be integral to this activity. The presence or absence of the crosslink itself, however, was also found to not correlate with INH resistance. The KatG resistance-conferring mutants were then assayed for their ability to generate the INH-NADH adduct in the presence of peroxide (t-BuOOH and H2O2), superoxide, and no exogenous oxidant (air-only). The results demonstrate that residue location plays a critical role in determining INH-resistance mechanisms associated with INH activation; however, different mutations at the same location can produce vastly different reactivities that are oxidant-specific. Furthermore, the data can be interpreted to suggest the presence of a second mechanism of INH-resistance that is not correlated with the formation of the INH-NADH adduct.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10292009-100009/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Voluntary versus Forced Task Switching on Task Performance</field><field name="creator">Panepinto, Marie</field><field name="description">Research on task switching has focused on the relatively well known task switching cost, usually defined as an increase in RT on a trial directly following a switch. Two main issues with previous studies suggest that their results may not be applicable to real world scenarios; one, that they typically use short and arbitrary tasks in comparison to real work situations and two, that the vast majority force participants to switch rather than allowing them to do so voluntarily, as is common in the workplace. The current experiment utilized two longer lasting tasks (document proofreading and a Sudoku puzzle) to more closely resemble real world sitations and four task switching groups. One group switched voluntarily, one was forced without warning, one was forced with a cue that a switch would be coming, and one served as a no switch control group. Performance, reaction time, and mental workload (NASA-TLX) were measured. Task switch group produced no differential effects on these variables, and no task switching cost was found. Though the hypothesis were not met, these results lend support to the notion that previous lab studies may not adequately resemble real world scenarios and that micromanaging small tasks, and switching between comparatively longer lasting tasks may not be the same thing. More research on this area may help to produce a better understanding of why people task switch and what they experience cognitively when they do so.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10292009-105633/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of isolates of Glomerella cingulata causal agent of Glomerella leaf spot and bitter rot of apples based on morphology and genetic, molecular, and pathogenicity tests</field><field name="creator">Gonzalez, Eugenia</field><field name="description">Isolates of Glomerella cingulata, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. acutatum, obtained from symptomatic fruit and leaves collected from apple orchards in the US and Brazil, were characterized based on morphological and cultural characteristics, vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs), mtDNA RFLP haplotypes, and the sequence analysis of a 200 bp intron of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GDPH) gene. The isolates were also tested for pathogenicity on leaves and fruit. The population structure of the species associated with bitter rot of apples in two orchards of cv. Granny Smith was also studied. Multiple VCGs and mtDNA RFLP haplotypes were found within each of the species tested. Phylogenetic trees constructed based on Neighboring-Joining and Maximum Parsimony methods, using the intron sequence, produced similar topologies. Each species was separated into distinct groups. All isolates tested were pathogenic on fruit. Only isolates with haplotypes G1, G1.1, G3, and G4 and VCGs 1, 4, and 5 were capable of causing Glomerella leaf spot (GLS). G. cingulata was the predominant species associated with bitter rot in the two orchards of cv. Granny Smith. Vegetative compatibility was a better indicator than molecular characterization for distinguishing isolates of G. cingulata pathogenic on both leaves and fruit from the ones pathogenic only on fruit. Isolates of G. cingulata from the US and Brazil which cause GLS were included in different haplotypes and phylogenetic groups. Therefore, our results suggest that isolates of G. cingulata from the US capable of causing both GLS and bitter rot arose independently of Brazilian isolates of G. cingulata, and may have arisen from isolates of G. cingulata from the US that originally were capable of causing bitter rot only. Slower growth, lower optimum growth temperature, and less sensitivity to benomyl distinguished isolates of C. acutatum from isolates of G. cingulata and C. gloeosporioides.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10302003-213733/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Virus infection and evolution in the central nervous system following intracerebroventricular inoculation with Feline Immunodeficiency Virus</field><field name="creator">Liu, Pinghuang</field><field name="description">HIV-1 infection of the central nervous system (CNS) results in neurological impairments in subpopulation of HIV-infected individuals which range from from mild cognitive/motor disorder (MCMD) to HIV-associated dementia (HAD). HIV-1 associated neurological diseases are still a big problem even with the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy. However the mechanisms of CNS infection and pathogenesis that lead to HAD are still not completely clear. HIV-1 CNS infection occurs soon after peripheral infection. Subsequent to infection, the CNS may act as a protected anatomical reservoir for lentiviruses and may also give rise to the development of or sequestration of unique quasispecies. The choroid plexus (ChP) has been demonstrated to be an important site for lentivirus infection and contains a mixture of viral quasispecies including both systemic and brain derived isolates. Since the appearance of viral RNA is particularly prominent in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the ChP-CSF pathway may contribute to infection and viral diversity in the CNS. In the present study, we investigated lentiviral infection and evolution within the CNS by directly infusing virus into the CSF using an FIV animal model. Cell-free NCSU1 FIV or cell-associated FIV (FIV infected ChP macrophages) was directly injected into the right lateral ventricle of the brain. Negative controls were sham inoculated with uninfected ChP macrophages or cell-free culture supernatant and positive controls were infected systemically with cell-free FIV by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) inoculation with cell-free FIV resulted in high levels of plasma FIV RNA detected as early as 1-2 weeks post inoculation in all 6 i.c.v. cats, and the plasma viremia preceded the detection of CSF viral RNA. Compared to i.p. cats, i.c.v. cats exhibited much higher levels of CSF FIV RNA and FIV DNA in the brain, increased ratios of CSF to plasma viral load (&gt;1 at several time points), and a unique rebound CSF viral peak (5 of 6 cats). Infusion of FIV-infected ChP-Mac induced an acute inflammatory response and a slight suppression of the CD4+:CD8+ ratio, but failed to produce a detectable infection. After cell-free inoculation, FIV env variants, amplified by the poymerase chain reaction (PCR) and isolated using the heteroduplex tracking assay (HTA), exhibited clear compartmentalization between the CNS and periphery. Unique or enriched variants rapidly appeared in the CSF. Similar variation was seen in FIV proviral DNA isolated from cortical and subcortical brain regions. Compared to the initial viral peak in CSF, the second CSF viral peak displayed considerable change from both the first CSF peak and matched samples of plasma. FIV env diversity was highest in the CNS tissue and was unrelated to matched PBMCs collected at the same time indicating that the sequences were not due to PBMC trafficking. In addition, three unique variants were found to be selectively enriched in the CNS. Taken together, these results demonstrated that 1) CSF provides an efficient pathway for the transfer of infectious virus to the periphery, 2) virus trafficking through the CSF promotes infection of the CNS and viral diversification, 3) CSF virus may derive from both the local productive infection and blood, and 4)virus within the CNS experienced a relatively rapid and independent evolution relative to virus in the periphery.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10302005-212859/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flexural Behavior of Prestressed Girder with High Strength Concrete</field><field name="creator">Choi, Wonchang</field><field name="description">The advantages of using high strength concrete (HSC) have led to an increase in the typical span and a reduction of the weight of prestressed girders used for bridges. However, growing demands to utilize HSC require a reassessment of current provisions of the design codes. The objective of one of the research projects, recently initiated and sponsored by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP), NCHRP Project 12-64, conducted at North Carolina State University is to extend the use of the current AASHTO LRFD design specifications to include compressive strength up to 18,000 psi (124 MPa) for reinforced and prestressed concrete members in flexure and compression. This thesis deals with one part of this project. Nine full-size AASHTO girders are examined to investigate the behavior of using different concrete compressive strength and subjected to the flexural loadings. The experimental program includes three different configurations of prestressed girders with and without a deck slab to investigate the behavior for the following cases: 1) the compression zone consists of normal strength concrete (NSC) only; 2) the compression zone consists of HSC only; and 3) the compression zone consists of a combination of two different strengths of concrete. An analytical model is developed to determine the ultimate flexural resistance for prestressed girders with and without normal compressive strength concrete. The research also includes investigation of the transfer length and the prestress losses of HSC prestressed girders. Based on materials testing and extensive data collected from the literature, a new equation is proposed to calculate the elastic modulus for normal and high strength concrete.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10302006-114609/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of solid deuterium ultra-cold neutron source production and UCN transport</field><field name="creator">Xu, Yanping</field><field name="description">Ultracold neutrons (UCN) are neutrons with energies below about 330 neV, making it possible to store them in material bottles for hundreds of seconds and guide them into a variety of experiments.

In 2000, a series of experiments at LANSCE demonstrated that a solid deuterium superthermal source, coupled to a spallation target, can potentially provide orders of magnitude improvements in useful UCN density. Since these prototype experiments, a production UCN source has been constructed for the UCNA collaboration in Line B at LANSCE, and another solid deuterium source has been designed to operate at the PULSTAR reactor at NC State university, based on the similar principles. This work will present the initial results and analysis of the LANL UCN source performance and some of the development and design issues for the PULSTAR source.

However, it can also result in performance degradation or even destabilization of the control system. Similar effects may arise from different operating conditions of the system. In this research, the effect of the network is compared with the effects exerted by three other parameters in an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) path-tracking problem. The system?s performance is quantified by means of three characteristics: the deviation error, the system?s runtime and the error-time product. Design of Experiments (DOE) and regression analysis are utilized to appropriately collect and analyze experimental data. For the ranges of variation studied, it is shown that the system is two times more sensitive to the speed of the vehicle than to network?s delay. The effect of the look-ahead distance is shown to be similar to the network?s delay effect, indicating a potential control strategy to alleviate the network?s effect by appropriately adjusting the look-ahead distance. The above results are drawn with respect to the completion time and the error-time product characteristics of the system. The deviation error is shown to have a more complex relationship with the four parameters studied and their effects can only be calculated locally, based on the operating conditions of the system.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10302007-113420/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vigil</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Gabriel Marcus</field><field name="description">In a remote wilderness fort, a caravan is attacked by a mysterious creature, and the attack is a spark that ignites the tenuous social fabric of the Vigil.

To this end, spectroscopic studies were carried out to determine the physical and electronic properties of Ge/high-&#206;&#186; structures, and MOS capacitors were fabricated to study their electrical characteristics. Crystallinity, thermal stability, electronic defect levels, and Hf d state degeneracy removal in this material system were studied via x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The presence of conduction band edge defect states was confirmed by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), and medium energy ion spectroscopy (MEIS) was employed to investigate chemical distributions within these structures. Capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements made on related MOS structures provided valuable insight into the nature of carrier trapping and charged traps in these devices, and lastly, current-voltage (I-V) measurements revealed information about the integrity of these gate materials while in contact with germanium surfaces. While the nitridation of germanium surfaces was shown to mitigate atomic migration and diffusion to a degree during device processing, both hafnia and hafnium nitro-silicate films demonstrated a large degree of physical and chemical instability when in contact with germanium. Moreover, these difficulties were found to be correlated with electrically active defects which make this technology unsuitable for CMOS applications at present.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10302008-160353/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetics of gilt estrous behavior</field><field name="creator">Knauer, Mark</field><field name="description">Studies were conducted to develop and analyze gilt estrous behavior traits. Variance components, genetic correlations, and genetic line differences were estimated for gilt estrus, puberty, growth, composition, structural conformation, and first litter sow reproductive measures. Four groups of Landrace-Large White gilts (n=1,225, GIS of NC) from 59 sires and 330 dams were utilized. Heritability (h2) estimates for estrous traits; estrus length, maximum strength of standing reflex with a boar, total strength of standing reflex with a boar, maximum strength of standing reflex without a boar, total strength of standing reflex without a boar, vulva redness, strength of vulva reddening and swelling (VISUAL VULVA), and vulva width were 0.21, 0.13, 0.26, 0.42, 0.42, 0.26, 0.45, and 0.58, respectively. For puberty traits; age at puberty, puberty weight, puberty backfat, and puberty longissimus muscle, h2 estimates were 0.29, 0.39, 0.41, and 0.38, respectfully. The h2 of whether or not a gilt farrowed a litter (STAY1) was 0.14. Age at puberty had favorable genetic associations with estrus length, maximum strength of standing reflex with a boar, vulva redness, STAY1, and age at first farrowing (AFF) (-0.23, -0.32, 0.20, -0.27, and 0.76, respectively). Genetic correlations between estrus length and the standing reflex traits with STAY1 (0.34 to 0.74) and AFF (-0.04 to -0.41) were positive and negative, respectively. Growth rate had unfavorable genetic correlations with estrus length, the standing reflex traits, vulva redness, STAY1, and AFF (0.30, 0.14 to 0.34, -0.19, 0.52, and -0.25, respectfully). Backfat had unfavorable genetic associations with estrus length, age at puberty, and first litter total number born (TNB1) (0.29, -0.26, and 0.47, respectively). Vulva redness and TNB1 had favorable phenotypic and genetic correlations (-0.14 and -0.53, respectively). For estrous traits, crossbred performance was superior to the pure-line average for estrus length, total strength of standing reflex with a boar, vulva redness, VISUAL VULVA, and vulva width. These findings imply the use of F1 females would increase estrus length and improve vulva traits. The unfavorable genetic associations between production and reproduction traits further strengthen the need for a balanced selection objective. Based on these results it was concluded that selection for a younger age at puberty would have correlated responses of improved gilt estrous behavior and sow reproductive lifetime.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science and Poultry Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10302009-095808/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Regime Diagram for Premixed Flame Kernel-Vortex Interactions - Revisited.</field><field name="creator">Vasudeo, Nikhil Baburam</field><field name="description">Regimes of flame kernel-vortex (KV) interactions are investigated numerically using a detailed mechanism for hydrogen chemistry. The parametric simulations explore a wide range of conditions that are representative of conditions encountered at various degrees of turbulence intensity. The results show that KV interactions can be classified into five different regimes, which include 1) the laminar kernel regime, 2) the wrinkled kernel regime, 3) the breakthrough regime, 4) the global extinction regime, and 5) the regeneration after global extinction (RGE) regime. With the exception of the last regime, the transition from one regime to another in the order listed corresponds to increasing the vortex size and strength. Operation at the RGE regime reveals interesting dynamics of the flame front that results in reignition or mending of combustion regimes after most of the original kernel has extinguished due to intense straining. Two different types of combustion zones are observed, which correspond to a flamelet structure as well as to more diffuse structures of merged flame segments. A revised regime diagram of the KV interactions is proposed that includes the broader range of KV interactions and incorporate the new RGE regime.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10302009-145332/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wetland Assessment Using the Hydric Soil Technical Standard</field><field name="creator">Burdette, Jennifer Ann</field><field name="description">The National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils developed the Hydric Soil Technical Standard (HSTS) to identify a functioning wetland (hydric) soil using quantitative measurements of saturation and anaerobic conditions. We used the HSTS to assess wetland restoration success and to compare surface treatments designed to replicate microtopographic relief found in forested wetlands. Experiments were conducted on a wetland restored from agricultural fields in eastern NC where monitoring stations were installed across three surface treatments in the restored wetland: 1) a microtopography (MT) treatment created by roughing the soil surface to mimic the uneven surface of forested wetlands, 2) a crown removal treatment imposed by grading the field flat, and 3) a control treatment that had no surface alteration. Monitoring stations were also installed in a nearby nonriverine swamp forest as a reference wetland. Weekly measurements of water table depth and redox potential were collected for 15 months. Soil at all monitoring stations met the HSTS, indicating that functioning hydric soils were restored. Although a significant difference between surface treatments was not detected, the MT treatment resulted in anaerobic conditions most similar to the reference wetland, signifying that this type of surface treatment should be considered for wetland restoration of areas with smooth surfaces. The HSTS proved to be a useful tool in evaluating wetland restoration success and microtopographic effects. Microtopographic relief did not create nonhydric areas as measured by HSTS; however, microtopographic relief is likely to influence plant establishment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10302009-165757/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using Grammatical Evolution Decision Trees for Detecting Gene-Gene Interactions in Genetic Epidemiology</field><field name="creator">Deodhar, Sushamna Shriniwas</field><field name="description">A major goal of human genetics is the discovery and validation of genetic polymorphisms that predict common, complex diseases. It is hypothesized that complex diseases are due to a myriad of factors including environmental exposures and complex genetic models. This etiological complexity, coupled with rapid advances in genotyping technology present enormous theoretical and practical concerns for statistical and computational analysis. Specifically, the challenge presented by epistasis, or gene-gene interactions, has sparked the development of a multitude of statistical techniques over the years. Subsequently, pattern matching and machine learning approaches have been explored to overcome the limitations of traditional computational methods. Grammatical Evolution Neural Networks (GENN) uses grammatical evolution to optimize neural network architectures and better detect and analyze gene-gene interactions. Motivated by good results shown by GENN to identify epistasis in complex datasets, we have developed a new method of Grammatical Evolution Decision Trees (GEDT). GEDT replaces the black-box approach of neural networks with the white-box approach of decision trees improving understandability and interpretability. We provide a detailed technical understanding of coupling Grammatical Evolution with Decision Tress using Backus Naur Form (BNF) grammar. Further, the GEDT system has been analyzed for power results on simulated datasets. Finally, we show the results of using GEDT on two different epistatis models and discuss the direction it would take in the future.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10302009-181439/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Dance Flies (Diptera: Empidoidea) of Madagascar</field><field name="creator">Swink, Whitney Garland</field><field name="description">The Empidoidea are a monophyletic superfamily of flies that includes dance flies (Empididae), long-legged flies (Dolichopodidae), and several small families (Atelestidae, Hybotidae, and Brachystomatidae). Empidoids are found worldwide and contain many thousands of species, but none have ever been described from Madagascar. An ongoing biodiversity survey by the California Academy of Sciences has brought to light many hundreds of undescribed empidoids from the island. This research project involves description, databasing, and DNA barcoding to establish the first estimates of empidoid species diversity in Madagascar. This study will contribute to critical surveys of species richness for rapidly degrading habitats in this important biodiversity hotspot. Representatives from two empidoid families, Empididae and Hybotidae were collected from Madagascar. There are eight new species of Hybos (Hybotidae: Hybotinae) from Madagascar: H. gardneri sp. nov., H. flaviarticulus sp. nov., H. verykoukis sp. nov., H. fianarantsoensis sp. nov., H. exastis sp. nov., H. triangulus sp. nov., H. angustifacies sp. nov., and H. ignotopalpus sp. nov. All species are described and male genitalia are illustrated. DNA barcoding was performed on the flies from the subfamily Hybotinae in order to infer species limits, but due to poorly preserved or degraded DNA, no definitive conclusions could be drawn. To aid identification, eight new barcodes were obtained that will be submitted to the barcode library upon publication of the new species.

PourThru is a quick and easy nutrient sampling technique that is not laboratory oriented and can help prevent costly nutritional problems for greenhouse crop producers. Additionally, time domain reflectometry (TDR) was evaluated as an experimental tool to measure substrate moisture content, which may affect PourThru extraction. Time domain reflectometry is quick, non-destructive and has potential for use in automation of moisture content determination in greenhouse production. Previous PourThru research had focused on techniques for use on large nursery containers (&#8776; 3800 cm3) versus the smaller floriculture containers (&#8776; 1500 cm3) and no exact calibration of PourThru nutrient values to saturated media extract (SME) values, the current standard for nutrient testing, had been completed. Therefore, studies were implemented to examine the relationship of PourThru to SME, evaluate irrigation systems and timing effect on PourThru results as well as develop recommended influent and leachate volumes to ensure an unadulterated sample. Calibration curves were developed between PourThru and SME values and r2 values ranged from 0.91 to 0.99 for linear relationships. Irrigation systems did affect electrical conductivity (EC) values and alternative interpretive standard values were developed dependent upon irrigation system. Timing of the PourThru was important to ensure adequate leachate was collected for sample analysis and the amount of influent affected EC values and the amount of leachate collected. The use of TDR was effective in small containers (980.6 and 2177.5 cm3); however, care should be taken to match probe size to container size to ensure representative sampling. The largest limitation to TDR use was the bulk density of the substrate being analyzed. Approximately a 50 to 75% underestimation occurred when substrate bulk densities were below 1.2 g.cm-3, but material specific calibration improved TDR accuracy to within 4%.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10312002-105020/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical Modeling of Laminar and Turbulent Single-phase and Two-phase Flows in Straight and Helical Ducts</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Liping</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to investigate numerically the dynamics and heat transfer of laminar or turbulent flows in different media and complicated geometries, including the flow in a composite domain whose central portion is occupied by a clear fluid (turbulent flow) and whose peripheral portion is occupied by a fluid saturated porous medium (laminar flow); a laminar flow of a non-Newtonian fluid in a helical pipe; a laminar flow in a helical pipe filled with a fluid saturated porous medium; a two-phase laminar flow (non-Newtonian carrying fluid and solid particles) in a helical pipe. To model forced convection in a composite porous/fluid domain, the Brinkma-Forchheimer-extended Darcy equation is utilized for the porous region and a two-layer algebraic turbulence model is utilized for the flow in the central region. The effects of turbulence on velocity and temperature distributions as well as on the Nusselt number are analyzed. To investigate a fully developed laminar flow of a non-Newtonian fluid in a helical pipe, an orthogonal helical coordinate system is utilized and the Navier-Stokes and energy equations for the non-Newtonian fluid in this coordinate system are derived. The effects of the curvature and torsion of a helical pipe, the Dean number and Germano number on the velocities, secondary flow and heat transfer are presented. A full momentum equation for the flow in porous media that accounts for the Brinkman and Forchheimer extensions of the Darcy law as well as for the flow inertia is adopted to study the fully developed laminar flow in a helical pipe filled with a fluid saturated porous medium. The effects of the geometry of the helical pipe and the physical properties of the porous medium are investigated. Accounting for the flow inertia is shown to be important for predicting the secondary flow in a helical pipe. For 3D modeling of two-phase laminar flow in a helical pipe, the Eulerian approach is utilized for fluid flow and the Lagrangian approach is utilized for tracking particles. The interaction between the solid particles and the fluid that carries them is accounted for by a source term in the momentum equation for the fluid.

These responses range from secretion of toxins, antibiotics and complete physiological transformations leading to the development of highly resilient spores resistant to heat, sunlight, chemicals and drugs. Due to the constant flux in environmental conditions, bacteria spend most of its life in this critical period, the transition-state. Proteins involved in the activation of genes required for survival are called transition-state regulators, a novel family of DNA binding proteins. Two defining characteristics describe transition-state regulator proteins: 1.) ability to recognize a multitude of genes with no consensus sequence and 2.) sole decision making policy of the cell is controlled by this select group proteins to monitor and regulate hundreds of cellular pathways. Despite their vital and increasingly common role, there is a paucity of information. &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B. anthracis&lt;/i&gt; both possess transition-state regulators responsible for gene expression during transition from vegetative to post-exponential growth. This dissertation focuses on investigating the protein-DNA interactions of the transition state regulators, antibiotic resistance protein B (AbrB) and antibiotic resistance protein h (Abh) from &lt;i&gt;B. subtilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B. anthracis&lt;/i&gt; to develop a detailed general model describing recognition and interaction mechanisms. Biophysical characterization of AbrBN and AbhN show that multimerization plays an essential role in binding to DNA targets. High-resolution NMR structure analysis was carried out to refine the structure of AbrBN and to solve the structure of AbhN, both showing dimeric topologies. These studies employed a complementary mutagenesis, ESI-MS, NMR, as well as a multiple spectroscopic technique approach. The study concluded with a respectable model of AbrB?s, and transition state regulators in general, interaction with DNA. The unique ability to bind over 60 genes with no consensus sequence relies on conformational flexibility of both protein and DNA. Furthermore, the solution structure of the N-terminal domain of Abh provided the stature needed to declare the transition-state regulator family a unique and characterized DNA binding family.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10312004-072939/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biophysical dispersal dynamics of the blue crab in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina</field><field name="creator">Reyns, Nathalie Brigitte</field><field name="description">For many species such as the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, successful estuarine recruitment to juvenile nursery habitats is dependent on the biophysical processes experienced during dispersal of the early life stages. The goal of this study was to determine how blue crab primary (postlarval) and secondary (early juvenile) dispersal occurs within a predominately wind-driven estuary, Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA. We (1) characterized circulation patterns in Pamlico Sound during the fall blue crab recruitment months over two consecutive years using current meters (2) sampled during multiple 24 h periods to relate spatiotemporal water column distributions of postlarval and early juveniles blue crabs with circulation patterns, and used a hydrodynamic model to recreate dispersal trajectories from eastern (inlet) to western sound nursery habitats and (3) examined the environmental (wind, diel cycle, tidal phase) and biological (ontogenetic, density-dependent) factors that contribute to early juvenile blue crab secondary dispersal from near-inlet nursery habitats. During our study, surface currents responded synchronously to wind-forcing by generally flowing in the same direction as the wind. Particle-tracking simulations suggested that dispersal from Oregon and Hatteras Inlets to across-sound nursery habitats resulted from the combined use of tidal and wind-driven currents. Simulation results and observed crab distributions further indicated that Oregon Inlet was the primary supplier of postlarval blue crabs (dispersing in surface waters at night) throughout Pamlico Sound, as postlarvae ingressing through Hatteras Inlet were not retained within our study area. Furthermore, Oregon Inlet supplied early juvenile blue crabs (dispersing in bottom waters at night) to northwestern sound habitats, while crabs from Hatteras Inlet dispersed to mid- and eastern-sound regions. Results from our study in near-inlet settlement habitats confirmed the importance of tides to mediating dispersal partway into Pamlico Sound, as early juvenile blue crabs responded to increasing conspecific density in settlement habitats by using flood-tide transport near the inlets to rapidly leave these habitats. Based on our findings, we make recommendations regarding the prioritization of nursery habitats for conservation and fisheries management.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10312004-143755/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soft Computing Approaches to Routing and Wavelength Assignment in Wavelength-Routed Optical Networks</field><field name="creator">Lea, Djuana</field><field name="description">The routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem is essential for achieving efficient performance in wavelength-routed optical networks. For a network without wavelength conversion capabilities, the RWA problem consists of selecting an appropriate path and wavelength for each connection request while ensuring that paths that share common links are not assigned the same wavelength. The purpose of this research is to develop efficient adaptive methods for routing and wavelength assignment in wavelength-routed optical networks with dynamic traffic. The proposed methods utilize soft computing techniques including genetic algorithms, fuzzy control theory, simulated annealing, and tabu search. All four algorithms consider the current availability of network resources before making a routing decision. Simulations for each algorithm show that each method outperforms fixed and alternate routing strategies. The fuzzy-controlled algorithm achieved the lowest blocking rates and the shortest running times in most cases.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10312004-195203/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applications of canonical transformations and nontrivial vacuum solutions to flavor mixing and critical phenomena in quantum field theory</field><field name="creator">Mishchenko, Yuriy</field><field name="description">This dissertation deals with recent applications of Bogoliubov transformation to the phenomenology of quantum flavor mixing and to the study of critical phenomena in quantum field theories. The dissertation contains a brief review of canonical transformations, with a special emphasis on linear quantum canonical transformation (Bogoliubov transformation), as they appear in classical and quantum physics and their applications in superfluidity and low energy quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Then, the general quantum field theory of flavor mixing is introduced with Bogoliubov transformation, space-time conversion is considered and effects for phenomenology of flavor oscillations in time and space is presented. Furthermore, the Oscillator Representation Method, relevant to analysis of degrees-of-freedom rearrangement during phase transitions, is fully reviewed and illustrated. Nontrivial vacuum condensation, dynamical mass generation and duality are all incorporated as parts of this approach. Specific applications to phase transition in nonlinear sigma model and phi^4 scalar quantum field theory are presented and possibilities for further method improvement are considered. A new independent variational approach, method of Symmetric Decomposition Problem, is also fully introduced, illustrated and applied to the analysis of the ground state in a variant of nonlinear sigma model. In this method, the structure of the Fock space in terms of the expectation values of given quantum operators is found and used to reformulate and exactly solve variational problem for the ground state of the above mentioned quantum field theory.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10312004-202935/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SOIL BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES IN A LONG-TERM VEGETABLE MANAGEMENT STUDY</field><field name="creator">Overstreet, Laura Flint</field><field name="description">Agricultural management decisions that influence biological activity and diversity include tillage, fertilizer and pest-control inputs, and crop rotations. Our research objective was to characterize relationships between biological and physical properties resulting from long-term agricultural management decisions. A nine-year old factorially-designed field experiment was used to examine the effects of tillage (moldboard plow or strip-tillage), input (synthetic fertilizers and pesticides or inputs approved for organic certification programs), and crop rotation (continuous staked tomatoes or 3-year vegetable rotation) on a suite of biological and physical soil parameters. Biological measurements included microbial, nematode, and earthworm community composition, soil respiration and N mineralization potential, enzyme activity, and microbial biomass. Physical property measurements included aggregate stability, bulk density, and pore-size distribution. Biological properties generally responded to all treatment combinations, but tillage provided the strongest treatment effect in most cases. Compared to strip-tillage, tillage consistently yielded significantly lower values for the following biological measurements: total C and N, above-ground biomass, microbial biomass, enzyme activity, soil respiration, N mineralization, some nematode trophic groups, and earthworms. Compared with organic inputs, synthetic inputs consistently induced significantly lower values for the following biological measurements: microbial biomass, enzyme activity, some nematode trophic groups, and soil respiration. An examination of relationships between biological and physical parameters using redundancy analysis revealed that microporosity was the physical property that was most strongly correlated with most biological parameters. Soil organisms responded to our treatments in the following order: tillage &gt; input &gt; rotation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10312005-033217/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plan Recognition as Candidate Space Search</field><field name="creator">Kumaran, Vikram</field><field name="description">Effective human computer interaction is enhanced by a machine?s ability to make educated guesses about the intention of its user.

Each of three chapters involves exploration into a different signaling pathway important for migration downstream of chemoattractant stimulation through inhibition of a kinase or disruption of the function of an effector and examination of the effects on migration, adhesion, and actin reorganization in primary human or equine neutrophils. Chapter II examines the requirement for the signaling molecule p38 Mitogen Activated Kinase (MAPK) in equine neutrophil chemotaxis through use of the p38 specific inhibitor SB203580. SB203580 reduced LTB4- and PAF-induced migration and disrupted the ability of cells to polarize, but did not affect b2 integrin-dependent adhesion or surface b2 integrin expression. Chapter III is a comprehensive inquiry into the regulation of the phosphorylation of serine 157 of the cytoskeletal protein Vasodilator-stimulated Phosphoprotein (VASP). The rapid and transient phosphorylation of VASP serine 157 corresponded with F-actin levels in chemoattractant-stimulated human neutrophils. fMLF-induced serine 157 phosphorylation was abolished by pretreatment with the PKA inhibitor H89 and the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ22536. In contrast, fMLF-induced serine 157 phosphorylation was unaffected by PKC inhibitors, PKG inhibitors, and the CamKII inhibitor KN-62. Inhibition of adhesion did not alter fMLF-induced VASP phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. This study demonstrated that chemoattractant stimulation of human neutrophils induces a rapid and transient PKA-dependent and adhesion-independent VASP serine 157 phosphorylation. Chapter IV probed into the function of the actin binding protein and PKC substrate Myristoylated Alanine-Rich C-kinase Substrate (MARCKS) through utilization of a cell permeant peptide derived from the MARCKS myristoylated aminoterminus (MANS peptide). Treatment of isolated human neutrophils with 50 &#956;M MANS, but not a scrambled control peptide, significantly inhibited their migration and adhesion in response to fMLF, IL8, or LTB4. MANS significantly reduced F-actin content in neutrophils 30s after fMLF-induced polymerization, but did not alter the ability of cells to polarize, spread, or upregulate surface b2 integrin expression. These data provided evidence that MARCKS, via its myristoylated aminoterminus, is a key regulator of neutrophil migration and adhesion.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10312007-134315/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using Software Thread Integration with TinyOS</field><field name="creator">Purvis, Zane Dustin</field><field name="description">with peripherals such as radios, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), memory devices, and sensors.

In 2009, the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission is scheduled to launch as part of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Mars Exploration Program. To assure the safety of this mission, an understanding of the Martian atmosphere is necessary. This is the first mission that may determine the landing site based on weather conditions. As such, potential landing sites at Terby Crater, Melas Chasma, Gale Crater, and Nili Fossae Trough were studied. Due to limited observations of Mars, the Planetary Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) Mars general circulation model was used to represent the Martian atmosphere. Model validation was conducted against Viking Lander 1, Viking Lander 2, and Mars Pathfinder data and showed that the Planetary WRF model was able to reasonably represent the Martian atmosphere. This research is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on density, temperature, and wind profiles at each potential landing site. These profiles are used to determine the amount of variability engineers must account for in the spacecraft design specifications. All profile deviations were within the MSL design specifications. The largest deviations occurred at Terby Crater while the smallest deviations occurred at Nili Fossae Trough. It appears that the large topographic features of Hellas Basin and Valles Marineris affect the local airflow patterns around Terby Crater and Melas Chasma. The second part focuses on these topographically-forced atmospheric perturbations using two of the largest features on Mars, Hellas Basin and Olympus Mons. Vertically propagating waves were generated over Olympus Mons during the night, while a strong daytime convective boundary layer and diabatic heating plume occurred during the day. Hellas Basin was dominated by cyclonic motion throughout the night and vertically propagating waves along the western edge of the basin during the day. In general, the Planetary WRF model compared to conventional mountain wave theory and was able to model topographic disturbances with coarse resolution. Limitations of the model are discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10312007-172343/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of Biological and Other Novel Seed Treatments for Organic Peanut Production</field><field name="creator">Ruark, Sarah Johnson</field><field name="description">Poor stands are a constraint on organic peanut production because stand losses of 50% or more are possible with untreated seed. Biological, other novel seed treatments, and soil amendments were tested for efficacy against pre- and post-emergence damping-off in greenhouse, microplot, and field plot trials. Seed of the lines Perry, GP-NC 343, and N03081T were utilized in all trials. Nine treatments were tested in natural soil in the greenhouse. Treatments included Bacillus subtilis (Kodiak), B. pumilus (Yield Shield), Trichoderma harzianum (T-22 PB and Plantshield HC), Muscodor albus, Coniothyrium minitans (Contans), activated charcoal, two separate soil amendments of dried herbage of Monarda didyma cultivars, a commercial fungicide check (Vitavax PC), and an untreated control. Vitavax PC and Kodiak were the only seed treatments with higher percentage emergence and survival than untreated seed. A separate greenhouse experiment was conducted for seed treatments using natural soil or soil infested with field isolates of Aspergillus niger. Seed were treated with Kodiak, copper hydroxide (Champion), Plantshield HC, Kodiak and Plantshield HC combined, Streptomyces griseoviridis (Mycostop), hot water, Vitavax PC, or were left untreated. Seedling emergence and survival was much lower in inoculated versus uninoculated plots. In all plots, treatment with Kodiak increased percentage emergence and survival compared to untreated seed, but was not as effective as Vitavax PC. In uninfested plots, treatment with Champion also increased emergence and survival compared to the untreated check. Field microplot studies in Clayton, NC evaluated seed treated with Kodiak, T. harzianum, activated charcoal, Vitavax PC, or untreated seed on the three peanut lines following wheat, oat, or triticale cover crops, soil amendment with M. albus, or no cover as a control. In both years, the percentage emergence and survival was highest for Perry seeds treated with Vitavax PC. Cover crops did not affect emergence, but M. albus treatment suppressed emergence. In field studies at Lewiston, NC, the three peanut lines were treated with M. albus, Kodiak, T. harzianum, or were untreated. In the 2007 trial, none of the treatments improved stands compared to the untreated check. In 2008, the highest stand counts were produced by seed treated with Kodiak. In both years, the largest stands were N03081T. The most commonly observed pathogen was A. niger. Confounding effects of seed line and seed source prevent assessment of performance from individual cultivars. However, regardless of seed line, in most trials Kodiak seed treatment consistently increased emergence and survival over untreated seed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10312008-133746/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and Analytical Investigation of an Innovative Composite Shallow Floor Framing System</field><field name="creator">Willis, Meade Hanes</field><field name="description">Since the early 1950&#226;s, composite concrete-steel systems have been a popular and economic choice for floor construction in the United States. The conventional composite floor system comprised of a concrete slab with light gauge steel deck form supported by wide flange structural steel girders has been widely used in construction. In recent years, modifications to the conventional system have been made to meet a market need for floor systems with reduced structural depth to be used in a variety of building types including office buildings, hotels, and hospitals. In 2007, Diversakore&#194;&#174; LLC developed the Versa :T:TM beam, an innovative shallow floor composite framing system that utilizes a small structural depth and also makes improvements in the ease and speed of construction. The system includes a u-shaped steel plate which supports hollow core plank flooring during construction and serves as a stay-in-place form for a cast-in-place reinforced concrete girder. The concrete girder is cast monolithically with a topping slab to engage the hollow core planks and the u-shaped steel section into a composite t-beam. A research program to evaluate the performance of this innovative floor system has been developed and is currently ongoing at the Constructed Facilities Laboratory at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC. The experimental and analytical program includes full-scale tests of representative sub-assemblages and utilizes a layered sectional analysis to predict the behavior. The results of the analytical model and the experimental investigation are presented along with conclusions drawn from the initial phase of the research program.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-10312009-143857/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE EFFECT OF ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE PLASMA TREATMENTS ON INTERFACIAL BONDING STRENGTH OF ULTRAHIGH MODULUS POLYETHYLENE FIBERS TO EPOXY RESIN</field><field name="creator">Jensen, Christina Louise</field><field name="description">The surface modification of UHMPE fibers by atmospheric pressure plasma treatments was examined. In one study the aging effects of atmospheric plasma treatments were studied. UHMPE fibers were treated for 0.5 and 1 min with He/O2/air gas and for 2 and 4 min with He/air gas by atmospheric pressure plasma on a capacitively coupled device. The samples were tested for fiber/epoxy interfacial shear strength using the microbond technique at time intervals of 0, 3, 15 and 30 days after initial plasma treatment. Interfacial shear strengths (IFSS) for plasma treated fibers were 2 - 3 times as high as that of the control. The IFSS for the plasma treated fibers remained constant up to 15 days and then decreased afterwards. XPS Analysis and SEM photographs characterized the fiber surface modification. In a second study, delamination phenomena was studied by the transverse compression of seven-fiber bundle UHMPE microcomposites, a peeling test of laminated plain weave UHMPE fabric and tensile shear strength testing of a ten-layer plain weave UHMPE / Epoxy flat panel composite. Results showed a 49% increase in yield modulus of the plasma treated sample compared to the control in the transverse compression test. There was an 82.5% increase in bonding strength for the plasma treated sample during the peel test and a 25.7% increase in interlaminar shear strength of the ten-ply UHMPE composite proving that atmospheric plasma treatments are very effective in surface modification on a microscopic fiber level and a full-scale composite production level.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11012002-080351/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prevalence and Antibiotic Resistance of Campylobacter in Mature Cattle at Harvest</field><field name="creator">Gharst, Greg</field><field name="description">Campylobacter is considered to be a leading bacterial cause of acute enteritis in the United States. Campylobacter is found in the fecal material and the gastrointestinal tract of a broad range of animals. It has been suggested that the greatest cause of human infection is cross-contamination and/or the consumption of undercooked meat and poultry products. In the United States there are limited data on the presence of Campylobacter in cattle. This study investigated the prevalence of Campylobacter (C. jejuni and C. coli) as well as the presence of antibiotic resistant strains in mature cattle at slaughter. Representative fecal samples (n = 610) of the day&#161;&#175;s harvest were taken from the colon of mature cattle older than 30 months of age, over a period of 17 months. Species of Campylobacter isolates were determined by polymerase chain reaction. Pure cultures of Campylobacter were obtained from 143 of the 610 samples (23.4%, SE 1.7%). Of the confirmed Campylobacter-positive samples, the majority (93.0%) yielded C. jejuni, with C. coli recovered from the rest (7.0%). Seasonal data showed that Campylobacter prevalence is somewhat greater during the winter (29.4%) as compared to summer months (20.7%) (P &#161;&#220; 0.05). Some of the isolates were resistant to selected antibiotics, with the greatest incidence being resistance to ampicillin (49.7%). The data imply that there may be a human health risk from the colonization of mature cattle at harvest by Campylobacter. Further research needs to be done to evaluate the food safety impact of Campylobacter colonization of cattle.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11012004-082702/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proactive Mediation in Plan-Based Narrative Environments</field><field name="creator">Harris, Justin Tucker</field><field name="description">In interactive plan-based narrative environments, user's actions must be monitored to ensure that conditions necessary for the execution of narrative plans are not compromised. In the Zocalo system, management of user actions is performed on a reactionary basis by a process called mediation. In this thesis, an extension to this approach, proactive mediation, is described, which calculates responses to user input in an anticipatory manner. A proactive mediation module accepts as input a plan describing the actions being performed by the user (generated by a plan recognition system) and identifies portions of that plan that jeopardize the causal structure of the overall narrative. Once these portions are identified, proactive mediation generates modifications to the narrative plan structure that avoid the unwanted interaction between user and story. This extension to the original mediation algorithm provides more responses to a user's actions and generates responses that are more tailored to the user's actions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11012005-075353/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationship between Ethnicity, SES, and Education on Parental Beliefs of Manipulation, Contempt, and Privacy</field><field name="creator">Beale, Karen Sue</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to assess whether parental emotion beliefs include the dimensions of manipulation, contempt, and privacy and to examine the degree to which ethnic differences exist for those dimensions. Because reported ethnic differences are often due to other variables such as socio-economic status, individual as well as combined contributions of ethnicity, occupational status, and education are assessed in their relation to parental emotion beliefs. Participants included 1,108 African American, European American, and Lumbee American Indian parents of at least one child 4- to 10-years of age. Parents? beliefs about children?s use of emotion as manipulation, parents? expression of contempt toward their children, and children?s need for emotional privacy did emerge as distinct belief sets and ethnic differences were found. Although education did account for significant amounts of variance in parental beliefs and accounted for the ethnic difference between African American and European American parents for Manipulation, ethnicity was typically a significant predictor above and beyond what could be accounted for by the other predictors. This indicates that there is something unique to ethnicity such as a common set of values, beliefs, or behaviors. Additionally, the largest amounts of variance were overlapping in the three predictor variables, suggesting that ethnicity, occupational status, and education cannot be thought of separately when investigating psychological variables such as emotional beliefs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11012006-035058/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ad-hoc Wireless Routing for Wildlife Tracking with Environmental Power Constraint</field><field name="creator">McClusky, Douglas</field><field name="description">The purpose of this paper is to suggest an algorithm by which mica motes can organize themselves into a network to relay packets as quickly as possible under energy constraints from environmental harvesting.

Since these obsessions act as motivating forces compelling Kafka?s writing, it is crucial to understand the constitutive nature of the repetition compulsion in Kafka?s texts by examining its presence in two of his prominent works, ?The Judgment? and The Trial. I will begin this study by first establishing my theoretical framework, defining the compulsion to repeat and the death instinct as they function in Freud?s psychoanalytic theory. Next I will differentiate Lacan?s (re)formulation of the repetition compulsion and the death instinct and show the critical role the symbolic order qua language has in this conception. Following this, I will examine Kafka?s story, ?The Judgment,? looking at a typical piece of psychoanalytic criticism focused on Kafka?s supposed Oedipus complex and then showing the pitfalls of such an approach. I will go on to show the possibilities for deeper readings offered by post-Freudian psychoanalytic concepts, focusing on the repetitive and constitutive role that the letter has for the subject, the function of the return of the repressed, and the significance of the space ?between two deaths,? where the story ends. The next section will examine The Trial in a similar manner; the focus will be on the importance of language in the novel, including the court as an agency of language and also the role lying or deceit plays in signification.

Among the most disruptive groups of invasive species are ants. Invasive ants have caused losses in biodiversity among a wide range of taxa, including birds, mammals, lizards, but especially towards ground nesting arthropods such as native ants. Why native ants are so susceptible to invasion and how invasive ants are able to sustain massive population growth remain unclear. It has been suggested that invasive ants utilize carbohydrate resources from hemipteran exudates to fuel aggressive foraging and colony expansion. Perhaps invasive ants are simply more proficient at usurping these resources, maintaining higher hemipteran populations, etc. Our work uses a model invasive, the Argentine ant, , Linepithema humile, and a native ant Tapinoma sessile to quantify hemipteran tending ability and competition. Through a series of laboratory and field experiments we were able to quantify 1) carbohydrate sequestering performance, 2) the effect either ant species had on hemipteran population growth rates in a predator-free space, 3) the defense ability of either ant against hemipteran predators and parasitoids, and 4) the proportion of invasive ants required to displace a native colony from a hemipteran resource. Neither ant demonstrated a better ability to sequester liquid resources; however recruitment strategies were much different. Hemipteran populations in the presence of L. humile grew larger in a predator free environment and populations exposed to predators were better defended by L. humile than T. sessile. L. humile was able to displace T. sessile from a nest site without having a majority of worker ants. Aggression of either ant species was significantly reduced without hemipterans present. Understanding factors that drive invasive species can give us insight into native areas that may be susceptible for invasion, how potential mutualist populations might respond and possibly provide us with an avenue for secondary control measures given the economic and ecological importance of invasive species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11012008-082656/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Inelastic Analysis Methodology for Bonded Joints with Shear Deformable, Anisotropic Adherends</field><field name="creator">Smeltzer, Stanley S. III</field><field name="description">The development of a one-dimensional analysis method for evaluating adhesively bonded joints composed of anisotropic adherends and adhesives that exhibit nonlinear material behavior is presented. The strain and resulting stress fields in a general, bonded joint overlap are determined by using a variable-step, finite-difference solution algorithm to iteratively solve a system of first-order differential equations. Applied loading is given as a system of combined extensional, bending, and shear loads that are applied to the edge of the joint overlap. Adherends are assumed to behave as linear, cylindrically-bent plates using classical laminated plate theory that includes the effects of first-order transverse shear deformation. This provides a capability for modeling differences in the transverse shear modulus between each adherend. Using a total plasticity theory and a modified von-Mises yield criterion, inelastic material behavior is modeled in the adhesive layer. Results for the proposed method are verified using the single-lap joint geometry against previous results from the literature and shown to be in excellent agreement. Convergence of the strain and stress fields determined using the finite-difference solver are described as a function of the number of evaluation points along the length of the joint. Additionally, design studies using the single-lap joint are presented that investigate the effects of changes to the joint overlap, adherend thickness, laminate stacking sequence of the adherend, adherend material properties, and adhesive material properties. Results from the design studies established a nonlinear relationship between changes in the bending and axial stiffness of the adherends due to laminate ply manipulations and a reduction in the inelastic adhesive strain and shear stress responses. Additionally, analyses performed on the bonded joint models that had a difference in the transverse shear stiffness between the upper and lower adherends displayed a minimal effect on the adhesive strain and stress responses.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11022003-233940/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive, Collegiate, and Demographic Predictors of Success in Graduate Physical Therapy Education</field><field name="creator">Andrews, A. Williams</field><field name="description">Success in healthcare education, as defined by timely completion of the academic program, has consequences for individual students, academic institutions, and society. One purpose of this study was to quantify attrition in the physical therapy program at Elon University. The attrition rate in the physical therapy program at Elon University for students admitted between 1998 and 2002 (n = 198) was 10%, including those whose graduation was either delayed or denied. Most causes of attrition were for academic difficulties. This attrition rate is higher than the attrition rate in other physical therapy programs but it is lower than the attrition rates for most nursing and medical programs. The primary purpose of this research was to identify cognitive, collegiate, and demographic predictors of attrition in physical therapy education for students at Elon University. Predictors were chosen based on Tinto?s model of doctoral persistence. Cognitive predictors addressed in this study were undergraduate GPA, Math GRE, and Verbal GRE. The collegiate predictor chosen was undergraduate institution quality as denoted by average SAT score for entering students at the undergraduate institution. Demographic predictors studied included age, race, and gender. The model including all of these predictors was not significant in predicting attrition. However, once those who experienced attrition for personal reasons were deleted from the data set, the model was able to significantly predict attrition (likelihood ratio = 15.876; p = 0.044). Two of the predictor variables, undergraduate GPA (odds ratio = 0.040) and average SAT score for the undergraduate institution (odds ratio = 0.990), were independent, significant predictors of attrition. The admissions committee in the physical therapy program at Elon University should continue to emphasize the cognitive predictors when making admissions decisions. In addition, admissions committee members should begin to consider of the quality of the applicant?s alma mater. These results need to be replicated in other physical therapy programs before the results of this study can be generalized more broadly.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult and Community College Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11022004-164736/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Empirical Study Comparing the Effect of Feedback, Training, and Executive Coaching on Leadership Behavior Change</field><field name="creator">Saling, Nona E.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to examine the differences in leadership behavior change of participants in feedback only (A), feedback and training (B), and feedback, training, and coaching (C) groups. Participants were 101 managers, supervisors, and team leaders from businesses and nonprofit organizations in the United States. Participants received 360-degree feedback twice, based on a 28-item feedback survey. Pre-test and post-test responses were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis, resulting in two factors: relationship (14 items) and task (7 items). Seven items were discarded from further analysis. These were analyzed separately in all statistical tests of difference. There were no significant differences between the change in relationship or task factor scores over time as measured by the interaction effect of group and test, when adjusted for the covariates of time and participant age. For the task factor, tests for effects of slices found highly significant differences in both pre-test and post-test scores. Tests of pre-test scores on the task factor showed a significant difference between the feedback only (A) group and the feedback, training, and coaching (C) group. Tests of post-test scores showed a trend toward a significant difference between the feedback only (A) group and the feedback and training (B) group. Preexisting differences among the training, feedback, and coaching (C) group on the task factor may have accounted for the differences found. Based on prior research, this group may be more at risk for derailment than the other two groups. Further research using exploratory factor analysis to identify the actual factors present in 360-degree feedback is recommended. Tests for differences between pre-tests and post-tests within each of the three groups showed trends that should be replicated in future research. Due to the small sample size of the study, results need to be interpreted with caution.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult and Community College Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11022005-085114/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of percutaneous malathion absorption in anurans</field><field name="creator">Willens, Scott</field><field name="description">The objective of this research was to characterize the percutaneous absorption of the organophosphorous pesticide, malathion, across the skin of bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) and marine toads (Bufo marinus) using in vitro models. An established mammalian model for percutaneous absorption, the two-compartment Teflon flow-through diffusion cell assay, was adapted to anuran skin to examine species and anatomical site differences in absorption and partitioning of C&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;-radiolabeled malathion. Malathion absorption was greater across the ventral skin compared to dorsal skin in both bullfrogs and marine toads but did not differ significantly between species. The issue of short-term storage and viability of anuran skin for diffusion cells was examined using glycerol preservation and cryopreservation techniques. Bullfrog skin viability was retained for 28 days, while marine toad skin viability significantly decreased after 7-10 days. A novel in vitro model, the harvested perfused anuran limb (HPAPL) preparation, which maintained an intact microvasculature to the skin, was developed. The HPAPL represented an improvement over diffusion cells by retaining the anatomic and physiologic integrity of the skin. Doppler ultrasound was used to determine the perfusion rate for the HPAPL by measuring the physiologic blood flow of the pelvic limb in vivo. In addition to the characterization of the percutaneous absorption of malation in anurans, effects of sublethal doses on brain acetyl cholinesterase activity in bullfrogs and marine toads, were examined using a modified Ellman spectrophotometric technique. Sensitivity to environmental toxins make anurans potentially important animal models for studying the impacts of organophosphorous insecticide contamination of the environment.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11022005-110637/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical and structural characterizations of juvenile wood, mature wood, and compression wood of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda)</field><field name="creator">YEH, TING-FENG</field><field name="description">In an effort to comprehensively study the wood property variation in juvenile wood, compression wood, and mature wood, and also to provide a rapid and cost-effective assessment tool to screening the wood chemical property variation, several loblolly pines (Pinus tadea), and transmittance near infrared spectroscopy were utilized in this study. The method development results show that a successful screening of wood chemical property variation, such as lignin and &#225;-cellulose contents, could be adapted using stacked wood wafers microtomed from increment cores and combining with transmittance near infrared spectroscopy. The morphological, chemical, and metabolic analyses of juvenile wood and compression wood show that although compression wood and juvenile wood share some properties, they are actually distinct in their chemistry during development and in final wood chemistry and anatomy. The within tree variation analyses also show that juvenile wood from the top of the tree and that from the base of the tree are more different in morphological structures than in chemical structures. A similar pattern was found between juvenile wood and mature wood.

PET films were subjected to helium and helium/oxygen gas plasmas. The contact angle of the treated films decreased due to plasma etching and possible scission indicating that the surfaces become more hydrophilic. Atomic force microscopy results had a large standard error, however the surface visually showed changes in surface micro and nanoscale roughness corresponding to treatment duration. Keratinocytes were plated on the day of plasma treatment and two and five days after plasma treatment and tested half a day, one, two, three, and six days after plating. The same methodology of plating and testing was also applied to hepatocytes. Cell growth, proliferation, and adhesion were characterized via a fluorescent probe based assay and were correlated with surface chemical and nanostructural features. Both the helium and helium/oxygen plasma-treated PET had little or no effect on cell behavior for both keratinocytes and hepatocytes. The nanoscale surface changes due to the plasma surface treatment are believed to be masked by the protein adherence in the media on the surface of the PET.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11022005-223628/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of temperature and forage availability on growth and habitat selection of a pelagic piscivore</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Jessica Suzanne</field><field name="description">Habitat characteristics influencing growth of fishes often affect habitat selection because behaviors leading to rapid growth are under selective pressure. For pelagic piscivores such as striped bass Morone saxatilis stocked into southern reservoirs, temperature and prey density will likely be the most important factors influencing growth and spatial distribution. The traditional paradigm used to understand reservoir striped bass has focused on unsuitable physical conditions that may develop during summer stratification when hypolimnetic hypoxia forces fish into warm epilimnetic water. This study investigates how forage availability modifies the effects of physical conditions on this species. Striped bass in Badin Lake, NC, tagged with temperature-sensing transmitters tolerated temperatures above 27 degrees Celcius for two months to avoid hypolimnetic hypoxia but still displayed rapid growth. Bioenergetics models showed that high consumption rates allowed these fish to allocate energy to growth even during the summer and to grow rapidly during the fall as temperatures cooled. In contrast, striped bass in Lake Norman, NC, had slower growth despite experiencing warm summer temperatures for two to four weeks less. Lake Norman striped bass had lower consumption rates, and bioenergetics model simulations in which habitat conditions were exchanged between the reservoirs indicated that differences in forage availability had a greater relative effect on growth of striped bass than differences in thermal regime. These results suggest that criteria for determining the suitability of reservoirs for striped bass should incorporate a measure of prey availability. As with growth, habitat selection of Badin Lake striped bass was not solely dependent on temperature. Growth rate potential (the rate of growth of a predator occupying a particular location characterized by temperature and forage fish density) provided a better explanation of the spatial distribution of striped bass than did temperature or forage fish density alone. These results suggest growth rate potential can help us understand how fish integrate information on temperature and forage fish density, but it is important to note that growth rate potential was not a perfect predictor of the spatial distribution of striped bass so we cannot assume fish will optimize their patch choice with respect to this variable under all circumstances.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11022006-122130/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Automated Decision Aid Reliability and Algorithm Modality on Reported Trust and Task Performance</field><field name="creator">Oduor, Kenya Freeman</field><field name="description">As IT systems grow more complex and become more prevalent, understanding the collaborative nature of the relationship between humans and automation becomes more important. Several factors influence the human-automation relationship. Research has shown that trust and perceived reliability are key factors in whether a relationship will develop between humans and automation. Presenting automation reliability and automation algorithms are ways to potentially improve this relationship. To explore this question, an experiment was conducted in which an automated decision aid presented suggestions to participants while they managed a simulated city (i.e., Policity). The goal was to maximize the health of the city?s population by adding hospitals, housing, businesses, and other facilities and services. Participants were assigned to conditions where the automated decision aid performed with high or low reliability levels. Based on condition, the decision aid?s algorithm was presented to participants in a textual or graphical (diagrammatic) format. Results showed that users? perception of the decision aid?s reliability directly influenced their trust in the decision aid. Results also showed that presenting the decision aid?s algorithm, regardless of modality (i.e., textual or graphical) had a direct impact on reported trust. Both had a direct effect on human performance.

Furthermore, the most frequently used method for measuring performance is a supervisory rating. Given the prevalence of this method, it is crucial to understand the factors which influence rater behaviors. Recent research has indicated that a large portion of the variance in ratings is idiosyncratic to the rater (Scullen, Mount, &amp; Goff, 2000). However, the nature of this idiosyncratic variance remains unclear. Previous models of appraisal have focused on either the cognitive processes involved, or more recently, the appraisal context. Although this recent focus on contextual issues has shown promise, the extent to which raters are influenced by the context in which they work is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to contribute to our understanding of supervisory ratings by incorporating a multilevel analytic approach in order to partition the variance between raters from the variance between contexts. This approach allowed for the investigation of several rater and context-level characteristics, in attempt to explain the variance associated with these two sources. More specifically, a conceptual model was proposed in order to examine rater-level variables including rater tendencies for leniency and halo, along with rater opportunities to observe performance. Contextual factors proposed for study included norms for leniency and halo, opportunities to observe performance at the context-level, and the nature of work/activity itself within various contexts. Moreover, this research incorporated a multidimensional performance criterion, in order to provide a more thorough investigation of the relationships of interest here. Results suggested that the rating context accounted for significant variance in both task and citizenship performance ratings. Furthermore, the rater tendency for leniency explained significant between-rater variation in both criteria. The rater tendency for halo was also significant, however this finding did not recur when analyzing a replication sample of data. At the context-level, the norm for leniency consistently predicted variance in citizenship performance, but was only a significant predictor of task performance in one sample. Finally, although these relationships were not consistent across samples, the nature of work/activity and the contextual norm for halo explained significant between-context variation in citizenship performance ratings. The interpretation and implications of these results are discussed, along with limitations of this research and suggestions for future research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11022006-194219/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CD4+CD25+ REGULATORY T CELLS ARE INFECTED AND ACTIVATED PHENOTYPICALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY DURING ACUTE INFECTION WITH FELINE IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS.</field><field name="creator">Mexas, Angela Marie</field><field name="description">HIV-induced AIDS may be mediated by the activation of immunosuppressive CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells (Tregs). Tregs have been shown to regulate CD4+ and CD8+ immune responses to HIV and FIV antigens in vitro. We tested the hypothesis that Tregs become infected and activated during the acute stage of FIV infection leading to the suppression of CD4+ T helper cell responses. Cats were experimentally infected with FIV-NCSU-1 and blood and lymph node biopsies were collected at 1 week intervals following inoculation. Real-Time PCR was used to determine plasma viremia and relative number of FIV copies in CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD25- T cell subsets. Flow cytometry was used to assess the absolute numbers of each cell type and the expression of activation markers. Real-time RT-PCR was also used to assess relative increases in FoxP3 and TGF-&#61538; mRNA levels over time. Treg suppression of IL-2 production in CD4+ T helper cells was assessed by ELISPOT assays and inhibition of cellular proliferation was assessed by incorporation of tritiated thymidine and CFSE. Our results show that peak viremia levels correlate with maximal infectivity in lymph node CD4+CD25+ populations. FIV-gag-mRNA levels are higher in CD4+CD25+ T cells than CD4+CD25- lymph node T cells. Activation of FoxP3 and increased expression of TGF&#61538;1 in CD4+CD25+ cells correlates with peak plasma viremia and FIV-gag-mRNA levels in CD4+CD25+ T cells. Regulatory function can be detected in CD4+CD25+ T cells during the acute phase of FIV infection. Our findings support the hypothesis that early activation of immunosuppressor function in Treg cells may limit an effective anti-FIV response contributing to the establishment of the chronic infection and the immunodeficiency caused by this virus.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11022007-103144/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of the Advantages of Using a Tether Ballast Mass as Part of the Control System in a Solar Sail Based Solar Storm Warning Mission</field><field name="creator">Hays, Scott</field><field name="description">The objective of the thesis is to analyze the dynamics and controls of a solar sail operating on a Solar Storm Warning Mission. The Solar Storm Warning Mission was chosen for analysis because it has a high priority mission to provide data on solar storm activity. Solar storms can cause blackouts in power grids and disable satellites that are currently orbiting the Earth. A payload extends from the sailcraft by four tethers attached near the ends of the booms to provide stability. The tether length that produced a stable sailcraft was equal to or greater than 84.31 meters. A parametric study was completed to examine the effects of the roll, pitch, and yaw disturbances on the sailcraft dynamics. The roll and pitch coupling (in the equations of motion) had a large effect on the sailcraft using short tether lengths, but had a much smaller effect at the longer tether lengths of 84.31 meters or more. Thrusters were placed at the ends of the sail booms to provide dampening to the sailcraft. Full-state feedback (pole placement) provided settling times and number of maneuvers for each specific thruster/tether length combination. If the disturbances (roll, pitch, and yaw) expected to impact the sailcraft are known, an ideal tether length can be found as a function of the settling time and number of maneuvers. For example, the 125 mN thruster requires a tether length of approximately 250 meters to provide the most maneuvers for any disturbance of less than twenty degrees.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11022007-150449/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of the dimer interface in the folding and assembly of procaspase-3.</field><field name="creator">MacKenzie, Sarah Helen</field><field name="description">Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that are intimately involved in apoptosis and exist in the cell as inactive zymogens prior to activation. Initiator procaspases are monomers that must dimerize for activation. Executioner procaspases, such as procaspase-3, are dimers that must be processed for activation. The chemical properties of the dimer interface are different between the two subfamilies of caspases but their structures are similar, suggesting that the interface region is important for regulation. The goal of the studies presented here is to determine the importance of the dimer interface in folding and assembly of procaspase-3. A histidine mutation was introduced into the dimer interface region, which completely abolished the activity of mature caspase-3. Equilibrium and kinetic folding studies were performed to elucidate how a mutation in the dimer interface prevents substrate turnover in the active site when the distance between the two regions is 20&#195;. The folding studies presented here coupled with the crystal structure show that the protein is entering a kinetic trap prior to dimerization because the histidine has to adopt an unusual rotomer to pack into a region that normally accommodates a much smaller valine residue. A hysteresis was observed by equilibrium folding studies, presumably because the time it takes to refold is different that the time it takes to unfold due to the limited conformational freedom of the histidine residues. Additionally, the hysteresis is observed to be concentration dependent suggesting that the histidine residue makes the activation mechanism of procaspase-3 more like initiator caspases that require a large local concentration of protein to promote dimerization. Kinetic refolding studies showed that the procaspase-3 monomer is becoming trapped in a conformation that is unstable and prone to aggregation prior to forming a dimerization competent species. The crystal structure of caspase-3 (V266H) revealed two separate pathways of inhibition starting from the dimer interface and culminating in the active site that could be responsible for the lack of activity in this mutant. These data, taken together, suggest that the dimer interface is a region that can be used to allosterically inhibit procaspase-3 because it is important for regulation of the enzyme. This is important because it could be used as a drug target for diseases that have too much cell death, such as neurodegenerative disorders.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11022009-143108/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the Process of Civic Engagement: A Phenomenological Case Study</field><field name="creator">Reno, Deborah L.</field><field name="description">Research expresses the need for society to develop ways that encourage civic responsibility.

Nearly 700,000 people suffered from stroke last year and two thirds of them survived but were left with any number of disabilities, one such disability is upper extremity hemiplegia. If the hand and arm doesn?t have therapy immediately after stroke, it will lose it power and muscle control, resulting in a claw like appearance and loss of function. Activities of the patient daily living will be significantly effected. Current therapy on the affected limb in the hospital is expensive and difficult to manage due to the limited amount of resources compared to the number of patients. We introduce a pneumatic actuated wearable hand and forearm device in this thesis. It is designed according to the hand and arm kinematics. It can help the patients keep power on each finger and help maintain the coordination of different fingers to achieve daily living movements. It consists of forearm brace, rehabilitation glove and artificial muscles. The custom made artificial muscles also known as McKibben Artificial Muscles are used in antagonistic pairs to control the fingers flexion and extension. The rehabilitation device is small, lightweight, home-based, and has large force capabilities. It is also affordable to the patients due to the specially designed low-cost artificial muscles. The rehabilitation device was controlled by solenoid valves in conjunction with a Mitsubishi M32/83C 16-bit micro controller. Experiments on the pneumatic elbow brace have shown that it is capable of moving each finger from full extension to flexion, to perform actions like pinching and allows the coordinated movement of two fingers.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11032003-115737/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene Expression Profiling in Surrogate Tissues to Identify Biomarkers Following Conazole Exposure</field><field name="creator">Murrell, Rachel N.</field><field name="description">Conazoles are a class of azole fungicides which are used for agricultural and pharmaceutical applications.

Due to concerns about declining fishery stocks and habitat degradation, it is critical that the value of different habitats be evaluated, so that areas that are most important can be prioritized for habitat conservation and restoration. This dissertation used Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus) as a model species to quantitatively examine patterns of early juvenile nursery habitat use, factors influencing growth and mortality, and to test the widely held assumption that ?growth is a valid indicator of habitat quality?. A unique aspect of this study was consideration of how growth and survival of juvenile Atlantic croaker were influenced by the joint effects of individual (larval and juvenile growth) and cohort (density-dependent) characteristics, as well as biotic and abiotic characteristics of the nursery. Late-larval and early juvenile Atlantic croaker were collected weekly, using a 1-m beam trawl in river, upper-estuary, and creek habitats of two estuaries (White Oak River estuary and Newport River estuary, North Carolina, USA), sampled during two seasons (fall and spring) of two recruitment years (2001-2002 and 2002-2003). Subsequent analysis of otolith microstructure was used to provide estimates of growth rates, population age structure, and mortality. Juvenile Atlantic croaker were most abundant in oligohaline river nursery areas (primary nursery area), with the upper-estuary serving as an important ?refuge? habitat following periods of high freshwater outflow that forced fish down-estuary. In addition to management implications (i.e., time and area closures of shrimp trawling), such flood events have important implications for growth-based assessment of habitat quality: A positive covariance between larval and juvenile growth was found only after periods in which croaker were displaced from river nursery areas, when food was apparently in short supply. Atlantic croaker cohorts from both estuaries also exhibited evidence for selective mortality favoring survival of individuals that were faster growing as larvae and early juveniles, as well as evidence for density-dependent growth (i.e., slower average cohort growth rates at higher conspecific density). The results of this study indicate that growth is not a robust indicator of habitat quality. Unless factors such as previous environmental history, density-dependence, and selective mortality are accounted for, growth-based assessment of habitat quality may reach incorrect conclusions regarding the value of different habitats.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11032005-100512/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sexual Risk Behavior in College Students: Does the parent-college student relationship impact students? condom use?</field><field name="creator">Guin, Autumn Hope</field><field name="description">College students are at high risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS due to the high frequency of unprotected sexual activity (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2003). Condom use research among college aged youth has primarily concentrated on individual decision making processes with some recent focus on the impact of peer norms. To further understand college students? choices regarding sexual risk behavior, the current research examines the influence of the parent-college student relationship on college students? decisions about condom use. Building on previous research in sexual risk and alcohol use literature, the current study examines the role of parent-young adult relationship variables (i.e. facilitation of independence, and affective quality) on condom use. Parental influence has been an important predictor in other areas of college student life but has not been examined in the college student sexual risk literature.

The interaction of polymeric and crystalline structure in cellulose bio-based materials is of high technological importance. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanism of environmental/material interactions is crucial for engineering products from bio-based materials. This study was undertaken in an effort to develop a technique for the assessment of dimensional stability of cellulose microfibrils as a function of different relative humidity. Analysis of atomic force microscopy images showed that the local dimensional properties of cellulose microfibrils are highly responsive to variable relative humidity, and their hygro-expansive behavior depends on the relative humidity history, and their method of preparation. The results obtained suggested that dimensional and hygro-expansive behaviors of cellulose microfibrils are related to their ultra-structural arrangements and their origin, either directly or indirectly. These findings, hopefully, will prompt an open discussion regarding the dynamic interactions between cellulose and water molecules at a nano-scale.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wood and Paper Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11032006-120008/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analysis of Climatic and Economic Conditions Affecting Tourism in the Coastal Region of North Carolina</field><field name="creator">Carr, Jessica Leigh</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to investigate selected climatic and economic conditions affecting tourism in the Coastal Region of North Carolina by using multiple regression analysis and comparing multiple models to determine the best fitting model(s). The research expands on current quantitative data obtained in the area to provide applications for tourism. This study is exploratory to determine if the applications of regression modeling can provide a better understanding of the tourists&#226; consumer behavior and to provide a tool for tourism professionals to develop and implement policies and planning to maximize visitation. The research involves the application of standard linear multiple regression analysis for eight explanatory variables chosen based on literature and availability of data. The variables included in the research are rooms rented (represented by room demand), room supply, average daily rate, travel price index, gas prices for the lower eastern region of the United States, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation averaged on a monthly basis. The results indicate that the climatic and economic variables used in this study explain over three-fourths of visitation to the Coastal Region of North Carolina. Temperature has the greatest explanatory power of all the variables used in the models to explain tourism to the Coastal Region. Precipitation had the least explanatory power within the models. The study provides empirical evidence of the impact of climatic and economic conditions on tourism, which indicates the influence they have on tourist behavior.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11032009-073556/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Passive Pumping Microfluidic Coulter Counter</field><field name="creator">McPherson, Amy</field><field name="description">As a result of the growing costs of healthcare technology, there is an increasing need for medical diagnostic tools that provide accurate information in a portable, low-cost platform. A microfluidic device using on-chip passive pumping was characterized for use as a particle counter. A detection circuit interfaced with electrodes in the microfluidic chip to provide an excitation signal and to detect electrical activity. Flow occurred due to a Young-Laplace pressure gradient between a 1.2 mm diameter inlet and a 4 mm diameter reservoir when 0.5 &#206;&#188;L fluid droplets were applied to the inlet using a micropipette. Polystyrene particles were enumerated using the resistive pulse technique, in which particles can be detected based on the difference in particle conductivity from that of the surrounding medium. Particles counted using the passive flow method demonstrated mean particle counts that were within 13% of those detected using a syringe pump, while all pumping methods displayed particle counts that were within 16% of the count obtained using a hemacytometer. Three different sample loading patterns were compared; the methods varied only in the order of sample and wash fluid administration. Zero, one, or two wash droplets were loaded after the first of two sample droplets. No statistical difference was detected in the mean particle counts for all loading patterns using the passive method (p &gt; 0.05). This passive pumping method is easily implemented using only a micropipette, thus reducing the cost and complexity of particle enumeration, and the method can be implemented in a point-of-care (POC) device for a highly portable, cost-effective particle counter. These methods obtained particle counts that were also consistent with syringe pumping (p &gt; 0.05).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11032009-082653/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of Integral Signature and Hausdorff Distance in Planar Curve Matching</field><field name="creator">Iwancio, Kathleen Marie</field><field name="description">Curve matching is an important problem in computer image processing and image recognition. In particular, the problem of identifying curves that are equivalent under a geometric transformation arises in a variety of applications. Two curves in $mathbb{R}^2$ are called congruent if they are equivalent under the action of the Euclidean group, i.e. if one curve can be mapped to the other by a combination of rotations, reflections, and translations. In theory, one can identify congruent curves by using differential invariants, such as infinitesimal arc-length and curvature. The practical use of differential invariants is problematic, however, due to their high sensitivity to noise and small perturbations. Other types of invariants that are less sensitive to perturbations were proposed in literature, but are much less studied than classical differential invariants. In this thesis we provide a detailed study of matching algorithms for planar curves based on Euclidean integral invariant signatures. Several types of local and global signatures are considered. We examine numerical approximations of signatures, sensitivity to perturbation, dependence on parametrization and a choice of initial point, and effects of the symmetries of the original image on signatures. Furthermore, we use Hausdorff distance between signatures to define a distance between congruence classes of curves.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11032009-104907/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Lawn Maintenance on Nutrient Losses via Overland Flow and the Comparison of Nitrous Oxide Flux from Three Residential Landscapes A Case Study</field><field name="creator">Spence, Porche' La Phyl</field><field name="description">Residential lawn management practices (mowing, fertilizer, irrigation, reseeding, and aeration) result in aesthetically appealing landscapes, but can result in nutrient losses via overland flow or gaseous losses to the atmosphere (e.g. nitrous oxide - N2O). The overall objective of this study was to determine the effect of lawn management on nutrient losses from residential lawns. The specific objectives were: modify a passive sampling system to determine nutrient loads due to overland flow from lawns; evaluate differences in overland flow frequency, volumes, and nutrient losses during rainfall events (&#226;&#165; 2.54 cm); and compare N2O losses following rainfall events. Three lawn schemes were studied: a high maintenance fescue (Festuca arundinacea) lawn (HMFL), a low maintenance fescue lawn (LMFL), and a mixed forested residential landscape (RFL). The modified passive sampling system allowed 100% recovery of overland flow and demonstrated that differences in maintenance influenced the overland flow frequency, volumes, and nutrient losses. The LMFL had the greatest overland flow volumes and nutrient unit area loads, although N and P concentrations in overland flow exceeded USEPA recommendations from all three lawns. Nutrient losses (g ha-1 yr-1) from all three residential landscapes were 1000 times less than fertilizer (kg ha-1 yr-1) and throughfall (kg ha-1 yr-1) inputs, due in part to the presence of well-structured soils (low bulk densities and high infiltration rates). Irrigation practices between the HMFL and LMFL explained the differences in overland flow volumes and nutrient loads, especially during the first half of the study when drought conditions existed at the study site (Cary, North Carolina). Lack of irrigation in the LMFL resulted in early dormancy, a minimal thatch layer and lower plant density, resulting in higher volumes of overland flow. Trends in the N2O losses from the HMFL and LMFL were associated with timing of fertilizer applications, presence or absence of irrigation, and seasonal growth patterns of the fescue. For the RFL, the presence of a decomposing litter layer limited N2O production. Well-maintained residential lawns, receiving recommended fertilizer N applications and frequent irrigation, reduce nutrient losses via overland flow but may provide optimum conditions for greater N2O fluxes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11032009-142926/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crack-free Edge Isolation of the Si Solar Cell Using a Single Mode Fiber Laser</field><field name="creator">Rajule, Nilesh Gunwantrao</field><field name="description">The need for increasing use of renewable energy resources is pushing the technology towards inventing high efficiency solar cells. The edge isolation process during the manufacturing of solar cells is very important step as it affects IV characteristics of solar cell. There is need to create deep edge isolation scribe to increase shunt resistance in the solar cell. The deeper edge isolation scribe can be created by focusing the laser deep into the solar cell substrate. However previous experiments done on Si wafer using pulsed laser shows there is possibility of void generation when laser is focused deep into the material. To perform edge isolation process using Continuous Wave (CW) laser; the void formation due to deep focus needs to be investigated. It is confirmed from the experiments that there is a condition for maximum focus position for the combination of processing speed and power to achieve crack free edge isolation. The depth of the scribe can be predicted from the 2D model for different speeds and powers. The process parameters for the process by 300W single mode fiber laser can be determined by achieving the edge isolation scribe which is free from cracks.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11032009-152800/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of interbasin groundwater transfer on water and chemical budgets in lowland tropical watersheds- La Selva, Costa Rica</field><field name="creator">Jordan, Michael Terence</field><field name="description">Small watershed budget studies are a major research tool in hydrology, ecology, and geochemistry. Most watershed hydrology and geochemistry studies attempt to avoid sites with groundwater seepage beneath topographic divides, known as interbasin groundwater transfer (IGT), due to the difficulty in quantifying it. However, IGT is an important and relatively common hydrological process that merits study. This project identified and quantified IGT by making detailed physical and chemical measurements in two adjacent lowland rainforest watersheds in Costa Rica: the Arboleda watershed, which receives IGT, and the Taconazo watershed, which is not affected by IGT. Physical hydrologic data allowed total IGT (mm/year) to be quantified in the context of water budgets for the watersheds, and the combination of physical and chemical data together allowed the IGT to be quantitatively separated into two components (high-solute bedrock groundwater and low-solute local water). Physical measurements of change in groundwater storage using piezometers, rainfall using a tipping bucket rain gauge, and stream discharge using V-notch weirs were made for four consecutive budget years. Major ion concentrations were measured in bulk rainfall samples, streamwater samples, and groundwater samples. The physical and chemical data were used to calculate annual water and chemical (Cl, SO4, Na, K, Mg, Ca) budgets for the two study watersheds. The watersheds had equal annual rainfall and ET (averaging 4,973 mm/yr and 2,107 mm/yr, respectively), but the Arboleda also had additional large water inputs by IGT (averaging about 4,367 mm/yr from bedrock groundwater and 5,590 mm/yr from local water). IGT to the Taconazo (all local water) was negligible (328 mm/yr). IGT of bedrock groundwater was mainly responsible for the Arboleda watershed receiving 18 times more Cl, 11 times more SO4, 36 times more Na, 54 times more K, 220 times more Mg, and 71 times more Ca input than the Taconazo watershed. Total solute input to the Arboleda watershed is dominated by bedrock groundwater, which accounts for an average of 84 percent (SO4) to 99 percent (Mg) of total solute input as compared with the Taconazo watershed where total solute input is controlled by rainfall accounting for on average of 77 percent (Mg) to 91 percent (SO4) of total solute input. The Arboleda watershed was in a steady state condition (i.e., the difference between inputs and outputs was within the range of uncertainty) for each solute during the 12/00-11/01 and 12/02-11/02 budget years, as was the Taconazo for Na and Ca in both budget years and Cl in the second budget year. The Taconazo chemical budgets showed an excess of SO4 inputs over outputs (+88 mol/ha and +115 mol/ha), a net loss of K (-165 mol/ha and -162 mol/ha), and a net loss of Mg (-256 mol/ha and -330 mol/ha). Traditionally, most watershed budget studies are conducted on the assumption that the watershed is ?tight?; however, the results of this study clearly indicate that caution should be used in making such an assumption. Results also suggest a linkage between deep groundwater systems and lowland rainforest may be important to watershed science, water quantity and quality, water management, and conservation of lowland rainforest ecosystems.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11042003-075924/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) Envelope Glycoprotein-Mediated Cell Fusion and Apoptosis.</field><field name="creator">Garg, Himanshu</field><field name="description">Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are lentiviruses that are remarkable similar in their genomic organization, receptor usage and pathogenesis. Based on this FIV has evolved into a well-established small animal model for studying AIDS. FIV and HIV cause a progressive depletion of T cells via a still unknown mechanism though numerous studies support a role of membrane expressed HIV env glycoprotein in apoptotic killing of CD4+ T cells. HIV env glycoprotein is a heterodimer of surface expressed gp120 that binds to CD4 and a chemokine receptor and transmembrane gp41 that mediates fusion and syncytia formation. The role of the fusion process in HIV env-mediated apoptosis remains controversial even though evidence suggests that cytopathic effect of HIV is related to the fusogenic potential of env glycoprotein. Blocking HIV env receptor interactions either at the level of gp120 or gp41 blocks both syncytia formation and apoptosis. This suggests a crucial role for HIV gp41 in fusion, as well as apoptosis. The hydrophobic pre-transmembrane (pre-TM) region of HIV gp41 is important for membrane fusion and sequence analysis reveals a similar region in FIV gp41. The current study was undertaken to determine the role of different regions of FIV env in mediating fusion and apoptosis in bystander cells and to determine whether the two phenomena are related. FIV env interactions with target cells were blocked at the level of gp120 or gp41 and the effect of these on fusion and apoptosis studied. The role of FIV gp41 pre-TM region in fusion and apoptosis was also determined. Our findings support a role of FIV env in apoptotic loss of T cells and this phenomenon correlates with env-mediated fusion.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11042003-141554/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimization of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition using Various Preconditioning Techniques to Analyze Autoignition Simulation Data of Non-Homogeneous Hydrogen-Air Mixtures</field><field name="creator">Danby, Sean James</field><field name="description">The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is implemented on unsteady 2D data from direct numerical simulations (DNS) of auto-ignition in non-homogeneous hydrogen-air mixtures. The analysis is implemented to evaluate requirements for the reproduction of transient, multi-dimensional and multi-scalar processes in combustion. The resulting low-order models may be used to store and manage large data sets for post-processing and visualization, and for the implementation of POD reduced data as an integral element of model-based closure in turbulent combustion. Data reduction is implemented on a set of thirty snapshots of 2D fields of the passive scalar: the mixture fraction, and reactive scalars: the reaction progress variable, the reactants, hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2), mass fractions and intermediate species, H-radical and HO2 mass fractions. The snapshots cover the evolution of the hydrogen-air mixture from induction to high-temperature combustion stages. POD analysis shows that there are different requirements to reproduce passive and reactive scalars depending on the degree of their spatial and temporal variations during the autoignition process and the statistical distribution. The mixture fraction, which is affected by the mixing process only, requires the least number of eigenmodes, and yields a sufficient representation of the original data with only four eigenmodes. The success of the POD reduction of the reactive scalars depends upon the distribution of the statistics of the original scalar. On average, the reactive scalars require at least six modes to reproduce the original data. A number of pre-processing strategies of the scalar fields are explored to reduce the number of required eigenmodes. The strategies are designed to reduce the temporal and spatial spans of scalar values. The results show that different pre-processing strategies may yield different outcomes for the passive and reactive scalars reduction process depending on the statistical distributions of these scalars.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11042004-203408/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Event Familiarity on the Complexity and Coherence of Children's Narratives of Positive Events</field><field name="creator">Banks, Jonathan Britten</field><field name="description">The coherence of individuals? narratives of negative events has been shown to have significant positive effects on a variety of indicators of adaptive functioning (Klein &amp; Boals, 2001; Pennebaker, Mayne, &amp; Francis, 1997). Relatively little is known, however, about the processes through which individuals form coherent narratives of important personal experiences. This research examined the role of familiarity with the event on changes over time in the measures of narrative complexity, coherence and intrusive thoughts. In addition, the relationships among three previously used measures of coherence (a count of words in relevant categories, an overall rating, and a measure of causal connections between clauses) were examined, and the association between each measure and a criterion measure, Story Grammar, was explored. Two groups of 16 children participated in either a familiar event, a soccer tournament, or an unfamiliar event, soccer tryouts for a more competitive leaguer. All participants were interviewed within one week of the event and six weeks after the first interview. In contrast to expectations, familiarity with the event did not result in higher initial levels of coherence, and the coherence of the account of the less familiar event did not increase over time. The alternative measures of coherence were related to Story Grammar as expected, but were not correlated with each other.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11042004-221924/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From empire to Empire: Benjamin Disraeli and the formalization of the British Imperial Social Structure</field><field name="creator">Underwood, Jonathan Allen</field><field name="description">Throughout the last century British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli?s influence and reputation as an imperialist has been praised, demonized, and denied. Though always a target of considerable political criticism, Disraeli?s advancement and, some might even say, invention of British imperial nationalism was celebrated by contemporary politicians, academics, and the general population who considered him ?inextricably entwined? with the notion of empire. However, twentieth century historiography largely downplayed and discounted Disraeli?s influence on late nineteenth century imperial British expansion by focusing not on imperialism as an ideology, but as a phenomenon of economics and power; aligning its genesis with the Industrial Revolution, and the socio-economic theories of Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and John Atkinson Hobson. But, since the publication of Edward Said?s Orientalism in 1978, which reevaluated the cultural and social relationships between the East and the West, Disraeli?s impact on Britain?s colonial century has yet again come to the forefront of imperial British historiography. Disraeli?s rhetoric and political acumen regarding Britain?s eastern empire directly (through the proclamation of Victoria?s title Empress of India in 1876) and indirectly (through his assertion of Conservative Principles at the Crystal Palace in 1872) established a significant hierarchical social structure and consciousness that still pervades British culture today.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11042006-221836/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vermicompost Amended Pine Bark Substrate Improves Nursery Crop Production</field><field name="creator">McGinnis, Michelle Susanne</field><field name="description">Several field, greenhouse, and laboratory studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of vermicomposted (VC) hog manure amended to pine bark (PB) on substrate physical properties, plant growth and flower production, water use efficiency of productivity (WUEP), effluent nitrogen and phosphorus content, substrate solution pH, macronutrient release rate characteristics, and the ability of VC to replace conventional fertilizer nutrient inputs. Nitrogen and phosphorus budgets were determined, and nutrient use efficiencies of nitrogen (NUEN) and phosphorus (NUEP) were calculated. Container capacity and available water increased linearly and air space decreased linearly with increasing rate of VC. Growth of several species increased linearly with increasing VC rate with no traditional amendments of limestone and micronutrients; and 20% VC resulted in greater plant dry weights than the PB control (amended with limestone and micronutrients). However, there were species where growth decreased linearly with increased VC rate, while the 20% VC maintained equivalent dry weights to the PB control. The WUEP of several species were improved compared to the control. Liming effects of 5% VC were equivalent to the control receiving limestone, whereas VC rates &gt;10% had greater liming effects compared to the respective control. Twenty percent VC provided sufficient quantities of P, Ca, Mg, S, and micronutrients such that an additional supply of these nutrients need not be applied. Although 20% VC did not supply K in quantities comparable to traditional inputs, the reduction of K did not affect growth or flower bud production of hibiscus. Macronutrient release rates (determined on a volume basis) of N and S from VC followed a first-order model, Ca and Mg followed a two pool first/zero-order model, and P followed a zero-order model. The tissue nutrient content of N, Ca, Mg, and S increased with increasing VC rate while P decreased with decreasing VC rate. Vermicompost in the substrate increased N and P effluent content, but reducing the leaching fraction decreased nutrient contents. The NUEN ranged from 9% to 20% with no major differences between substrate or leaching fraction treatments. However, the NUEP was improved when VC was amended to the substrate.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11042007-145242/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Response Processes Validity of the Stanford Binet Intelligence Scales, Fifth Edition</field><field name="creator">Ouzts, Sandye Michelle</field><field name="description">This study examined the evidence for the response process validity of the Stanford Binet, Fifth Edition (Roid, 2003a).

Isolates collected from Camellia spp. were of the A1 mating type, while isolates from the other host plants were A2. All isolates were sensitive to mefenoxam at 100 ppm and all but one was sensitive at 1 ppm. Isolates from Rhododendron spp. scored higher average foliar disease and root rot ratings, while A1 isolates from Camellia spp. had the lowest average foliar disease and root rot ratings. The population sample of 42 isolates was also examined for DNA sequence polymorphisms in two nuclear loci, beta-tubulin (Btu) and a portion of the intergenic spacer (IGS) region of the nuclear rDNA repeat, and one mitochondrial DNA locus, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COX 1). Six base substitutions were found among the 42 isolates with a multi-locus data set. Isolates grouped into four haplotypes. Haplotype grouping corresponded to isolate mating type, plant host, and heterozygosity in the Btu locus. Our inferred multilocus rooted gene genealogy revealed a putative ancestral lineage representing the most frequently sampled haplotype in the population. This haplotype contained A2 isolates collected from Ilex spp., Juniperus spp., and Rhododendron spp.. Isolates of the A1 mating type diverged more recently in the genealogy.

The researcher conducted interviews with five recent Principals of the Year from an urban school district and concludes with a framework for a phenomenological understanding of vision based upon the metaphors used by these principals.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational Administration and Supervision</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11042008-152127/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Methods for the Determination of Aerodynamic Parameters and Trajectory Reconstruction of the Orion Command Module from Scale Model Aeroballistic Flight Data</field><field name="creator">Sebastian, Thomas Jr.</field><field name="description">Determination of aerodynamic coeffcients and stability derivatives is necessary in defning a model of the Orion CEV dynamics. This involves reducing experimental data, which can include acceleration, angular rate, or orientation data. This sort of extraction of dynamics from experimental data is often performed on data gathered from experiments conducted on uninstrumented models at indoor ballistics ranges. The US Army Research Laboratory (ARL) has developed a high-g survivable stand-alone instrumentation package that can transmit in-flight measurements of acceleration, angular rate, and local magnetic field. This telemetry module (TM) was installed in a scale model of the Orion CEV, which was red from a 175mm cannon at the ARL range. The instrumentation package was upgraded to include pressure transducers to measure forebody pressures. A minimum variance with a priori method was formulated to solve for both the "local" flight parameters of Mach number, angle of attack, and sideslip angle at each timestamp and the "global" parameters of scale factor and bias for each pressure transducer. Results using both simulated and experimental data indicates that these parameters may be estimated and used to compute stability coeffcients. Low pressure differentials between symmetrically-opposed pressure transducers, however, increased uncertainty in the parameter estimates. Validation of this method of data generation and analysis supports a low-cost method of vehicle testing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11042008-170009/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EFFICIENT, HIGH ASPECT RATIO MICROHOLE DRILLING WITH RAPIDLY REPEATED PULSES</field><field name="creator">Lehman, Ted Eugene</field><field name="description">The necessity for micro holes spans across a wide range of industrial applications with nearly endless boundaries. From electronics and X-Ray apertures to micro fluidics and heat transfer phenomenon, the advancement of precision ablation will undoubtedly be of benefit. Currently, three major techniques are employed in the fabrication of micro-holes: Conventional drilling methods, electrical discharge machining (EDM), and laser drilling. The flexibility to drill a wide range of materials with a single device in combination with high consistency and accuracy lead many applications to the necessity of laser drilling. Major drawbacks of laser ablation are low material removal rates and heat affected zones around the holes. Much research has been performed in the pico- and femtosecond paradigm with less insight into longer pulse durations. Investigation was conducted into four variables affecting microsecond pulses on the material removal of steel: pulse length, high power density spikes, pulsing frequency, as well as group multiple pulsing. The optimal pulse length of 3 &#194;&#181;s created unblocked holes with aspect ratios of 6 and depths of 196 &#194;&#181;m. Multiple pulsing increased the aspect ratio to 10, deepening the cavity to 236 &#194;&#181;m. Optimum depth occurred with the maximum number of pulses tested, 10; producing an aspect ratio of 12 and a depth of 295 &#194;&#181;m. A major drawback produced by 10 pulses was the signs of hole blockage. A process anatomy of hole creation explains causes of the blockage. The second variable, high power density spike exhibited by the laser increased hole depth 5% over instances lacking this spike. Major improvements in depth were demonstrated as the pulsing frequency was increased to a laser capable maximum of 48.7 kHz. Holes created under this condition experienced major blockage near the exit. Group multiple pulsing deepened the hole to 438 &#194;&#181;m with three sets of ten pulses at 48.7 kHz. Holes exhibited extreme blockage throughout their depths.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11042009-101354/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning to Teach Probability: Relationships among Preservice Teachers' Beliefs and Orientations, Content Knowledge, and Pedagogical Content Knowledge of Probability</field><field name="creator">Ives, Sarah Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The purposes of this study were to investigate preservice mathematics teachers&#226; orientations, content knowledge, and pedagogical content knowledge of probability; the relationships among these three aspects; and the usefulness of tasks with respect to examining these aspects of knowledge. The design of the study was a multi-case study of five secondary mathematics education preservice teachers with a focus on their knowledge as well as tasks that were used in this study. Data from individual interviews and test items were collected and analyzed under a conceptual framework based on the work of Hill, Ball, and Schilling (2008); Kvatinsky and Even (2002); and Garuti, Orlandoni, and Ricci (2008). The researcher found that the preservice teachers held multiple orientations towards probability yet tended to be mostly objective (mathematical and statistical) with little evidence of subjective orientations. Relationships existed between the preservice teachers&#226; orientations and their content knowledge, as well as their pedagogical content knowledge. These relationships were found more in tasks where they were required to make a claim about a probability within some sort of real-world context. The researcher also found that tasks involving pedagogical situations tended to be more effective at eliciting knowledge than tasks involving only questions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11042009-144919/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Directional p-Median Problem with Applications to Traffic Quantization and Multiprocessor Scheduling</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Laura Elizabeth</field><field name="description">An instance of a p-median problem gives n demand points. The objective is to locate p supply points in order to minimize the total distance of the demand points to their nearest supply point. P-median is polynomially solvable in one dimension but NP-hard in two or more dimensions, when either the Euclidean or the rectilinear distance measure is used. In this thesis, we treat the p-median problem under a new distance measure, the directional rectilinear distance, which requires the nearest supply point for a given demand point to lie above and to the right of it. This restriction has applications to multiprocessor scheduling of periodic tasks as well as to traffic quantization and Quality of Service scheduling in packet-switched computer networks. We show that the directional p-median problem is polynomially solvable in one dimension and give two algorithms. We prove the problem NP-hard in two or more dimensions and then present an efficient heuristic to solve it. Compared to the robust Teitz and Bart heuristic for p-median, our heuristic enjoys substantial speedup while sacrificing little in terms of solution quality, making it an ideal choice for our target applications with thousands of demand points.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11052003-111956/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generalizations and unification of centroid-based clustering methods</field><field name="creator">Ca&#241;as, Daniel Alberto</field><field name="description">There are many clustering methods that are referred to as k-means-like. We give the minimal necessary and sufficient components for the mechanism of the k-means (iterative and partitional) clustering method of a finite set of objects, X. Thus k-means is generalized and the methods that mimic k-means are unified. We name these k-center clustering methods. The fundamental mechanism of k-center methods exposes the usual misconceptions of k-means such as (a) ``distance" satisfies some of properties of a mathematical metric, (b) there is a need to measure ``distance" between objects in X, and (c) the centers of clusters have the same nature as the objects of X. Moreover, k-center methods have a common formula to choose or calculate centers of clusters. We characterize the convergent common objective function by expressing it in terms of (a) a distance measure for closeness between center objects and the objects in X and (b) the coherence of clusters. We give a three object example to demonstrate the components of the formal mechanism of a k-center method. We then give examples of various known methods that belong to the class of k-center methods. We exhibit an extensive and thorough comparison of the qualitative k-modes and the numerical spherical k-means. Included are paradigm applications, a matrix environment, an understanding of the duality of a dissimilarity and similarity measure, and an understanding of normalized X and the normalized centers of subsets of X.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11052004-022839/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Something Blue: Poems</field><field name="creator">Stancar, Angela Diane</field><field name="description">Something Blue is a collection of poems that explore the physicality of relationships. ?Light on Lake Michigan,? the first poem in the manuscript, explores a mother?s suicide by drowning.

To explain these documented sex differences in well-being, I bring theories of gender to bear on how the processes described in general strain theory and the stress paradigm are modified by the processes and practices of gender. Building on past research that examines gender differences in the experience of stress, I consider how sex differences in general, agentic (intrapersonal) and communal (interpersonal) stress contribute to differences in well-being. Additionally, I further specify current approaches by examining how gender theoretically alters access to and employment of social/personal resources ? social support, self-esteem, mastery, and coping styles. I hypothesize that these interact with the experience of stress in gendered ways to produce variance in well-being by sex. Data are from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Regression models are estimated separately for boys and girls, including interaction terms between each type of stress and social/personal resource. Analyses show boys report more delinquency, and girls report more depression. Boys report more exposure to agentic stress, but this does not translate into vulnerability. Girls, in terms of depression, are more vulnerable to general and communal stress. No social or personal resource completely accounts for their greater vulnerability to these stresses. Boys report higher levels of self-esteem, mastery, and risk-oriented coping; girls report higher levels of social support and avoidant coping. In terms of delinquency, social support and self-esteem protect girls from delinquent outcomes but are not significant for boys. Differences in coping styles provide some explanation for sex differences in well-being. For girls, avoidant coping exacerbates the damaging effects of stress on depression, while approach-oriented coping buffers the effects of stress on delinquency. Risk-oriented coping puts boys and girls at risk for delinquency and depression, but puts girls at greater risk for delinquency if they use a risk-oriented coping style to manage stress.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11052006-164943/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relative and Incremental Validity of the Big Five and Maladaptive Personality Characteristics for Predicting Leadership Effectiveness</field><field name="creator">Lindberg, Jennifer Tricia Ms.</field><field name="description">Although previous research has examined ?bright? personality characteristics that impact leadership effectiveness through their presence, there is a growing recognition of the importance of factors that promote leadership effectiveness through their absence (e.g., Hogan &amp; Hogan, 2001; McCall &amp; Lombardo, 1983). These ?dark? or maladaptive personality characteristics have been hypothesized to interact with the length of time that an observer has been exposed to a given manager (Hogan &amp; Hogan, 1997, 2001). In the current study, the relative and incremental validity of the Big Five and maladaptive personality characteristics in predicting leadership effectiveness was examined, as well as the moderating effect of leader-subordinate relationship length. Although previous research has examined ?bright? and ?dark? personality characteristics in the prediction of leadership effectiveness (e.g., Facteau &amp; Van Landuyt, 2005; Judge, Bono, Illies, &amp; Gerhardt, 2003), this study was the first attempt to examine both types of personality characteristics in the prediction of leadership effectiveness, in addition to the moderating role of relationship length. Personality data were collected from a sample of supervisors (N = 134), and their direct reports (N = 330) provided concurrent ratings of their supervisors? effectiveness. The multiple regression analyses revealed that the Big Five and maladaptive personality characteristics did not predict leadership effectiveness. In addition, the Big Five personality dimensions did not demonstrate incremental validity over and above the maladaptive characteristics, nor did the maladaptive characteristics demonstrate incremental validity over and above the Big Five personality dimensions in the prediction of leadership effectiveness. Finally, the relation between the maladaptive personality characteristics and leadership effectiveness did not vary as a function of leader-subordinate relationship length, contrary to the predictions of previous theoretical work (Hogan &amp; Hogan, 2001).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11052006-172739/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three Essays on Modeling Risk in Fed Cattle Production</field><field name="creator">Belasco, Eric J</field><field name="description">This study examines issues that arise when modeling risk associated with fed cattle production. While research concerning crop yield and revenue risks are numerous, studies focusing on production risk in livestock are much less frequent. The first essay evaluates the relationship among four variables associated with the health and performance of feedlot cattle, and the resulting production and profit risk. The four variables of interest include feed conversion rates, average daily gain, veterinary costs, and mortality rates, which are conditional on characteristics that are known when the pen is placed into a commercial feedlot. Conditional variables include gender, average weight, feedlot location, and season of placement. A multivariate Tobit model is used to characterize the relationship among the four dependent variables, where each element in the covariance matrix is conditional on placement characteristics. The second essay focuses on modeling cattle mortality rates, alone and as part of a system. A zero-inflated log-normal distribution is developed and shown to have advantages in model fit and prediction tests with this data set, relative to classical methods. A simulated data set is also utilized to assess the potential bias from assuming a Tobit model when the data are more accurately characterized through a mixture model. The third essay quantifies the amount of risk inherent in cattle feedlot operations through the use of simulation techniques. More specifically, extit{ex-ante} profit risks are evaluated under scenarios that utilize varying levels of price protection through the use of forward contracts and the options market.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11052007-145106/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a movement ecology: modeling the behavioral response of invasive snails to resources and competition.</field><field name="creator">Snider, Sunny Brooke</field><field name="description">The movement of individuals is one of the fundamental components of contemporary ecological problems such as metapopulation theory, epidemic models, competitive coexistence, and invasion dynamics. Advection-diffusion models, sometimes with a reaction term, have been usefully applied to such problems. For this dissertation, I broadened this approach by seeking to understand the effects of certain biotic and abiotic factors on movement ecology, and asking how to incorporate flexible behavioral responses into classical advection-diffusion models. I asked how resources, competitive environment, and habitat structure, interacting with body size or not, affect the movement behaviors of two coexisting invasive snails (Melanoides tuberculata and Tarebia granifera), and whether including the behavioral response to these factors improves advection-diffusion models of movement. I also made natural history observations regarding the snail system to provide a biological context for my empirical work. To address these questions, I conducted replicated experiments and observational studies, extended advection-diffusion models, and arbitrated among candidate models using AIC (Akaike?s Information Criterion) model selection. Specific studies included (1) behavioral response to phenotypic and resource heterogeneities, and their interaction, (2) behavioral response to intraspecific and interspecific competition, and (3) behavioral response to spatially uniform versus spatially heterogeneous environments. In summary, this dissertation provides insights into modeling movement behaviors, using two coexisting invasive snails as the model system. I advocate for a behaviorally informed modeling framework that integrates sentient responses of individuals in terms of movement, improving our ability to accurately model ecological processes that depend on movement ecology.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11052007-171057/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Redox Potential Trends of Cucumber Fermentation as Influenced by Microbial Growth and Gas Purging</field><field name="creator">Olsen, Maegan Jessie</field><field name="description">Determining the redox potential of a system can be a useful tool in evaluating the thermodynamic changes that occur over a period of time. Currently, fermentation industries use pH measurements to assess the progress of fermentation and growth of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Redox potential (Eh) measures the transfer of electrons within a system, rather than solely the concentration of hydrogen ions, as measured by pH. Continuous monitoring of fermentation by Eh may allow for more descriptive analysis of the metabolic process and could offer a method for the earlier prediction of spoilage by yeasts. The trends in redox potential of fermenting cucumbers were observed to evaluate the possible application of this parameter in monitoring the development of fermentation. Additionally, an evaluation of the effect of gas purging on microbial growth during the fermentation was conducted using redox potential trends as a monitoring tool. Cucumbers were packed and brined using sodium chloride, calcium chloride, and acetic acid and the redox potential monitored during fermentation. Examination of both pasteurized-inoculated jars and non-pasteurized jars was conducted in this study. In addition, changes in redox potential were measured in fermentations that were purged with nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, or left untreated. Brine samples were analyzed for microbial counts, pH and substrates and products of fermentation. Under conditions representative of a standard cucumber fermentation, a dramatic decrease in the redox potential was observed during the first day, concomitantly with the initiation of the log phase of bacterial growth. However, in the presence of spoilage yeast, redox potential remained low over this initial period. The progress of a fermentation sparged with nitrogen, oxygen, or no treatment produced similar Eh trends. The Eh trend was more reduced under hydrogen sparging. A heightened growth rate for LAB, more efficient production of lactic acid, and lower production of ethanol occurred with nitrogen sparging. The evidence suggests that the growth of yeasts in a cucumber fermentation could be detected based upon differences in the redox potential. Distinct variations in Eh were still recorded after pH values decreased and remained constant, suggesting the valuable possible application of Eh to monitor industrial cucumber fermentations. Additionally, changes in redox potential were affected by gases introduced during cucumber fermentations and sparging with nitrogen could have substantial benefits to the industry.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11052008-141935/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using a Hydrologic and Storm Water Model to Predict the Movement of Water Soluble Tracers via Surface Water Runoff at the Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Station</field><field name="creator">Sharpe, Desmond</field><field name="description">GPS and stormwater models are two extremely powerful technologies that can effectively predict the movement of rainfall runoff and soluble pollutants via surface water, when applicable correctly.

The consequence is that results obtained by different groups are scattered across the Internet, making it difficult for researchers to obtain a comprehensive view of cognitive modeling research. The goal of my project is to develop a collaborative modeling environment for cognitive scientists in which they can develop and share models. The current system supports collaboration by providing a structured representation for ACT-R cognitive models using frames. The rationale for providing a structured representation for cognitive models is two-fold: it not only provides a mechanism for sharing models (i.e. via consistent APIs); it also enables the application of analytical techniques to cognitive models. As a proof of concept for the approach, a medium-scale modeling application has been developed, integrating an extension of ACT-R developed elsewhere, to solve synonym crossword puzzles.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11052009-142649/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electron Beam Melting of Advanced Materials and Structures, mass customization, mass personalization</field><field name="creator">Mahale, Tushar Ramkrishna</field><field name="description">Layered manufacturing has for long been used for the fabrication of non-functional parts using polymer-based processes.

This essay describes, through the lens of honor, the attempts of Nat Turner and Margaret Whitehead to rebel against the patriarchal code of Southern honor, and explores their failures to subvert the rigid assumptions of the prevailing system. Disrespected, mistreated, and enslaved, Nat wishes to disrupt the perpetual social system of white honor and black deference; he uses his literacy and the patriarchal models of the Old Testament and his father to rebel against his social condition and to sustain his plan for insurrection and eventual liberation. Emotionally distant from the patriarchal authority of her brother and the influence of her mother, unable to communicate freely with her peers or family, and distraught and torn by her socially unacceptable belief that slavery should be abolished, Margaret rebels against these socially imposed controls and ideologically commits herself to her convictions about equality, tolerance, and Christian love. Though both Nat and Margaret actively rebel against the existing honor system, they fail to consider the influence of the public sphere. This failure to identify the public perceptions of various social communities results in the collapse of Nat&#226;s and Margaret&#226;s rebellions, and it contributes to their eventual deaths.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11052009-205004/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimating the Potential Impact of Carbon Markets on North Carolina Forests</field><field name="creator">Liu, Shan</field><field name="description">Several studies have examined the theoretical aspects of determining the optimal carbon rotation.

Under conservative assumptions regarding the social benefits of carbon storage, optimal rotation periods are extended depending on the forest type, carbon price, interest rate, and emission penalty under consideration. Analysis shows when carbon price is low the extension of the joint timber-carbon rotation are similar among DOE, CCX, and VCS protocols; when carbon price is high, the joint rotation extends longer under DOE protocol than the other two protocols, especially in the lowland hardwood forest type. Results suggest that such joint strategies could be financially attractive. Sensitivity analysis is used to examine the effects of changes in financial parameters on landowner returns and optimal management. Under most assumptions, our findings indicate that including carbon sequestration in forest management increases returns but leads to only marginal changes in rotation length.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11052009-234247/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of diffraction enhanced imaging for obtaining improved contrast of calcifications in breast tissue</field><field name="creator">Kiss, Miklos Zoltan</field><field name="description">KISS, MIKLOS ZOLTAN. Application of diffraction enhanced imaging for obtaining improved contrast of calcifications in breast tissue. (Under the direction of Dale E. Sayers.) Diffraction enhanced imaging (DEI) has been used to study the improvements in image contrast of calcifications in breast tissue. This new imaging modality has the potential to greatly improve early detection of breast cancer, primarily due to its ability to utilize contrast mechanisms in the breast, which are not possible with existing radiographic methods. Of particular interest is the comparison of the image contrast of calcifications in breast tissue obtained using DEI to those obtained using conventional radiography. The presence of calcifications in breast tissue has been connected to breast cancer, but this relationship is not well understood. The purpose of this dissertation is to study the improvements in image contrast of calcifications in healthy as well as cancerous breast tissue when using synchrotron-based DEI compared to conventional synchrotron-based methods. Image contrast is in part determined by the capabilities of the detector in the imaging system, and this relation was used to determine the effect of the limits of spatial resolution on near-pixel-sized objects, both by experiment and by computer modeling. Consistent definitions for image contrast were presented and applied to test objects, followed by application to breast tissue specimens containing calcifications. In every case, images obtained using DEI exhibited higher image contrast than the corresponding images obtained using normal radiography. The ratio of these contrast values, called the DEI gain, was consistently larger than unity, indicating that DEI does indeed utilize additional contrast mechanisms, such as refraction and scatter rejection, in addition to absorption and provides support for the development of a clinical prototype.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11062002-155217/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capacity Estimation of Wireless Mesh Networks</field><field name="creator">Jun, Jangeun</field><field name="description">The goal of this research is to estimate the capacity of wireless mesh networks (WMNs).

While anaerobic lagoons and sprayfields are currently used for treatment, recent administrative initiatives call for their replacement. This decision has increased the need for characterization of the cost and treatment effectiveness of alternative technologies. However, due to variations in farm characteristics (e.g., size, location), identification of the most cost-effective combination of treatment technologies to achieve collective environmental goals requires an integrated approach (i.e. all combinations of treatment technology alternatives at all farms in a region must be considered simultaneously). The objective of this research was to develop a regional management decision-support framework to assist policy-makers, planners, and farmers in making cost effective lagoon replacement decisions to achieve desired treatment and public protection goals. A major component of the framework is a cost and treatment efficiency assessment tool to evaluate alternative animal waste treatment technologies for individual farms. Outputs from the assessment tool, together with geospatial data, feed into the regional management component of the framework, which consists of several formal optimization techniques that assist in the search for good decisions. Among these techniques are an optimization engine (integer programming) that can be used to find management strategies that meet cost and environmental targets, and a method for efficiently generating alternatives (Modeling to Generate Alternatives (MGA)). The management alternatives have similar cost and environmental performance but may behave differently for unmodeled objectives (e.g., risk or equity). Finally, the regional management framework includes an uncertainty analysis component that allows the evaluation of alternatives while taking into consideration the uncertainty in model inputs. The decision-support framework was demonstrated through an illustrative example; the regional waste management of swine farms in the Lower Neuse River watershed in eastern North Carolina to achieve a 30% reduction in nitrogen loading. Results show that 1) a regional management approach is essential for achieving cost savings, 2) there is significant flexibility in meeting the nitrogen reduction and cost targets, 3) consideration of uncertainty may lead to the selection of a different solution, 4) the decision support framework can be used successfully to address a range of concerns, including but not limited to cost, risk, equity, and uncertainty.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Systems Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11062002-210908/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Overall Heat Transfer Coefficients and Axial Temperature Distribution of Fluids in a Triple Tube Heat Exchanger</field><field name="creator">Batmaz, Ediz</field><field name="description">Computation of overall heat transfer coefficients in a triple tube heat exchanger (TTHE) is complicated when compared to a double tube heat exchanger (DTHE) since the two overall heat transfer coefficients are not independent of each other and must be solved for simultaneously. Previous methods established towards calculation of these parameters either include assumptions that are not valid for all flow conditions and fluid flow rates or use empirical correlations which may cause significant deviations from actual values of these parameters. A more generic technique was developed for calculation of overall heat transfer coefficients and axial temperature distribution of fluids in a triple tube heat exchanger. The developed procedure has been used for calculation of these parameters at various fluid flow rates and product inlet temperatures. Theoretical double tube heat exchanger results were also tabulated for comparison purposes. The advantages of using a TTHE over a DTHE has been both conceptually explained and demonstrated using the results obtained. However, it was also shown that design of TTHE experiments is critical, especially in the co-current flow arrangement, since the relative flow rates of the fluids may result in a decrease in the effectiveness. The effect of fluid flow rates, product inlet temperature, and flow arrangement on values of overall heat transfer coefficients, total amount of heat transferred, and effectiveness were also investigated. These results were analyzed using SAS and interpreted for the consistency of the obtained results with the literature.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11062003-123823/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">STATISTICAL METHODS FOR FAMILY-BASED ASSOCIATION STUDIES FOR COMPLEX HUMAN DISEASES: SINGLE-LOCUS AND HAPLOTYPE METHODS</field><field name="creator">Chung, Ren-Hua</field><field name="description">Disease-gene fine-mapping is an important task in human genetics. Linkage and association analyses are the two main approaches for exploring disease susceptibility genes. In Chapter 1, we introduce the development of methods for disease-gene mapping in the past decades and present the rationale behind our new method development. Family-based association analyses have provided powerful tools for disease-gene mapping. The Association in the Presence of Linkage test (APL), a family-based association method, can use nuclear families with multiple affected siblings and infer missing parental genotypes properly in the linkage region. In Chapter 2, we generalized and extended APL so that it can be applied to general nuclear family structures using a bootstrap variance estimator. Unlike the original APL that can handle at most two affected siblings, the new APL can handle up to three affected siblings. We also extended APL from a single-marker test to a multiple-marker haplotype analysis. According to our simulations, the new APL has a correct type I error rate and more power than other family-based association methods such as PDT, FBAT/HBAT, and PDTPHASE in nuclear families with missing parents. The robustness of APL when there are rare alleles or haplotypes and when there is population substructure such that the allele frequencies in the population deviated from the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) assumption was also examined in Chapter 2. Genes on the X chromosome play a role in many common diseases. Linkage analyses have identified regions on the X chromosome with high linkage peaks for several diseases. Currently there are few family-based association methods available for X-chromosome markers. In order to fill in this gap, we proposed a novel family-based association method, X-APL, in Chapter 3. X-APL is a modification of APL and shares some important properties with APL. X-APL can also perform haplotype analyses, which is the only family-based test of association we are aware of for testing haplotypes for the X-chromosome markers. Our simulation results showed that X-APL has a correct type I error rate and has more power than other family-based association methods for X chromosome such as XS-TDT, XPDT and XMCPDT for single-marker analysis in nuclear families. The robustness of X-APL when there are deviations of genotype frequencies from HWE was also examined in Chapter 3. Linkage and family-based association analyses are often applied simultaneously in the same data in order to maximize use of family data sets. However, it is not intuitively clear under what conditions association and linkage tests performed in the same data set may be correlated. In Chapter 4, we used computer simulations and theoretical statements to estimate the correlation between linkage statistics (affected sib pair maximum LOD scores) and family-based association statistics (PDT and APL) under various hypotheses. Different types of pedigrees were studied: nuclear families with affected sib pairs, extended pedigrees and incomplete pedigrees. Both simulation and theoretical results showed that when there is either no linkage or no association, the linkage and association statistics are not correlated. When there is linkage and association in the data, the two tests have a positive correlation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11062006-134924/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION OF A HYBRID WIND TURBINE-DIESEL MICROGRID POWER SYSTEM</field><field name="creator">Milani, Neil Patrick</field><field name="description">Nearly all off-grid, remote cold-weather facilities utilize diesel-only systems for both thermal and electrical power generation.

Major components of this defense are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Some AMPs are derived from larger proteins with other recognized functions (e.g., lactoferrin, histones). In this study, we demonstrate the expression of peptides homologous to the &#946;-chain of hemoglobin (Hb-&#946;), one of the two major subunits of this respiratory protein. These Hb-&#946; peptides (Hb&#946;P-1, -2 and -3), isolated from gill of the economically important channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), had antibacterial activity and were upregulated in gill and skin epithelium in response to parasitic (Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, ich) infection. One peptide (Hb&#946;P-1), while having relatively weak antibacterial activity, had antiparasitic activity comparable to that of other potently antiparasitic AMPs. Also, this cidal activity was specifically directed against the trophozoite (trophont) stage of ich at a low concentration (6.2 ug/ml, 1.7 mM) but had no apparent effect on the disseminative (theront) stage or the reproductive (tomont) stage at the highest concentration tested (400 mg/ml, 108 mM). In addition, Hb&#946;P-1 was not lytic to channel catfish erythrocytes at the highest concentration tested (400 mg/ml, 108 mM). Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization of skin and gill from fish experimentally challenged with ich indicated that the Hb&#946;P-1 sequence was both synthesized and expressed in epithelial tissues of skin and gill, which are the target tissues for ich. ?Bug blots? of gill extracts from fish recovering from a bacterial infection suggested that upregulation of these Hb-&#946; related peptides might also occur with other infections. These findings, along with the recent discovery by others that Hb-&#946; is expressed in mammalian macrophages and alveolar epithelium, suggest that hemoglobin-derived AMPs might play a significant role in the non-specific immune response of vertebrates.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11062006-173910/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Ability in Goal Setting: A Re-specification of Ability and Task Complexity as Goal-Performance Moderators</field><field name="creator">Craven, Denise Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The present study sought integration of two well-documented relationships: the relationship between general mental ability and performance of complex tasks, and between goal characteristics and level of work performance. Goal-setting theory states that the impact of goal level (difficulty and specificity) on performance depends on the task?s complexity level. Past versions of the theory have also specified ability as a moderator of the goal-performance relationship. This study tested an alternative model of ability and task complexity as goal-performance moderators: a 3-way interaction among general mental ability (GMA), goal level, and task complexity. Undergraduate psychology students completed a class-scheduling task, which manipulated task complexity and goal difficulty at two levels each. Whereas main effects of task complexity and GMA were found, the 3-way interaction was not supported.

Several hypothetical treatment options, including fusion and different types of artificial disc replacements (ADR) were examined. The cases presented consisted of three one-degree of freedom artificial discs, three two-degrees of freedom artificial discs, one ideal three-degrees of freedom artificial disc, a degenerated disc, a fused disc and a healthy spine. The equations of motion were generated for a healthy lumbar spine using Lagrange?s equations and numerically integrated using Matlab&#174;. Results were obtained for all cases at two different levels, L4-L5 and L5-S1 in response to an impulsive force of 100N applied at L3 in the posterior anterior direction. In the 1-DOF ADR cases at the L4-L5 level, the shear ADR performed better than the other two ADR, while at the L5-S1 level, the rotational ADR performed better than the other two ADR, and significantly better than the fused vertebrae case since it matched the behavior of the healthy spine much more closely. All the other 1-DOF ADR provided little or no improvement when compared to the fused case. In the 2-DOF ADR cases, the shear rotational ADR behaved very similarly to the healthy spine when implanted at both levels, L4-L5 and L5-S1, showing a behavior that varied by less than 1% in the posterior anterior direction and flexion extension rotation and less than 10% in the axial displacement when compared to the behavior of a healthy spine. Overall, the results of this thesis indicate that implanting an artificial disc to replace a damaged disc offers more benefits for the spine than fusion since this allows the spine to behave closer to the natural healthy spine, and hence most likely cause less damage to adjacent discs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11062007-154437/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioral inhibition, behavioral activation, and spontaneous attribution.</field><field name="creator">Wrenn, Sara Cordelia</field><field name="description">Multilevel linear modeling was used to evaluate the effects of situation- and individual-level variables on participants? appraisals of event outcomes.

But the literature has identified several potential &#226;coupling&#226; mechanisms that suggest theory and practice are not in accord. Using both estimation and simulation methods, we analyze the effect of decoupled payments on farmers&#226; decisions in the presence of one such mechanism, credit constraints. Intuitively, as payments enhance the liquidity and/or the collateral of credit constrained farmers, additional investment in production is allowed to occur. We estimate the marginal effect of decoupled payments on total, owned, and pasture acres, and on acres of corn, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat and observe whether payments matter more for more leveraged farmers. Our ability to observe farms over time allows us to improve on the existing literature by controlling for farm-specific unobserved effects. In an effort to analyze the income stabilization aspect of these payments we further estimate their effect on farm household consumption expenditures. The significant acreage effects and insignificant marginal propensity to consume suggest payments are being not put to the policy makers&#226; intended use. We also extend the existing literature by using simulation methods in an expected utility maximization framework to evaluate the effects of doubling the amount of payments received and of recently proposed tighter payment limits on the typical Kansas wheat farmer&#226;s acreage and borrowing decisions. While tighter limits do not appear to matter, the collateral boosting effect of payments allows farmers to put more acres into production. Finally, we estimate the ability of farm characteristics to explain differences in crop yield performance. Our results reveal the potential for decoupled payments to boost relative yields and give an unfair advantage to their recipients. This may become an issue in future WTO discussions over the distortionary effects of decoupled payments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11062008-094354/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cover Crop Mulches for No-till Organically Managed Onion Production</field><field name="creator">Vollmer, Emily R.</field><field name="description">Combining the environmentally sound practices of reduced tillage and cover crop use with organic vegetable production systems requires management choices that are tailored to specific climate and crop combinations. In the southeastern U.S. summer cover crops can be grown through the fall until desiccation by frost. At this time a cash crop such as bulb onions (Allium cepa L.) can be grown using reduced tillage for over winter production. Field experiments were conducted on first year transitional (non-organic) land in 2006-07 and 2007-08. Cover crops of foxtail millet &#226;German Strain R&#226; [Setaria italica (L.) Beauv.] and cowpea &#226;Iron &amp; Clay&#226; [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] were grown as monocrops (MIL, COW) and biculture mixtures and compared to a bare ground control (BG). Mixtures of cowpea and millet consisted of seeding rates aimed at producing 70%, 50%, and 30% millet per total biculture biomass (MIX-70, MIX-50, MIX-30). Cover crop residue treatments were evaluated for weed suppression and N contribution to no-till organic onion production. Supplemental N in the form of surface applied soybean meal [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] was applied to cover crop treatment subplots at three rates: 0, 105, and 210 kg N&#226;ha-1. Onion yields increased linearly from 0 to 210 kg N&#226;ha-1 rates of soybean meal. Cover crop treatments COW and BG had the greatest total marketable onion yield and were statistically equivalent both years. Losses in marketable yield were primarily due to mortality in MIL and MIX in 2006-07 and bolting across all cover crop treatments, which averaged 28% in 2006-07 and 72% in 2007-08. Onion mortality was over 50% in MIL and MIX treatments in 2006-07 and was attributed to physical properties of thick surface mulch. Onion mortality in 2007-08 was highest on MIL compared to all other cover crop treatments but remained below 20%. Weed interference during onion production was highest in COW and lowest in treatments with millet (MIL, MIX) in 2006-07. Nitrogen rates of 105 and 210 kg N&#226;ha-1 increased soil mineral N (NO3- and NH4+) on BG plots two weeks after surface application of soybean meal at the end of November each year but generally ceased to have an effect on soil mineral N by February or March. The 105 kg N&#226;ha-1 soybean meal rate appeared to be more than sufficient for use as a starter fertilizer. Split applications of soybean meal could be an important improvement in N management to avoid N leaching and better meet increased N uptake demand during bulb initiation and growth in the spring. Overall, this study shows that cowpea cover crops grown preceding an over-wintered no-till allium crop is feasible with appropriate management, and provides onion yield comparable to bare ground production.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11062008-105026/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selection of Dairy Cow Families For Superior Ferttility</field><field name="creator">Vierhout, Crystal Nadine</field><field name="description">The objective of this study was to determine if dairy cow families could be used to select for superior pregnancy rate. Holstein cow records in 13 southern states were obtained from Animal Improvement Laboratory of USDA. Cows were included from historical records dating back to birth year of 1981 or 1982 as the foundation cows. Historical records included cows calving and completing lactations through August, 2005. Cows from various generations were then put in maternal family groups using dam identification within herd. Standardized milk production and pregnancy rate (based on days open) deviations were obtained within herd-year-season. A family value was calculated by averaging the first and second lactations across parity by degree of relationship to the individual (free of progeny information) for generation one though four. Each family entered into one of three groups based on average deviations milk production, pregnancy rate, and combining pregnancy rate and milk into a selection index. Analysis was performed on fifth generation members to determine if milk production and pregnancy rates in the fifth generation were significantly associated with historical performance of the respective cow families. Average of the standardized values for milk production has improved (8,542 to 10,275 kg) from generation one to five while pregnancy rate decreased from (26.91 to 18.28) in the same period for cow families having daughters represented in the fifth generation. After adjustments for sire predicted transmitting ability (PTA), maternal-grandsire PTA, and family group for milk or pregnancy rate in the model the effect of maternal cow family remained highly significant for pregnancy rate (P &lt; 0.05, R2=0.0759) and milk production (P &lt; 0.05, R2=0.1192) when single trait selection was utilized. Utilizing a selection index with equal weights for milk and pregnancy rate the effect of the maternal cow family remained significant (P &lt; 0.05, R2=0.0208) but pregnancy rate was not significant (P &gt; 0.05, R2=0.0106). The findings provide evidence that pregnancy rate and milk production are inherited through the maternal lineage. Thus, there may be potential economic value in considering maternal family history for pregnancy rate when selecting future bull dams.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science and Poultry Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11062008-114256/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population dynamics and dispersal gradient of Aphelenchoides fragariae in the woody ornamental Lantana camera.</field><field name="creator">Kohl, Lisa Michelle</field><field name="description">Foliar nematodes (Aphelenchoides fragariae) infect ornamental crops in greenhouse and nursery production. The objectives of this research were to study A. fragariae population dynamics in a woody ornamental, Lantana camara, during the growing season and during overwintering in a commercial nursery, and to determine the dispersal gradient of A. fragariae in a nursery with overhead irrigation. In the 2006, 2007, and 2008 growing seasons symptomatic, asymptomatic, and defoliated leaf samples were taken throughout a study plot of 30 lantana plants (Lantana camara) infected with foliar nematodes at a commercial nursery in North Carolina. Air temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall data were recorded at the nursery. Over the growing season, nematode densities per gram of fresh weight leaf tissue were low in May and June, and then reached a peak in July, with 122 nematodes/g in July 2006, 406 nematodes/g in July 2007, and 180 nematodes/g in July 2008. Nematode densities decreased over the rest of the summer, except for October 2007 when a second peak occurred. Nematode densities in symptomatic leaves were positively correlated with daily high temperatures and daily low temperatures, while nematode density in asymptomatic leaves were positively correlated to daily low temperatures and relative humidity. Nematode densities in defoliated leaf samples were positively correlated to relative humidity, daily low temperatures, and daily high temperatures. Leaves were also collected during the 2006-7 and 2007-8 overwintering seasons, when the 30 lantana plants were moved to a polyhouse. During overwintering nematode counts remained low in the three different types of leaf tissue, but nematodes were still detected throughout the overwintering season. In 2007 and 2008 a dispersal gradient for foliar nematodes was examined during the summer at a research nursery by spacing healthy plants at a distance of 0 (touching), 30, or 100 cm from an A. fragariae-infected source plant. After 11 weeks in 2007, 100% of the plants at the 0 cm from the inoculum source were infected, while only 10% of the plants at the 30 cm distance and 5% of the plants at the 100 cm distance were infected. In 2008 100% of the plants at the 0 cm spacing became infected after 12 weeks, and 5% of the plants at the 30 cm spacing became infected.

The power perspective suggests that unequal power relationships encourage potential migrants to rely on social capital from members of the dominant group, typically men. Conversely, the homophily perspective posits that relatively equal power relations may allow a tendency for gender homophily in social capital use to become evident. Because evidence for the power perspective comes largely from Mexico and evidence for the homophily perspective comes from Thailand, these perspectives must be tested in an alternative national context to determine their generalizability and the extent to which power differentials mask a tendency towards gender homophily in migrant social networks.

They have many biological and ecological functions. Over the past many years, numerous efforts have been made to determine the biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanins and also to identify several regulatory proteins mainly in flowers and fruits of model plants and crop plants. However, many questions concerning the metabolism of anthocyanins in foliage remains unsolved. One example is &#226;How can developmental processes impact on accumulation patterns of anthocyanins in leaves&#226;. In this study, we choose several cultivars from one of the most popular ornamental plants Acer palmatum Thunb. to understand the mechanism of developmental changes of pigmentation in leaf. Several other maple species were also analyzed. We propose that the metabolism of anthocyanins play an essential role in such changes. We use an integrated approach of phytochemistry and metabolic profiling to determine the biosynthesis and metabolism of anthocyanins and their impacts on foliage color. Proanthocyanidin analysis was carried out as well to determine their relationship to both anthocyanin production and foliar coloration. We have found that even for green leaves with no/trace amount of detectable anthocyanins, the biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanidin/proanthocyanidin is still activated. Our results indicate that metabolic channeling directing the anthocyanin pathway to the proanthocyanidin biosynthesis plays a very important role in pigmentation pattern change along developmental processes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11062009-103243/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Explaining the Gender Gap in Capital-Enhancing Website Use: The Effect of Male-Oriented Website Content</field><field name="creator">Solebello, Nicholas Paul</field><field name="description">The Internet has grown rapidly over the past two decades and researchers continue to discuss the potential benefits of Internet use depending on how an individual utilizes it. Researchers argue that a large part of the advantages from Internet use stem from visiting capital-enhancing websites that provide individuals with educational, financial, occupational or networking opportunities that help cultivate human, cultural, and social capital. Despite these prospective benefits, previous literature finds that women lag behind men in overall frequency and variety of capital-enhancing website use. This article extends the literature on capital-enhancing website use by testing two possible explanations for why the gender gap exists: 1) the unequal division of household labor, and 2) non-capital-enhancing website content geared towards men. The findings from an analysis of General Social Survey (GSS) data from 2000-2004 indicate that the gendered content of Internet websites may play a large role in determining women and men&#226;s capital-enhancing website use.

Agricultural activities, livestock production in particular, have been reported to be the largest contributor of ammonia emissions into the atmosphere. Accurate estimation of ammonia emission rate from individual operations or sources is important and yet a challenging task for both regulatory agencies and animal producers. The overall research objective of this study was to develop an emission model which can be used to estimate ammonia emission from broiler litter. In the reported model, the ammonia flux is essentially a function of the litter's total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) content, moisture content, pH, and temperature, as well as the Freundlich partition coefficient (Kf), mass transfer coefficient (KG), ventilation rate (Q), and emission surface area (A). A dynamic flow-through chamber system and a wind tunnel were designed to measure ammonia fluxes from broiler litter. The dynamic flow-through chamber experiments evaluated the reported model with various litter samples under a constant temperature and wind profile. The wind tunnel experiments evaluated the reported model under various temperatures and wind profiles. Model parameters such as Kf and KG were estimated. The results from the two experiments were consistent with each other. The estimated KG ranged from 1.11 to 27.64 m h-1, and the estimated Kf ranged from 0.56 to 4.48 L kg-1. Regression sub-models were developed to estimate Kf as a function of litter pH and temperature and to estimate KG as a function of air velocity and temperature. Sensitivity analysis of the model showed that ammonia flux is very sensitive to litter pH and to a lesser extent temperature.

We predicted that landowners would have low knowledge levels of woody biomass but, as a result of participating in the training, would increase knowledge, have more positive attitudes, and develop aspirations to harvest woody biomass on their land. Results, based on 395 returned surveys, confirmed these hypotheses, thus strengthening the perception of the importance of woody biomass educational programs as a component of renewable energy adoption plans. However, while the majority of landowners reported that the information gained was beneficial, we found that landowners would like more specific information before committing to participate in emerging woody biomass markets. Outreach to minority and traditionally underserved landowners also requires considerable development. If Extension professionals do not make a conscious effort to reach out to these populations they will be effectively excluded from this woody biomass market opportunity. These findings will assist Extension agents and other adult educators, policy makers, and energy or timber industry professionals to make informed decisions when developing policies and programs concentrated on woody biomass harvesting for energy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11062009-141236/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional Behavioral Assessment in Consultation: A Comparsion of Verbal Communication Patterns</field><field name="creator">Franks, Athena Elaine</field><field name="description">Verbal communication allows individuals to share information during consultation. Although there have been several studies investigating verbal communication patterns in traditional behavioral consultation, there have been very few investigating verbal behavior in its newer variants. Thus, the purpose of this study was to document and compare consultants&#226; message control and relevant content used in two types of school-based behavioral consultation. The first type of consultation was considered a traditional behavioral/ &#226;consultation as usual&#226; model. The second type was behavioral consultation with an added functional behavioral assessment (FBA) component, which involves a comprehensive method of assessing a client&#226;s behavior through closely examining antecedents and consequences of the behavior (DuPaul et al., 2006; Jitendra et al., 2007). Verbal communication patterns in 16 Problem Identification Interviews were coded using the Consultation Analysis Record (Bergan &amp; Tombari, 1975). Two hypotheses were posed: (a) consultants in the consultation condition with FBA would use greater message control than those consultants in the traditional behavioral consultation condition, and (b) consultants in the FBA condition would discuss more behaviorally-related topics than consultants in the traditional condition. Findings revealed that consultants did not use more message control in the FBA condition than in the traditional consultation condition. In fact, there was an indication that more control was used in the &#226;consultation as usual&#226; condition. Thus, the first hypothesis was not supported. However, as expected, findings indicated that consultants do cover more behavioral-related topics in the consultation condition with FBA. Future research considerations and limitations were discussed. Implications were provided, but are limited due to the small n, exploratory nature of the study.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11062009-154132/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Discovery of Causal Variants in Genetic Association Studies</field><field name="creator">Dickson, Samuel Price</field><field name="description">In recent years population-based association studies have been advocated as the most powerful method of discovering genetic loci that are associated with heritable traits, particularly for complex traits that are likely caused by a variety of factors including environmental effects and multiple genetic loci. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have already yielded a large number of such associations, but there is growing concern that the results of these studies are not explaining as much genetic variation as they were expected to. Chapter 2 discusses tagging and imputation to leverage the information available on commercial genotyping chips to make inferences about variants found in large reference samples such as those made available by the International HapMap Consortium. Transferability of multi-marker tagging is assessed. Tagging and imputation are compared, and a method of using tagging to select a reduced tag set to be used for imputation. Chapter 3 details how multiple low frequency causal variants can create synthetic associations among more common variants and may be responsible for many of the genome-wide associations that have already been observed. Examples of synthetic associations are demonstrated in congenital deafness and sickle-cell anemia. Chapter 4 examines issues related to combining samples of diverse genetic ancestry for analysis in genetic association studies. Through simulation it is shown that type I error can be controlled and power increased using statistical methods to account for differences in populations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics and Statistics (Co-major)</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11062009-155400/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance Analysis and Strategic Management of Longitudinal Pavement Markings</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Guanghua</field><field name="description">This research evaluated longitudinal pavement marking performance and developed useful degradation models for paint pavement markings which can help transportation agencies meet the pending FHWA minimum retroreflectivity requirements. The impacts of several important factors (such as directionality, pavement type and roughness) on marking retroreflectivity were evaluated. With a large dataset in hand, we determined whether these factors had significant impacts on marking retroreflectivity. Paint pavement marking centerline retroreflectivity values measured in the direction of paint striping were found to be significantly higher than the values measured in the opposite direction. The mean values of the retroreflectivity measurements collected on the plant mixed pavements were found to be significantly larger than the values collected on the bituminous surface treatment (BST) pavements. Image processing techniques were used to analyze paint pavement marking surface glass bead density. Bead density values were found to have a positive correlation with marking retroreflectivity measurements. Higher glass bead density led to higher marking retroreflectivity. The research also compared existing marking retroreflectivity degradation models. A linear mixed effects model (LMEM) was selected as most appropriate for the paint marking retroreflectivity data. LMEMs were established for paint pavement markings based on the data collected in NC. The research outcomes can help transportation agencies have a better understanding of paint pavement marking performance, which can lead to cost savings by maximizing the marking service lifecycles.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11062009-155546/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations of Retrodirective Array Transponders.</field><field name="creator">Shah, Rachana</field><field name="description">Retrodirective arrays, when illuminated by an interrogator signal, transmit a signal back towards the interrogator in the same direction as the incoming signal, without any prior knowledge of the source direction.

Using Hierarchal Linear Modeling (HLM), the findings of the analyses suggest that less experienced officers and those officers working in patrol districts where members are more highly trained issue more African American citations than more experienced officers and officers working in patrol districts where members are less trained. The findings also indicate that the effect of length of service on the outcome measure varies by the officer?s race. The racial threat analyses suggest that there is racial disparity in the issuance of citations and that the extent of the disparity steadily increases as the representation of African Americans in the driving population increases.

A network simulator was developed using the C++ language for this study. The simulator supports any input topology with single or multi-fiber links, many routing schemes (static, alternate and dynamic), dynamic traffic loads, and may be modified easily to accomodate different wavelength-assignment policies. The signaling messages used, in our study, to establish lightpaths, follow the Constrained-Routing Label Distribution Protocol (CR-LDP) semantics. The problem studied here falls under the general category of Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) Problem which has been proved to be NP-hard. Previous studies have mostly considered static routing (with static or dynamic traffic demand), and static traffic demand (with static or alternate routing) under zero propagation delays. A few papers in the recent past have studied the effect of signaling delays but have been limited in scope. We study the effect of varying holding times, compare random versus first-fit wavelength assignment policy, compare fixed versus alternate routing, compare backward wavelength reservation schemes to forward reservation schemes, and lastly study the effect of traffic loads. We find that, in general, the random wavelength assignment policy performs better than first-fit policy and that under certain conditions, alternate routing scheme performs worse than fixed routing scheme.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Networking</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11072002-192327/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TRAINING AS A MODERATOR IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TEACHERS?

An inclusion support scale was used to determine teachers? support for inclusion. It was predicted that teachers? perceptions of their school staff?s training would moderate the relationship between teachers? perceptions of staff?s available time and their support for moving toward more inclusive practices at their school. Although teachers? perceptions of their school staff?s available time were related to their perceptions of inclusion, the relationship was not moderated by teachers? perceptions of their school staff?s training. The current study also examined teachers? ratings of the helpfulness of 21 inclusion strategies. A reduction of class size based on the needs of the classroom was rated most often as a helpful inclusion strategy, and an exploratory factor analysis revealed support for a three-factor model. Results are discussed in terms of implications for effective strategies to support teachers in inclusive classrooms and future research on teachers? perceptions of inclusion.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11072006-161256/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nanocrystalline Diamond Deposition for Friction Applications</field><field name="creator">Winfrey, A. Leigh</field><field name="description">The structure and morphology of nanocrystalline diamond films, grown on single side polished silicon (100) wafers by microwave plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition in Ar-H-CH4 plasma, with varying hydrogen concentrations, were analyzed and examined using Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, near edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction. Visible Raman spectra, XRD data, and NEXAFS spectra exhibit fingerprints for NCD films. Broad bands at 1350 and 1520-1580 cm-1 with shoulders at 1100-1150 cm-1 and 1430-1470 cm-1 and a shoulder at 1150cm-1 are evident in the Raman spectra. The XRD analysis reveals small grain sizes, 5 to 10 nm. The NEXAFS spectra discussed in this thesis are similar to characteristic NCD spectra in the literature and show distinct diamond character. Friction performance was studied using Pin-on-Disk and Reciprocating sliding tribometry with sapphire counterfaces. Tribological performance of nanocrystalline diamond coatings was not influenced by coating roughness over the range studied (20 ? 60 nm); however, the coating performance was influenced by coating chemistry. High friction run-in was minimized and a low final friction coefficient &lt;0.05 was measured. These coatings exhibited good wear resistance for sliding against sapphire hemispheres. Their performance was correlated to their properties and structure, which were also studied. Plasma modeling and optical emission spectroscopy revealed plasma parameters, electron plasma temperature and number density, consistent with published results.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11072007-160302/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of High School Soccer Competitive Team Selection on Athletic Identity, Expectations for Success and Subjective Task Value</field><field name="creator">Diaz, Stephanie Mary Cerow</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to examine the relationship between athletic identity and two variables from the expectancy-value theory, expectations for success and subjective task value, in the context of high school soccer competitive team selection. The quantitative research design integrated historical and emerging theoretical perspectives on identity development in an effort to add insight to the relationships between the theoretical perspectives. The quasi-experimental research design included the self-administration of paper and pencil questionnaires on three occasions over the course of approximately four weeks. Males and females competing for selection to their high school soccer teams in Central Florida comprised the study sample. Significant positive correlations were found between participants&#226; athletic identity, expectations for success and subjective task value throughout competitive team selection. Participants&#226; athletic identity remained relatively stable over time; yet, significant increases in expectations for success and significant decreases for subjective task value were detected. Additional findings were: the varsity&#226;s athletic identity and expectations for success were significantly higher than junior varsity and not selected groups; the female junior-varsity&#226;s subjective task value was significantly lower than female-varsity and male-junior varsity groups; seniors reported higher expectations for success than freshmen; the upper division reported higher expectations for success than the lower division, whereas, the lower division reported higher subjective task value than the upper division. In consideration of the study&#226;s limitations, recommendations for the field and for future research are provided. The findings provide a basis to forge an empirical connection between the construct of athletic identity and the expectancy-value theory model of achievement-related behavior in a sports domain. Moreover, the lack of significant gender differences may indicate that socially supportive environments may foster female athleticism, including confirmation of athletic identity and sport-related expectations for success.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11072008-064237/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM Survival in Acidified Yogurts</field><field name="creator">Trahan, Caitlin Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM is a probiotic culture widely added to dairy products and dietary supplements. The bacterium has been linked with immune modulation, cold prevention in humans, and relief of gut pain via a morphine like mechanism in animals. Industrially, the target for delivery of viable cells in a 6 oz. serving of yogurt at the end of a 52 day shelf-life is 2 x 106 CFU/g. Survival studies with an industrial yogurt formulation showed that counts of NCFM fell to less than 102 CFU/g at the end of shelf-life. The objective of this study was to investigate the reasons for the dramatic loss of viability during shelf-life, and define a solution that could maintain viability throughout shelf-life. Levels of NCFM were followed in fermented yogurts at pH 4.1, 4.7 and 5.0. Results showed that with inoculation levels of 108 CFU/ml, NCFM added at the outset of fermentation maintained survival in yogurts acidified at pH 4.7 and 5.0. NCFM showed poor survival in yogurts acidified to pH 4.1, exhibiting a 3 log loss after 48 days. The possible effects of cell injury in lyophilized Lb. acidophilus NCFM cells were also investigated. Cells subjected to a 60 minute resuscitation period in MRS media, prior to addition to acidified yogurt base at pH 4.1, showed only a ~1.5 log loss after 42 days. Survival of NCFM in yogurt was compromised at acidic conditions below pH 4.7 and a recovery period of the lyophilized cells can greatly improve survival.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11072008-084635/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whey Permeate, Delactosed Permeate, and Delactosed Whey as Ingredients to Lower Sodium Content of Cream Based Soups</field><field name="creator">Dixon, Elizabeth Marie</field><field name="description">The use of whey permeates as salt substitutes can help to decrease sodium and chloride intake, increase potassium, calcium and magnesium intakes and decrease hypertension risk. Five different whey permeates from 5 different manufacturers were analyzed with ICP for mineral content (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn). Two permeates are powder and three are liquid. Lactose and protein content were also analyzed by Lactose/D-Glucose UV kit from Roche and BCA protein assay, respectively. Chloride and phosphate were measured spectrophotometrically. Basic tastes and aromas were quantified by a trained sensory panel. Based on the highest &#226;salty taste&#226; identified by the trained sensory panel, one liquid and one solid permeate were further investigated as sodium substitutes. The sodium content of the guideline solutions for comparing salty taste of the permeates were used to calculate the equivalent concentrations of salt and permeate for salty taste in aqueous solution. Two soup formulations were used to test the use of permeate as a salt substitute; one retorted, canned, condensed cream soup base, and one fresh cream soup base. Each formulation of soup was tested on a separate day by 75 consumer panelists who averaged between 20 and 30 years of age. Four samples were given each day 0%, 50%, 100% of the standard salt content in condensed soup, and permeate at a content calculated to be equal in salty taste to the standard salt content. The permeate soup was ranked in salty taste slightly lower than the 50% sample for the fresh soup. In the retorted soups, the permeate was ranked slightly higher than the 50% sample. However, the fresh and retorted soup formulations made from permeate actually contained 11% and 19% sodium as compared to the 100% salt recipe, respectively. The permeate soup was described as higher in salty taste than expected based on actual sodium content, but not as high as predicted from the salty taste of the permeate in aqueous solution. Potassium and magnesium levels were increased in the formulations with permeate. This research gives an optimistic view on the possibility of whey permeates and their capability of replacing sodium in cream soups and other processed foods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11072008-113327/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power and Status with Small Groups: An Analysis of Students' Verbal and Nonverbal Behavior and Responses to One Another</field><field name="creator">Morris, Lynnae Carol</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research has been to determine the influence of verbal and nonverbal behavior on power and status within small groups. The interactions which took place within five small groups of students in a middle school spatial reasoning elective were analyzed. Verbal responses to requests for help were analyzed using sequential analysis software. Results indicated that the identity of the child asking a question or requesting help in some form or another is a better predictor of whether he/she will receive help than the type of questions he/she asks. Nonverbal behavior was analyzed for social gestures, body language, and shifts in possession of tools. Each nonverbal act was coded as either ?positive? (encouraging participation) or ?negative? (discouraging participation); and, the researchers found that in groups in which there was unequal participation and less ?help? provided among peers (according to the verbal analysis results) there tended to be more ?negative? nonverbal behavior demonstrated than in groups in which ?shared talk time? and ?helping behavior? were common characteristics of the norm. The combined results from the analyses of the verbal and nonverbal behavior of students within small groups were then reviewed through the conflict, power, status perspective of small group interactions in order to determine some common characteristics of high functioning (collaborative) and low functioning (non-collaborative) groups. Some common characteristics of the higher functioning groups include: few instances of conflict, shared ?talk time? and decision making, inclusive leadership, frequent use of encouraging social gestures and body language, and more sharing of tools than seizing; while, some shared traits among the lower functioning groups include: frequent occurrences of interpersonal conflict, a focus on process (rather than content), persuasive or alienating leadership, unequal participation and power, frequent use of discouraging social gestures and body language, and more seizing of tools than sharing. While ?functionality? was easily defined, labeling groups according to this characteristic proved to be a more difficult task. Although there was clearly a ?highest functioning? and a ?lowest functioning? group among the five, the other three groups fell somewhere in between these two, along a continuum (dependent upon the day).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Science Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11082007-042527/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alternatives to the Americium-Beryllium Neutron Source for the Compensated Neutron Porosity Log</field><field name="creator">Peeples, Cody Ryan</field><field name="description">Monte Carlo simulations of neutron porosity logs were performed to examine the possibility of replacing the standard Americium-Beryllium neutron source.

Appropriate conditions for in vitro osteogenesis need to be identified to establish protocols for engineering bone tissues. The success of in vitro osteogenesis lies on the type of cell source, stimuli, and scaffold material used for engineering bone constructs. Recent investigations have established the pluripotency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their ability to differentiate down a multitude of pathways including osteogenenic. In vivo studies have shown that MSCs are primarily responsible for bone growth and regeneration and therefore have become a major candidate for bone tissue engineering. Osteogenic differentiation of MSCs via chemical stimuli has been extensively investigated using both monolayer and three-dimensional (3D) culture conditions. These investigations provided useful information on media conditions, cell seeding densities, and differentiation capabilities of MSCs. However, chemical stimulation alone might not be sufficient to accelerate osteogenesis and impart necessary mechanical strength to the final tissue construct. Mechanical strength of the final tissue construct is vital to maintain its structural integrity when exposed to physiological stresses in vivo. Stimulation of MSCs using mechanical strain might provide another method to induce MSC osteogenesis while also obtaining desired mechanical strength of the final tissue constructs. Although in vivo studies and experimental models have indicated that cyclic tensile strain could induce MSC osteogenesis, its effect on MSC osteogenesis in 3D cultures in vitro has not been investigated. The need to maintain cell viability and be able to provide chemical or mechanical cues to cells in 3D cultures requires improvements in scaffold architecture and design. While collagen provides a natural matrix for cell adhesion and growth, its contraction during culture can greatly limit culture duration and mechanical stability of the matrix. Although fibrous scaffolds can be used as an alternative to collagen scaffolds, insufficient media diffusion to the center of these 3D scaffolds could detrimentally affect uniform cell growth throughout the scaffold; hence, scaffolds with better diffusional properties need to be developed. This study investigated the use of 3D collagen matrices as a scaffold material to determine the effects of strain and chemical stimuli on osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs (hMSCs). Major attention was given to the analyses of: cell viability, matrix contraction, nuclei morphology, expression of osteogenic markers and proinflammatory cytokines, as well as changes in mechanical properties of the final tissue construct. As an approach to develop 3D fibrous scaffolds with enhanced diffusional properties, fabrication of melt spun microporous fibers using a blend of poly (lactic acid) (PLA) and sulfopolyester that could be used in 3D nonwoven scaffolds was also investigated. The findings of this study clearly illustrated the ability of cyclic tensile strain to induce osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs when cultured in a 3D environment. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines by strained hMSCs suggested that cyclic strain might have induced modulation of bone resorption in hMSCs. The results also illustrated the effects of strain on the mechanical properties of the final tissue construct. Microporous fibers created from melt spun composite fibers using binary blends of poly (lactic acid) and sulfopolyester could enhance diffusional properties of 3D nonwoven scaffolds fabricated using these fibers. As this body of work demonstrates, use of cyclic tensile strain combined with chemical stimulation to induce osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs could greatly assist the engineering of functional bone tissues in vitro. Microporous fibers created using polymer blends could provide an effective method to improve diffusional properties of 3D polymeric scaffolds.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiber and Polymer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11092006-132359/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of Nycodenz gradient on enrichment and culture of perinatal porcine spermatogonial stem cells</field><field name="creator">Miller, Stephanie Renee</field><field name="description">The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a Nycodenz gradient enrichment method to enrich a dissociated single cell suspension of porcine testicular cells for spermatogonia, and to observe the separated fractions from the gradient over a 14-day culture period for cell viability and number of spermatogonia in culture.

This radionuclide is typically produced through the O-18(p,n)F-18 reaction by proton bombardment of O-18-enriched water. Thermosyphon batch targets have been proposed as a means to increase F-18 production due to their enhanced heat rejection capabilities. These boiling targets have been operated with up to 3.2 kW of beam power with manageable O-18 enriched water volumes. The purpose of this research project has been to develop computational methods which can be used to design new targets with enhanced production capabilities. The computational methods developed in this work were used to design a low power thermosyphon production target for the Duke Medical Center cyclotron. This design was modeled to be range thick, and operate within the desired margins for beam powers in excess of 1 kW, the operating limit of the Duke cyclotron. A sensitivity analysis of the computational methods was performed which indicated the model is most sensitive to the boiling and condensing heat transfer coefficients. Even with a high uncertainty in these coefficients, the target should still operate well within the desired margins.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11092006-180341/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flora, Plant Communities, and Soils of a Significant Natural Area in the Middle Atlantic Coastal Plain (Craven County, North Carolina)</field><field name="creator">Elam, Caitlin Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Cool Springs Environmental Education Center (CSEEC), owned by Weyerhaeuser Company, includes a 591 ha State Significant Natural Area.

Observation of electrical switching, for example, fueled early interest in a-chalcogenides. More recently a-chalcogenide switching has been applied successfully to programmable memory devices as well as DVD technology where the quest for the discovery of better-suited materials continues. Thus, switching grants researchers today with an active arena of technological as well as fundamental study. Bond constraint theory (BCT) and rigidity theory provide a powerful framework for understanding the structure and properties of a-materials. Application of these theories to switching in a-chalcogenides holds the promise of finding the best composition suited for switching applications. Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy is an ideally suited technique to investigate the switching properties of these materials. Films of amorphous Ge2Sb2Te4, Ge2Sb2Te5, and Ge2Sb2Te7 exhibit differing bonding structures and bond statistics, which result in different electronic and optical properties. Results of new EXAFS experiments on these three critical compositions in the Ge-Sb-Te system are presented in light of BCT and rigidity theory.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11092007-145505/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays on Economic Variability, Dynamics of Adjustment, and Exchange Rate Flexibility</field><field name="creator">Al-Abri, Almukhtar Saif</field><field name="description">This dissertation revisits the literature on the role of exchange rate flexibility in smoothing the adjustments of the economy to different disturbances. Recently, the role of flexible exchange rates in stabilizing the economy against real shocks has been challenged by the new open economy models, which build on some empirical regularities, such as the low pass-through from nominal exchange rates to import prices. We take three approaches in an attempt to enrich this literature. Firstly, we incorporate factors of production into welfare analyses of fully-specified general equilibrium models. We find flexible exchange rate regimes reduce terms of trade and consumption volatility for primary commodity economies, particularly oil-exporting. Secondly, in an empirical investigation, using a panel Vector Autoregressive Regression of nine of the OECD?s major oil-importing countries and the Reinhart and Rogoff?s de facto classification of exchange rate regimes, we find support for the hypothesis that flexible exchange regimes better absorb oil-price shocks. We also document feedback from the real effective exchange rate and inflation rate to the domestic-currency real oil price shocks, supporting the growing notion that oil price shocks are not purely exogenous to developed economies. Thirdly, in a micro-level empirical investigation, we find a significant improvement in estimating the degree of nominal exchange rate pass-through to import prices when the adjustment costs and the equilibrium degree of pass-through assumptions are considered. More specifically, using a vector threshold cointegration model, we find increases in both the initial reaction and the long-run equilibrium response of import prices to nominal exchange rate changes for five industries in 16 OECD countries, especially for the manufacturing industry.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11102005-123721/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EMPLOYEE TRAITS, PERCEIVED ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT, SUPERVISORY COMMUNICATION, AFFECTIVE COMMITMENT, AND INTENT TO LEAVE: GROUP DIFFERENCES</field><field name="creator">Yoshimura, Kari Emi</field><field name="description">This study explored the implications a diversifying workforce may have on employee attitudes, perceptions, and intention to leave the organization. Employee responses to an annual company survey (N=2838) were analyzed to determine whether demographic groups differed in perceptions of organizational support and supervisory communication, organizational commitment, and intention to leave. Demographic groups of interest included gender, job classification, and race. Age and tenure differences were also studied. The study also examined the relationship between perceived organizational support, affective commitment, perceived supervisory communication, and intention to leave. The predictive relationship between perceived organizational support, affective commitment, perceived supervisory communication, and employee demographics with intention to leave was also explored. Results of this study suggest that gender differences are diminishing in the current workforce. Further, it suggests that meaningful group differences are not prevalent in the sample analyzed. Affective commitment, perceived organizational support, and supervisory communication were shown to be positively related. Employees who intended to leave could not be consistently identified by their attitudes, perceptions, and demographic information using discriminant function analysis.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11112003-134047/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In Praise of Michelle Cliff's Creolite</field><field name="creator">Hyatt, Quincey Michelle</field><field name="description">Focusing on feminism, language, and history, this thesis explores the ways in which the theories of creolization set forth in Michelle Cliff's novels, Abeng (1984), No Telephone to Heaven (1987), and Free Enterprise (1990), explain existence in an increasingly cross-cultural world.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11122002-152547/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CLASSIFICATION AND MODELING OF INTERNET APPLICATIONS</field><field name="creator">Patel, Parita</field><field name="description">The classification of Internet traffic is an active research topic due to its applicability in the areas like differentiated services and network security. The introduction of voice, video and other real-time applications to the Internet has resulted in increasing demand for service differentiation and has triggered the need for change in traffic handling on the Internet. Traditionally, such a classification is done using the packet header field of ?port number,? which is a unique number associated with the application that generated the packet. In addition to adding complexity and extra computation in traffic handling, certain recent developments in networking techniques have rendered port numbers unreliable for this purpose. This motivates our scheme of classification that uses the distribution of packet sizes in a buffer or collected during a short time interval at a switch or a router. We demonstrate that the applications can be classified by these distributions. This ?implicit? classification builds a foundation for estimation and prediction of traffic mix, which is a long-term goal of this research project.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11122003-221659/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multipliers for the Lower Central Series of Strictly Upper Triangular Matrices</field><field name="creator">Levy, Louis Agnew</field><field name="description">Lie algebra multipliers and their properties is a recent area of study.

The purpose of this work is to discuss key metrics that help to quantify the improvements among technology nodes, specifically a comparison between TFETs and traditional MOSFETs.

Despite the apparent accessibility of the phenomena of interest, namely, the motion of sand under the forcing of waves and currents, the predictive capability of existing models for nearshore evolution is poor. A detailed study of the forces exerted on individual sand grains is undertaken in an effort to elucidate sediment transport mechanisms in the surf zone. New results indicate that fluid acceleration is a particularly important feature of surf zone transport; likewise, the processes of particle size segregation and the role of particle shape are newly explored. The study methodology employs computer simulations that describe the collective and individual motions of discrete particles immersed in a Newtonian fluid having essentially arbitrary density and viscosity. In this study all particle properties are those of quartz sand, and the fluid properties correspond to saltwater at 20&#176; C. Such discrete-particle models, having a basis in molecular dynamics studies, have a broad range of applications in addition to the sedimentological one of interest here; for example, similar methodologies have been applied to traffic flow, schooling fish, crowd control, and other problems in which the particulate nature of the phenomenon is of critical importance.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11132002-065631/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Verification of the Weathered Rock Model for P-y Curves</field><field name="creator">Nixon, Joseph Blair</field><field name="description">Four full-scale field lateral load tests were conducted to independently verify the Weathered Rock Model for P-y Curves published by Cho (2002). Class A performance predictions were developed and presented to North Carolina Department of Transportation officials prior to testing. Performance predictions were calculated using the Weathered Rock Model, Reese&#161;&#175;s Method for P-y Curves in Weak Rock (Reese, 1997), and the Stiff Clay Model (Reese, Cox, and Koop, 1975). Field testing was conducted on two sites in Durham County, North Carolina; both sites were located within the Durham Triassic Basin. Two fully instrumented drilled shafts were constructed at each site; the instrumentation plan allowed for the measurement of top deflections, head rotation, shaft deflection and strain with depth. Results obtained from each test shaft are compared with respective Class A performance predictions. Results of verification testing show that the Weathered Rock Model can be used to accurately model the lateral deflection behavior of drilled shafts embedded in weathered rock profiles. Distribution of the subgrade reaction evaluated from testing results is compared with that published by Cho (2002) for other types of weathered rock. The magnitude of the increase in the subgrade reaction below the point of rotation for Triassic Weathered Rock is not as significant as that realized by Cho (2002). Recommended design procedures for using the Weathered Rock Model with either rock dilatometer data or geologic data are presented.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11132002-203833/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Atomic and Electronic Structure of Interfaces in Materials Systems for Future Semiconductor Devices</field><field name="creator">Lopatin, Sergei</field><field name="description">Because of the intrinsic limits of the Si/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; based industry, there is a great trend towards the monolithic integration of new materials into already well developed silicon technology. Having lasted for several decades now, downscaling reaches the limit, in which a critical device dimension approaches the size of one atom. At this level of the miniaturization, it is not the bulk material, but the interface between the two materials that what controls the properties of the resulting optoelectronic device. Thus, the characterization of precise atomic arrangements at different interfaces and the influence of these arrangements on the optoelectronic properties of interfaces is required. Therefore, in this study, a combination of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques and density functional theory calculations was used as a research tool for the characterization of interfaces. The STEM instruments used for the study were equipped with prototypes of spherical aberration correctors, enabling to achieve the highest resolution currently available both in space and energy. The combination of experimental and theoretical methods was applied to study interfaces between Si/GaAs, Si/Ge, Ge/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Si/HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Si/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. As the result of the present research, a new dislocation configuration at the Si/GaAs interface was reported for the first time. The influence of this dislocation structure on the electrical properties of the Si/GaAs interface was analyzed. Also, the transition from Si to GaAs and from Si to Ge at corresponding interfaces was described with atomic precision. For the first time, the interface between Ge and SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was shown to have ?ideal? characteristics (chemical abruptness and sharpness). This indicates the potential, both for a more successful use of Ge in high-speed devices and for advances in interface engineering to enhance performance in electronic devices. The features of Si/HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Si/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interfaces, namely the distribution and bonding of Si and Hf across the interface, and the formation of charged SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; islands at the Si/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interface were also studied. These results for materials systems show the significance of a basic understanding of the atomic structures of interfaces for a rapid development of new electronic devices.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11132003-190514/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative Trait Transcript Mapping for Drug Response in Drosophila melanogaster</field><field name="creator">Passador-Gurgel, Gisele Candia</field><field name="description">Here I used microarrays to identify genes that are activated or repressed by nicotine and caffeine in Drosophila melanogaster. I compared genotypes with differential resistance to each drug in order to select genes that may be involved in resistance to the drugs. Comparison of the genes differentially expressed by both drugs leads me to propose that there are common mechanisms of metabolic resistance to caffeine and nicotine, in particular cytochrome P-450-mediated mechanisms. Caffeine seems to have a more dramatic influence on gene expression than nicotine, in particular on expression of genes involved in energy metabolism. Next, I extended the studies on nicotine resistance to ask whether there are differences in response between two populations of Drosophila. The gene expression patterns of both populations were evaluated separately and in a combined analysis. Most of the differentially expressed genes were up-regulated by nicotine in both populations and in the combined analysis. The induced transcripts were mainly related to protein, nucleic acid, amino acid and energy metabolism, and response to stimulus and stress. Those findings suggest that amino acid and energy metabolism may be important biological processes affected by nicotine and be interesting targets for further investigation related to the nicotine response in Drosophila. The two populations displayed considerable differences in gene expression profiling that may be the result of the observed phenotypic variation for nicotine response between the two populations. Most of the differential expression induced by nicotine seems to be specific to the more resistant population. Finally, I focused on genes whose expression showed significant correlation with survival time on nicotine food. Using a regression approach, it was possible to map quantitative trait transcripts associated to nicotine response. Control expression of alkaline phosphatase and ornithine aminotransferase displayed significant correlation to survival time in drug food. They seem to be linked to regulation of GABA/glutamate neurotransmission and detoxification mechanisms, which ultimately counteracts the stimulatory effects of nicotine.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Functional Genomics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11132005-160424/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene Expression Profiling in Testis and Liver of Mice to Identify Modes of Action of Conazole Toxicities</field><field name="creator">Goetz, Amber Kristina</field><field name="description">Conazoles are a class of azole fungicides used in both pharmaceutical and agricultural applications. This study focused on 4 conazoles that exhibit a range of carcinogenic and reproductive effects, in order to identify common and unique modes of action. Conazoles target cytochrome P450s (CYPs), and the inhibition and induction of various CYP activities may be part of the toxic modes of action in liver and testis. We used gene expression profiling to characterize a broader range of conazole effects and to identify additional modes of action. Adult male CD-1 mice were dosed daily by gavage for 14 days with fluconazole, propiconazole, myclobutanil or triadimefon (three doses each). Relative liver weight increased following fluconazole and propiconazole exposure, and histological analysis revealed centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy in response to all 4 conazoles. No weight or histological changes were observed in testis, and serum testosterone and luteinizing hormone were also unchanged. Microarrays queried expression of 16,475 genes, and identified 2,081 and 1,424 differentially expressed genes in liver and testis, respectively, following conazole exposure. Of these genes, 118 in the liver and 94 in the testis were common to two or more conazoles. The majority of differentially expressed genes related to stress response, oxidative stress, xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, steroidogenesis or carcinogenesis. Expression profiles between conazoles and between liver and testis affected similar biological pathways, suggesting the potential for common modes of action.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toxicology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11142003-170100/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Prior Stages of Criminal Justice Decision-Making on Criminal Sentencing: A Test of Three Models</field><field name="creator">Godwin, Melissa Hunt</field><field name="description">Previous research has analyzed the effects of legal and extralegal factors on criminal justice decision-making. Most of this research analyzes discrete stages, rather than multiple stages of the criminal justice process. Using data on felony convictions in a New Jersey State Court, this study compares the utility of a legal model of decision-making, an organizational model of decision-making and Black?s (1976) theory of law in predicting several criminal justice outcomes. Providing some support for both the legal model and Black?s theory of law, the results indicate the influence of both legal case characteristics and extralegal factors during initial stages of criminal justice processing. However, the influence of extralegal factors on later sentencing decisions through their effects on initial outcomes indicates the operation of organizational factors in criminal justice processing. While offenders are directly penalized by extralegal factors during initial criminal justice processing, they are penalized indirectly at sentencing stages by these same factors. Overall, the results of this analysis provide overwhelming support for an organizational model of criminal justice processing, in which later criminal justice outcomes are greatly a function of outcomes at previous stages. Previous research fails to systematically include prior outcomes in analyses of criminal sentencing. Criminal sentencing research that fails to consider the impact of initial criminal justice outcomes may falsely conclude that extralegal factors have no affect on decision-making.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11152002-140257/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of subsurface solute transport and its contribution to nutrient load in the drainage ditches prior to restoration of a Carolina Bay</field><field name="creator">Abit, Sergio Jr. Manacpo</field><field name="description">Subsurface solute transport is a major mechanism that contributes to the contaminant load in both surface and ground waters. Among these contaminants are plant nutrients that if transported in excessive amounts to surface waters can cause adverse effects on humans and animals, as well as negative impacts on aquatic life. The general objective of this study was to conduct a field evaluation of subsurface solute transport in the capillary fringe (CF) and shallow ground water (SGW) and their contribution to nutrient load in the ditches prior to restoration of a Carolina Bay. Specifically, this study was aimed at evaluating: a) the horizontal flow of bromide (Br-) in the CF and SGW under field conditions, b) the fate of nitrate (NO3-) in the CF and SGW in a sandy field site drained by ditches, and c) the possible contribution of subsurface flow to the increased nutrient load in drainage ditches at a drained Carolina Bay following storm events. The study was conducted in Juniper Bay, a drained Carolina Bay in Robeson County, NC. A solute transport experiment was conducted at a sandy site in the Bay where a solution containing Br- and NO3- was applied into an auger hole dug to about 10 cm above the CF during the time of application. The transport of Br- and NO3- in the CF and SGW was monitored by frequently collecting soil water samples using tension lysimeters installed at depths of 45, 60, 75, 90 and 105 cm at lateral distances of 20, 60, 120, 220 and 320 cm from the auger hole along the general direction of the ground water flow. A representative monitoring site from each of the Bay?s mineral and organic soil areas was also chosen for a year-long monitoring of fluctuations in nutrient concentrations in water samples from the Bay?s main ditch exit as well as from the vadose zone, ground water and lateral ditches. Soil solution from the vadose zone and ground water samples were collected using tension lysimeters installed at 15-cm depth intervals from 15 to 120, and 30 to 180 cm depths at the mineral and organic soil sites, respectively. Ground water samples were collected from three fully perforated wells. Seven piezometers installed at each site also allowed collection of ground water samples from different depth intervals below the water table The direction and magnitude of the subsurface hydraulic gradient at the monitored sites were also determined using the three-point technique. Lateral transport of Br- in the CF was observed in the direction of ground water movement up to 320 cm from the auger hole where solutes were applied. The Br- plume from the unsaturated zone that entered into the CF tended to stay and move horizontally in the CF until it was partially moved into the ground water by the fluctuating WT following rain events. The normalized concentrations (concentration in soil solution/concentration in the applied solution) of both NO3- and Br- in water samples collected from CF were comparable for all distances from the application spot. However, in the groundwater, the normalized concentration of NO3- was substantially lower than the normalized Br- concentrations. We believe the reduction in NO3- concentration in the ground water was due to denitrification. Results from the nutrient monitoring experiment reveal that the sample taken from the main ditch exit following a 5 cm d-1 storm event had higher concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), phosphates (PO4-P), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) compared to the average of samples collected during baseflow conditions. The same was also observed for samples collected from the vadose zone especially at depths closer to the soil surface where organic carbon and extractable Ca, Mg and PO4-P contents were higher. Higher concentrations of these solutes in the ditches and vadose zone coincided with observed increase in the magnitude of the groundwater hydraulic gradient. In addition, it was observed that following the storm events, the direction of the ground water hydraulic gradient tended to become more perpendicular to the nearby lateral ditch suggesting that the route taken by the water as it moves in the subsurface towards the ditch is shortened. We believe that the increase in concentration of PO4-P, Ca, Mg and TOC in the soil solution at certain depths in the soil profile coupled with their higher rate of movement in the subsurface towards the ditch following the storm event should have contributed to the increase in concentration of such nutrients in the ditches.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11152005-183644/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of New Tools for Functional Genetics</field><field name="creator">Young, Douglas Dean</field><field name="description">The development of small molecule probes to investigate biological functions is integral to the elucidation of complex biological processes.

(n=7) and expert teachers? (n=7) learning experiences and how these experiences were integrated into the teachers? practices. The participants reflected upon experiences from professional development and their classroom during a semi-structured audiotaped interview. Data were analyzed using concept maps and matrices to distill the multipage interview transcriptions into manageable and comparable elements. Theoretical constructs underlying the analysis drew from expertise and situated learning theories. Comparisons between novice and expert teachers found that the acquisition of the knowledge bases in developing teaching expertise is a nonlinear process and that there are many factors upon which this development is predicated. The knowledge bases that are constructed as a part of developing teaching expertise are not acquired in a certain sequence, after a designated amount of time, nor as a result of particular experiences in a teacher?s practice. While there are distinct differences between novice and expert teachers, the findings indicate that most teachers seek guidance from colleagues rather than from staff development opportunities. Novices and experts both expressed concern regarding lack of time and that student academic diversity demands impact the quality of their job. Novices? concerns included classroom discipline, inability to level lessons for student needs, and insufficient time to observe more experienced teachers. The most significant difference between novices and experts was the directly inverse proportional relationship between experts? abilities to properly level instruction and manage the classroom and the novices? inability to do so.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult and Community College Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11172003-140523/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Hope Creek Bridge as a Wildlife Underpass</field><field name="creator">Kleist, Andrea Margaret</field><field name="description">Roads pose many threats to wildlife. One such threat, wildlife-vehicle collisions, is a danger to humans as well as wildlife. Bridges built to facilitate movement of wildlife under roads may reduce threats that exist when large mammals attempt to cross roadways. My study is the first phase of a two-stage investigation of whether a bridge designed to function as a wildlife underpass influences wildlife use of the U.S. Highway 15/501 bridge over New Hope Creek (NHC) near Durham, North Carolina. This underpass is important as a wildlife passage, particularly for white-tailed deer (&lt;i&gt;Odocoileus virginianus&lt;/i&gt;), because the forests associated with NHC create a corridor between two natural areas: Duke Forest to the north and B. Everett Jordan Lake to the south. Phase One involves monitoring wildlife use of the current bridge structure using video cameras. In 2007, a longer bridge will be constructed. Phase Two will be the replication of my study upon completion of the new bridge. Wildlife use of the current and future underpass will be compared to determine whether underpass dimensions influence wildlife use of the underpass. Wildlife use of the NHC underpass was recorded continuously from December 2003 through May 2005. During the study period, 126 crossings were observed in the sample of video data by the following species: white-tailed deer, woodchuck (&lt;i&gt;Marmota monax&lt;/i&gt;), chipmunk (&lt;i&gt;Tamias striatus&lt;/i&gt;), raccoon (&lt;i&gt;Procyon lotor&lt;/i&gt;), red or gray fox (&lt;i&gt;Vulpes vulpes&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Urocyon cinereoargenteus&lt;/i&gt;), gray squirrel (&lt;i&gt;Sciurus carolinensis&lt;/i&gt;), domestic dog or coyote (&lt;i&gt;Canis&lt;/i&gt; spp.), domestic cat (&lt;i&gt;Felis catus&lt;/i&gt;), muskrat (&lt;i&gt;Ondatra zibethicus&lt;/i&gt;), hispid cotton rat (&lt;i&gt;Sigmodon hispidis&lt;/i&gt;), and unidentifiable small and medium-sized mammals. Based on the sampling technique, 42.2% of wildlife crossings were observed. Thus, an estimated 299 wildlife crossings occurred throughout the study period. Seventy-five deer were observed in the sample of video data using the underpass, while 17 deer approached and retreated. Using the sampling technique, 40.5% of deer crossings and 92.1% of deer approaches were observed. Thus, an estimated 185 deer crossings and 18 approaches occurred during the study period. One-hundred forty-six people were observed near the underpass in the sample of video data. Based on the sample, 80.8% of human activity near the underpass was detected. Thus, an estimated 181 people were observed near the underpass during the study period. Five potential road crossings, including three by small mammals and two by deer, were observed in the sample of video footage. As an index of road mortality near the NHC underpass, weekly surveys of vehicle-killed animals were conducted while driving north and south on the 1.8 km section of Highway 15/501 containing the underpass from December 2003 through June 2005. The surveys revealed that five individuals were killed by vehicle collisions, including raccoon, opossum (&lt;i&gt;Didelphus virginiana&lt;/i&gt;), woodchuck, wild turkey (&lt;i&gt;Meleagris gallapavo&lt;/i&gt;), and one unidentifiable mammal. North Carolina Department of Transportation records of wildlife collisions occurring from January 1, 1990 through October 30, 2004 revealed that deer-vehicle collisions on the section of Highway 15/501 containing the NHC underpass were infrequent, with 16 deer-related vehicle collisions occurring. Because several years will separate the current study from the future study of the expanded NHC underpass, a deer abundance index was developed using counts of deer observed during a driving route along roads west and north of the NHC underpass. From March 23, 2004 through May 31, 2005, 205 deer were observed during 53 driving counts. These data suggest that the Highway 15/501 underpass provides landscape connectivity between habitats on opposite sides of the highway and likely increases motorist safety by providing deer and other wildlife with an alternate route for reaching habitat on the far side of the highway without crossing onto the road.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11172005-224721/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">WELD FOR ITANIUM PROCESSOR</field><field name="creator">Sharma, Saurabh</field><field name="description">This dissertation extends a WELD for Itanium processors.

Hardware contexts such as program counters and the fetch units are duplicated to support for multithreading.

This research utilized molecular biology techniques to evaluate gene activation. Transfections of MCF-7 cells showed that liganded ER-alpha activates transcription of the human lactoferrin ERE 4-fold higher than the mouse lactoferrin ERE in the context of their natural promoters. Since the ERRE of the human lactoferrin gene naturally occurs 18 bp upstream from the ERE and is absent in the mouse lactoferrin gene promoter, we created a chimeric mouse lactoferrin CAT reporter, which now encodes the ERRE in the identical location as in the human lactoferrin gene. The addition of the ERRE in the mouse lactoferrin gene rendered this reporter extremely responsive to estrogen stimulation. We also demonstrated that the conformation of the estrogen receptor bound to the ERE alone or in the presence of ERRE differed and that the ERRE influenced the selectivity of coactivators in liganded ER-alpha-mediated transcriptional activity. Like the lactoferrin gene ERE, most known natural estrogen response elements are imperfect palindromes that differ from the consensus by at least a 1 base pair change and confer different levels of ER transcriptional activation compared to the consensus ERE. In contrast to our transient transfection data showing a lower estrogen response of the mouse lactoferrin ERE compared to the human lactoferrin ERE in the context of their natural promoters, in vivo data showed that the gene is robustly transcribed in response of estrogen in both species. Therefore, this research model can be applied to studies of genes that have different hormone responses in vivo versus in vitro in an attempt to identify non-typical estrogen response elements that influence ER-alpha-mediated transactivation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11182003-090946/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cicatrice</field><field name="creator">Shepard, Nora H.</field><field name="description">Cicatrice is a collection of poetry.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11182005-104221/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation of Transitional Flow over an Elliptic Cone at Mach 8 using a One-Equation Transition/Turbulence Model</field><field name="creator">Malechuk, Andrew Martin</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research has been to extend a previously developed one-equation model for transitional/turbulent flows (AIAA Journal, Vol. 39, No. 9) for use in the simulation of transitional/turbulent flows over three-dimensional bodies in conventional hypersonic tunnels. This is done computationally through the combination of the Spalart-Allmaras one-equation turbulence model and an eddy viscosity-transport equation based on that proposed by Xiao, Edwards, and Hassan for high disturbance environment (HIDE) induced transition. The blending of these two pieces of the model is achieved through the use of an intermittency function based on the work of Dhawan and Narasimha. The test case used in this research is an elliptic cone of aspect ratio 2:1 in a Mach 8 environment with Reynolds numbers between the range of 1.98x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;/ft and 6.09x10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/ft. Two separate methods are used to find the boundary layer edge flow properties under the resulting conical shock. The first of these methods uses fluid values extracted from the surface of the cone after an inviscid calculation. The second searches for the boundary layer edge by locating the largest momentum flux under the shock. The second of the two approaches is found to be the most successful in replicating transitional flow heat flux data measured experimentally by Kimmel, Poggie, and Schwoerk. Over the range of Reynolds numbers examined, the model reasonably predicts the location and extent of the transitional region, but does not effectively predict fluid properties within the transitional region.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11192002-194918/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF SITUATED LEARNING IN OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY</field><field name="creator">Machles, David Lee</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to understand how learning occupational safety practices occurred for employees outside of and in addition to, what was taught through planned, intentional safety training. The participants reflected upon their personal experiences regarding the work safety practices that they chose to incorporate into their lives during a semi-structured audio taped interview. Data were analyzed using qualitative phenomenological methods to distill the multi-page interview transcriptions into manageable and comparable elements. Theoretical constructs underlying the analysis drew from occupational safety literature and situated learning theories. The analysis found that learning occupational safety practices occur through experience with equipment and within various environments. These safe work practices are easily transferred to other settings where they are negotiated and become part of the workplace repertoire of safety. The participants did not discern non-workplace and workplace safe practices, but saw safe work practices as a conceptual tool that was applied to all settings. The participants used stories as a vehicle for both learning and sharing safe work practices with co-workers. These stories provided a rich, meaningful way to share safety concepts. The participants learned safe practices through the interaction with co-workers, self-selecting mentors who would provide learning opportunities, and they in turn would become mentors for other co-workers. This learning occurred during and within the daily activities of performing their work within communities of practice.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult and Community College Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11192004-181304/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Point of Fixity Analysis of Laterally Loaded Bridge Bents</field><field name="creator">Possiel, Benjamin Allen</field><field name="description">Research work in this thesis deals with the effects of lateral loads in the longitudinal direction on a substructure?s point of fixity.

A circular concrete pile, square concrete pile, and steel H-pile were tested in connection with both type V and type VI elastomeric bearing pads. The response of these full scale tests were then modeled in FB-MultiPier as tested and as an equivalent single foundation element. The model response was then compared to the measured results.

Crystal structure analysis of the tungsten cofactor in AOR indicated that the tungsten cofactor exists as part of a tricyclic pterin moiety analogous to molybdopterin cofactor present in molybdoenzymes such as nitrate reductase. Molybdopterin cofactor synthesis has been well characterized in Escherichia coli with the identification of at least 14 genes that participate in this process. Analysis of the P. furiosus genome revealed that it has homologs to all cofactor synthesis genes except for modE, a transcriptional regulator of molybdopterin cofactor synthesis, and mogA, a putative molybdo-chelator. Two of the molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis genes, moeA and moeB, involved in activation of molybdenum and in donation of sulfur to the pterin ring structure, respectively, each have two homologs in P. furiosus (MoeA, 45%, MoeA2, 44%, MoeB, 50%, and MoeB2, 47% similar to E. coli MoeA and MoeB respectively). The MoeA and MoeB homologs were targeted for initial functional activity studies to determine if they participate in cofactor formation. The activity studies entailed complementing E. coli strains mutant in moeA or moeB with recombinant P. furiosus homologs in an in vitro system and assaying for restoration of the molydoenzyme nitrate reductase (NR) activity. Partial complementation of defects in E. coli moeA and moeB were observed for assays including P. furiosus MoeA2 and MoeB2 which supported 13.1 nmole NO2-?min-1?mg-1 (10&#181;g MoeA2) and 19.6 nmole NO2-?min-1?mg-1 (100&#181;g MoeB2) activity respectively. These specific activities represent 10.1% and 15.1% of wild type E.coli nitrate reductase activity (130 nmole NO2-?min-1?mg-1) Only negligible restoration of nitrate reductase activity was observed when P. furiosus MoeA or MoeB was included in the assay, with specific activities 0.16 nmole NO2-?min-1?mg-1 (1&#181;g MoeA) and 0.74 NO2-?min-1?mg-1 (50&#181;g MoeB). Partial complementation of the E. coli moeA mutant was also observed for in vitro trimethyl amine oxide (TMAO) reductase assays where 10 &#61549;g MoeA2 supported a specific activity of 40.97 nmole TMAO reduced?min-1?mg-1 and 10 &#61549;g MoeB2 supported a specific activity of 6.3 nmole TMAO reduced?min-1?mg-1 compared to 2,374 nmole TMAO reduced?min-1?mg-1 for the wild type E. coli. When TMAO assays were conducted in the presence of tungsten rather than molybdenum, the wild type E. coli had a specific activity of 1,297 nmole TMAO reduced-?min-1?mg-1. E. coli moeA mutant had an activity of 2.07 nmole TMAO reduced -?min-1?mg-1 when supplemented with 10 &#61549;g MoeA2 and the E. coli moeB mutant supported 6.01 nmole TMAO reduced-?min-1?mg-1 when supplemented with 100 &#61549;g MoeB2. The partial nature of the complementation seen in these studies is likely due in part to the use of sub optimal assay temperatures (37&#61616;C), as required for E. coli NR, well below the optimum temperature of 95&#61616;C seen for most P. furiosus enzymes. Nevertheless, these complementation assays demonstrate that P. furiosus MoeA2, and MoeB2 homologs likely function as MoeA and MoeB in tungsten cofactor synthesis in P. furiosus.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11202002-162819/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of habitat corridors on dispersal success, predation induced mortality and colonization of estuarine macrofauna in seagrass</field><field name="creator">Darcy, Meaghan Christian</field><field name="description">A habitat corridor is a landscape feature that is hypothesized to promote dispersal between habitat patches that would otherwise be isolated, and promote population persistence. Habitat corridors have not been widely explored in marine and estuarine systems. We used artificial seagrass units (ASUs) placed on unstructured sediment in Middle Marsh and Drum Shoals, Back and Bogue Sounds, North Carolina to create seagrass patches (1m2 and 4m2) separated by bare sediment or connected by additional ASUs, which made up a habitat corridor. We assessed the interactive effects of habitat corridor (presence or absence) and interpatch distance (5m or 10m), as well as the ratio of corridor width to patch width upon dispersal of grass shrimp, Palaemonetes sp., and bay scallops, Argopecten irradians in seagrass. We conducted mark-recapture experiments where marked grass shrimp or bay scallops were placed in one patch from each treatment (donor patch). Regardless of the presence of a habitat corridor, interpatch distance, or ratio of corridor width to patch width, dispersal between seagrass patches for grass shrimp and bay scallops did not significantly vary. There was, however, a significant site effect with the number of scallops successfully dispersing between seagrass patches significantly higher at Drum Shoals than at Middle Marsh. The small spatial scales of this study and the perception of a homogeneous environment may explain the lack of a dispersal response by grass shrimp. Site-specific differences in bay scallop dispersal may have been due to varying flow at the two study sites. Tethering experiments were conducted concurrently with dispersal experiments to assess the interactive effects of habitat corridor and interpatch distance, as well as perimeter to area ratio, on predation-induced mortality of bay scallops. Habitat corridor, interpatch distance or perimeter to area ratio did not significantly influence predation-induced mortality of scallops; however, there was a significant site by interpatch distance interaction. Predation rates were greater in patches separated by 10m at Middle Marsh than at Drum Shoals, whereas predation was greater in patches separated by 5m at Drum Shoals than at Middle Marsh. The lack of predation response to habitat corridors may have been due to a prey refuge in size (the scallops used in this study were relatively large, 35mm-50mm), or relatively low replication (N = 5) or another biotic or environmental factor not measured during this study. Colonization experiments were conducted to assess the interactive effects of habitat corridor and interpatch distance upon the colonization of estuarine macrofauna in seagrass. Neither mean density nor species diversity of estuarine macrofauna, nor mean density of individual taxonomic groups was significantly influenced by the presence of habitat corridors or by interpatch distance. Mean densities of slow-, intermediate-, and rapid-level dispersers were also not significantly influenced by the presence of habitat corridors or interpatch distance. The lack of community-level response may be explained by the interaction of hydrodynamics and its influence on the perception of a homogeneous or heterogeneous environment by dispersing organisms. Although habitat corridors may promote animal movement between habitat patches in terrestrial systems and for certain marine predators, the results from the present study do not confirm that habitat corridors are used by estuarine macrofauna for dispersal or colonization at relatively small spatial (10s of m) and temporal (hours to one month) scales. The coupled effects of hydrodynamics and habitat use should be considered when investigating distribution and abundance patterns of organisms with different dispersal abilities.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11202003-084325/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Movement, habitat selection and growth of early-juvenile Atlantic sturgeon in Albemarle Sound, North Carolina</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, James Leland</field><field name="description">We characterized habitat use, growth, and movement of early juvenile Atlantic sturgeon in Albemarle Sound, North Carolina through field work conducted in 1997 and 1998. Most of the Atlantic sturgeon encountered in the study were estimated to be age-1 fish. The presence of numerous age-1 Atlantic sturgeon near a historic spawning river (Roanoke River) suggests that these fish are likely native to the system. Recaptures of tagged Atlantic sturgeon allowed us to describe the growth of early juveniles using simultaneous analysis of length increment and length composition data. Growth of Atlantic sturgeon in Albemarle Sound was similar to growth rates observed in other systems, and suggests that Albemarle Sound serves as an adequate nursery habitat. Among telemetered individuals, we observed a preferred depth interval of 3.6 to 5.4 m. Additionally, the organic rich mud substrate type was used significantly more than expected under the null hypothesis of random movement. Site-constrained movement was demonstrated by some fish. Occasional large catches of Atlantic sturgeon in our survey gear suggested that these fish may aggregate in the sound. Bycatch of Atlantic sturgeon by a commercial flounder gillnetter in eastern Albemarle Sound was dominated by fish within the expected age-2 size range. The impact of local gillnet fisheries on the Atlantic sturgeon population in the Roanoke River/Albemarle Sound system remains an important and unanswered question.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11202003-110600/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ENGINEERED DEPOSITION OF FUNCTIONAL COATINGS FROM MICRO- AND NANOPARTICLES USING CONVECTIVE ASSEMBLY</field><field name="creator">Prevo, Brian Geoffrey</field><field name="description">The potential technological applications of micro- and nanoparticle coatings necessitate the development of rapid, inexpensive and easily controlled deposition procedures. We have developed a technique for making structured thin films from micro- and nanoparticles by dragging on a substrate a liquid meniscus at constant velocity. The advantages of this technique are improved process speed, efficiency and reduced material consumption relative to standard dip coating techniques. The governing mechanism of the deposition process was found to be convective assembly at high volume fractions. Uniform, large area coatings (square centimeters in area) can be deposited in minutes at rates approaching 100 microns per second from microliters of suspension. Operational ?phase? diagrams were constructed from coating data, relating the coating layer thickness and particle packing symmetry to the process parameters: deposition speed, particle volume fraction, and solvent evaporation rate. Varying these parameters provided the means to control and tune nanocoating structure and properties. We found the most potent parameter to be the deposition speed. The deposition process was well modeled by a simple macroscopic species balance taken around the thin film drying site. We have successfully applied this deposition technique to a wide variety of colloidal systems including: latex and silica microspheres, gold nanoparticles, ferritin proteins, and living yeast cells. Conductive coatings from metal nanoparticles exhibited tunable optical and electronic properties simply by virtue of the adjusting deposition speed. The antireflective (AR) capabilities of silica nanoparticle coatings on glass and silicon substrates can also be facilely tuned using this deposition process. These AR coatings demonstrably improved the photovoltaic efficiency of solar cells. We have also investigated the use of compressed carbon dioxide as a replacement solvent for colloidal coating deposition. We achieved rapid sedimentation of uniform, conformal nanoparticle coatings using liquid and supercritical carbon dioxide (primarily as an antisolvent). These results show potential for fabricating conformal coatings of self cleaning, technologically relevant materials by simple self-assembly techniques.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11202005-150427/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Increased Susceptibility and Severity of Influenza in Mice Exposed to Diesel Exhaust.</field><field name="creator">Gowdy, Kymberly Mae</field><field name="description">Epidemiological studies have noted an increase in adverse health effects with increasing levels of air pollution. One major area of concern is the incidence of respiratory infections, specifically influenza. An air pollutant that has raised concern in recent years is diesel exhaust (DE) due to an increase the amount of diesel engines in use. Previous laboratory studies have reported that DE exposure prior to an influenza infection increases viral titers but the mechanism of how this occurs is still unknown. Herein, studies were designed to investigate three main areas associated with DE enhanced influenza infection. 1) Assess whether DE affects host defense responses against pathogens, 2) Determine if pre-exposure to DE increases susceptibility to influenza in vivo, 3) Investigate whether exposure to DE increases the severity of an ongoing established influenza infection. DE exposure alone increased proinflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, decreased expression and production of surfactant proteins (SP)-A and D as well as clara cell secretory protein (CCSP). The molecules downregulated by DE are important for binding viral and bacterial pathogens therefore making the lung more susceptible to infection. This was confirmed when mice were exposed to DE and then subsequently infected with influenza A. One day post infection mice pre-exposed to DE had a significant increases in influenza induced inflammation and viral titers that were associated with a decrease in SP-A and SP-D. Mice exposed to DE during an established influenza infection also had a significant increase in viral titers and pulmonary inflammation throughout the course of infection. This DE-enhanced influenza infection was associated with an upregulation of the Th2 cytokine IL-4 which has previously been shown to delay clearance. However with antioxidant treatment to combat the oxidative stress induced by DE, pulmonary inflammation and IL-4 expression returned to baseline levels. Taken together these data indicate that exposure to DE either before or during influenza infection has immunomodulatory effects that can be detrimental to the host with increased viral proliferation and morbidity associated with the disease.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11202008-100143/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating the Rationality of The Wall Street Journal's Panel of Economists</field><field name="creator">Houck, Adam Christopher</field><field name="description">This paper will explore a methodology that will examine the difference between average and individual forecasts, concentrating on whether individual Wall Street Journal forecasters are unbiased and efficient.

Specifically, the study examined if the self representations, parent representations, and attachment themes of maltreated children predicted their attributions of intent or response generation. Participants were a sample of 65 maltreated children who were in preschool, kindergarten, or first grade at the time of the assessment. The MacArthur Story Stem Battery was used to assess children&#226;s internal working models and the Home Interview with Children was used to assess social information processing. A number of significant correlations were found between children&#226;s representations of themselves, their parents and their expressed attachment themes. Findings also indicated that only children&#226;s positive self representations predicted their response generation, in that children who represented themselves positively had fewer aggressive responses.

Generating correctly warped images for nonplanar projection surfaces often requires even higher degrees of tessellation. Generating left and right eye views for stereo would further reduce the frame rate since information for a one eye view cannot be used to redraw the vegetation for the other eye view. We describe an image based rendering approach that is a modification of an algorithm for monoscopic rendering of vegetation proposed by Aleks Jauklin. The Jauklin algorithm pre-renders vegetation models from six viewpoints; rendering from an arbitrary viewpoint is achieved by compositing the nearest two slicings. Slices are alpha blended as the user changes viewing positions. The blending produces visual artifacts that are not distracting in a monoscopic environment but are very distracting in a stereo environment. We have modified the algorithm so it displays all pre-rendered images simultaneously, and slicings are partitioned and rendered in a back-to-front order. This approach improves the quality of the stereo, maintains the basic appearance of the vegetation, and reduces visual artifacts but it increases rendering time slightly and produces a rendering that is not totally faithful to the original vegetation model.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11222002-013933/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Static and Gradient Field Inhomogeneity Compensation for Low-Cost MRI Machines</field><field name="creator">Thrower, James Patrick</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research has been to develop technology necessary for Low-Cost Magnetic Resonance Imaging (LC-MRI) machines. This dissertation describes an overview of the tradeoffs necessary for LC-MRI machines and focuses on compensating for magnetic field inhomogeneity. The trade-offs for allowing inhomogeneous fields is examined. The equations describing inhomogeneity are derived for both one and two dimensions. Two methods of image compensation are compared, one from the literature and a new, proposed method. Both methods are demonstrated and analyzed on one-dimensional and two-dimensional images. The robustness of each method to uncompensated quantization errors and field mis-measurement is also examined. The computational complexity of each method is also investigated. The appendix of the dissertation covers background on MRI. The classical model of MRI is explained as well as the meaning of the time constants T1, T2, and T2*.

Human activities contribute large amounts of nitrogen and carbon compounds to watersheds, resulting in changes in resource availability through alteration of biogeochemical cycles. Although the effects of poor water quality on lower trophic level biota is well understood, the impact of nutrient waste on upper trophic levels, such as blue crabs (&lt;I&gt;Callinectes&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;sapidus&lt;/I&gt;), has not been well studied. Stable nitrogen (&#948;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N) and carbon (&#948;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) isotope ratios can provide time and space integrated information about feeding relationships and energy flow through food webs. An isotopic comparison of the trophic structure of two North Carolina estuaries was undertaken to understand the impacts of anthropogenic runoff on blue crab tissue enrichment and feeding interactions. This study examined isotopic signatures of primary producers, as well as blue crab and their bivalve prey (&lt;I&gt;Rangia&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;cuneata&lt;/I&gt; &amp; &lt;I&gt;Corbicula&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;fluminea&lt;/I&gt;) as indicators of potential changes in food web relationships in response to eutrophication. The Neuse River Estuary is an "impacted" system that experiences high nitrogen loading and drains areas of urban development, row crop agriculture, and concentrated animal operations. The Alligator River Estuary by comparison, is designated as a "less-impacted" system in this study. The Alligator River Estuary is classified as having "Outstanding Resource Waters" and low nutrient loading. In each estuary, samples were collected in the upper, middle and lower regions of the river. Bivalves collected from the Neuse River Estuary yielded a significant difference (p&lt;0.0001) in mean nitrogen isotopic composition of tissue (10.4? &#177; 0.82; N=66) compared to the bivalves collected from the Alligator River Estuary (6.4? &#177; 0.63; N=45). Similarly, the Neuse River Estuary blue crabs had a mean nitrogen isotopic composition of 11.41? (&#177; 1.3, N=77), which was significantly different (p&lt;0.001) than the less-impacted Alligator River blue crabs (9.65? &#177; 0.6; N=77). The mean nitrogen isotopic ratios between blue crabs and bivalves were significantly different (p&lt;0.0001) in the Neuse (1.01 ? &#177; 0.13) compared to the Alligator River Estuaries (3.2 ? &#177; 0.1). Linear regression analyses showed a significant inverse relationship between &#948;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N values of blue crab tissue and water quality for the Neuse River Estuary (R&#178; = 0.7; p= 0.01). A generalized linear model was conducted using blue crab tissue &#948;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N as the dependent variable and river estuary as the independent variable of interest. This analysis showed a significant difference (p&lt;0.0001) between rivers controlling for size, site, and the river by site interaction. The results of this study indicate that 1) a relationship exists between the uptake of anthropogenic nutrients by primary producers and the subsequent energy transfer to estuarine consumers, represented by &#948;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N and &#948;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C ratios, in two North Carolina estuaries; and 2) an inverse relationship exists between blue crab tissue enrichment and water quality in an impacted estuary.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11222003-195124/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NMR Structural Studies of Proteins Involved in the Competence and Sporulation Pathways of Bacillus subtilis and Pasteuria penetrans.</field><field name="creator">McLaughlin, Patrick Daniel</field><field name="description">The ability of bacteria to adapt to environmental stress is essential to their existence.

More so than relations between multiple industry members (industry-industry) or government agencies (industry-government), industry-university relationships are focused on research and development. The number of industry-university research centers (IUC) in the United States has increased dramatically over the last two decades (National Science Board, 2002). However, organizations vary tremendously in terms of the benefits they report from participation in an IUC (NSF- IUCRC Process/ Outcome Survey Results, 2003). The underlying cause of the variation in benefits is yet unknown (Ailes, Roessner &amp; Feller, 1997). Different roles played by the boundary role incumbents who represent the organization to the center, known as the Industrial Advisory Board (IAB), may affect firm benefits which in turn affect center outcomes. The purpose of the current study is to examine the tasks and characteristics of boundary spanning IAB representatives and their impact on vital outcomes associated with IUC research including R&amp;D, commercialization, and professional networking. The current study utilized a cross sectional survey design and examined (n=220) IAB representatives from 35 national and state level IUCs. Results from OLS and logistic regression analyses suggest that IAB representatives play not one but four distinct roles (representative, internal boundary-spanner, external boundary-spanner, and technology champion). External boundary-spanning was found to be the strongest predictor of increased firm benefits. Guidance for firms seeking to maximize benefits from participation in an IUC, and best practices for personnel selection and training of an IAB representative are discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11232004-124833/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamental Studies in Flameless Combustion and Implications to Reaction Zone Structure and Pollutants Formation</field><field name="creator">Terry, Jason Charles</field><field name="description">The objective of this study is to investigate numerically the effects of strain rate, methane dilution by nitrogen, and air-side preheat on pollutant and molecular hydrogen production and the reaction zone structure during flameless and flame-based combustion in a non-premixed counter-flow geometry of diluted methane with preheat air. Fundamental flameless and lean flame-based combustion studies are useful in shedding light on their possible uses in fuel reforming, especially as it pertains to the production of cleaner fuels for fuel cell operation, or partial oxidation. The study centers on fuel concentrations from 5 to 15% (by volume) in intervals of 2% along with both varying inlet velocities (the relation to strain rate is described below) of 10 to 60 cm/s in intervals of 10 cm/s, and oxidizer preheat temperatures from 1100 to 2100 K in intervals of 200 K. The geometry is based on axisymmetric counterflow of fuel and oxidizer jets, which are separated by a distance of 5 cm at their inlets. Parametric studies of different fuel dilution rates show that NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; mass fractions decrease with an increasing strain rate as well as decreasing fuel concentration in both flameless and flame-based combustion, while NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; mass fractions increased with the air-side preheat temperature. The intermediate species, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is found to follow a similar trend to NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; as preheat temperatures and fuel concentrations were increased; however, varying strain rate has little or no effect on H2 concentrations. The distinct differences in behavior between NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may be attributed primarily to the conflicting roles of strain in both increasing reactants? delivery to the reaction zone and its reduction of chemical residence time. Reaction flux analysis, which elucidates the chemical mechanisms governing the flameless and flame-based modes of burning concerning NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, shows an important shift in the dominant mechanisms producing NO, from the thermal NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; mechanism at high preheat temperatures, and to prompt NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; at lower preheat temperatures.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11242003-121506/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of Robinia Pseudoacacia L. as Browse for Meat Goat Production in the Southeastern USA</field><field name="creator">Snyder, Lori June Unruh</field><field name="description">Demand for goat meat in the southeastern USA is steadily increasing as a result of preferences exhibited by expanding ethnic communities. Feeding systems can be developed to take advantage of the natural preference of goats for browse. A field study was undertaken in Raleigh, NC to measure the effects of spacing (1.0 or 0.5 m) and coppice height (0.25 or 0.5 m) of a 5-year old stand of black locust (BL; Robinia pseudoacacia L.) on growth characteristics such as herbage mass (HM), canopy height (H) and width, number and size of main branches, above ground woody biomass, and root collar diameter. A second objective was through regression analysis to identify one or more of the previously mentioned characteristics as a rapid method to estimate HM. The third objective was to determine the relationship between growing-degree-days (GDD) and HM, H, herbage quality indicators (N, in vitro true dry matter disappearance, neutral and acid detergent fiber (NDF and ADF), cellulose, and 72% sulfuric acid lignin) and anti-quality indicators (Folin-reactive phenolics, condensed and hydrolyzable tannins) of BL. The final objective was to evaluate the N metabolism of goats fed BL foliage. Results indicated that coppicing BL trees at 0.5 m and planting at the widest spacing (1.0 m) produced the greatest plant growth. Average HM (2,600 kg ha-1) was observed for the highest coppice height (0.5 m). The character most closely related to HM was size of main branches. In 1999, a dry year, there was a significant relationship between GDD and NDF, ADF (r2 =0.90 and 0.80, respectively). In 2000, a wet year, GDD was a poor predictor of NDF and ADF. For 1999 and 2000, GDD was a poor predictor of BL tannin concentrations. From the conclusions of the N metabolism trial, goats consuming BL had lower digestibilities and higher content of N in the feces. Overall, BL contributes well to a silvopastoral system.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11242003-154755/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synchronization of Carbohydrate and Protein Metabolism by Ruminal Microbes in a Continuous Culture</field><field name="creator">Mohney, Kathryn Suzanne</field><field name="description">A major factor in maximizing microbial protein synthesis is the availability of energy and protein in the diet. Our objective was to determine the effect of fermentable carbohydrate and protein on microbial fermentation. Diets were formulated using three ingredients, soybean meal (SBM), ground corn (GC) and soybean hulls (SBH). Corn and SBH were used in ratios of 60:20, 40:40 or 20:60, respectively to prepare high, medium or low non-fibrous carbohydrate (NFC) diets. Soybean meal was included either unextruded (control) or extruded at low, medium or high temperature. Degradability of the N fractions in the control, low, medium and high soybean meal were 97, 80, 80 and 60%, respectively. Diets were arranged as a 3 x 4 factorial (3 levels of corn/soybean hulls and 4 levels of protein) and analyzed as a completely randomized block design. There were no statistically significant interactions seen between NFC and protein sources. Total volatile fatty acids were affected (P&lt;0.01) by the NFC with 78.5, 63.2 and 71.5 mM with increasing NFC levels. The NFC level affected the acetate and butyrate whereas the protein source had an effect on the propionate. Molar ratios of acetate, propionate and butyrate averaged 60.1, 31.0 and 6.79, respectively. Varying the level of fermentable carbohydrate had a negative linear affect on ruminal pH (P&lt;0.01). Extrusion did not alter pH greatly P&gt;0.67). Higher extrusion temperatures altered ammonia concentrations when compared to control or low extrusion. In the low NFC diets, the medium and high extrusion increased (P&lt;0.10) ammonia concentration (29.8 and 32.6 mg/dl, respectively) when compared with control and the low (18.9 and 23.4 mg/dl, respectively). Methane concentration averaged 308 nmoles/ml and was affected by both the NFC treatment and protein source. The high and medium NFC diets increased (P&lt;0.01) bacterial nitrogen percentage (9.0 and 9.5%, respectively) compared to the low NFC diet (8.7%). Data suggest that the fermentability of the structural carbohydrates in SBH was similar to the high starch corn diets. Furthermore, large differences in protein degradability did not seem to have a major impact on microbial fermentation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11252002-094152/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using GIS Based Property Tax Data For Trip Generation.</field><field name="creator">Tanaka, Krista Mari</field><field name="description">This project assesses the feasibility of using statistically clustered property tax data instead of windshield survey data for input into the Internal Data Summary (IDS) trip generation model used by the North Carolina Department of Transportation.

The use of hydrateable meal pads to deliver a specific concentration of these two proteins in insect diet was investigated. Continuous feeding on artificial diet containing 0.8 mg of anti-BSA/g hydrated diet resulted in 2430&#177;125 and 3459&#177;105 ng of anti-BSA/mL hemolymph after 8 and 16 h, respectively (average &#177; 1 SEM), as determined by ELISA. Continuous feeding on meal pads with the same concentration of BSA resulted in 1547&#177;132 and 1623&#177;122 ng of BSA/mL hemolymph at 8 and 16 h, respectively. No BSA or anti-BSA was found in the feces, and when 5 mg of these two proteins were applied topically in DMSO to the cuticle, neither protein was found in the hemolymph after 4 h. Western blot analyses using native and/or de-naturing gel electrophoresis demonstrated that both BSA and anti-BSA were not degraded in the hydrated meal pads and were also unchanged in the hemolymph, retaining the multimeric structure for BSA and the antigen reactivity for anti-BSA. When 1 mg of anti-BSA or BSA was injected into the hemocoel of fourth instars, the concentrations decreased with time and 120 min after injection were 0.6 and 20% of the original concentration, respectively. When added at the same original concentration to hemolymph in vitro, the decrease was 81.5 and 57.5%, respectively, at 120 min. Apparently, the accumulation of native anti-BSA and BSA protein in insect hemolymph is the result of the rate of their transfer from the diet versus their rate of turnover in the hemolymph. Hemolymph turnover of these proteins appears to be the result of degradation and sequestration.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11252003-090845/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimating Crack Growth in Temperature Damaged Concrete</field><field name="creator">Recalde, Juan Jose</field><field name="description">Evaluation of the structural condition of deteriorated concrete infrastructure and evaluation of new sustainable cementitious materials require an understanding of how the material will respond to applied loads and environmental exposures. A fundamental understanding of how microstructural changes in these materials relate to changes in mechanical properties and changes in fluid penetrability is needed. The ability to provide rapid, inexpensive assessment of material characteristics and relevant engineering properties is valuable for decision making and asset management purposes. In this investigation, the effects of changes in dynamic elastic properties with water content and fluid penetrability properties before and after a 300 &#194;&#176;C exposure were investigated as they relate to estimates of the crack density parameter, developed from the work by O&#226;Connell and Budiansky (1974; 1977) on dry and saturated crack media. The experimental and analytical techniques described in this dissertation allow calculation of a value for the crack density parameter nondestructively from differences in wet and dry dynamic shear modulus of relatively thin disks. The techniques were used to compare a conventional concrete mixture and several mixtures with enhanced sustainability characteristics. The analysis provided quantitative assessment of changes with high temperature damage and autogenous healing, and provided estimates of increases in mean crack trace lengths. The three enhanced sustainable materials investigated were a very high fly ash mixture (mixture F), a magnesium phosphate cement based mortar (mixture M), and a magnesium phosphate cement based concrete (mixture G), and were compared to a conventional concrete mixture (mixture C). The results showed that water interaction, deterioration due to damage, and autogenous healing recovery were different for mixtures G and M than the concrete mixtures C and F based on portland cement. A strong correlation was found between log(API), Gd and crack density parameter. The findings imply that the test method and related analysis can be used to evaluate the validity of current standard test methods to new &#226;green&#226; construction materials and therefore be a useful screening tool as well as providing important insight into microstructural changes in concrete under various exposures.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11252009-111845/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utility Guided Pattern Mining</field><field name="creator">Jagannath, Sandhya</field><field name="description">This work is an initial exploration of the use of the decision-theoretic concept of utility to guide pattern mining.

Utility guided pattern mining provides the twin benefits of capturing user preferences precisely using utility functions and of expressing user focus by choosing an appropriate utility guided pattern mining problem. It addresses the drawbacks of threshold guided pattern mining, the specification of threshold and the assumption of a fixed level of interest.

From a phylogenetic perspective, we address three major questions. First, does this protein family represent a monophyletic or polyphyletic group? Second, what methods of gene or modular duplication are utilized within different organisms to propagate and maintain this group of proteins? Third, what are the structural or functional constraints on evolution of the conserved DNA-binding domain? These questions are addressed through a combination of computational and molecular methods. Phylogenetic analyses provide evidence of monophyletic origin for the GATA family followed by gene duplication and modular evolution, accompanied by considerable divergence outside the conserved zinc finger DNA-binding domain. Genomic comparisons permit the tracing of GATA factor evolution and provide insight into mechanisms utilized by respective organisms. Finally, mutational and biochemical analyses enable the separation of phylogenetic and structural/functional constraints on the conserved zinc finger DNA-binding domain.

Most of the current literature on the subject also stressed on the need for a high temperature process step to attain the high mobility under minimal change of effective oxide thickness. However, the physical origin of high mobility is not well understood. In this work, fundamental insight into the necessity of the high temperature process step is provided. Novel experimental strategies are developed to understand the impact of interface states and bulk traps separately and exclusively on channel mobility. It is conjectured that the interface states at the SiO2/(100) bulk-Si interface are identical in nature (as far as coupling with the channel electrons is concerned) to those at the high-k/SiO2/(100) bulk-Si interface. Thus, the response of interface states on channel electrons in high-k insulator based NMOSFETs is properly calibrated by a novel thermal desorption of hydrogen experiment on SiO2/(100) bulk-Si NMOSFETs to yield a highly accurate parameterized equation. The value of interface state response parameter determined by the aforementioned experiment is compared with theoretical predictions, and independently determined projections from electrical stress measurements. The impact of transient charging on transport in the channel is investigated. It is conclusively shown that remote charge has minimal impact on mobility in the channel. The role of nitrogen induced fixed oxide charge is studied on a set of Hf-silicate samples. Role of soft optical phonon scattering and the beneficial impact of metal gates on soft optical phonon limited mobility are thoroughly investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Conclusions are drawn on the fundamental limit of mobility attainable in high-k dielectric based NMOSFETs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11272005-222631/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and Analysis of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Propulsion System with Fluidic Flow Control Inside a Highly Compact Serpentine Inlet Duct</field><field name="creator">Collie, Wallis Vernon</field><field name="description">The benefits of highly compact serpentine inlet ducts extend from reductions in overall aircraft weight to higher survivability, as well as allow the aircraft designer greater flexibility in propulsion system integration. Unfortunately, due to the extreme wall curvature, these ducts result in significant flow distortion and total pressure losses at the engine face. It has been shown that active flow control in the form of micro-fluidic vortex generators significantly helps to reduce these losses. To date, these systems have only been tested in a laboratory setting in which items such as flow control air supply, system and subsystem size, weight, and location are not major factors. Subscale unmanned aerial vehicles provide a real world test bed to help overcome these constraints at a lower cost and lower risk as compared to full scale aircraft testing.

To solve this problem, complex cooling schemes have been adopted. They employ the use of outside air to dilute the high combustion temperatures to make them suitable for turbine section exposure. This leads to a non-uniform temperature profile leaving the combustion area and therefore decreasing the overall engine performance by introducing thermal cycling and inconsistencies in operational temperatures. This research suggests placing an ultra-high temperature open cell metal foam ring in front of the combustion area and directly before the turbine section. Open cell foam with their 3-dimensional geometry help mix the hot and cool gasses entering the turbine area creating a more uniform temperature profile. This increases efficiency by raising the operational temperature of the jet engine. It also contributes to an increased lifetime since the mixing function of the metallic foam will reduce thermal cycling fatigue on turbine vanes and blades. This research presents a full investigation on the feasibility of this idea; it studies the potential of producing ultra-high temperature metallic foam from a list of currently available as well recently engineered materials. This work also investigates the pressure drop and heat transfer associated with the foam for a full assessment of the design. Infrared imaging for heat transfer measurements done on Al foam of 5 and 10 PPI (pores per inch) samples showed the mixing role of the metal foam as a function of thickness; it showed improvement of the temperature profile resulting from the averaging the hot and the cool gasses. Pressure drop testing provided data on pressure drop in Al foams in the compressibility region of air. Up to this point, similar data was not available. Pressure drop testing revealed that with careful design of pore size, ligament thickness and foam thickness, taking into consideration heat transfer capabilities of the foam, a feasible design of an ultra-high temperature open cell foam ring can be achieved with minimal pressure drop and increased heat transfer capabilities.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11282004-014635/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Retro Stadiums on Major League Baseball Franchises</field><field name="creator">Menefee, William Chadwick</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of ?retro? stadiums on professional baseball franchises.

The link between outbreaks in separate farms within an area remains unclear despite biosecurity measures. We have investigated the vector potential of stable flies in the transmission of PRRSV under laboratory conditions. We first determined that blood seeking stable flies are attracted to pigs by olfactory cues. We determined stable flies could acquire the virus through a bloodmeal, and the amount of virus in the flies declined with time, indicating the virus does not replicate in fly digestive tissues. Transmission of the virus to na&#195;&#175;ve pigs failed in all attempts. The volume of blood contained in the closed mouthparts of the stable fly appears to be insufficient to deliver an infective dose of the virus. We further examined the fate of PRRS virus in the hemolymph of the flies following a midgut barrier bypass. Virus levels were up to 9,500 times greater in the hemolymph when compared to those detected in the digestive tract at the same time point. Further study to test the saliva of inoculated stable flies for presence of the virus is needed to determine if PRRS virus can enter and escape stable fly salivary glands. Although stable flies are unlikely vectors of PRRS virus between animals, they may play a role in virus dissemination by harboring the virus and contaminating the environment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11282008-160747/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growth of binary alloyed semiconductor crystals by the vertical Bridgman-Stockbarger process with a strong magnetic field.</field><field name="creator">LaPointe, Stephen James</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a model for the unsteady species transport for the growth of alloyed semiconductor crystals during the vertical Bridgman-Stockbarger process with a steady axial magnetic field. During growth of alloyed semiconductors such as germanium-silicon (GeSi) and mercury-cadmium-telluride (HgCdTe), the solute?s concentration is not small so that density differences in the melt are very large. These compositional variations drive compositionally-driven buoyant convection, or solutal convection, in addition to thermally-driven buoyant convection. These buoyant convections drive convective transport which produces non-uniformities in the concentration in both the melt and the crystal. This transient model predicts the distribution of species in the entire crystal grown in a steady axial magnetic field.

The archetype of the Noble Savage, particularly as inspired by the Amerindians of New France, played a critical role in the evolution of French perceptions of the Arabs. The Noble Savage influenced French perceptions of the Arabs during the Napoleonic conquest of Egypt, but his influence gained momentum during the French colonization of Algeria. Although the Arabs did not conform completely to the image of the Noble Savage, the indigenous Kabyles of Algeria appeared to be his embodiment. The French had encountered the Noble Savage in New France and his image had been disseminated further through the popular travel accounts and the ?natural man? of French intellectuals such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In discovering the Kabyles, the French discovered the perfect Noble Savage. The valorization of the Kabyles as Noble Savages resulted in the demonization of the Arabs as barbaric and ignorant. This led to a division in French attitudes between the ?good? Kabyle and the ?bad? Arab. Although French colonial and imperial interests in Algeria contributed to the formulation and perpetuation of this division, the long-standing and pervasive French understanding of and sympathy for the Noble Savage significantly facilitated its development.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11292005-145050/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Augmentation of Intrusion Detection Systems Through the Use of Bayesian Network Analysis</field><field name="creator">Williams, Lloyd</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research has been to increase the effectiveness of Intrusion Detection Systems in the enforcement of computer security. Current preventative security measures are clearly inadequate as evidenced by constant examples of compromised computer security seen in the news. Intrusion Detection Systems have been created to respond to the inadequacies of existing preventative security methods. This research presents the two main approaches to Intrusion Detection Systems and the reasons that they too fail to produce adequate security. Promising new methods are attempting to increase the effectiveness of Intrusion Detection Systems with one of the most interesting approaches being that taken by the TIAA system. The TIAA system uses a method based on employing prerequisites and consequences of security attacks to glean cohesive collections of attack data from large data sets. The reasons why the TIAA approach ultimately fails are discussed, and the possibility of using the TIAA system as a preprocessor for recognizing novel attacks is then presented along with the types of data this approach will produce. In the course of this research the VisualBayes software package was created to make use of the data generated by the TIAA system. VisualBayes is a complete graphical system for the creation, manipulation, and evaluation of Bayesian networks. The VisualBayes also uses the Bayesian networks to create a visualization of observations and the probabilities that result from them.

A series of Ru(II) amido complexes of the type TpRu(L)(L')NHR (L = L' = PMe3 or P(OMe)3 or L = CO and L' = PPh3; R = H, Ph, or tBu) were prepared and characterized.

During the machining process, very high pressures can be achieved at the contact interface between the machining tool and the surface of a material. The induced pressures can cause transformations through a series of phases, and upon releasing the pressure, the material can again be transformed to a new phase. Many of the high-pressure phases of Si, and some of the phases of SiC and &amp;beta;-Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; have been defined experimentally for hydrostatic pressure conditions in diamond anvil cell experiments, and have also been predicted theoretically. However, the complexity of plastic deformation complicates the transition process from non-hydrostatic pressure causes the response of the material to be difficult to define for precision engineered and machined surfaces. In these cases, the transmission of applied force can be dependent on nonhydrostatic structural changes due to plastic flow, and structural transitions can be induced at lower pressures than would occur, if at all, for hydrostatic pressures. The Raman technique is employed as a nondestructive structure sensitive probe to investigate the structural and vibrational properties of indented and machined Si, 6H-SiC, &amp;beta;-Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Visible Raman scattering of Si indentations indicate that localized regions are transformed into metastable phases. On machined Si surfaces, a layer of amorphous material is observed, and the depth of this layer has been found to be dependent on the machining conditions. For the wide bandgap materials, 6H-SiC and &amp;beta;-Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the short absorption depth of UV light allows for accurate probing of the surface, and the transparency to visible light allows analysis of the bulk material. The studies on indentations made on the 6H-SiC (0001) surface indicate biaxial stress from point pressure. Machined 6H-SiC basal plane edges of (0001) wafers indicate that the near surface structure is changed from single crystal to polycrystalline. Studies conducted on nm and &amp;mu;m precision-machined &amp;beta;-Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; reveals transformation of a surface layer into an amorphous phase.

Although techniques for modeling and identifying dynamic systems are well established, very few procedures exist for estimating uncertainty bounds. In the case of H-infinity control synthesis, a conservative weighting function for model uncertainty is usually chosen to ensure closed-loop stability over the entire operating space. The primary drawback of this conservative, "hard computing" approach is reduced performance due to the number of plants the resulting controller can stabilize. This paper demonstrates a novel "soft computing" approach to estimate bounds of model uncertainty resulting from parameter variations, unmodeled dynamics, and non-deterministic processes in dynamic plants. This approach uses confidence interval networks (CINs), radial basis function neural networks trained using asymmetric bilinear error cost functions, to estimate confidence intervals on the uncertainty associated with nominal linear models for robust control synthesis. This research couples the hard computing features of H-infinity control with the soft computing characteristics of intelligent system identification, and realizes the combined advantages of both. Experimental demonstrations conducted on a multivariable, flexible-rotor active magnetic bearing system confirm these capabilities.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11302004-135840/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and Parameter Estimation of the Aerodynamic and Handling Qualities of the C-130A Modified With Wing Tip Tanks</field><field name="creator">Phillips, David</field><field name="description">This work presents the background, flight testing, and resulting change in the aerodynamic and handling qualities of a C-130A Hercules modified with wing tip tanks. The data collected during the baseline and modified flight tests of this aircraft demonstrated the potential aerodynamic benefits of a tip tank design that incorporates a greater aspect ratio and end plating effects. Wing mounted pressure belts measured a 24% increase in local Cl near the tip tanks. This local increase in lift contributed to a 38% increase in CL max for the airplane. The pressure and dynamic data was gathered using a LIFT (Linux In Flight Testing) system, and it laid the foundation for finding the longitudinal and lateral directional stability coefficients of the airplane. Then using MATLAB&#174; and the System IDentification Programs for AirCraft (SIDPAC) to reduce this data, it was possible to generate aerodynamic, lateral, and longitudinal parameters that clearly proved the overall benefits of the design change. The demonstrated lift benefits of these uniquely designed tip tanks for the C-130A cargo transport proved that by capitalizing on the benefits of a combination tip tank and end plate design it is possible to generate increased lift without adversely affecting the stability and dynamic parameters of the aircraft.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11302004-185835/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arthopod Fauna Associated With Kudzu (Pueraria montana var. lobata Willd) In North Carolina</field><field name="creator">Thornton, Melissa Rose</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to obtain background information to aid the implementation of a biological control program against the weed, kudzu (Pueraria montana var. lobata Willd).

Kudzu is pollinated by native and naturalized insects in NC, in a pattern that varies by flower apparency rather than density. Arthropod herbivory by native generalists almost eliminated kudzu seed viability, while a naturalized Asian specialist consumed a nominal proportion of seeds. These data indicate that seed feeding arthropods would be poor candidates for importation biological control. Kudzu and soybeans shared the same foliar feeding insect communities and levels of defoliation, suggesting that foliage feeders are also poor choices for importation. No kudzu vine or root feeding insects or damage were found during the two years of this study, suggesting that future importation biological control research should focus on such feeders from Asia.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11302004-203434/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Evolution of Phytophthora infestans (Mont.)de Bary, the late blight pathogen</field><field name="creator">Gomez-Alpizar, Luis E</field><field name="description">Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary causes late blight of potato and tomato and is one of the world?s most devastating plant diseases. P. infestans left its footprint in human history when, in the 19th century, it was responsible for the Irish Potato Famine. Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA variability was used to examine the population history of P. infestans. DNA sequence data from three nuclear regions (Intron Ras, Ras, and &#226;-tubulin) and two mitochondrial regions (P3 and P4) were obtained from ninety isolates from various locations including Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Costa Rica, Mexico (Toluca Valley), the USA and Ireland. Population summary statistics show that the Mexican population from the presumed center of origin of P. infestans, harbored less nucleotide and haplotype diversity than South American populations, and was genetically differentiated from other populations, particularly at the mitochondrial loci. Coalescent-based genealogies of mitochondrial (rpl14, rpl5, tRNAs, cox1) and nuclear (Intron Ras+Ras) loci were congruent and demonstrated the existence of two lineages leading to the present day haplotypes of P. infestans associated with potatoes. A third lineage, associated with a group of isolates from Solanum tetrapetalum collected in the Andean Highlands of Ecuador was also found. In the mitochondrial genealogy the two potato lineages corresponded to the mitochrondrial haplotypes Type I and Type II described elsewhere. Mitochondrial haplotypes were associated with different nuclear backgrounds. Haplotypes found in the Toluca Valley population were derived from only one of the two lineages in both mitochondrial and nuclear genealogies, whereas haplotypes found in South American populations (Peru and Ecuador) were derived from both lineages. Haplotypes found in USA and Ireland populations were also derived from both lineages and these populations were not genetically differentiated from the Peruvian populations, suggesting a common ancestry among these populations. Evidence for recombination was found for Mexican and USA populations. Solanum tetrapetalum isolates were highly polymorphic within the regions analyzed and may be a new species.

Cornell virus, defined as the reovirus ARVCU98, a small round virus (SRV or ARVCU98) and a turkey astrovirus, Ohio State University isolate (TastOSU), were gavaged orally into the crop of turkey poults. Reduced body weights and reduced relative weights of the bursa of Fabricius, thymus, and liver were observed in virus-challenged poults. The reduced body weight gain and tissue atrophy was exacerbated by the presence of E. coli. In study number two, the possibility of vertical transmission of reovirus via the egg was tested. In ovo inoculation resulted in pathogenic and metabolic alterations in broilers challenged in ovo at day 9 of embryonation with ARVCU98 and the field isolated S1733 (1:100 and 1:500 dilution). In a third study, hyperimmunization of turkey breeder hens against the ARVCU98 reovirus provided limited protection to progeny as indicated by decreased weight gain and loss of lymphoid organ integrity in post hatch ARVCU98-challenged poults. Overall these studies demonstrated that PEMS-associated astrovirus and reovirus affected poult performance by decreasing body weight and altering lymphoid organ integrity, and the addition of E. coli further exacerbated these signs under a controlled environment. Additionally, ARVCU98 reovirus is a turkey isolate, and the evidence presented herein clearly demonstrated that it can infect broilers and that vertical transmission via the egg is a strong possibility.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Poultry Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11302004-233639/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbohydrate utilization pathway analysis in the hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima</field><field name="creator">Conners, Shannon Burns</field><field name="description">Carbohydrate utilization and production pathways identified in Thermotoga species likely contribute to their ubiquity in hydrothermal environments. Many carbohydrate-active enzymes from Thermotoga maritima have been characterized biochemically; however, sugar uptake systems and regulatory mechanisms that control them have not been well defined. Transcriptional data from cDNA microarrays were examined using mixed effects statistical models to predict candidate sugar substrates for ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters in T. maritima. Genes encoding proteins previously annotated as oligopeptide/dipeptide ABC transporters responded transcriptionally to various carbohydrates. This finding was consistent with protein sequence comparisons that revealed closer relationships to archaeal sugar transporters than to bacterial peptide transporters. In many cases, glycosyl hydrolases, co-localized with these transporters, also responded to the same sugars. Putative transcriptional repressors of the LacI, XylR, and DeoR families were likely involved in regulating genomic units for beta-1,4-glucan, beta-1,3-glucan, beta-1,4-mannan, ribose, and rhamnose metabolism and transport. Carbohydrate utilization pathways in T. maritima may be related to ecological interactions within cell communities. Exopolysaccharide-based biofilms composed primarily of ?&#210;-linked glucose, with small amounts of mannose and ribose, formed under certain conditions in both pure T. maritima cultures and mixed cultures of T. maritima and M. jannaschii. Further examination of transcriptional differences between biofilm-bound sessile cells and planktonic cells revealed differential expression of beta-glucan-specific degradation enzymes, even though maltose, an alpha-1,4 linked glucose disaccharide, was used as a growth substrate. Higher transcripts of genes encoding iron and sulfur compound transport, iron-sulfur cluster chaperones, and iron-sulfur cluster proteins suggest altered redox environments in biofilm cells. Further direct comparisons between cellobiose and maltose-grown cells suggested that transcription of cellobiose utilization genes is highly sensitive to the presence of cellobiose, or a cellobiose-maltose mixture. Increased transcripts of genes related to polysulfide reductases in cellobiose-grown cells and biofilm cells suggested that T. maritima cells in pure culture biofilms escaped hydrogen inhibition by preferentially reducing sulfur compounds, while cells in mixed culture biofilms form close associations with hydrogen-utilizing methanogens. In addition to probing issues related to the microbial physiology and ecology of T. maritima, this work illustrates the strategic use of DNA microarray-based transcriptional analysis for functional genomics studies.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11302005-092748/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design Study of an Autonomous Unmanned Air Vehicle Controller</field><field name="creator">Peterson, Joseph Scott</field><field name="description">Peterson, Joseph Scott, Design Study of an Autonomous Unmanned Air Vehicle Controller.

A coastwide assessment of the stock based on landings, fishery-dependent and fishery-independent length data, and survey abundance information was performed using the stock synthesis model. Landings have generally increased since the 1950s, with most of the catch occurring in North Carolina and Virginia. Major commercial gears are gill net, trawl, haul seine, and pound net. The recreational fishery has become increasingly important over time. Indices of relative abundance generated from fishery-independent surveys show that year-class strength has varied considerably among years. Patterns for year-class strength were consistent within each state, and fairly consistent among states. There is evidence for a potential rebuilding of the stock from both the observed data and model predictions. Coastwide length samples from the recreational fisheries and length samples from NC commercial fisheries demonstrated an increase in the maximum length in recent years. Observed and predicted mean lengths for the gill net, trawl, and recreational fisheries also suggest an increase in the proportion of older and larger fish in recent years. Observed trends in relative abundance and model predictions of recruitment reflect the presence of several recent strong year classes. The model results suggest that the population is highly recruitment-driven and that recruitment is variable. This dynamic is likely reflected in the harvest as variability in catch, which has shown fluctuations for at least the past 50 years. Estimates of fishing mortality have been high, particularly during the late 1980s when abundance was estimated to be low. Evaluation of the uncertainty in model estimates demonstrated that the model was fairly insensitive to changes in source data, but did appear sensitive to changes regarding assumptions about M and assumptions about the error associated with survey abundance indices. The yield-per-recruit analysis results suggested that a significant gain in yield would result if age-at-entry was delayed, which, in turn, would allow for relatively higher Fs. Comparison of age-0 abundance indices between Virginia and North Carolina revealed similar patterns in annual recruitment. Age-0 abundance indices also exhibited significant spatial autocorrelation for both states. In general, sampling stations in close proximity tended to have more similar observations of age-0 abundance. Positive spatial autocorrelation typically occurred at distances less than 30-km, while negative spatial autocorrelation was more often detected at distances of 40-km or greater.

The objective of this study was to investigate how these bridges and culverts alter stream hydrology and geomorphology by determining the effects on the upstream and downstream reaches of a road crossing on the cross sectional area, the hyporheic depth, on riffle habitat, and substrate types. Three types of culverts (arch, box, and pipe) and small bridges were evaluated. All four types of stream crossings were determined to increase the cross sectional area downstream of the structure. Crossing structures also affected hyporheic zone depths by decreasing average depths downstream of the structure. Finally, most mussels seemed to occur in substrates that were dominated by relatively large particles (gravel and cobble) that were less movable by sheer stress during higher flows. Each of the problems discovered with these structures is a result of the channel restriction and the increased flow velocity and turbulence scour that it creates. These detrimental conditions can be mitigated by providing for floodplain access for higher flows. It is recommended that culverts be designed for low flows and high flows. Oversizing culverts, compared to current design criteria will allow floodplain access and build bankfull benches in the extra openings to restrict low flows to a few openings. The use of bridges that span across the valley limiting fill and allowing floodplain access may even be more beneficial. When valley fill is necessary, then side culverts in the floodplain may alleviate degradation and allow more natural floodplain hydrology.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural Resources</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11302005-175258/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of a Trap-Neuter-Return Management Program for Feral Cat Colonies: Population Dynamics, Home Ranges, and Potentially Zoonotic Diseases.</field><field name="creator">Nutter, Felicia Beth</field><field name="description">Management of feral cats is controversial, and alternatives to lethal control methods are gaining popularity. To evaluate the effectiveness of sterilization programs, nine feral cat colonies were divided into groups of three, managed either by spaying females and castrating males, spaying females and vasectomizing males, or leaving all cats intact. Colonies were followed intensively for four years, and intermittently for three additional years. Most cats were trapped in fewer than ten trap nights each. Breeding females produced a mean of 1.4 litters/year and 3 kittens/litter. Kitten mortality was 75% by 6 months of age. Feral and pet domestic cats had similar baseline health status and prevalences of FIV, FeLV, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and Toxocara cati, but feral cats had higher prevalences of Bartonalla henselae and Toxoplasma gondii. Castrated male and spayed female cats survived longer than intact male and female cats. Survival times of vasectomized males were equivalent to those of intact males. Control colonies decreased in size and remained stable in composition, while intact colonies increased in size and had high turnover. One neutered colony went extinct and several others had fewer than five cats at the end of the project. Home ranges of both intact and neutered cats were small, usually less than 1 ha. Vasectomized males had larger home ranges than either intact or castrated males, probably because they were searching for intact females. Community-level stakeholder meetings were successful in building consensus among groups, and a basic decision tree for feral cat management was developed. Computer simulation modeling using VORTEX software suggested that harvesting breeding colonies every one or two years at 50% to 100% can keep colonies small, but will not lead to long-term reductions in cat numbers. Models of neutered colonies suggested that 75% to 80% sterilization is necessary to cause population decrease and eventual extinction. The mean estimated time to extinction of 12.8 years fits well with ongoing observations of steady decline in sterilized colonies.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11302005-195423/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biochemical, Genetic, and Cytogenetic Studies of Stokesia laevis (Stokes Aster)</field><field name="creator">Barb, Jessica Gaus</field><field name="description">Stokesia laevis (J. Hill) Greene is a herbaceous perennial with blue, lavender, violet, albescent, pale yellow or pale pink flowers. All cultivars are diploid (2n=2x=14) except for ?Omega Skyrocket, a tetraploid (2n=4x=28) cultivar selected from a wild population. Anthocyanidin and copigment aglycones extracted from floral tissue were characterized using high-performance liquid chromatography. Results indicated that blue, lavender, violet and albescent flowers contained petunidin, though albescent flowers contained a substantially smaller amount. Pale pink flowers were found to contain only cyanidin. Anthocyanidins and carotenoids were not present in pale yellow flowers. All flowers contained the flavone luteolin. Genetic analyses suggested that at least three genes (A, P, Y) each with two alleles control flower color: A permits normal synthesis of anthocyanins and other flavonoids, a reduces synthesis and/or prevents the accumulation of anthocyanins and other flavonoids; Y permits normal synthesis of anthocyanins, y completely blocks synthesis of anthocyanins; P produces petunidin, p produces cyanidin. All three genes are completely dominant, and yy is epistatic to A and P. We provide a model for flavonoid biosynthesis in Stokesia. Study of karyotypes and meiotic behavior of diploid cultivars and ?Omega Skyrocket? suggest that ?Omega Skyrocket? is an autotetraploid form of Stokesia. The karyotype of ?Omega Skyrocket? was almost indistinguishable from the average diploid karyotype. Meiotic pairing in diploids was normal (i.e. 100% bivalents); no meiotic irregularities such as laggards/bridges were observed and disjunction was equal (7:7). Meiotic pairing in ?Omega Skyrocket? demonstrated a high frequency (60%) of quadrivalent formation, though later stages of meiosis were regular with balanced disjunction (14:14). Meiosis in synthetic autotetraploids and triploids from crosses of diploid cultivars &#215; ?Omega Skyrocket? included univalents, bivalents, trivalents, quadrivalents, 5-valents; abnormalities (i.e. laggards, unequal and/or premature disjunction, chromosome bridging, chromosome stickiness) were observed. Nuclear 2C DNA content for diploids and synthetic tetraploids was 20.3 pg and 39.9 pg. Nuclear 2C DNA content for ?Omega Skyrocket? was 37.3 pg (i.e. 8.2% less than twice the 2C DNA content of diploids), indicating that genomic downsizing has likely occurred in this cultivar. Differences in chromosome symmetry between the diploid and tetraploid karyotypes and the reduction in nuclear DNA content observed in ?Omega Skyrocket? both suggest that some divergence has occurred between ?Omega Skyrocket? and its diploid progenitor. A crossability study was conducted to determine the ploidy level and the frequency of progeny produced by interploid and intraploid crosses of Stokesia. A high percentage (70%) of progeny were aneuploids (i.e. 2x-1 to 6x+3) with the total percentage of aneuploids ranging from 92% to 94% in 2x &#215; 3x, 3x &#215; 2x, 3x &#215; 3x, 3x &#215; 4x and 4x &#215; 3x crosses. Progeny (94%) from 2x &#215; 2x crosses were diploids, and progeny (81%) from 2x &#215; 4x and 4x &#215; 2x crosses were triploids and 3x&#177;1 aneuploids. Progeny from crosses of synthetic tetraploids were mostly tetraploids (16%) and tetraploid aneuploids (69%). Unreduced gamete production was estimated to be 0.7% to 1.4%. Reciprocal crosses of identical 2x and 4x parents produced viable progeny, demonstrating that a triploid block is not present in this species. Triploid fertility was higher than expected; crosses using triploids produced seed 38% of the time with an average seed set of ~2 seeds/inflorescence. Fertility of synthetic tetraploids was reduced relative to their progenitor diploids; pollen viability was reduced by 36% and the percentage of inflorescences producing seed and average seed set/inflorescence were reduced by ~50%. Pollen size was positively correlated with ploidy level (i.e. DNA content).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11302007-145604/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Access to Authority and Promotions: Do Organizational Mechanisms Affect Workplace Outcomes Differently for Blacks and Whites?</field><field name="creator">Wright, Delmar Anthony</field><field name="description">In this study I examine the effects of two organizational mechanisms on the race gap in promotions and authority attainment. Previous work in the area has treated promotions as a means to obtaining authority invested positions, while the present research examines promotions and authority simultaneously, and as conceptually distinct. This research also examines the effects of both social closure and homosocial reproduction on promotions and authority, something previous research has failed to accomplish. Using the North Carolina Employment and Health Survey (NCEHS), I examine the effect that social closure through training time may have on Black?s relative chances of having authority, and the influence of homosocial reproduction by linking the racial composition of jobs with the likelihood of receiving a promotion and having authority. Results from these analyses indicate that Blacks are more likely to receive promotions and authority positions in jobs with a higher percentage of Black employees. The results also indicate that Black employees with increased education also increase their likelihood of being promoted, and Blacks have less authority in private sector jobs, both conclusions showing support for the particularistic mobility thesis. This analysis provides empirical support for homosocial reproduction.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12012004-131651/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Working Toward Nonviolence in Composition</field><field name="creator">Wagar, Scott Edward</field><field name="description">This thesis suggests that composition studies is in need of further efforts to bring the concept and practice of nonviolence into the discipline?s theoretical and pedagogical framework. I survey and synthesize existing literature on nonviolence in composition as well as related writing on spirituality in education, feminism, the environment, and moral education. The implications of critical pedagogy and social construction theory for the subject are also considered. Ultimately, I argue for the importance of an approach incorporating the personal and the spiritual on the part of both teachers and students. Such an approach retains a strong social perspective because it works toward an understanding that the self cannot be seen as separate from its others. Guided by these ideas, I present and discuss a proposal for a one-semester university-level composition course entitled ?Writing Nonviolence.? I conclude the thesis by briefly considering alternate pedagogical models and by calling for further exploration, testimony, and commitment by teachers and scholars of composition and rhetoric.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12012004-170719/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Algorithm to Systematically Reduce Human Errors in Healthcare</field><field name="creator">Seastrunk, Chad Stephen</field><field name="description">The purpose of the research was to develop an algorithm to permanently reduce human errors in the healthcare industry. The algorithm will be able to be applied to all healthcare organizations and provide a preventative approach to errors. The research involved looking at past methods of error reduction/prevention. Certain methods proved to be useful in generating the algorithm like the Healthcare Failure Modes and Effects Analysis while others like Root Cause Analysis proved to only have limited success. The algorithm takes a three phase approach to reducing errors. Phase One identifies the potential error producing situations. Phase Two uses error proofing principles and known solution directions to generate solutions while Phase Three uses a new method developed called Solution Priority Number to rank and evaluate the solutions. Throughout the algorithm many worksheets have been developed to aid in a team?s progression through the process. Two case studies were performed. The first case study followed a traditional team through the error prevention process while the second case used the algorithm. When comparing the two cases the team using the algorithm finished the process in shorter time, produced more effective failure modes, and generated a richer set of solutions to error proof the process.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12012005-073356/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fabrication of a Graphitic Layer for Nanotribological Studies of Temperature Rise in a Frictional Contact Area</field><field name="creator">Walker, Matthew James</field><field name="description">In this thesis I use a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) to investigate the interfacial heat rise of an adsorbed Kr layer on a single layer of graphite called graphene. The graphene surface is made by reacting CO to a 1000 &#197; thick Ni(111) surface at a temperature of 400 &#186;C. A 100 &#197; Ti layer is the base layer the Ni is deposited onto. The surface is characterized using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) under ultra high vacuum conditions. The change in frequency vs. pressure/coverage graphs on a linear scale shows at what pressures a monolayer of Kr forms. The frequency vs. pressure/coverage graphs on a log scale show phase changes that can be compared to well known static phase changes. The comparison of the static phase change to the dynamic phase change yields an inferred temperature at the interface. This inferred temperature remained the same regardless of the sliding velocity. The latter observation, which is one principal point of this thesis, remains true irrespective of surface quality.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12012005-095905/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation of DRAND, the Distributed and Scalable TDMA Time Slot Scheduling Algorithm</field><field name="creator">Min, Jeong Ki</field><field name="description">The problem of energy savings is the most important subject currently in the research area of wireless sensor networks. So, in order to present a better scheme for energy savings and system performance, the TDMA scheme is considered as a solution. Moreover, the TDMA time slot scheduling algorithm is an important issue in running the TDMA scheme. The distributed and scalable fashion is required in wireless sensor networks because it is very difficult and inefficient to manage many sensor nodes by the centralized method with small size of memory space and battery capacity on each sensor node deployed in the broad sensing field. So, we implemented DRAND, the TDMA time slot scheduling algorithm which supports the important requirements as we listed above. Even though a scheme shows good performance by the simulation result, the implementation as a real system is another problem to solve. This is because good simulation results could not guarantee that implementation of the algorithm would work properly in the real word due to various unexpected obstacles. Therefore, by implementing the DRAND scheme as a real system, we can confirm the analysis and simulation result with various real experiments. For the experiment, we use up to 42 MICA2 motes for one-hop and multi-hop test.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12012005-152207/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Live Axis Turning</field><field name="creator">Buescher, Nathan P</field><field name="description">The goal of this research is to develop a new method to create Non-Rotationally Symmetric (NRS) optical surfaces that overcomes the limitations of the current techniques and is fast, accurate and inexpensive. The term Live-Axis turning (LAT) has been coined to describe a lightweight, linear-motor driven, air bearing slide that can be used to fabricate NRS surfaces. The system described was developed at the Precision Engineering Center (PEC) in an effort to create a long-range fast tool servo to fabricate future NASA optics. The slide designed for the system is a triangular cross-section, lightweight (0.6 kg) honeycomb aluminum slide driven by a linear motor (64 N maximum force) resulting in an acceleration capability of 10 g. Additionally, a damper was added to the system to investigate the effects of physical damping on surface quality. The LAT axis was mounted on a Nanoform 600 diamond turning machine and both flat surfaces and tilted flat surfaces were machined to assess the performance of the system, which has a rise time of less than 2 msec. The 12.5 mm diameter flat surfaces had surface finishes of 16 nm without damping and 14 nm with damping, with both having a figure error of less than &#189; wave. 25 mm diameter tilted flat surfaces, using a maximum stroke of +/- 1 mm at 5 Hz, had a surface finish of 24 nm without damping and 20 nm with damping. The figure error for the damped and undamped parts was +/- 25 microns.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12012005-170722/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visualizing Communication Structures of Nonverbal Information for Online Learning Environments</field><field name="creator">Winegarden, Claudia Rebola</field><field name="description">This doctoral level study aims to advance research in the visualization of Spontaneous Interactive Gestures produced by students in online learning environments, and how they can best be used as interfaces in compute-mediated communications.

Evoking themes, images, and concepts found within these two mediums, Luhrmann goes to great lengths to signify both the cinematic and the theatrical within these films through references to popular culture, and these references incrementally mesh the worlds of theatre and cinema throughout the trilogy. In Strictly Ballroom, Luhrmann explores the concepts of performance, spectacle, and realism while at the same time replicating a popular cinematic form of the time, the non-diegetic musical. Moving further away from the popular genre that Strictly Ballroom mirrored, Luhrmann next made Romeo + Juliet, a film that speaks to many of the same conventions of theatre and film while also adding features of diegetic song and self-referentiality to heighten this connection. Moulin Rouge, Luhrmann?s final film, is an overt musical homage, complete with internal and external references to both theatre and film with an overwhelming sense of awareness of popular culture. Although many critics, including Luhrmann himself, have praised him for his innovative style, this thesis argues that Luhrmann?s trilogy does not create a new film form. Rather, ?Spectacular, Spectacular? will demonstrate that his self-proclaimed genre, Red Curtain Cinema, is a modernized echo of an earlier idea?using popular culture and referentiality to pay tribute to a fading genre?found in one of the most popular movie musicals of all time, Singin? in the Rain.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12012005-231429/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Study Modality and Study Order on Learning Braille and Other Haptic Alphabets Used by Blind Persons</field><field name="creator">Mroczka, Mary Ann</field><field name="description">Braille is the alphabet predominantly used today for total communication by blind persons; yet, its difficulty to learn prevents some from using it.

Moon was easier to learn than Braille, which was easier to learn than the Fishburne alphabet. Visual study facilitated learning only with the Moon alphabet.

There is growing interest in determining the scale at which coastal wetlands are functionally connected and how management influences their use by migrant shorebirds. Parameters of interest were estimated using multi-state models and encounter histories obtained from resight and telemetry data. Data were collected in the spatial context of three clusters of multiple wetland units each separated by distances of 2.6 to 4.1 km and two hydrologic treatments--a slow and fast draw down. Mean length of stay was 2.99 d (95% CIs = 2.45 - 3.52) in 2006 and 4.57 d (95% CIs = 2.59 ? 8.92) in 2007. Residency probability was influenced by a negative and significant interaction between estimated percent fat at capture and southerly wind speed. This meant that differences in departure rates by birds with varying body conditions were minimized. Sixty-five percent of all marked birds stayed within 2 km from their banding location. Movement probabilities were negatively related to inter-cluster distance and bird density. In the spatial context of YWC there was functional connectivity among the clusters that were ~2.5 km apart; movement was negligible between units at nearly twice that distance (4.1 km). Contrary to expectations, the average probability of surviving and not moving for birds in slow-managed units was higher than birds in fast-managed units (PhiSS 2006 = 0.488, PhiSS 2007 = 0.654). On average, birds marked in fast-managed units moved out at high rates (Psi 2006 = 0.399, Psi 2007 = 0.467). Higher prey biomass and bird density in slow-managed units influenced observed residency and movement rates. My findings advocate for conservation strategies that identify functionally connected wetland units and suggested that habitat supplementation for shorebirds during peak migration can be met by carefully planned staggered, slow drawdowns. The effectiveness of fast drawdowns is vulnerable to differential prey base quality, presence of birds on previously exposed habitat, failure of water control structures to operate properly, and the possibility of mismatching peak migration and rapid drawdown implementation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12032007-112436/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Cell Wall Synthesis Genes in Feeding Cells Formed by Root-Knot Nematodes.</field><field name="creator">Hudson, Laura Christine</field><field name="description">Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne sp.) are sedentary endoparasites that infect roots of a wide range of plant species and cause considerable economic loss to many crops. Root-knot nematodes (RKN) transform selected root vascular cells into enlarged, multinucleate feeding sites called giant-cells that arise from repeated karyokinesis without cytokinesis. Giant-cells undergo extensive modifications of the cell wall architecture including cell wall thickening and the formation of ingrowths that act to increase the surface area of the plasma membrane to facilitate solute uptake by the nematode. Extensive cell division is stimulated around the giant-cells to give rise to the root gall that is characteristic of RKN infection. Extensive cell wall modifications taking place in feeding cells are hypothesized to be mediated by both cell wall-loosening and cell wall biosynthetic enzymes of plant origin based on evidence that nematodes alter gene expression in plants during formation of feeding cells. Ten members of the cellulose synthase (CesA) gene family of Arabidopsis thaliana were analyzed to monitor cell wall deposition in RKN infection sites. CesA gene promoter::GUS constructs and developmental quantitative RT-PCR indicated that CesA genes responsible for both primary and secondary cell wall synthesis were temporally and quantitatively expressed in the same pattern, with peak activity in RKN infection sites at five days post-inoculation. Sections of RKN infection sites in CesA promoter::GUS roots indicated that upregulated secondary cell wall CesA genes were localized within the central giant-cells and primary cell wall CesA genes were primarily localized to the surrounding dividing cells (gall tissue) of the infection site. The number of galls and RKN female development were decreased in Arabidopsis mutants in eight of the CesA genes, and complementation studies with the constitutive 35S promoter restored the mutant phenotypes of CESA4, CESA5, and CESA7 (involved in secondary cell wall synthesis) and also restored normal RKN infection levels. Mutant complementation of the CESA4, CESA5, and CESA7 genes with the giant-cell-inducible NtCel7 promoter had limited effects on mutant plant phenotype and RKN infection rates, but the development of successful infective RKN females was increased dramatically. The combined data support a critical role for plant CESA gene activity working in consort to generate the proper root morphology to promote nematode infection and for the development of feeding cells to support nematode growth and reproduction.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12032008-123305/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays on Environmental and Computational Economics</field><field name="creator">Balikcioglu, Metin</field><field name="description">The study consists of three separate essays. The first essay reassesses and extends the papers by Pindyck (2000, 2002) which analyze the effects of uncertainty and irreversibility on the timing of emissions reduction policy. It is shown that proposed solutions for some of the optimal stopping problems introduced in these papers are incorrect. Correct solutions are provided for both the incorrect special cases and the general model through a numerical method since closed form solutions do not exist for these problems. In the second essay, singular control framework is employed in order to allow for gradual emission reduction instead of once-for-all type policies. The solution for the model is obtained using the numerical method introduced in the last essay. The effects of uncertainty and irreversibility on optimal emission reduction policy are investigated. The model is illustrated for greenhouse gas mitigation in the context of climate change problem and some of the model parameters are estimated using a state space model. In the third essay, a unified numerical method is introduced for solving multidimensional singular and impulse control models. The link between regime switching and singular/impulse control problems is established. This link results in a convenient representation of optimality conditions for the numerical method. After solving the optimality conditions at a discrete set of points, an approximate solution can be obtained by solving an extended vertical linear complementarity problem using a variety of techniques.

The stencils used in the reconstruction involve only the von Neumann neighborhood (face-neighboring cells) and are compact and consistent with the underlying DG method. The resulting RDG method can be regarded as an improvement of a recovery-based DG method, in the sense that it shares the same nice features, such as high accuracy and efficiency, and yet overcomes some of its shortcomings such as a lack of flexibility, compactness, and robustness. The developed RDG method is used to compute a variety of flow problems on arbitrary meshes to demonstrate its accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and versatility. The numerical results indicate that this RDG method is third-order accurate at a cost slightly higher than its underlying second-order DG method, at the same time providing a better performance than the third order DG method, in terms of both computing costs and storage requirements.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12032009-162626/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Nutrition on the Development of Urolithiasis in Captive Giraffes and Meat Goats.</field><field name="creator">Sullivan, Kathleen Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Obstructive urolithiasis is a documented problem in domestic ruminants, such as the meat goat, and also in captive giraffe. A survey of the health history, feeding practices, and dietary contents in captive giraffes in North America was conducted to examine the possible connection between diet and the development of urolithiasis. Samples of urine, serum and feed were collected and analyzed for basic panels and mineral content. There appeared to be a positive correlation between diet and physiologic phosphorus levels in giraffe. This may not have been related to the ingredients of the diet but rather to the ratio of concentrate to hay eaten and the nutrient composition of the concentrate. We hypothesized that high phosphorus content in the diet and a high level of concentrate feeding would increase indicators of urolith formations including crystal formation and high urine mineral content. We followed up with a metabolic trial in meat goats, testing 2 different complete pelleted feeds and 2 complete pelleted feed to hay ratios in a 2 by 2 factorial randomized complete block design. The intent of this study was to look at the impact of type of diet (ADF-16 or Wild Herbivore complete pelleted feed) and complete pelleted feed to hay ratios (20 or 80 % hay) on the development of urolithiasis in meat goats, in the context of captive giraffe feeding practices. The four treatments had a range of fiber content and differed in mineral content, particularly Ca to P ratio and levels of P. We also measured the number of crystals in the fresh urine, as these may be considered precursors to urolith formation. The ADF-16 diet where hay was 20% of the diet had the lowest levels of fiber, lowest Ca to P ratio, and highest level of phosphorus compared to the other 3 diet treatments. From our results, it can be concluded that feeding the ADF-16 diet where hay is 20% of the diet, produced a trend of high urinary P, high serum P and a tendency for a high crystal count in the urine over the four week experimental period. These can be considered strong risk factors for the development of phosphatic uroliths. As one third of the zoos which responded to the survey fed a majority of their diets as ADF-16, this conclusion warrants further investigation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12042006-190320/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motivational Predictors of Academic Cheating Among First-Year College Students: Goals, Expectations, and Costs.</field><field name="creator">Sieman, Ashley Mouberry</field><field name="description">Academic cheating is a persistent and pervasive problem that threatens the core values of higher education (Burnett, Rudolph, &amp; Clifford, 1998; McCabe, Trevino, &amp; Butterfield, 2001a; Whitely &amp; Keith-Spiegel, 2002). While a significant amount of research has been devoted to exploring the problem of student cheating, much of what exists is descriptive in nature and lacks an overarching, theoretically-based, conceptual framework. This study aimed to fill this gap in the existing literature by proposing and testing a theoretically-based conceptual model of the motivational predictors of academic cheating using a population of first-year college students. The model used in this study was developed based on the combined work of Murdock and Anderman (2006) and Harding, Mayhew, Finelli, &amp; Carpenter (2007) and relied generally on expectancy value theory and, specifically, on the theory of planned behavior, to explore how goals, expectations, and costs influence first-year college students&#226; decisions to cheat. The proposed model was tested using a quantitative web-based survey instrument that was administered during the spring of 2008 to all 4,462 full-time, second semester, first-year students attending a large, public, land grant, institution located on the east coast of the United States. Data were analyzed using a variety of quantitative statistical techniques including multiple and hierarchical regression, general linear modeling, and structural equation modeling. Results provided support for the use of expectancy value theory and, specifically, the theory of planned behavior, as a theoretical model for understanding how motivational factors influence students&#226; decisions to cheat. Results showed that goals and expectations are important for understanding how students&#226; perceive the costs associated with cheating and that attitudes toward cheating and past cheating behavior are among the strongest predictors of intention to cheat and actual cheating behavior. Implications for practice and future research are presented and discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Higher Education Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12042008-105621/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritional Influences on the Ultra-structural Development of the Small Intestinal Epithelium of the Perinatal Turkey Embryo and Poult</field><field name="creator">Boh&#195;&#179;rquez, Diego V</field><field name="description">The transition from a lipid-rich in-ovo environment to a carbohydrate- and protein-rich diet is perhaps the biggest challenge that hatchlings must overcome during early life. Amniotic fluid supplementation of the late-term avian embryo (i.e. in-ovo feeding &#226; IOF) stimulates enteric maturation of poultry and alleviates the stress of hatching. Because rapidly dividing cells (e.g. intestinal epithelial cells) require an exogenous supply of nucleotides, dietary nucleotide supplementation can improve the enteric maturation post-hatch. Our working hypothesis was that nutritional strategies influencing in-ovo nutrition and post-hatch dietary feed intake enhance the enteric development in perinatal turkey embryos and poults. Our study was among the first to characterize the ultra-structural changes in the small intestinal mucosa of the perinatal turkey embryo and poult (Chapter II). Moreover, electron microscopy revealed that microbial colonization in the avian digestive tract begins prior to hatch as early as 17E. Molecular profiling of these bacteria confirmed that some the species include Bacillus, Lactobacilli, Pseudomonas and several uncultured bacteria (Chapter III). We showed that IOF accelerates the ultra-structural maturation of the jejunum mucosa of turkey embryos and poults around the time of hatch, and these effects are associated with elevated plasma triiodothyronine (T3) levels, a potent stimulator of morphological development of the mucosa (Chapter IV). Finally, we showed that dietary nucleotide supplementation to IOF turkey poults enhances the enteric maturation after hatch and the positive effects of nucleotide supplementation appear to be associated with stimulation of feed intake post-hatch. Therefore, we concluded that: (1) profound ultra-structural adaptations of the intestinal mucosa coincide with the imbibition of the amniotic fluid by the embryo; (2) microflora colonization of the avian gut begins well before hatch, (3) IOF stimulates ultra-structural maturation of the small intestine at hatch and these effects involve up-regulation of genes mediating epithelial cell proliferation as well as higher T3 levels. (4) Dietary nucleotide supplementation of IOF turkey poults enhances enteric maturation post-hatch, which coincide with a consistent stimulation of poults appetite by dietary nucleotide supplementation.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12042009-080316/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">System Protection for Power Electronic Building Block Based DC Distribution Systems</field><field name="creator">Mahajan, Nikhil R</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research has been to develop an agent based protection and reconfiguration scheme for power electronic building block based (PEBB) DC distribution systems. One of the foremost applications would be in the new zonal DC distribution on naval ships. The research involves the design of an agent based protection scheme which uses the PEBBs for current limiting and circuit breaking purposes. Considerations are given to reduce the system downtime under fault conditions, allow proper coordination and provide backup protection. The research also involves the design of a reconfiguration management scheme based on collaborative agents. The collaboration ensures that the reconfiguration is achieved at a global level, enhancing the system survivability under the conditions of multiple faults and damages. The coordination ensures that only the faulted part of the system is isolated and the reconfiguration makes sure that the power to the healthy part of the system is supplied continuously. The reconfiguration management also performs load shedding if the generation does not meet the load demand of the reconfigured system due to a fault or damage in the generator.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12052004-233822/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Space on Health and Well-Being: An Environmental Assessment for Home-like Long Term Care Settings</field><field name="creator">KEPEZ, ORCUN Mr.</field><field name="description">Small scale and home-like long term care environments were generally associated with increased activity and positive outcomes. This study aims to test the hypothesis that plan types with different spatial configurations lead to differences in the use of spaces and the social interaction between residents that may affect well-being. The context of the study is 12-bed adult care homes with cognitively intact residents. Nine cases from four different sites, which contained 80 residents in total, were selected to be studied. Caregivers were asked to complete a survey for each resident to report about each resident?s background, competence in activities and instrumental activities of daily living, participation in social events, mood, and use of the outdoors. The corresponding distances between each resident?s bedroom and the common spaces and syntax variables (depth, local, and global integration) were also considered. Behavior maps (n=308) were collected during observations in order to have three days of observation from each studied case. The use of spaces and conversations between residents were noted as an indicator of the residents? activeness and social interaction. The hypothesis that there were at least two plan types with significantly different outcomes (survey outcomes, use, and social interaction) was accepted at p &lt; 0.05 level. Shorter walking distances were found to be an indicator of an increase in the number of conversation groups formed only by residents. The numbers of spaces that resident needed to walk through to reach any of the common areas were also found to be a factor for social interaction. The distance was not found to be a factor for use in the studied context. The isolation of bedrooms from the surrounding spaces was found to be necessary to provide privacy for residents. The results were independent from the bedroom sharing status of residents, which was shown to be a factor of use in at larger scales. Depression levels of residents were found to be independent from the considered spatial variables.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12052006-105055/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Southeastern United States Site Characterization Involving Black Carbon Aerosol Concentrations and Meteorological Variables</field><field name="creator">Lewitsky, Jeffrey Ryan</field><field name="description">Aerosols present in the Earth?s atmosphere play a crucial role in global meteorological conditions. If there is a larger concentration of aerosols then there may be a resulting variance in the weather and climate. One particular aerosol, which was measured and observed for this study, is black carbon. The presence of black carbon concentrations could result in a variance of certain weather variables at any given location. Black carbon aerosols absorb incoming solar radiation, which can impact the vertical temperature profile. A comparison of results can be made between weather and climate conditions in which a significant amount of black carbon is present, and other conditions with minimal amounts of black carbon in the troposphere. The observed data analyzed is from the Lake Wheeler site, a semi-urban location near the threshold of the piedmont and coastal plain zones of central North Carolina. The period for evaluation is June 2003 through May 2004. The weather variables that were closely examined include air temperature, dewpoint temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction. In addition, radiation data was collected and analyzed including solar radiation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), net irradiance, diffuse radiation and direct radiation. Aerosol optical depths (AOD), which are the measurement of light attenuation at specified wavelengths, were also collected and evaluated in both the ultraviolet and visible light spectrums. This was done in order to determine any relationships between black carbon concentrations and AODs at certain wavelengths. After examining the year?s worth of data a site characterization involving the black carbon concentrations and meteorological variables for the Raleigh, NC location was devised.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12052006-173422/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of Ligands For Electronic and Magnetic Structure-Property Relationship Studies</field><field name="creator">Ogallo, Linda Ajuang</field><field name="description">The next generation of molecules will take advantage of electronic spin as well as electronic charge.

Don) in Chile</field><field name="creator">Rubilar, Rafael Alejandro</field><field name="description">Environmental site-specific constraints on shoot, branch, and leaf area growth and phenology were investigated during the third and fourth growing seasons in two-year-old radiata pine plantations established under a factorial combination of soil preparation, fertilization, and weed control at three contrasting textural and climatic soil-site conditions in the Central Valley of Chile. During October 2002 and June 2005, biweekly measurements of foliage accretion, branch, and stem growth were obtained together with periodical evaluations of foliage senescence. At each site, tree growth, aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, total biomass, aboveground:belowground biomass ratio, and leaf area index increased mainly by weed control (WC). The large gradient of tree growth and biomass accumulation among sites, and within sites varying in response to WC, was mainly attributed to large differences in soil water availability and possibly atmospheric water demand differences within sites. A linear relationship was established between LAI and stand growth across sites. The slope of the relationship (stemwood growth efficiency, GE) varied from 2.9 m3ha-1year-1 to 6.8 m3ha-1year-1 per unit of leaf area, with lower growth efficiencies found on sites with the greater water constraints. Phenology of growth was little affected by site or silvicultural treatments. Seasonal differences in the patterns of growth were mainly observed among sites for diameter, with longer growing seasons at sites with lower water limitations. In contrast, strong site and silvicultural treatments effects were observed on tree morphology. Trees where water limitations were more severe exhibited fewer and shorter flushes of height growth. The negative effects of soil water limitations, were at least partially ameliorated by silvicultural treatments that had been applied three years previously. Resource availability constraints during the mid to late growing season affected diameter growth more than height growth. Phenology of fascicle elongation indicated that sites with water and nutritional constraints ended fascicle elongation earlier during a growing season. Phenology of fascicle senescence indicated that maximum needlefall occurred during the summer and autumn seasons. No differences in silvicultural treatments were observed in foliage accretion or senescence patterns. Foliage longevity increased for sites with water and nutrient limitations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12062005-135049/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A NEW METHOD FOR RADIOACTIVE PARTICLE TRACKING</field><field name="creator">Shehata, Ashraf Hassan</field><field name="description">A system based on the concept of three detectors radio active particle tracking, to track a particle non-invasively in the three dimensions is presented. It consists of a set of three well collimated detectors mounted on a platform that can be moved to track the radioactive particle vertically through one collimated detector with a horizontal slot opening. The other two collimated detectors with vertical slot opening can be rotated angularly to track the radioactive particle in the planar domain, and deduce the polar coordinates. A complete description of the actual system developed is outlined including the hardware, the automation and control software, and the data acquisition aspects. A critique of the conventional tomographic radioactive particle tracking was established in comparison to the new three detectors system we developed. A number of obvious and valuable advantages of the new method were pointed out. The result presented here are illustrative through a series of benchmark experiments to test and verify the performance of the system. Results of real trajectories of a single radioactive particle moving in air, and in a bed filled with a mass of granular spherical attenuating medium is also presented. Through testing benchmark experiments that include a variety of real time trajectories the success of the tracking system is demonstrated.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12072005-140754/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Linguistic Rule Generation for Broken Rotor Bar Detection in Squirrel-cage Induction Motors</field><field name="creator">Ayhan, Bulent</field><field name="description">In motor condition monitoring applications, traditional human expert approach for sensor exploitation is not cost-effective. The training requirements for human experts are extensive, and the overall training process is a very time-consuming task. In addition, the performance of human experts has limitations. For human experts, it is difficult to examine all the input-output data from the motor system under varying noise and motor load conditions. With a motor condition monitoring system that can automatically generate rules in the form of interpretable linguistic fuzzy "if-then" rules and membership functions, it would be easier for experts to understand and modify the rule base and also to track the motor condition for maintenance and replacement requirements. In this research, a methodology for fuzzy rule and membership function generation for broken rotor bar detection of squirrel-cage induction motors was developed. The methodology consists of a set of steps that an expert might do for fuzzy rule and membership function design. The methodology is named "H-ROC", since it utilizes histogram analysis with overlapping bins and a weighted cost function based on ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve analysis. As a second method, an existing fuzzy rule extraction method was extended to broken rotor bar detection problem. The performance and sensitivity analyses of the two methods were conducted.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12072005-232928/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Garbage or Godsend?: Contested Meanings Among Conservation and Humanitarian Groups on the United States Border</field><field name="creator">Shellabarger, Rachel Marie</field><field name="description">Conservation and human rights are currently threatened by direct and indirect effects of border enforcement practices on the Arizona-Sonora border. Increased border enforcement in urban areas has pushed migrants into remote conservation areas, threatening both the vulnerable borderland ecosystems and the human migrants passing through them. This study examines responses to human and environmental impacts of border policies in the case study region of Altar Valley in southern Arizona, where migrant traffic has increased greatly as a result of the expanded border enforcement near urban centers. We use ethnographic methods to explore and understand the actions of land-management and humanitarian aid groups attempting to address the socio-ecological crises wrought by increased border enforcement, in order to look for ways to reduce the crises through a better understanding of the context. Community partners include the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, the Coronado National Forest, and the No More Deaths humanitarian aid group, all located within 25 miles of the Arizona-Sonora border. The results of this study, carried out largely during the summer of 2008, describe how the actions of land-management and humanitarian groups eventually conflicted and resulted in littering citations for the humanitarian aid volunteers who left water for migrants along trails on the wildlife refuge. The conflict was branded as an issue of conservation versus human rights. I argue that the conflict between land-management personnel and humanitarian aid volunteers arose not just from differing conservation and humanitarian goals, but from their different conceptions of problems associated with border activity and different ideas of the borderlands as a place.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural Resources</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12072009-223639/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE GENETIC ANALYSIS OF NEGATIVE GEOTAXIS BEHAVIOR IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER</field><field name="creator">Shuford, David Tice Jr.</field><field name="description">Behaviors are complex traits, which exhibit continuous phenotypic variation in natural populations. The continuous variation is attributable to the segregation of multiple interacting loci with individually small effects on behavior, which are sensitive to the environment. In Drosophila, loci with small, environmentally sensitive effects on behavior can be identified by screening collections of P-element insertions that have been generated in a co-isogenic background. Here, we have used this approach to identify novel candidate genes affecting geotaxis. Drosophila melanogaster are negatively geotactic, i.e., flies move opposite the Earth?s gravitational vector when disturbed. We developed a rapid assay to quantify this geotactic behavior. Individual flies are placed in a 15cm tube, and lightly tapped to the bottom. The vertical distance traveled in 10s is the measure of behavior. Using this assay, we quantified the behavior of 475 co-isogenic P-element insertion lines, generated in co-isogenic Canton-S backgrounds as part of the Berkeley Drosophila Gene Disruption Project. The most extreme scoring lines were also assayed for locomotor activity to control for pleiotropic effects associated with this quantitative trait. We found 24 lines with increased, and 15 lines with decreased geotaxis. Four lines had sex-specific effects on geotactic behavior. Seventeen of the mutations are in known genes, many of which affect neurogenesis (e.g. Mushroom-body expressed and neuralized). The remaining are insertions in predicted genes of unknown function. We tested a subset of lines in the classic geotaxis maze. Of the ten lines chosen to be tested, eight lines showed a significant difference from the parental line, and of these, six lines showed a phenotype that corroborated our observations in the climbing assay. Thus, our approach identified new candidate genes that contribute to geotaxis in Drosophila melanogaster.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12082004-160325/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and Synthesis of Porphyrins for Targeted Molecular Brachytherapy</field><field name="creator">Yao, Zhen</field><field name="description">New approaches are urgently needed for treatment of cancer. The inherent heterogeneity of cells in solid tumors has thwarted most approaches developed to date. A fundamentally new approach, targeted molecular brachytherapy, also known as selective targeted amplified radiotherapy (S.T.A.R.), is attractive conceptually but has not yet been implemented. This new method selectively accumulates radioactive precipitates in tumor sites by systemic treatment of distinct agents in a sequential manner. One of the key agents for such a therapy is a soluble, precipitable reagent (SPR). The essence of this thesis includes design, synthesis and evaluation of porphyrin-based SPRs for the S.T.A.R. method. Three distinct designs of porphyrin-based SPRs were proposed. Synthetic approaches for target SPRs were explored, and several model compounds were synthesized. The development of a new synthetic approach to trans-AB-porphyrins, which are essential structures in the designs of SPRs, is also described in this thesis. Several target SPRs have not yet been synthesized due to synthetic difficulties as well as limitations related to water-solubility or stability of compounds. On the other hand, a diphosphate porphyrin exhibited successful enzymatic conversion from the water-soluble form to a porphyrin precipitate. Future work toward SPRs will focus on new designs that incorporate such diphosphate porphyrins.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12082006-143415/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic analysis of odor-guided behavior in Drosophila melanogaster</field><field name="creator">Ganguly, Indrani</field><field name="description">The ability to respond to and interact with the chemical environment is fundamental to the survival of many species. It governs predator-prey relationships, kin and mate selection, food localization, maternal behaviors and avoidance of environmental toxins. Olfactory behavior is determined by the concerted action of multiple genes that interact with one another and with the environment, be it external, genetic or sexual. Like a number of other quantitative traits, odor-guided behavior shows significant sex-specificity in its phenotypic expression. However, the molecular basis of sexual dimorphism remains poorly defined. This study provides the first example of an autosomal pleiotropic gene that undergoes sex-specific transcriptional regulation to provide the potential for sexually dimorphic olfactory behavior. The phenotypic and molecular characterization of a P-element tagged locus, smi97B, reveals that the multiple PDZ (PSD-95, Discs-large, Zo-1) and LRR (Leucine-Rich Repeat) domain protein, Scribble (Scrib) is responsible for olfactory behavior in adult and larval stages of Drosophila melanogaster. In the adult, scrib is alternatively spliced to generate sex-specific transcripts that are correlated with sexually dimorphic olfactory phenotypes. Head-derived scrib splice variants differ in the number and positions of protein-interaction (PDZ and LRR) domains they encode. Since, Scrib is a synaptic scaffolding protein, these differences may direct the organization of sexually dimorphic synaptic signaling assemblies that contribute to odor-guided behavior.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12092002-021236/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fate and Distribution of Current-Use Pesticides in the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System of North Carolina</field><field name="creator">McCarthy, Annette</field><field name="description">Estuaries are complex ecosystems that are composed of a number of sensitive and inter-dependent environments. An abundance of nutrients combine with the dynamic conditions to create some of the most productive environments on the planet. Almost 85% of the commercially harvested fish in the United States depend on estuaries and the surrounding coastal waters at some stage in their life history. Many estuarine drainage basins contain large quantities of agricultural acreage. Over 29 million pounds of active ingredient of pesticides are applied in coastal drainage basins in the United States each year. Studies have shown that the overall condition of the nation's estuaries is fair, while benthic condition is poor. Seventy five percent of estuarine sediments are contaminated with pesticides. Concentrations of pesticides in 30% of the estuaries exceed the levels that are known to result in ecological effects at least 10% of the time. There have been few comprehensive pesticide studies in estuaries to date. The Albemarle-Pamlico (A-P) Drainage Basin of North Carolina forms the second largest estuarine system in the United States and supports heavy agricultural production with high pesticide use. I evaluated measurement and modeling strategies to assess exposure in the A-P drainage basin. Atrazine and metolachlor were the most frequently detected pesticides in water samples that were collected in the A-P drainage basin in 2000 and 2001. Concentrations of these compounds exceeded both human health and aquatic life criteria in 2000. No toxicity thresholds were exceeded in samples collected in 2001. Due to the expense associated with field sampling and pesticide analysis alternative methods for estimating pesticide exposure have been developed, including fate models. The Exposure Analysis Modeling System (EXAMS) was modified to model the fate of pesticides, specifically atrazine and metolachlor, in a small tidal estuary of the larger A-P estuarine system. Based on the estimate that 10% of the total amount of atrazine and metolachlor applied in the Bath Creek drainge basin would enter the estuary the EXAMS steady state model predicts concentrations of both atrazine and metolachlor that fall between the mean and maximum values that were measured in Bath Creek in 2002. Concentrations of pesticides in the A-P drainage basin, both measured and modeled, are significantly less than acute toxicity thresholds for even the most sensitive aquatic species. Due to the short lived nature of these compounds it is unlikely that organisms in the region would experience adverse health effects due to exposure to the existing concentrations.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toxicology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12092002-143945/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Can These Rights Be Fulfilled?: The Planning, Participants, and Debates of the To Fulfill These Rights Conference, June 1-2, 1966</field><field name="creator">Valeika, Kathryn Roberts</field><field name="description">On June 1 and 2, 1966, the White House sponsored the &#226;To Fulfill These Rights Conference&#226; in Washington, D.C. Following a year of planning by a council of civil rights activists, government officials, and big business and labor leaders, roughly 2500 people from diverse backgrounds and civil rights experiences attended the conference. Previously neglected by other historians, the conference and its planning reveal two important and related dynamics of the movement: the shifting alliances among civil rights leaders and the re-examination of civil rights goals and strategies. In particular, debates over the conference&#226;s list of invitees, format, and procedures capture disagreements between established civil rights leaders, the White House, and labor and business leaders over who would, or could, direct the next phase of the civil rights movement. Secondly, conference debates on the reach of federal power, affirmative action, Vietnam, the expansion of the movement, fears of imminent violence, and the emergence of Black Power reveal the conflicting ideas that would create deep divisions between activists, liberals, and the federal government in the late 1960s and years to come.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12092008-144935/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polypores of a North Carolina Piedmont Forest</field><field name="creator">Vernia, Caroline Sue</field><field name="description">Fungi play an important role in recycling woody debris in forest ecosystems. The dynamics of fungal decay of woody debris are important factors in creating animal habitat and soil organic matter as well as causing economic losses in the commercial utilization of timber resources. Polypore fungi account for approximately 70% of the fungi capable of decaying wood. On September 6,1996 winds from Hurricane Fran downed trees throughout the Piedmont of North Carolina and provided abundant substrate for polypore development. The objectives of this research were to: 1)Survey two forested tracts, totaling 115 hectares, for the occurrence of polypore fungi; 2) Record any new fungi or host-fungi associations for North Carolina; 3) Develop a key, based on macroscopic features, to these polypores for use by non-experts. A 100% cruise of Schenck Forest and an adjacent tract of land in Wake County, North Carolina was completed. Fifty-six polypore species representing 37 genera in five families were observed. Twenty-four taxa of woody plants were recorded as substrates. Six of these fungi are new reports for North Carolina. Fourteen of the host-fungi associations are new reports for the United States. A key and individual species descriptions are presented.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12102003-133109/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical Modeling of Single Phase Flow and Particulate Flow Subjected to Microwave Heating</field><field name="creator">Zhu, Jianxi</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to numerically investigate heat transfer in liquids and liquids with carried solid particles as they flow continuously in a duct that is subjected to microwave irradiation. During this process, liquid flows in an applicator tube. When flow passes through the microwave cavity, the liquid absorbs microwave power and its temperature quickly increases. The spatial variation of the electromagnetic energy and temperature fields in the liquid was obtained by solving coupled momentum, energy and Maxwell?s equations. A finite difference time domain method (FDTD) is used to solve Maxwell?s equations simulating the electromagnetic field. The effects of dielectric properties of the liquid, the applicator diameter and its location, as well as the geometry of the microwave cavity on the heating process are analyzed. For modeling particulate flow subjected to microwave heating, the hydrodynamic interaction between the solid particle and the carrier fluid is simulated by the force-coupling method (FCM). The Lagrangian approach is utilized for tracking particles. The electromagnetic power absorption, temperature distribution inside both the liquid and the particles are taken into account. The effects of dielectric properties and the inlet position of the particle on electromagnetic energy and temperature distributions inside the particle are studied. The effect of the particle on power absorption in the carrier liquid is analyzed. The effect of the time interval between consecutive injections of two groups of particles on power absorption in particles is analyzed as well.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12102006-235146/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Migration and spawning of anadromous shads in the Roanoke River, North Carolina</field><field name="creator">Harris, Julianne Elaine</field><field name="description">Anadromous alosines are ecologically, commercially, and recreationally valuable fishes. Some populations of alosines are at historically low levels, as a result of overfishing, pollution and habitat change, including the presence of dams, which block access to historic spawning sites upstream and alter spawning habitat downstream. To aid in the restoration of alosine stocks, I evaluated several methods for spawning habitat identification and characterization and evaluated trap and transport as a method to give American shad Alosa sapidissima access to additional spawning habitat above dams in the Roanoke River, North Carolina and Virginia. The Roanoke River has four anadromous shads: American shad, hickory shad A. mediocris, blueback herring A. aestivalis, and alewife A. pseudoharengus. For all four alosines, spawning sites river-wide were most efficiently identified using plankton tows. Spawning habitat selection for hickory shad and river herring (blueback herring and alewife) could be evaluated using spawning pads, whereas American shad eggs were unsuccessfully sampled by spawning pads and spawning habitats were best examined by visual observations of spawning splashes. Unlike the other alosines in this study, very little is known about spawning habitat for hickory shad. Hickory shad eggs were collected at water temperatures from 10 to 23 &#194;&#186;C, and peaked from 11 to 14 &#194;&#186;C. Spawning generally occurred in water velocities &#226;&#165;0.1 m/sec, over substrates free from silt. Standard USFWS and Bayesian belief network formats were used to develop preliminary habitat suitability models for hickory shad. Bayesian belief networks are a relatively new method for modeling habitat suitability for fishes, but could prove very useful in the future, especially for species such as American shad which have been the focus of more study and are in need of restoration. We evaluated movement patterns and spawning of sonic-tagged adult American shad transported to habitats above dams on the Roanoke River. Most transported fish spent relatively little time in the riverine habitat considered suitable for spawning and no eggs were collected by plankton sampling. American shad appeared to move more effectively through a smaller as compared to a larger reservoir, but migration was best when fish were released directly into riverine habitat. Low mortality resulted from downstream migration through each dam turbine, but many individuals were observed just upstream from a dam late in the season, suggesting that structures to increase downstream passage may be beneficial. We used data on behavior and outmigration of American shad adults and fry released above and below dams on the Roanoke River to develop a deterministic, density-dependent, stage-based matrix model to predict possible population-level effects of transporting American shad to upper basin habitats. The American shad population in the Roanoke River appears small compared to assumed values of carrying capacity in the lower river and would appear to benefit from transport only under optimal conditions of young survival and effective fecundity. The matrix model predicts that under present conditions, improvements to survival rates of young or adults would likely lead to greater improvements in the stock size of American shad in the Roanoke River.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12102009-152753/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic Mapping of Genes Controlling Two Leaf Surface Chemistry Traits and Identification of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) Associated with Resistance to Phytophthora nicotianae in Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.).</field><field name="creator">Vontimitta, Vijay</field><field name="description">The ultimate objective of a tobacco breeder is to use genetics to improve traits contributing to improved crop production efficiency and that affect product quality. Two leaf surface chemistries, cis-abienol and &#206;&#178;-methylvaleric acid-containing sucrose esters (BMVSEs), are known to be associated with organoleptic properties of tobacco products and may contribute to resistance against insect pests and fungal pathogens. The black shank disease, caused by Phytophthora nicotianae, causes severe crop losses annually in many tobacco growing regions of the world. Multiple races of this pathogen make it difficult to develop tobacco cultivars with high levels of resistance to all races. In the current study, an investigation was carried out to gain insight into the genetics controlling two leaf surface chemistry traits and black shank resistance using the assistance of microsatellite markers. A cigar tobacco line, &#226;Beinhart 1000,&#226; was chosen as a source of the ability to accumulate the two leaf surface chemistries and as a source of high levels of resistance against multiple races of the black shank pathogen. A doubled haploid population of 118 lines was developed from a cross between Beinhart 1000 and the flue cured cultivar, Hicks, which lacks the ability to produce the two leaf surface chemistries and is highly susceptible to the black shank disease. Field evaluations in disease nurseries were conducted using replicated trials in three environments. A genetic linkage map with 24 linkage groups was constructed by genotyping the mapping population with 190 microsatellite markers. Both genes controlling leaf surface chemistry traits were positioned on linkage group 4 and were separated by a genetic distance of 8.5 centimorgans (cM). Multiple interval mapping (MIM) analysis identified a total of six quantitative trait loci (QTL) (on linkage groups 2, 4, 8, 9, 11, and 14) associated with black shank disease resistance in Beinhart 1000. Two QTLs on linkage groups 4 and 8 were identified as having major effects and explained 20.5% and 23.5% of the phenotypic variation for end percent survival, respectively. The QTL on linkage group 4 was found to be strongly linked with the gene, Abl, controlling cis-abienol accumulation. Growth chamber evaluations of the mapping population with specific races (Race 0 and Race 1) revealed that the two major QTLs on linkage groups 4 and 8 were significantly associated with resistance to both races. The QTL on linkage group 8 was observed to have consistent large effects in both field and growth chamber evaluations. An attempt was also made to draw genetic comparisons between Beinhart 1000 and the currently most widely exploited source of black shank disease resistance, &#226;Florida 301&#226;. A mapping population of 125 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from the cross between Florida 301 and Hicks was used for this study. Microsatellite markers representing the six genomic regions identified to be associated with resistance in Beinhart 1000 were tested for their association with resistance in Florida 301. Markers on linkage group 8 and 2 were identified to be associated with resistance in Florida 301. Markers on linkage group 4 and other regions of interest were not significantly associated with resistance in Florida 301. Results may be useful for transferring the two leaf surface chemistry traits and black shank resistance into new cultivars using marker assisted breeding.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12102009-174020/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Establishment Rates and Growth Characteristics of Six Bermudagrass Cultivars for use on Athletic Fields and Golf Course Fairways</field><field name="creator">Reynolds, William Casey</field><field name="description">Bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) is the primary choice for athletic fields and golf course fairways in the southeastern United States. Its superior heat and drought tolerance as well as excellent recuperative capacity allow it to withstand many of the stresses often associated with recreational turf. There are several new cultivars on the market with little available information regarding their performance. Six cultivars of bermudagrass, ?TifSport?, ?Tifway?, ?GN-1?, ?Quickstand?, ?Navy Blue?, and ?Tifton 10? were established by sprigs on a Candor sand (Sandy, siliceous, thermic, Arenic Paleudult) at the rate of 0.1m3/100m2 on 28 June 2001 at the Sandhills Research Station in Jackson Springs, NC. During year one of the study, data were taken on establishment, rooting, disease incidence, fall color, and spring green-up of each of the six bermudagrasses. Tifton 10 demonstrated the ability to establish faster than all other cultivars based on its ranking on all observation dates followed by Quickstand and GN-1, which had five and four top rankings, respectively. No differences in rooting density were found among the six cultivars. Navy Blue exhibited significantly more dollar spot (Sclerotinia homoeocarpa F.T. Bennett) incidence than all other cultivars, while GN-1 had significanctly higher incidence of Large patch (Rhizoctonia solani). During April 2002, 10.8 cm diameter plugs were taken from the field plots for the low temperature study. Sixty stolons per cultivar were excised from the plugs and placed into a Low Temperature Stress Simulator (LTSS) where they were exposed to four different temperatures of 2oC, 0oC, ?2oC, and -4 oC for a period of 24 hr. No significant differences were found among cultivars in their ability to tolerate low temperatures, but mortality did increase as temperature decreased. After the field plots had achieved one year of growth, data were taken on growth characteristics such as root and rhizome mass, recuperative potential, surface hardness, seedhead production, and overall quality. No significant differences were found in root or rhizome mass among the six cultivars. Quickstand produced a harder surface than all other cultivars on 24 July, while Tifton 10, GN-1, and TifSport were the softest. TifSport consistently produced the highest turf quality of the six cultivars followed by Tifway, GN-1, and Navy Blue. Quickstand and Tifton 10 had the poorest quality over four observation dates, primarily due to their coarse texture and off-green color. Differences among these six bermudagrass cultivars imply that they may not all be suitable for the same situation. Turfgrass managers can match this data to their intended use and more accurately choose which cultivar will perform best under their specific conditions.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12112002-145750/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SIMULATION, NETWORK MODELING, AND IMAGING OF POROUS MEDIA DRYING</field><field name="creator">Ghosh, Supriyo</field><field name="description">Drying is a unit operation where water is removed from a material by means of evaporation and mass transfer. It is widely used in industrial manufacturing processes. Many of these processes involve drying of porous materials. Porous media are, in general, heterogeneous systems. The microstructure of the pore space influences transport properties and hence, drying rates. Thus, a quantitative geometrical characterization of the pore space is crucial for accurate prediction of porous media drying rates. Simulation of porous media structure, given a specific size distribution of constituent particles, followed by pore-space characterization is a powerful as well as economical predictive tool for product design. Realistic unconsolidated porous media were reconstructed through Monte Carlo gravitational particle packing simulation. The porous media simulation was validated by comparison with extracted transport related micro-structural parameters from x-ray micro-CT (computed tomographic) images. A mathematical morphology based three-dimensional image processing algorithm was developed to characterize the pore space in the simulated porous media. This realistic pore-throat network information was utilized in an invasion percolation based simulation of porous media drying and showed satisfactory agreement with quantitative data extracted from in-situ NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) imaging experiments.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12112006-103136/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Roles of Fat and pH on the Detection Thresholds and Partition Coefficients of Three Compounds: Diacetyl, Delta-Decalactone, and Furaneol in Water, Oil, and Emulsions.</field><field name="creator">Leksrisompong, Pattarin</field><field name="description">The effect of fat and pH on the best estimate threshold (BET) of 3 prominent dairy product flavor compounds with varying physicochemical properties: diacetyl, delta-decalactone, and furaneol, in water, oil and oil-in-water model emulsions (at 10 and 20 % fat at neutral and acidified pH 5.5) were investigated. The headspace-matrix partition coefficients (KHS/matrix) of each compound in the different matrixes were established. The rheology and particle size of the emulsions used in this study were also investigated. The particle size and the viscosity of the emulsions did not affect the BET or the partition coefficients. Reducing fat from 20 to 0 % did not affect the BET value or partition coefficient of diacetyl (P&gt;0.05). Increasing fat content increased the BET value and decreased the partition coefficient (P&lt;0.05) of the most lipophilic compound in the study, delta-decalactone. Fat did not affect the BET of furaneol (P&gt;0.05) but did have an effect on the partition coefficient (P&lt;0.05). At pH 7, addition of fat decreased the partition coefficient of furaneol whereas at pH 5.5, addition of fat increased the partition coefficient of furaneol. Adjustment of pH from 7.0 to 5.5 did not impact the BET values of delta-decalactone, but did affect the partition coefficients of furaneol at all fat levels and impacted diacetyl at 0 % fat. The partition coefficient results generally agreed with the BET values on the effect of fat and pH, although, the partition coefficient test was more sensitive to the differences in the matrix composition than a threshold test.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12112008-103758/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Geographical Mosaic of Myrmecochory in a Global Biodiversity Hotspot and the Fate of Myrmecochorous Seeds Dispersed by a Keystone Seed Disperser</field><field name="creator">McCoy, Neil L</field><field name="description">Seed dispersal mutualisms are important ecological interactions that can shape plant communities by influencing species distributions, community composition, and the regeneration of populations following a disturbance. Considering the fundamental role seed dispersal mutualisms play in many plant communities, it is important to understand, both generally and for individual seed dispersal mutualisms, what determines when animal partners successfully disperse seeds and when they do not. Myrmecochory, the dispersal of seeds by ants, is the most common form of zoochory in Western Australia. Myrmecochore plant diversity is richest in the Kwongan sandplains of the south-west, where ant-dispersed species can make up as much as 36% of the plant community. Here, I studied the determinants of seed dispersal rates to understand local variation in myrmecochorous seed dispersal rates. At a series of 30 sites, we sampled the ant and plant communities, measured aspects of the community structure (vegetation height, openness, topography, soil), measured seed removal rates and observed ant-seed interactions. The most significant factor that governed seed removal rates was the presence of the ant species Rhytidoponera violacea. Additionally, during seed dispersal observation trials, R. violacea removed 95% of all seeds taken. To better understand the fate of Acacia blakelyi seeds dispersed by R. violacea, we simulated variable seed burial depths and elaiosome removal by ants, followed by a bushfire to stimulate germination. Seed burial depth had a significant effect on seedling emergence, with the proportion of emerged seedlings declining with burial depth. The effect of depth was due to the strength of a fire-cue (heat) declining with depth. Seed burial depth also had a fitness cost, with a greater proportion of &#226;robust&#226; seedlings emerging from seeds buried closer to the surface. Seeds buried too deep to receive fire-cues remained dormant, adding to a long-lived soil seed bank.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12112008-142107/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementing and Evaluating SCM Algorithms for Rate-Aware Prefetching</field><field name="creator">Kulkarni, Amit Vasant</field><field name="description">File system prefetching has been widely studied and used to hide high latency of disk I/O.

In this work we draw parallels between file system prefetching and the field of Supply Chain Management (SCM), particularly Inventory Theory. We further describe two very commonly used algorithms in SCM that directly address access rate and uncertainty. We also implement these prefetching algorithms in the Linux kernel and present the performance results of using these algorithms. Our results show that with these SCM-based algorithms, we can improve the throughput of standard Linux file transfer applications by up to 33% and the throughput of some server workloads (such as Video-on-Demand) by up to 41%.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12112008-154909/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a Toxico-Chemogenomic Future: The Transformation of Public Gene Expression Data and Consideration for its Use.</field><field name="creator">Williams-DeVane, ClarLynda Raynell</field><field name="description">The term &#226;toxico-chemogenomics&#226; is used to convey extension of toxicogenomics to more broadly survey gene expression changes across chemical space. Moving towards an improved, publicly available toxico-chemogenomics capability requires not only common data standards and protocols across public resources, but also broad data coverage within the chemical, genomics and toxicological information domains, and transparent and functional linkages of Internet data resources. The first goal of this project was to assess the current extent of standardization, interoperability, and chemical indexing of public genomics resources with respect to toxico-chemogenomics utility. Focusing on the largest of these public data resources &#226; Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress -- the second goal was to chemically index the full experimental content of these repositories to assess the current coverage of chemical exposure-related microarray experiments in relation to chemical space and toxicology, and to make these data accessible in relation to other publicly available, chemically-indexed toxicological information. Current standards for chemical annotation within ArrayExpress and GEO are presently inadequate to this task, such that development of new methodologies to mine the author-submitted content was required. A series of automated Perl programs were utilized along with extensive manual review to transform the raw experiment/study descriptions and text files into a standardized chemically-indexed inventory of microarray experiments in both resources. These files and top-level experiment annotations allowed for identification of all current chemical-associated experimental content as well as the subset of chemical exposure-related (or &#226;Treatment&#226;) content deemed most relevant to toxicogenomics in the GEO Series and ArrayExpress Repository experiment inventories. With chemical exposure experiments suitably indexed by chemical structure, it is possible for the first time to assess the breadth of chemical study space represented in these databases, as well as the overlapping chemical content, and to begin to assess the sufficiency of data for making chemical similarity inferences. Chemical indexing of public genomics databases is also the first step towards integrating chemical, toxicological and genomics data into predictive toxicology by providing linkages across public resources. The main products of this effort include the following: (1) published, downloadable and structure-searchable DSSTox Structure-Index (Locator) files for both the GEO Series (GEOGDS) and ArrayExpress Repository (ARYEXP), containing standard chemical fields for the unique chemical &#226;Treatment&#226; subset, accompanied by URLs to AccessionID experiment pages in GEO and ArrayExpress; (2) published, downloadable DSSTox Aux data files for GEOGDS and ARYEXP providing a chemical-experiment pair index to all chemical-associated content in each resource and containing 14 standard genomics fields (e.g., Experiment_Title, Experiment_Description, Experiment_ArrayType, Species, Number_Samples, etc.) and source-specific fields extracted from each resource (e.g., MIAME_Protocol, MIAMI_Factors, etc. for ArrayExpress); and (3) incorporation of the &#226;Treatment&#226; chemical-experiment pair index with URLs linked directly to AccessionID pages for GEO and ArrayExpress into the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) PubChem resource. The secondary product of this effort is a methodology discussion about the proper use of public microarray data with a demonstrative analysis of how one might use the newly identified public microarray data.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12112008-214342/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Neck Resection Level on the Initial Torsional Stability of Cementless Total Hip Arthroplasty in Dogs</field><field name="creator">Brooks, Daniel John</field><field name="description">The initial torsional stability of a cementless total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the key factors in determining the biological fixation of the implant. The success of a cementless hip replacement relies on the quantity and quality of bone ingrowth that occurs. This study looked at the effects of femoral neck resection level on the initial torsional stability of cementless THA in the canine population. Twenty paired cadaver femurs were collected from dogs and implanted with canine cementless hip stems. One femur from each pair was prepared with a neck cut with its medial aspect located at the proximal aspect of the lesser trochanter (low neck cut) and the other with a neck cut with its proximo-lateral aspect at the ossum collis femoris isthmus of the greater trochanter and femoral neck (high neck cut). The specimens were then subjected to cyclic torque loads in the caudal direction (Amplitude: -0.1 N-m to set torque) at four torque levels (1 N-m, 2 N-m, 4 N-m, and 6 N-m) and the torsional displacement, axial subsidence, and strain were all recorded. A paired statistical analysis was completed so that specimens from the same dogs could be compared to each other. The low neck cut group was found to have significantly less micromotion than the high neck cut group during the 1 N-m and 4 N-m torque tests (p = 0.02 for both). Because the high neck cut specimens tended to have more micromotion they may be apt to have lower quality bone ingrowth. A significant difference was not found between the torsional displacements of the two groups. The high neck cut specimens were found to have significantly (p = 0.02) more implant rotation at 1.6 N-m of torque, however the average difference was only about 0.22 degrees which most likely does not indicate a clinically significant difference. No statistical difference was found between the axial subsidence of the high and low neck cut specimens other than at the 6 N-m level (p = 0.02). At 6 N-m the stems in the low neck cut specimens had an average upward movement of 255 +/- 310 um while the stems in the high neck cuts moved in the opposite direction and had an average downward movement of 280 +/- 695 um. The low neck specimens were found to have significantly more canal fill and implant impaction than the high neck cut specimens. This suggests that surgeons need to be mindful that they may not insert stems as deeply in femurs prepared with high neck cuts as they do in femurs with low neck cuts. This study was not able to show that one neck cut level was superior to the other, however the data indicate that the low neck cut group had slightly better stability based on having less micromotion at 1 N-m and 4 N-m and less at rotation at 1.6 N-m.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12122006-175747/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knots</field><field name="creator">Williams, Frank L.

I propose that incorporating traditional gender ideologies into the traditional ?add gender and stir? approach can help extend the theory and lead to a better understanding of the gender gap. Using data from the National Youth Survey, I empirically assess the differences in the levels (means) and the effects that attachment to family, commitment to school and/or a future career, and acceptance of traditional gender ideologies have on delinquency. The findings suggest that although Hirschi?s theory offers insight into why males and females engage in delinquent behavior, it does little to explain the gender gap in delinquency. Specifically, having ?stakes in conformity? curbs delinquency among both males and females. However, the data shows that these stakes in conformity do not help understand the gender gap per se. The findings also suggest that the acceptance of traditional gender ideologies play an important part in understanding the gender gap in delinquency because these ideologies promote delinquency among males but control female delinquency. These findings underscore arguments that the ?add gender and stir? approach to understanding the gender gap in delinquency is insufficient.

Our work builds off of recently published work by Graves and Willems (2003) that demonstrates that a simple-to-compute, congestion-based adjustment to supply lead times, first developed by Ettl et al. (2000), can be embedded in a non-linear optimization problem to minimize total investment in safety stock across the entire supply chain. We are interested in investigating how the Graves and Willems (GW) model performs under uncertainty in supply. We first propose an adjustment to the model (Mod-GW) by considering two types of fulfillment times, a normal fulfillment time and a worst possible fulfillment time , which allows us to account for supply uncertainty, or disruptions in supply. We evaluate the performance of GW and Mod-GW using Monte Carlo simulation and, using motivation from Timed-Petri Net analysis, develop an Informed Safety Stock Adjustment (ISSA) algorithm to compute the additional buffer stock levels necessary to improve downstream service performance to the target level. We find that the service performance of the Mod-GW solution is most sensitive to the probability of disruption at any node in the supply chain, requiring higher safety stock adjustments through ISSA as this probability increases. In particular, the relative value of the holding costs for components and finished goods?and the resulting impact on where safety stock is held in the network?is an important moderating factor in determining the level of service performance degradation of the Mod-GW solution as either , the probability of disruption at node j, or , the ratio of the disrupted and normal lead times, increases (i.e., as disruptions exert more impact on the network). The Informed Safety Stock Adjustment algorithm generally suggests a sufficient complementary amount to the safety stock.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12132005-115819/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Policing of Gender in Middle School</field><field name="creator">Seale, Elizabeth Kelley</field><field name="description">Based on 43 semi-structured interviews with children in grades 6th through 8th, this study examines how heteronormativity, or normative heterosexuality, shapes and reinforces gender stratification among preadolescents. The sample consists of 29 white and 17 non-white children. The author draws from self-evaluation theory, closure theory, and theory on heteronormativity in demonstrating that heteronorms and the use of the gay stigma operate to regulate gender performances and identities. Findings suggest specifically that a) while norms of femininity have altered in response to the feminist movement, norms of masculinity have not; b) male gender nonconformists are harassed through the use of the gay stigma, putting significant pressure on boys to maintain a hegemonic masculine/heterosexual identity; c) openly gay students are not always harassed to the extent suggested by the level of homophobia revealed in interviews with middle school students; d) boys use the gay stigma against other boys in their struggle for dominance over others; and e) white girls are less homophobic than other groups. The strict regulation of self and others reproduces heterosexism and patriarchy in ways profoundly important for understanding the persistence of inequality.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12132005-122850/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Male Broiler Breeder Feeding Programs on Growth, Reproductive Performance, and Broiler Progeny</field><field name="creator">Romero-Sanchez, Hugo</field><field name="description">Four studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of different feeding programs during rearing and production on broiler breeder male growth, fertility, and progeny performance. In Experiment I, the effects of two levels (High and Low) of cumulative nutrient intake during the rearing period to photostimulation at 21 wk of age through different dietary formulations or feeding programs were evaluated. The High cumulative nutrition program supplied 33.5 Mcal ME and 1,730 g CP, while the Low cumulative nutrition program supplied 29.6 Mcal ME and 1,470 g CP. At 21 wk of age in Experiment I-2, males were classified into Heavy or Light BW groups. A cumulative nutrient intake during the rearing period of 29.6 Mcal ME and 1,470 g CP, regardless of diet or feeding program resulted in a male of adequate BW that was able to maintain good fertility throughout the production period and produce broilers with increased 42-d BW. In Experiment III, two levels of dietary CP (12% and 17%) and two feeding programs (Concave and Sigmoid) were evaluated during the rearing period to 26 wk of age. The Concave or 17% CP treatments were unable to sustain fertility after 40 wk of age without an increased allocation of feed. In Experiments II, two antioxidant levels and different source of selenium were evaluated during the production period. In Experiment IV different feeding programs from 16 to 26 wk of age and during the production period were evaluated. The data showed that feed allocation relative to BW affected fertility more than did antioxidant inclusion. Furthermore, slow and consistently increasing feed increments from 16 to 26 wk of age and during the production period improved fertility and favorably impacted progeny performance. In conclusion, when males failed in accumulate adequate nutrients during the rearing period or gain adequate BW, as an indication of ME allocation, after photostimulation fertility declined and significant negative effects were observed in progeny performance.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science and Poultry Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12132005-210700/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional Profiling of Geminivirus Infection in Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0</field><field name="creator">Ascencio-Ibanez, Jose Trinidad</field><field name="description">Geminiviruses are small DNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus and use plant replication machinery to amplify their single-stranded genomes. Geminiviruses replicate through a combination of rolling-circle and recombination-dependent replication. Earlier studies showed that the geminivirus, Cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV), induces transcription of a host gene encoding a replication factor. To scrutinize the global impact of geminivirus infection on host gene expression, Arabidopsis transcriptome in response to CaLCuV infection at 12 days post inoculation was examined. These experiments uncovered 5241 Arabidopsis genes with changes in transcript levels (q &lt; 0.004, p &lt; 0.002) in response to infection. Data mining of the differentially expressed genes revealed that CaLCuV triggers a pathogen response via the salicylic acid pathway and inhibits the jasmonate pathway. CaLCuV also induced genes associated with programmed cell death and genotoxic stress, including components of the host DNA repair apparatus. CaLCuV also impacted expression of cell cycle-associated genes, preferentially activating genes with peak expression in S and G2 and inhibiting genes that peak in G1 and M. A limited set of core cell cycle genes expressed during cell cycle re-entry, late G1, S and early G2 had increased RNA levels, while core cell cycle genes expressed in early G1 and late G2 had reduced transcript levels. FACS analysis of nuclei from infected leaves showed an increase in 8C, 16C and 32C DNA content relative to nuclei from control leaves. Together, these results underscore the complexity of geminivirus/host interactions and establish that geminiviruses alter cell cycle controls to induce plant cells to move into an endocycle and support viral replication. We also standardized a previously reported method for inoculating geminiviruses using plasmid DNA rubbed onto leaves in the presence of an abrasive (DNA abrasion). We can obtain 100% inoculation efficiency with this method in solanaceous plants. Silencing of an endogenous gene was successful when a silencing vector was inoculated by DNA abrasion.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12132006-114927/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Montanism in Second/Third Century CE Anatolia: A Hybridist Mystery Religion.</field><field name="creator">Viets, Chaffee W.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to provide an alternative lens to use in the study of Montanism than is offered by the dominant paradigm developed during the last two centuries. Most scholars assume or assert that the earliest Montanists in Phrygia, in ancient Turkey, sprung from within the local, rural Christian community of Pepouza. As such, most modern research has omitted considerations of anything beyond incidental contact with so called &#226;pagan&#226; cults in the surrounding area. I will argue that Phrygian Montanism can be viewed from its inception as a religion with several parental contributors, embodied as an eclectic amalgam of multiple forms of Christianity, the cult of Cybele and Attis, the cult of Dionysius, the oracle cult of Apollo, and other sources including Judaism. In this sense, it rather resembled not merely a Christian &#226;heresy&#226; as several Ante and Post Nicene fathers asserted in their polemical tracts, nor an offshoot of a polytheistic cult, but instead a unique mystery religion, neither wholly &#226;pagan&#226; nor Christian in composition. In other words, Montanism might be viewed alternately, regardless of what its founder(s) believed this &#226;New Prophecy&#226; represented, as an independent mystery religion, separately practiced while simultaneously overlapping the various Anatolian Christianities, &#226;pagan&#226; cults, and state sponsored religions of the eastern Roman Empire. Within this context, arguments about its source, placement, acceptance and religious validity within the &#226;pagan&#226; or Christian historical worlds become tangential. Seen as an island, a new vision of Montanism arises, one defined more comprehensively by the social, cultural and religious traditions of Anatolia and a Christianity that began with Pauline missionary activity 100 years prior to Montanism&#226;s rise in Phrygia. I intend to argue this thesis by presenting an outline of Anatolian culture and religion as it relates to the emergence of Montanism in rural Phrygia before showing how it represents a uniquely structured hybrid mystery religion with both Christian and &#226;pagan&#226; elements.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12132008-084514/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dissolution of Phosphate in a Phosphorus-Enriched Ultisol as Affected by Microbial Reduction</field><field name="creator">Hutchison, Kimberly J</field><field name="description">Knowledge of the effect of reduced soil redox conditions on P dissolution is needed to better assess P mobility to surface or ground water. The objectives of our study were to determine the effect of microbial reduction on P dissolution and determine mechanisms of P release in a reduced soil. Duplicate suspensions of silt+clay from a Cape Fear sandy clay loam were reduced in a continuously-stirred redox reactor for 40 d. We studied the effects of three treatments on P dissolution: (i) 2 g dextrose kg-1 solids added as a microbial carbon source at time 0 d; (ii) 2 g dextrose kg-1 solids split into three additions at 0, 12, and 26 d; and (iii) no added dextrose. Regardless of treatment or variation in the intensity of reduction rates, dissolved reactive P (DRP) increased up to 7-fold from 1.5 to 10 mg L-1 and was linearly related (R2 = 0.79) with dissolved organic C. Dissolved Fe and Al and pH also increased, suggesting the formation of aqueous Fe- and Al-dissolved organic matter (DOM) complexes. Separate batch experiments were performed to study the effects of increasing pH and citrate additions on PO4 dissolution under aerobic conditions. Increasing additions of citrate increased concentrations of DRP, Fe, and Al, while increasing pH had no effect. Results indicated that increased DOM during soil reduction contributed to the increase in DRP, perhaps by competitive adsorption or by formation of aqueous ternary PO4-Fe-DOM or PO4-Al-DOM complexes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12142003-144219/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of age-1 striped bass predation on juvenile fishes in western Albemarle Sound</field><field name="creator">Tuomikoski, Jack Esa</field><field name="description">Historically, adult river herring (&lt;I&gt;Alosa pseudoharengus, Alosa aestivalis&lt;/I&gt;) and American shad (&lt;I&gt;Alosa sapidissima&lt;/I&gt;) fisheries were economically important in Albemarle Sound. Stocks of these species are currently in decline while stock estimates for striped bass (&lt;I&gt;Morone saxatilis&lt;/I&gt;) have increased 10-fold for the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River stock since the early 1990s. The primary goal of this study was to quantify the diet, prey selectivity and the predatory impact of age-1 striped bass on juvenile river herring and American shad in 2002 and 2003. Similar estimates were produced for juvenile yellow perch (&lt;I&gt;Perca flavescens&lt;/I&gt;), a species with an expanding fishery. Striped bass and prey samples were obtained from 443 beach seine and 171 purse seine hauls from May through October in 2002 and 2003. Age-1 striped bass were primarily piscivorous from May onward in both years. &lt;I&gt;Alosa&lt;/I&gt; spp. were a small component of age-1 striped bass diet in summer months but dominated diet in early fall months. Age-1 striped bass fed randomly with respect to &lt;I&gt;Alosa&lt;/I&gt; spp. abundance during the summer and selected for them during early fall months. During summer 2003, selectivity for yellow perch decreased with concomitant decreases in importance as a prey item. Field estimates of consumption rates ranged from 3 to 8 % body weight per day while bioenergetics model estimates of consumption ranged from 4 to 12 % in 2002 and 3 to 10% in 2003. Age-1 striped bass density, diet, prey sizes eaten, and consumption rates were used to calculate loss rates due to predation and were compared with total loss rates from catch curves. There was interannual variation in the effects of predation. Age-1 striped bass predation had a marked effect on juvenile American shad densities in 2002 but had little influence on their numbers in 2003. Conversely, age-1 striped bass predation explained none of the loss in juvenile yellow perch in 2002 but accounted for nearly all of the loss in 2003. Thus, predation by striped bass may explain at least some of the variability in year class strength for these species. In most cases, age-1 striped bass predation did not have a strong influence on juvenile alewife numbers. Juvenile blueback herring were preyed on but the relative predatory impact could not be determined because of apparent emigration into the study area. To better understand striped bass impacts on &lt;I&gt;Alosa&lt;/I&gt; spp., future work should address movement of juvenile &lt;I&gt;Alosa&lt;/I&gt; spp into and out of Albemarle Sound estuary.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12142004-132232/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self-assembled Magnetic Nanostructures: Epitaxial Ni on TiN (001) Surface</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Honghui</field><field name="description">Systems that contain single domain magnetic particles have been receiving intensive attentions over recent years since they are possible candidates for applications in ultrahigh-density data storage and magnetoelectronic devices. The focus of this research is self-assembly growth of magnetic nickel nanostructures by domain matching epitaxy under Volmer-Weber mode. The growth was conducted by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique using epitaxial titanium nitride film as the template, which was in turn grown on silicon (100) substrate. The structural characterization includes X-ray diffraction and both cross-sectional and plan-view transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that the nickel islands formed exhibit a self-assembled nature, i.e., a certain degree of uniformity in orientation, shape, and size. The orientation relationship observed is Ni {100} // TiN {100} // Si {100}, the so-called ?cube-on-cube? relationship. The islands are faceted, forming truncated pyramids with walls of (111) planes and a flat top of (100) plane. The base of islands is rectangular with the two principal edges parallel to two orthogonal &lt;011&gt; directions. The size distribution is relatively narrow, comparable to that obtained from self-assembled islands grown under Stranski-Krastanow (S-K) mode. A certain degree of self-organization was also found in the island lateral distribution: island chains were observed along the directions close to &lt;011&gt;, which are also the edge directions. The island faceting could be explained by surface energy minimization. The interaction of island edge induced strain field between neighboring islands is believed to be responsible for the size uniformity and the lateral ordering. Magnetic measurements were also conducted on these crystallographically aligned nickel islands using superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer, and the results were compared with that obtained from the ensemble of randomly oriented nickel islands, which were grown on polycrystalline/amorphous Al2O3 matrix layer. It is found that both blocking temperature and coercivity of aligned nickel islands are significantly higher than that of the randomly oriented nickel islands. The enhancement in ferromagnetism is attributed to the increased collective effects resulting from the particle interactions in the ensemble of aligned islands, which are self-assembled and self-organized to some degree.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12142004-192338/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Novel Method for Dynamic Yarn Tension Measurement and Control in Direct Cabling Process</field><field name="creator">Shankam Narayana, Vivek Prasad</field><field name="description">Yarn tension control is an important parameter for quality and efficiency in textile processes. It has a significant influence on productivity in various processes such as winding, twisting and cabling. There have been several articles based on theoretical models, which discuss the effect of various factors on yarn tension variation in direct cabling, but very few have addressed the possibility of measuring and controlling it practically while the yarn is being twisted. Quality control system manufacturers like TEMCO (Textile Machinery Components) and BTSR (Best Technologies Studies and Research) have come up with smart tension scanning systems that perform online tension monitoring in various textile machines. However, these systems cannot be installed on the direct cabling machine due to their size and cost. The fact that the supply yarn package is housed inside the rotating yarn balloon restrains any wired tension sensor from performing online measurement. As such, there is an immediate need for using a wireless sensing device to perform online yarn tension measurement and execute a control mechanism that will control yarn tension adaptively. The objective of this research is to demonstrate the possibility of applying MEMS (MicroElectroMechanical Systems) technology with radio frequency (RF) transmission to effectively carry out dynamic online measurement for the control of yarn tension. A novel technique to achieve online control using the measured real-time data has been implemented. A device that ensures uniform tension in the yarn has been designed and developed. Ways of measuring twist in the cabled yarn using optical micrometers and digital imaging systems have also been explored, because variation in tension manifests variation in twist. Using the twist values obtained from these sensors, the individual tensions in the component yarns can be adjusted, resulting in the formation of a uniform cabled yarn with equal lengths of both component yarns.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiber and Polymer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12142005-110719/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE FOR CONTAMINATION SOURCE CHARACTERIZATION IN WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS</field><field name="creator">Sreepathi, Sreerama (Sarat)</field><field name="description">Urban water distribution systems (WDSs) are vulnerable to accidental and intentional contamination incidents that could result in adverse human health and safety impacts.

Many current toxicological models assume that PAHs present in the dissolved phase reflect actual PAH bioavailability to organisms. Plants can release significant amounts of plant organic matter (POM) to soils and sediments; however, the mechanisms by which POM may affect PAH bioavailability in sediments are unclear. The rhizosphere may increase PAH bioavailability by destabilizing soil organic matter (SOM) and enhancing PAH desorption, or the rhizosphere may alter SOM composition and provide new carbon matrices to sorb/sequester PAHs and reduce PAH desorption. Desorption studies were conducted to determine if vegetation decreased or increased the rate and mass amounts of desorbable PAHs. Replicate desorption studies were conducted using vegetated and non-vegetated bulk sediment and HF/HCl humin fractions; sediments were collected from a coastal refinery distillate waste pit (RP) and refinery-impacted sediments from a freshwater canal (IH). Desorption isotherms for four PAHs were determined by two methods, aqueous and TenaxTM bead extractions. PAHs were quantified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry selected ion monitoring (GC/MS SIM). Results showed differences in PAH desorption based on the amount of time vegetation had been present in sediments. Vegetated sediments with 30+ years of vegetative growth (RP) desorbed more PAHs than non-vegetated sediments by TenaxTM extraction in both bulk and humin sediment fractions. Recently vegetated, IH freshwater sediments desorbed fewer PAHs than non-vegetated IH sediments by aqueous and TenaxTM extractions in bulk and humin sediment fractions. These findings suggest that initial exposure of sediment to vegetation slows PAH desorption and that extensive exposure to vegetation enhances PAH desorption from both labile and refractory SOM.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural Resources</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12142006-113455/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interest-Matching Comparisons using CP-nets</field><field name="creator">Wicker, Andrew White</field><field name="description">The formation of internet-based social networks has revived research on traditional social network models as well as interest-matching, or match-making, systems. In order to automate or augment the process of interest-matching, we follow the trend of qualitative decision theory by using qualitative preference information to represent a user's interests. In particular, a common form of preference statements for humans is used as the motivating factor in the formalization of ceteris paribus preference semantics. This type of preference information led to the development of conditional preference networks (CP-nets). This thesis presents a method for the comparison of CP-net preference orderings which allows one to determine a shared interest level between agents. Empirical results suggest that distance measure for preference orderings represented as CP-nets is an effective method for determining shared interest levels. Furthermore, it is shown that differences in the CP-net structure correspond to differences in the shared interest levels which are consistent with intuition. A generalized Kemeny and Snell axiomatic approach for distance measure of strict partial orderings is used as the foundation on which the interest-matching comparisons are based.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12142006-120734/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION OF INJECTED EMULSIFIED OIL FOR IN-SITU BIOREMEDIATION OF HETEROGENEOUS AQUIFERS</field><field name="creator">Clayton, Matthew Hughes</field><field name="description">Emulsified oil can be injected into the subsurface to enhance the in-situ bioremediation of chlorinated solvents, energetic materials, and some heavy metals. Current design practice for these remediation systems is not well formalized and depends much on ?engineering intuition.? To better understand the effects of different remediation system designs, computer models are being developed that can accurately and efficiently simulate how the oil moves through and reacts in the subsurface. To this end, we have developed a Langmuir isotherm based transport model to simulate the distribution of emulsified oils in an aquifer in order to investigate what effect changing the volume of emulsion, amount of oil, and injection pattern has on distributing the oil through the aquifer. Upon investigation we found that increasing the volume of emulsion and mass of oil has a diminishing increase on distribution and that injection pattern has little effect at typical injection volumes. We further developed regression equations to estimate the distribution of emulsified oil for both areal and barrier treatment to be used in improving injection system design.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12142007-144939/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrogen Relations in Bermudagrass During Growth and Dormancy Cycles</field><field name="creator">Wherley, Benjamin George</field><field name="description">Use of recycled water for turfgrass irrigation is increasing in the southeastern U.S. because of population growth and interest in protecting water quality. Turfgrass systems are perceived to be well suited for effluent dispersal due to their proximity to waste treatment facilities, in-ground irrigation systems, and ability to efficiently absorb (i.e. filter) nutrient contaminants when actively growing. However, effluent generation is continuous and bermudagrass growth is seasonal in the southeastern U.S. Clearly, there is a need to more thoroughly understand the capacity of bermudagrass, the turfgrass most often involved with effluent dispersal, for receiving effluent irrigation. This series of experiments was designed with the overall intent of examining the capacity of a bermudagrass turf/soil system for handling effluent applications. Experiments involved 1) characterizing seasonal changes in nitrate assimilation efficiency of the system, 2) determining the effects of prolonged soil saturation on nitrate uptake efficiency, and 3) characterizing internal nitrogen relations during the spring emergence period. While it is difficult to extend the results of these experiments, quantitatively, to situations where effluent is being applied in the field, the evidence does support a few basic observations. Bermudagrass appears to be capable of assimilating large amounts of N when growing, an ability that may well extend into transition months when little vertical shoot growth is occurring. Furthermore, although reduction in quality occurred, shoot growth and nitrate uptake efficiency of bermudagrass and centipedgrass was relatively unaffected by prolonged saturated soil conditions, a condition that may be likely with effluent irrigated sites.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12142007-163215/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bacteriophage Defense Systems and Strategies for Streptococcus thermophilus</field><field name="creator">Sturino, Joseph Miland</field><field name="description">The genomes of six Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages were compared to identify genes that could be targeted by engineered phage defense systems with potentially widespread efficacy. The genes associated with the S. thermophilus phage Sfi21-prototype genome replication module, including a putative primase and a putative helicase, were found to be among the best candidates due to their frequency of distribution in industrial phage isolates, striking sequence conservation between independent isolates, and intrinsic strategic importance in early phage development. Fourteen antisense RNA cassettes targeting the phage k3-derived helicase (hel3) or primase (pri3) genes were expressed in S. thermophilus NCK1125. These constructs consistently reduced the efficiency of plaquing (EOP) of phage k3 to between 5 x 10-1 and 2.0 x 10-3 depending on the (i) gene targeted and (ii) region of the gene that was targeted. The largest antisense RNAs were generally found to confer the largest reductions in EOP, however shorter antisense RNAs designed to the 5' region of the gene retained much of the inhibitory function, especially if they contained sequences complementary to the ribosome binding site. Expression of antisense RNAs correlated with decreased levels of phage encoded primase transcripts, likely due to increased degradation of the dsRNA complex. This, in turn, correlated with diminished phage genome replication and aborted phage development. In a separate study, invariant and highly conserved amino acids within a primase consensus sequence were targeted by site-specific mutation within the S. thermophilus phage k3-encoded putative primase. PCR products containing the desired mutation(s) were cloned and expressed in S. thermophilus NCK1125. The majority of the examined constructs remained sensitive to phage k3, however four constructs conferred strong phage resistance to the bacterial host. The mutated residues resided within a putative ATPase/helicase domain suspected to be critical for primase function in vivo. The co-expression in trans of the K238(A/T) or RR340-341AA mutant proteins suppressed the function of the native, phage-encoded primase protein in a dominant negative fashion via a proposed subunit poisoning mechanism. According to this model, the plasmid-encoded mutant primase subunits are structurally intact and form stable interactions with the native, phage-encoded primase subunits, thus inhibiting their activity. These constructs completely inhibited phage genome synthesis and reduced the efficiencies of plaquing more that nine log cycles. Given the magnitude of the resistance conferred, it was concluded that the putative primase is essential for genome replication in S. thermophilus Sfi21-type phages. Further, it was also clear that host-encoded factors were unable to complement the resultant deficiency. Amber mutations introduced upstream of the transdominant RR340-341AA and K238(A/T) mutations restored phage genome replication and phage sensitivity of the host, indicating that translation was required to confer phage resistance. Residues within a critical oligomerization domain were also identified through genetic analysis. Introduction of an E437A mutation downstream of the transdominant K238T mutation completely suppressed phage resistance, indicating that the E437A mutation precluded the association of the mutant and native subunits. To our knowledge, this is the first use of subunit poisoning to inhibit phage replication in the lactic acid bacteria.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Functional Genomics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12152003-034319/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-Dimensional Data Set Visualization in Portable Computing Environments</field><field name="creator">Romeo, Michael John</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the issues involved with a graphical presentation of large, multi-dimensional data sets.

The caspase family, and especially caspase-3, is integral to apoptosis. We show that an uncleavable mutant (D3A) of procaspase-3 is catalytically active with Km similar to that of its mature counterpart. We developed limited proteolysis assays using trypsin and V8 proteases, which allow the examination of amino acids in three of five active site loops. In addition, we examined the response of the two tryptophanyl residues in the active site to several quenching agents over the pH range of 3 to 9. Overall, the data suggest that the major conformational change that occurs upon maturation results in formation of the loop bundle between loops L4, L2 and L2?. The pKa?s of both catalytic groups decrease as a result of the loop movements. However, loop L3, which comprises the bulk of the substrate-binding pocket, does not appear to be unraveled and solvent exposed, even at lower pH. In order to understand the active site formation in the context of folding, we looked into the equilibrium unfolding of procaspase-3(C163S). The equilibrium unfolding of procaspase-3(C163S) is described by a four-state equilibrium model in which the native dimer undergoes an isomeration to a dimeric intermediate, and the dimeric intermediate dissociates to a monomeric intermediate, which then unfolds. Therefore, dimerization is a folding event and it contributes significantly to the protein stability (18.8 kcal/mol of 25.8 kcal/mol). Equilibrium unfolding experiments of procaspase-3(C163S) at different pH shows maximum stability at pH 7.2, and a transition from four-state model to a three-state monomer and finally to a two-state monomer model with decrease in pH. This is representative of conformational change and dimer dissociation at lower pH (between pH 5 and 4). The pro-less variant of procaspase-3(C163S) folds reversibly only in 1:1 protein to pro-peptide ratio suggesting it might act as an intramolecular chaperone (IMC).</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12152003-200515/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the Pyrolysis of Chromated Copper Arsenate-Treated Wood: Analytical Methodology and Optimization</field><field name="creator">FU, QIRONG</field><field name="description">Low temperature pyrolysis offers a feasible option for wood waste management and the recovery of a variety of useful chemicals. The effect of Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA) wood preservatives on the yield and composition of various pyrolysis products was investigated in the present research. A novel quantitative 31P NMR methodology has been developed to quantify levoglucosan and levoglucosenone from the pyrolysate of CCA-treated and untreated wood. The CCA treatment on wood had a significant effect on the amount of main carbohydrate derived degradation products of tar. In particular, a higher yield of levoglucosan can be obtained compared to that from untreated wood. Phosphoric acid has proven to be an efficient catalyst to favor levoglucosenone formation. The pyrolysis of CCA-treated wood in the presence of phosphoric acid gave rise to high yields of levoglucosenone, which demonstrated the potential for a new pathway in the rational use of CCA-treated wood waste. Pretreated wood with metal compounds has demonstrated that K2Cr2O7 and CuSO4 salts promote the formation of levoglucosan. The CrO3 treatment was found to favor the formation of levoglucosenone. A kinetic study of the pyrolysis of CCA-treated wood by thermogravimetric analysis has shown that CCA components have a significant influence on the thermal decomposition behavior of CCA-treated wood, which accelerate the weight loss of wood and the oxidation of the char.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wood and Paper Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12152006-062858/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DESIGN AND MODELING OF A MARS TUMBLEWEED ROVER</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Jamie Leigh Miss</field><field name="description">A Mars Tumbleweed Rover is a spherical, wind driven, planetary rover.

A model of copyright developed by Landes and Posner (2003) explaining the effect of varying levels of copyright protection on research incentives, is closely followed and adopted in a patent and regulatory context. Exclusivity here is taken to refer to the intellectual property environment and regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pertaining to marketing exclusivity for approved drugs. Both these aspects determine the period of time that drugs get marketed exclusively with limited competition and the amount that markets enable them to appropriate in return for their research activity. Intellectual property debates regarding the scope of patents and determination of patentable subject matter would affect research intensives of firms such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms. Besides obtaining patents, FDA approval for marketing of new drugs is also a long regulatory process and governed by the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 brought about some crucial amendments to the drug regulatory process by enabling easy entry of generic drug manufacturers. Since the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act, to the amendments introduced to the Hatch-Waxman Act through the Medicare Prescription Drug Act (2003), various court decisions have been instrumental in recognizing the weak links in the Hatch-Waxman amendments to the FFDCA (1938). These cases were precursors to some of the eventual statutory amendments to the Hatch-Waxman Act which were passed through the Medicare Prescription Drug Act of 2003. In the current study, the reaction of three sets of firms- pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and generics drug manufacturers, are analyzed following some precedent-setting cases that changed the exclusivity available to new drugs entering the market. The event study methodology is used in evaluating the change in firm returns following these decisions, and determining whether they are affected significantly negatively or positively. As an extension to the study, the research behavior of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms are also analyzed taking into account the abnormal returns obtained from these event studies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12152006-183255/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life Cycle Inventory Incorporating Fuel Cycle and Real-World In-Use Measurement Data for Construction Equipment and Vehicles.</field><field name="creator">Pang, Shih-Hao</field><field name="description">Biodiesel is an alternative fuel that can be made from vegetable oils or animal fat. This study focuses on whether substitution of soy-based biodiesel fuels for petroleum diesel would produce an overall reduction in emissions of selected pollutants. A life cycle inventory model was developed to estimate energy consumption and emissions of selected pollutants and greenhouse gases. Real-world measurements using portable emission measurement system (PEMS) were made for 15 construction vehicles, including five backhoes, four front-end loaders, and six motor graders on both petroleum diesel and soy-based B20 biodiesel. These data are used as the basis for vehicle tailpipe emission factors of CO2, CO, HC, NOx, and PM. The results imply that biodiesel is a promising alternative fuel for diesel, but that there are some environmental trade-offs. Analysis of empirical data reveals that intra-vehicle variability of energy use and emissions is strongly influenced by vehicle activity that leads to variations in engine load, as represented by manifold absolute pressure (MAP). Vehicle-specific models for fuel use and tailpipe emissions were developed for each of the 30 construction vehicle. The time-based regression model has the highest explanatory ability among six models and is recommended in order to predict fuel use and emission rate for diesel-fueled nonroad construction equipment. Representative duty cycles for each type of vehicles were characterized by a frequency distribution of normalized manifold absolute pressure (MAP). In order to assess the variations of fuel use and emissions among different duty cycles, for a given engine, the inter-cycle variability is assessed. In order to assess the variations of fuel use and emissions among engines, for a given duty cycle, the inter-engine variability is assessed. The results indicated time-based inter-cycle and inter-engine variations of fuel use and emissions are significant. Fuel-based emission factors have less variability among cycles and engines than time-based emission factors. Fuel-based emission factors are more robust with respect to inter-engine and inter-cycle variations and are recommended in order to develop an emissions inventory for nonroad construction vehicles. Real-world in-use measurements should be a basis for developing duty cycle correction factors in models such as NONROAD.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://web.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12152007-080346/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heroes, Gods, and Virtues: a comparison and contrast of the heroes in the Aeneid and The Lord of the Rings</field><field name="creator">Davis, Jason Larry</field><field name="description">The heroes in Virgil?s Aeneid and Tolkien?s The Lord of the Rings are compared and contrasted. Some of the heroic characteristics that Tolkien instills in his characters are similar to Aeneas?s, but the primary heroes?Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, and Gandalf?display particularly Christian virtues that complement and fulfill Virgil?s pre-Christian ideals. The comparison begins with Aeneas?s and Frodo?s choices to leave Carthage and Lothlorien because those two cities pose similar temptations. However the protagonists? decisions have differing motivations. Motive marks the beginning of the contrast which then proceeds to analyze goals and hopes of the characters. The virtues advocated by the two authors are directly connected to the theologies at work in their plots, and the varying celestial powers and forces of evil are contrasted as well. Finally, the conclusions of the two works reveal the greatest difference between the heroes?the power and importance of mercy rather than strength.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12162002-104157/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Minimizing WIP over a Rolling Horizon in a Job Shop</field><field name="creator">Coley, Andrea L</field><field name="description">In this paper, a job shop scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing work in process (WIP) subject to meeting due dates constraints is evaluated in a rolling horizon setting.

Epidemiological studies were conducted to examine the variation in aggressiveness among isolates, period of fruit susceptibility in &lt;i&gt;V. vinifera&lt;/i&gt;, relative susceptibility of cultivars to bitter rot, and influence of temperature and duration of wetness on infection. Detached &lt;i&gt;V. vinifera&lt;/i&gt; ?Chardonnay? fruit were inoculated with 10 isolates of &lt;i&gt;G. uvicola&lt;/i&gt; obtained from fruit of &lt;i&gt;V. vinifera&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;V. rotundifolia&lt;/i&gt; (muscadine grape), and a French-American hybrid. Isolates HCMD1 and HCMD5, obtained from &lt;i&gt;V. vinifera&lt;/i&gt; grapes from a Maryland vineyard, were the most aggressive. Severity of disease on fruit inoculated with isolates collected from &lt;i&gt;V. vinifera&lt;/i&gt; was significantly higher than with isolates collected from &lt;i&gt;V. rotundifolia&lt;/i&gt;. The period of fruit susceptibility was distinguished by inoculating intact clusters of grapes in vineyards in Alamance Co. and Rockingham Co., NC, every 2 weeks from bloom until 2 weeks before harvest. Susceptibility of &lt;i&gt;V. vinifera&lt;/i&gt; ?Merlot,? ?Chardonnay,? and ?Cabernet Franc? fruit increased from bloom until v&#233;raison in 2003 and from bloom until 2 weeks before v&#233;raison in 2004. The relative susceptibility of 38 cultivars and selections, including 23 &lt;i&gt;V. vinifera&lt;/i&gt; cultivars and 5 French-American hybrids, was determined by inoculating and incubating detached fruit at 26&#176;C. Fruit of &lt;i&gt;V. vinifera&lt;/i&gt; were significantly more susceptible to infection by &lt;i&gt;G. uvicola&lt;/i&gt; than French-American hybrids. &lt;i&gt;V. vinifera&lt;/i&gt; ?Petite Sirah,? ?JB97-8-0-7,? ?MissBlanc,? ?Roussanne,? ?Mourv&#233;dre,? and ?Petit Verdot? were among the most susceptible to the bitter rot pathogen. &lt;i&gt;V. aestivalis&lt;/i&gt; ?Cynthiana Norton,? &lt;i&gt;V. vinifera&lt;/i&gt; ?Arkansas 1271? and ?Riesling,? and French-American hybrid ?Traminette? and ?Chardonel? were among the most resistant. Growth chamber studies also were conducted to examine the influence of temperature and duration of wetness on infection. Detached fruit of &lt;i&gt;V. vinifera&lt;/i&gt; ?Cabernet Sauvignon,? ?Cabernet Franc,? and ?Chardonnay? were inoculated and incubated at 14, 18, 22, 26, or 30&#176;C for 6, 12, 18, or 24 hours.

This study was focused mainly on three enhancements. First, the queue propagation algorithm of the selected tool (DYNASMART-P) was modified to more realistically model traffic congestion. The author proposed the addition of transfer flow capacity and backward gated flow constraints for more accurately calculating transfer flow rate. Second, the study modeled the natural diversion behaviors of drivers who do not receive traveler information. Lastly, statistical models of user responses to traveler information were developed using binary and multinomial logit methods to understand and model the relationship between drivers&#226; socio-economic characteristics and their responses to traveler information. Among these three enhancements, the first two (improved queue propagation and natural diversion behavior algorithms) were implemented in the enhanced model. The user behavior models, however, were not implemented because their predictive power was not acceptable due to limitations in the data set. The enhanced model was applied to two case studies: 1) verifying the capabilities of the model under a recurring bottleneck scenario on I-40 corridor in the Triangle region of North Carolina, and 2) demonstrating the capability of the enhanced model to measure the effectiveness of U-Transportation (similar to the Vehicle Infrastructure Integration [VII] program in the USA) which has been under development in Korea. The first case study results showed that the improved queue propagation algorithm simulated the bottleneck queue much closer to the real data than the original model. The simulation results also indicated that the actual diversion rate under recurring congestion in the study network was very low. The results of the second case study demonstrated that the enhanced model can evaluate the network impact of new advanced technology in flooding situations and can evaluate the effect of market penetration of the communication technology.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12162008-001643/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond Human and Social Capital Punishment: The Stigma of Incarceration, Race, and Their Effect on Earnings through the Life Course</field><field name="creator">Bodkin, Mark R</field><field name="description">Incarceration is a stigmatizing event that is likely to lead to negative labor market outcomes. Prior research has linked incarceration to reduced earnings and slow wage growth, but little is known about individual differences that lead to divergent wage trajectories between formerly and never-incarcerated individuals. Moreover, race differences in these wage trajectories have yet to be fully explored. I employ a multilevel modeling technique (MLM) to examine hourly wage trajectories across the careers of incarcerated and non-incarcerated males using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). I find that incarceration leads to a significant reduction in wages that is not explained by individual differences in human or social capital. This suggests that incarceration is a stigmatizing event with long-term labor market consequences. I do not find any evidence for a significant interaction between race and previous incarceration; however, additively, I find that formerly incarcerated white individuals earn as much as never-incarcerated African Americans through their late 40s.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12162008-112539/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology and Control of Maryland Meadowbeauty (Rhexia mariana L.) in Blueberry (Vaccinium spp.) in North Carolina</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Meagan Marykatherine</field><field name="description">North Carolina is the fifth largest producer of blueberries (Vaccinium spp.) in the U.S. with approximately 5,000 acres harvested in 2006. A study was conducted to determine if a positive correlation exists between the weed populations in field drainage ditches and weed populations in the field interior, and to inventory the weed species present in the ditches and the field interiors. Sixty-six species were inventoried over a two year period. A second study was conducted to define the seed biology of Rhexia mariana L., an aggressive perennial weed in blueberry, by determining temperature effects on germination, average seed number per capsule, seed number in the seed bank, and seed dormancy. Maximum seed germination was observed at day/night temperatures of 20/35C. Seed germination ranged from 47 to 86% and dormancy ranged from 14 to 53%. The number of seed capsules produced per infested area was different among locations and ranged from 500 to 1125 capsules/m2. Across locations, seed capsules produced an average of 74 seeds each. On average, 27 R. mariana seeds were present in each 273cm2 sample of soil. A single m2 of R. mariana infestation has the potential to produced 12,375 seed capsules and 915,750 seeds. Of those seeds, roughly 604,395 would be viable, 519,779 could germinate as freshly mature seeds, and an additional 84,615 seeds would be dormant. An estimated 1000 R. mariana seeds could germinate from 1m2 of the soil seed bank. A third study was conducted to determine the efficacy of flumioxazin on R. mariana and the tolerance of blueberry to flumioxazin. The data indicate that flumioxazin does not injure blueberry when applied PRE. Flumioxazin applied PRE in a single or a sequential application does not have a negative effect on blueberry yield, even at rates that exceed the registered rate. Control of R. mariana with a single application of flumioxazin at the registered rate of 0.42 kg ai/ha ranged from 83 to 100% at 60 days after treatment (DAT). Sequential applications of flumioxazin at 0.21 kg ai/ha per application resulted in control greater than 96% 30 d after the last of two applications. The data indicates that flumioxazin applied PRE at the registered rate of 0.42 kg ai/ha in a single application or 0.21 kg ai/ha in a sequential application in a 12 month period would give effective control of R. mariana. A final study was conducted in which a grower survey was used to determine the current weed management practices employed by blueberry growers in North Carolina. A 41-question survey was mailed to 241 blueberry growers in February 2008. A total of 58 valid responses were returned and were entered into the data set. Respondents represent 24% of the survey population. Thirty-eight percent of the survey population grows a combination of rabbiteye and highbush blueberry types. The highbush variety &#226;Croatan&#226; was the most frequently planted variety in total hectacreage, and the rabbiteye variety &#226;Premier&#226; was the most common variety of that blueberry type. Growers use a combination of mechanical cultivation, hand removal, and herbicides to control weeds in blueberry. Greenbriar species (Smilax spp.) were reported as those species that are increasing in severity, are the hardest to manage, and that interfere most with harvest. Sethoxydim and hexazinone are the most common herbicides used in non-bearing and bearing blueberries, respectively. Growers indicated that their greatest concern in weed management is crop safety to herbicides. Results from all four studies will aid in the development of a comprehensive weed management plan to address the specific needs of North Carolina blueberry producers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12162008-124602/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sample-Data Modeling for Double Edge Current Programmed Mode Control in High Frequency and Wide Range DC-DC converters</field><field name="creator">Park, Jinseok</field><field name="description">This dissertation focuses on sample-data modeling for double edge current programmed mode control (DECPM) and its application to high frequency and wide range DC-DC converters.

Combined with their advantageous lightweight and high work output characteristics is a complex, highly non-linear and hysteretic material behavior, which is also thermo-mechanically coupled. Due to this complexity, model development for SMA material behavior is a challenging task, and experimental data in particular about the inner hysteresis loops is necessary to gain further understanding and successfully design applications. In this thesis, a single crystal material model is presented and subsequently extended to the more realistic polycrystalline case considering material inhomogeneities, grain impurities and lattice imperfections. A first implementation, based on a stochastic homogenization procedure, provides a very accurate description of the observed phenomena, but also requires very high computation times. A reformulation of the underlying concept leads to a parameterization method, which preserves the advantages of the original method, but dramatically reduces the computation times. It is shown that the material behavior prediction of both models are identical, and the parameterization method is compared extensively to data from tensile experiments with a pseudoelastic SMA wire. Remarkably, the model is able to capture all facets of the material behavior including rate-dependence and minor loops. The versatility of the model also allows for the simulation of SMA actuator behavior including the electrical resistance. Finally, a MEMS device using polycrystalline SMA thin film actuators is experimentally investigated. As a first step, the material behavior of the SMA thin films is presented using strain-temperature and resistance-temperature measurements. Secondly, the performance of the MEMS device was determined for different driving frequencies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12172004-221828/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance Analysis of System-on-Chip Applications of Three-dimensional Integrated Circuits</field><field name="creator">Schoenfliess, Kory Michael</field><field name="description">In the research community, three-dimensional integrated circuit (3DIC) technology has garnered attention for its potential use as a solution to the scaling gap between MOSFET device characteristics and interconnects. The purpose of this work is to examine the performance advantages offered by 3DICs. A 3D microprocessor-based test case has been designed using an automated 3DIC design flow developed by the researchers of North Carolina State University. The test case is based on an open architecture that is exemplary of future complex System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. Specialized partitioning and floorplanning procedures were integrated into the design flow to realize the performance gains of vertical interconnect structures called 3D vias. For the post-design characterization of the 3DIC, temperature dependent models that describe circuit performance over temperature variations were developed. Together with a thermal model of the 3DIC, the performance scaling with temperature was used to predict the degree of degradation of the delay and power dissipation of the 3D test case. Using realistic microprocessor workloads, it was shown that the temperatures of the 3DIC thermal model are convergent upon a final value. The increase in delay and power dissipation from the thermal analysis was found to be negligibly small when compared to the performance improvements of the 3DIC. Timing analysis of the 3D design and its 2D version revealed a critical path delay reduction of nearly 26.59% when opting for a 3D implementation.

The objectives of this research were to: 1) evaluate the historical roots, experimental validation and subsequent impact of the C saturation relationships proposed by Jan Hassink, 2) evaluate the effects of management and texture on aggregation and C fractions using soil from two long term experiments, 3) develop new methods of structural disruption and physical fractionation that address shortcomings in existing methods, 4) evaluate the impact of antecedent C on C and aggregate dynamics and 5) evaluate the simplified MnoxC method proposed by Weil et al. (2003). Collectively, the literature we reviewed did not support broad application of simple C saturation relationships such as those proposed by Hassink but did support selective use of fine mineral content as an indicator of C storage capacity. Results from two incubation experiments demonstrated the modulating effect of antecedent C on soil C and aggregate dynamics following structural disruption and residue addition. Positive effects of residue and structural disruption on aggregation were greatest in soil with low antecedent C. Residue decomposed more rapidly in soil with high antecedent C but had a greater priming effect in soil with low antecedent C. Addition of a 15N labeled nitrate source revealed that immobilization of nitrate-N within microaggregates is a minor process irrespective of structural disruption and antecedent C. Carbon contained in microaggregates within stable macroaggregates from an organic transition experiment was sensitive to C input regime but unrelated to fine mineral content. Strong tillage system effects on C fractions, aggregation and texture (tillage intensity&#8593; = &#8595;C, aggregate stability and sand content) were identified in soil from a long term tillage system study. Permanganate oxidizable C (Weil method) was found to be a sensitive indicator of management effects on soil C particularly after correction for non-linearity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12172007-065019/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Operational Evaluation of In-Use Emissions and Fuel Consumption of B20 Biodiesel versus Petroleum Diesel-Fueled Onroad Heavy-duty Diesel Dump Trucks and Nonroad Construction Vehicles</field><field name="creator">KIM, KANGWOOK</field><field name="description">Diesel vehicles contribute substantially to statewide emissions of NOx, an ozone precursor, and to particulate matter. North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) is conducting a pilot study to demonstrate the use of B20 biodiesel fuel on approximately 1,000 vehicles in selected areas of the state; there are plans to extend the use of B20 fuel to a much larger number of vehicles in all 100 counties in North Carolina. Real-world in-use onroad and nonroad emissions of selected heavy-duty diesel vehicles, including those fueled with B20 biodiesel and petroleum diesel, were measured during normal duty cycles using a portable emissions measurement system (PEMS). Each vehicle was tested for one day on B20 biodiesel and for one day on petroleum diesel, for a total of 68 days of field measurements. The vehicles were operated by drivers assigned by NCDOT. Each test was conducted over the course of an entire workshift, and there were approximately 2 to 10 duty cycles per shift. Each duty cycle is comprised of a uniquely weighted combination of operating modes based on vehicle speed, acceleration, and typical modes of activities. Average emission rates on a mass per time basis varied substantially among the operating modes. Average fuel use and emissions rates increased 26 to 35 percent when vehicles were loaded versus unloaded. The use of B20 instead of petroleum diesel lead to a slight decrease (approximately 2 to 10 percent depending on the vehicle) in NO emission rate and significant decreases (approximately 10 to 30 percent depending on the vehicle) for opacity, HC, and CO, respectively. These trends are similar to nonroad vehicles. Factors that were responsible for the observed variability in fuel use and emissions include: operating mode, vehicle size, engine tier and size, vehicle weight, and fuel. In particular, emission rates were also found to decrease significantly when comparing newer, higher tier vehicles to older ones. Recommendations were made regarding operating strategies to reduce emissions, choice of fuel, and the need for future work to collect real-world duty cycle data for other vehicle types.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12172007-092347/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Interaction of Moisture Fluxes and Orographic Precipitation over Northern California Associated with a Landfalling Atmospheric River.</field><field name="creator">Smith, Barrett Lee II</field><field name="description">Atmospheric rivers emanating from the tropics are responsible for the majority of the meridional transport of water vapor in the Northern Hemisphere, and have also been linked to episodes of heavy orographic precipitation along the mountains of the U.S West Coast. As moist air flow impinges on mountain ranges, orographic lifting converts water vapor to precipitation and can greatly reduce the moisture content of the airmass. The nearly along-coast parallel orientation of the Coastal and Sierra Nevada Ranges in Northern California, and the proximity of the Petaluma Gap to the south along the coast yield a geography, where moisture may enter the Sacramento Valley from multiple locations, complicating the quantification of airmass transformation over the region. Limitations of surface and satellite observing networks further complicate these calculations. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) Version 2.2 is used to investigate the moisture flux and three-dimensional airmass transformation over northern California associated with the 29-31 December 2005 atmospheric river. Moisture flux analysis of the storm reveals that moisture enters the Sacramento Valley by both flowing over and around the Coastal Range. A large portion of the flow-over moisture is converted to precipitation along the windward slopes. Flow-around moisture enters through the Petaluma Gap, and then a significant portion is deflected northward by the strong barrier jet associated with the Sierra Nevada range. Moisture convergence and orographic lifting enhance precipitation along the slopes of the Sierra Nevada and Siskiyou Ranges. A drying ratio, or moisture reduction, of nearly 55% is found for the entire mountain complex, with 30% and 25% for the Coastal and Sierra Nevada Ranges, respectively. In a model sensitivity test where the Coastal Range is removed, the amount of moisture reaching the Sierras is only slightly increased compared to when the Coastal Range is present. When all terrain is removed, there is little reduction of moisture flux by the ocean/coast boundary, and the atmospheric river is able to penetrate deep into the western U.S.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12172007-184508/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of Body Biasing and Supply Voltage Scaling Techniques for Leakage Reduction and Performance Improvements of CMOS Circuits</field><field name="creator">Devasthali, Vinayak Sudhakar</field><field name="description">The efficiency of body biasing technique is evaluated in 90-nm process technology for regular and low threshold voltage devices. A new leakage monitor circuit for detecting an optimum reverse body bias voltage is designed. The simulation results shows that the monitor circuit accurately tracks the leakage currents within +/-5% of the actual leakage current values. The standby leakage reduction in static CMOS circuits using reverse body biasing is presented. The results indicate that the reverse body biasing is more beneficial for high speed circuits using low threshold voltage devices. For circuits using nominal threshold voltage devices, the efficiency of reverse body biasing decreases due to the presence of gate leakage. Speed improvement in ring oscillator and ripple carry adder using forward body bias is measured. The results show that the forward body biasing is less effective due to the lower body effect parameter. Supply voltage scaling technique for active power reduction is implemented using 180-nm technology. Power savings up to 50% is achieved by scaling the supply voltage as per the operating frequency requirements.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12172007-225105/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Comparison of Fuzzy Logic Spatial Relationship Methods for Human Robot Interaction</field><field name="creator">Ward, James L.</field><field name="description">As the science of robotics advances, robots are interacting with people more frequently. Robots are appearing in our houses and places of work acting as assistants in many capacities. One aspect of this interaction is determining spatial relationships between objects. People and robots simply can not communicate effectively without references to the physical world and how those objects relate to each other. In this research fuzzy logic is used to help determine the spatial relationships between objects as fuzzy logic lends itself to the inherent imprecision of spatial relationships. Objects are rarely absolutely in front of or to the right of another, especially when dealing with multiple objects. This research compares three methods of fuzzy logic, the angle aggregation method, the centroid method and the histogram of angles &#226; composition method. First we use a robot to gather real world data on the geometries between objects, and then we adapt the fuzzy logic techniques for the geometry between objects from the robot's perspective which is then used on the generated robot data. Last we perform an in depth analysis comparing the three techniques with the human survey data to determine which may predict spatial relationships most accurately under these conditions as a human would. Previous research mainly focused on determining spatial relationships from an allocentric, or bird's eye view, where here we apply some of the same techniques to determine spatial relationships from an egocentric, or observer's point of view.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12172008-125840/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Claudin-5 on Xenopus Heart Development</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Bo</field><field name="description">Claudin-5 is an important member of the claudin gene family.

The method can be used by utilities during T&amp;O episodes to quickly and reliably detect T&amp;O compounds and determine their concentrations. Knowledge about the identity and concentration of T&amp;O compounds will greatly aid utilities in the selection of appropriate treatment strategies. Head space solid phase microextraction (SPME) was used to concentrate T&amp;O compounds, and gas chromatography (GC) followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was used to separate, detect, and quantify the T&amp;O compounds. Method development included (1) determination of parent ion mass and retention time, (2) optimization of the ion trap MS/MS instrumental parameters, (3) development of calibration curves, and (4) determination of the method detection limits (MDLs) and limits of quantitation (LOQs) for each compound. For 12 of the 17 targeted T&amp;O compounds with known odor threshold concentrations (OTCs), LOQs were below the OTC. This result suggests that the developed method is capable of detecting developing T&amp;O problems for these 12 compounds and allow utilities to implement treatment strategies before consumers can detect objectionable tastes and odors in their water. The developed method was tested by analyzing three water samples from North Carolina ponds and lakes that experienced algae/cyanobacteria blooms. In addition, Raleigh source and tap water samples were analyzed. Of the 19 targeted T&amp;O compounds, all but 2,4,6 tribromoanisole were detected in the collected samples. In the bloom samples, geosmin, &#206;&#178;-ionone, and trans-2,cis-6-nonadienal most frequently occurred at concentrations that exceeded their OTCs, sometimes by a factor of &gt;100. A comparison of results for non-filtered and filtered (0.45 &#194;&#181;m membrane) samples suggests that many T&amp;O compounds were predominantly present inside algae/cyanobacteria cells. Only geosmin and &#206;&#178;-cyclocitral were present at measurable levels in Raleigh source and tap water. Concentrations in the raw and tap water samples were similar and at levels that were at or below the OTCs of geosmin and &#206;&#178;-cyclocitral.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12172009-085741/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinants of the Allocation of the Conservation Reserve Program and Landowners' Enrollment Decisions</field><field name="creator">Jacobs, Keri Lee</field><field name="description">Paying landowners to undertake and invest in long term conservation on agricultural land in lieu of production is a strategy that has been employed in the United States on a large scale since 1986, via the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). The literature has identified that this policy, its implementation, and the incentives it creates have resulted in excess rents to landowners, increased program outlays, and an inefficient targeting of environmental benefits. An explanation for these that remains largely unexplored in the current literature is that the program operates within and is affected by the political market: political forces which aim to affect the allocation of program benefits are redistributive in nature. Using CRP enrollment data, the program is analyzed by panel estimation to identify whether and to what extent state level membership on Congressional committees with program jurisdiction have resulted in distributional effects on the allocation of program acreage (enrollments) and payments. Understanding the role of the political economy in the CRP enhances the current literature by identifying and characterizing one potential determinant of the program&#226;s enrollment outcomes. Committee membership does appear to matter to the allocation of state level CRP payments and acres though the relationship between the membership measures used herein and enrollments has changed over time. Complementary to the political economy perspective in understanding the determinants of enrollment is that landowners then respond optimally to the incentives produced by the political and regulatory processes. The Environmental Benefits Index (EBI) is the ranking mechanism used to enroll land into the CRP and the index provides a higher probability of acceptance for landowners in certain priority regions. An expected return maximization theory describing landowners&#226; offer decision is presented and, using contract-level CRP offer data, estimations are conducted to identify the effect of priority area designations on the rental rates offered by landowners in the Prairie Pothole National Conservation Priority Area. Priority area designations are exogenous to the landowner and conventional thought regarding the program&#226;s offer process is that a landowner will increase his rental rate to extract rent if his probability of enrollment becomes exogenously greater. However, contrary to popular thought, the theoretical and empirical results reveal that landowners who receive exogenously-based EBI points may reduce their rental rates to maximize their expected return to enrolling. This provides supporting evidence that the CRP&#226;s enrollment process induces behavior that may reveal landowners&#226; opportunity cost of enrollment and that landowners respond to enrollment incentives in a manner consistent with a maximization of the expected returns to enrollment. The ability examine offer behavior across many signup periods is an important extension of the current literature, which generally relies on enrollment outcomes to reveal information about offer behavior. While not novel, the expected return maximization theory contributes to the current literature by allowing a rent-reducing response to higher EBI points. This approach and the findings have potentially important implications for the CRP&#226;s future implementation and program cost-benefit analyses.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12172009-155131/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PERFORMANCE OF DICLOSULAM IN CONVENTIONAL AND STRIP-TILLAGE PEANUT; PHYSIOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR OF FLUMIOXAZIN IN COTTON, PEANUT, AND SELECTED WEEDS; PERFORMANCE OF FLUMIOXAZIN IN COTTON; AND MORNINGGLORY RESPONSE TO NEIGHBORING PLANTS AND STRUCTURE.</field><field name="creator">Price, Andrew Jennings</field><field name="description">Research evaluated new herbicides to improve weed management in conventional and minimum-tillage production in cotton and peanut, herbicide physiology in cotton, peanut, and selected weeds, and morningglory response to neighboring plants and objects.

The selective Si&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; source/drain technology was proposed in this laboratory as an alternative to conventional junction and contact schemes. The technology is based on selective chemical vapor deposition of in-situ boron or phosphorus doped Si&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; in source/drain areas. The fact that the dopant atoms occupy substitutional sites during growth make the high temperature activation anneals unnecessary virtually eliminating dopant diffusion to yield abrupt doping profiles. Furthermore, the smaller band gap of Si&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; results in a smaller Schottky barrier height, which can translate into significant reductions in contact resistivity due to the exponential dependence of contact resistivity on barrier height. This study is focused on formation of self-aligned germanosilicide contacts to phosphorous-doped Si&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; alloys. The experimental results obtained in this study indicate that self-aligned nickel germanosilicide (NiSi&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) contacts can be formed on Si&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; layers at temperatures as low as 350&#162;XC. Contacts can yield a contact resistivity of 1E-8 ohm-cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with no sign of germanosilicide induced leakage. However, above a threshold temperature determined by the Ge concentration in the alloy, the NiSi&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/Si&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; interface begins to roughen, which affects the junction leakage.

In this light, an efficient and light weight multicast routing protocol is necessary. Presently the multicast routing is either done entirely at the network layer, or at the application layer as stateless overlay mulitcasting. Owing to the dynamic nature of ad hoc networks, the first method incurs a large signaling overhead due to frequent modification of routing tables and exchanging of session state information. The latter approach uses the underlying unicast routing to build multicast data distribution trees without maintaining session state information thereby trading efficiency for minimal messaging overhead. For small groups with constant bound on the number of multicast group members, the overlay schemes, apart from having a trivial signaling overhead, are also known to be far more efficient than the network layer schemes. But the existing overlay schemes do not completely exploit the `knowledge' possessed by the network layer; they just use the unicast routing at the network layer. We believe that, even for larger groups, the overlay schemes can function with reasonable efficiency along with trivial signaling overhead if they intelligently use the network layer information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this thesis, we propose a network assisted multicast routing scheme, NAMO NAMAHA, which primarily operates as an overlay while getting assistance from the network layer unicast routing protocol, CEDAR. The overlay algorithms dynamically build an approximate Steiner data distribution tree, adopting the (CHINS)_T (Cheapest Insertion Heuristic with Table) algorithm for the distributed implementation of the well known Takahashi-Matsuyama heuristic. The Steiner trees are incrementally built over a subgraph of core nodes, which form the approximate Minimum Dominating Set (MDS) over the network nodes. The core nodes get computed by a network layer heuristic using local data at that layer, and they provide useful information for the NAMO NAMAHA tree computation algorithms at the overlay layer. The main idea in this thesis is that if the construction of overlays is aided by some minimal but useful information from the network layer that is almost invariant, local and that which would incur constant memory overhead, efficient overlays can be constructed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This thesis presents the algorithms for the protocol NAMO NAMAHA, offers proof of correctness for the protocol and shows that the time and memory complexity of the algorithms in the protocol are either constant, or linear with the number of graph edges or nodes. We compare our work with the MCEDAR protocol in terms of the cost of the multicast data distribution trees, the number of messages exchanged in building them and the time and memory complexity of the algorithms involved. We choose MCEDAR since other multicast protocols for ad hoc networks are either network based which does not scale for large nubmer of nodes, or function as overlays designed only for small groups. When compared to MCEDAR, NAMO NAMAHA has a simpler join protocol implemented by our unique Unicast Trap algorithm that does not make use of acknowledgements. Unlike MCEDAR, the sender discovery messages are not propagated all over the network; they are restricted to regions where it is absolutely necessary. In NAMO NAMAHA, at any given time, a path exists between any multicast subscriber and the sender (which is approximately the best path possible) with very high probability. Such a guarantee cannot be given in MCEDAR. Furthermore because of the incremental Steiner tree construction, the resulting multicast data distribution tree has nearly the least total cost. Cost is not minimized in MCEDAR. These advantages are obtained in NAMO NAMAHA just by using extra messages during tree construction, whose number is well below the actual number of nodes in the multicast group. The time and memory complexity of the NAMO NAMAHA algorithms are in the same order as that in MCEDAR.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12182003-190413/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of diffraction enhanced imaging to bone</field><field name="creator">Connor, Dean Michael Jr.</field><field name="description">Diffraction enhanced imaging (DEI) is a new x-ray-based medical imaging modality that is in its early stages of development and testing. In images generated using DEI, contrast is from absorption and refraction of x-rays and from ultra-small angle x-ray scattering (USAXS). Though accepted values for x-ray absorption in biological tissues have been established, only recently have investigators began probing for characteristic refraction and USAXS from biological tissues. For this work, a series of four experiments were performed at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Upton, NY, USA) beamline X15A to help characterize DEI of bone. In the first experiment, the USAXS profile was measured for pre- and post-fatigue loaded cortical bone. Though no clear pattern of change in the USAXS profile was found, the bone samples were shown to have a measurable USAXS signal and it was found that large refracting structures within bone (&gt;100 microns) could be visualized. In the next two experiments, the contrast of DEI?s refraction and apparent absorption images was compared to the contrast in synchrotron radiation (SR) radiographs for planar imaging of gap regions in bone and for imaging of trabecular structure in tomography mode. DEI was shown to have significant contrast-to-noise ratio gains over SR radiographs in both experiments. The planar refraction and apparent absorption signals in the gap imaging experiment were shown to be consistent with their theoretically predicted values. DEI in tomography mode (DECT) was found to have significant resolution gains over comparably obtained SRCT images. In the final experiment, a computer model was developed to predict USAXS from cortical bone and the computer model results were compared to USAXS data obtained using DEI. The scattering widths, as predicted by the computer model, suggest that osteocyte lacunae cause the experimentally measured angular spreading of the x-ray beam. The findings of these experiments provide the impetus for further studies of bone with DEI emphasizing clinical applications.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12182005-160008/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SOCIAL PROMOTION OR RETENTION?

North Carolina?s current methodology for regulatory erosion rate calculation does not take advantage of emerging GIS, photogrammetric, and engineering technologies. Traditionally, historical shoreline positions from a database created in the 1970s have been coupled with a modern shoreline position to calculate erosion rates. The photos from which these historical shorelines come were subject to errors of tilt, variable scale, lens distortion, and relief displacement. Most of these errors could be removed using modern photogrammetric methods. In this study, an effort was made to acquire and rectify, using digital image processing, prints of the original historical photography for Bodie Island, North Carolina. The photography was rectified using the latest available desktop photogrammetry technology. Digitized shorelines were then compared to shorelines of similar date created without the benefit of this modern technology. Uncertainty associated with shoreline positions was documented throughout the process. It was found that the newly created shorelines were significantly different than their counterparts created with analog means. Many factors caused this difference, including: choice of basemaps, number of tie points between photos, quality of ground control points, method of photo correction, and shoreline delineation technique. Using both linear regression and the endpoint method, a number of erosion rates were calculated with the available shorelines. Despite the differences in position of shorelines of the same date, some of the calculated erosion rates were not significantly different. Specifically, the rate found using all available shorelines prior to this study was very similar to the rate found using all shorelines created in this study. As a result of this and other factors, it was concluded that a complete reproduction of North Carolina?s historical shoreline database may not be warranted. The new rectification procedure does have obvious value, and should be utilized in those locations where there is no existing historical data, or where existing data is thought to be of poor quality. This would especially be the case near inlets or other historically unpopulated areas.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12192002-155357/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defect Identification in GRID-LOCK&#174; Joints</field><field name="creator">Pandurangan, Pradeep</field><field name="description">Bonded metallic GRID-LOCK&#174; structures are being adopted for a variety of aerospace applications due to their structural efficiency and damage tolerance. The development of non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods is necessary to identify bond defects that can lead to failures in these structures. However, this task is complicated by the lack of interior access and complex geometry of GRID-LOCK&#174; components. In this dissertation, the feasibility of various NDE techniques for detecting the existence, location, and extent of bond defects in GRID-LOCK&#174; joints is investigated. Experiments are conducted on customized test structures to compare the effectiveness of optical NDE, ultrasonic C-scans and vibration-based damage detection. Finite element analysis (FEA) is used to interpret experimental results and highlight the advantages of candidate methods. The qualitative effectiveness of optical NDE is further investigated using full-field surface slope measurements (shearography). Because accurate characterization of structural defects is critical to flight safety, a quantitative non-destructive evaluation (QNDE) method using artificial neural networks (ANNs) is developed. This method involves the use of radial basis function networks (RBFNs) trained and validated using FEA simulation data. The effectiveness of this QNDE approach is demonstrated using experimental data from a custom-built optical scanning system.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12192006-181356/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Adoption of Gender Identity Inclusive Legislation in the American States</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Jami Kathleen</field><field name="description">This research addresses an issue little studied in the public administration and political science literature, public policy affecting the transgender community. Policy domains addressed in the first chapter include vital records laws, health care, marriage, education, hate crimes and employment discrimination. As of 2007, twelve states statutorily protect transgender people from employment discrimination while ten include transgender persons under hate crimes laws. An exploratory cross sectional approach using logistic regression found that public attitudes largely predict which states adopt hate crimes and/or employment discrimination laws. Also relevant are state court decisions and the percentage of Democrats within the legislature. Based on the logistic regression?s classification results, four states were selected for case study analysis: North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Massachusetts. The case studies found that legislators are often reluctant to support transgender issues due to the community?s small size and lack of resources. Additionally, transgender identity?s association with gay rights is both a blessing and curse. In conservative districts, particularly those with large Evangelical communities, there is strong resistance to LGBT rights. However, in more tolerant areas, the association with gay rights advocacy groups can foster transgender inclusion in statutes. Legislators perceive more leeway to support LGBT rights. However, gay activists sometimes remove transgender inclusion for political expediency. As such, the policy core of many LGBT interest groups is gay rights while transgender concerns are secondary items. In the policy domains studied, transgender rights are an extension of gay rights.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12192007-153304/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) in the Mid-Atlantic United States: A Sociological Analysis</field><field name="creator">Loughridge, Kenneth Brandon</field><field name="description">In response to the globalization of agriculture and the proliferation of convenience-based and processed foods, many Americans have joined community supported farms. Community supported agriculture (CSA) involves people paying a seasonal fee to a local farmer in return for weekly allotments of organically-grown produce. This research investigates the membership, stabilization, and success of selected CSAs in the mid-Atlantic United States. The analyses are based upon survey data from 204 members of five CSAs collected during the 2000 growing season. Interview data from each of the farmers and thirteen of the members supplement the survey data. The data are analyzed primarily with path analytic techniques in order to test hypotheses derived from a thorough search of the relevant literatures. Results show that the majority of the members of these CSAs are white, well educated, wealthy, and female. Although the respondents tend to be interested in environmental issues, alternative agriculture, and community issues, their relative level of interest does not affect their level of investment in the CSA. A higher level of member investment, however, does have a positive effect upon the organizational success of the farms in this study. Organizational success also is found to be negatively affected by the CSA's relative degree of organizational stability, a finding that contradicts some of the literature. The dissertation concludes with a discussion of the methodological, theoretical, and applied implications of these findings. These implications include the finding that while electronic survey techniques have certain advantages, one disadvantage discovered is that electronic return rates are much lower than the return rates for U.S. mail surveys. Additionally, the process of social movement organization growth and change, as developed by resource mobilization theorists, is found to be applicable to the maturation levels of the CSAs in this study. Finally, strategies are suggested by the findings that can be used by CSA practitioners to render their membership more socially diverse, including the implementation of subsidized shares and payment plans.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12202002-151616/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Construction and Testing of Implant Carrier Particles for Validation of Multiphase Aseptic Processes</field><field name="creator">Jasrotia, Aswini Kumar Singh</field><field name="description">Aseptic processing of low-acid foods containing large particles is an emerging technology. Most multiphase process validation methods employ simulated particles to contain residence time tags, thermo-sensitive implants and/or bio-loads for temperature detection, time-temperature integration, and bactericidal efficacy confirmation. Such particles need to have conservative (fast-moving and slow-heating) characteristics to compare them with real food particles for thermal treatment. This study was conducted to fabricate and test (by heat penetration studies) conservative simulated particles which serve as carriers for thermo-sensitive implants and bio-loads in the validation procedure required for aseptic processing of shelf stable low-acid multiphase foods. A custom developed CPD (Conservative Particle Design) software was used to determine the minimum wall thickness (~ 2 mm) and cavity dimensions of half inch cubic particles for validation of aseptic processing of foods containing half inch cubic potato, carrot and other vegetable pieces. These particles were fabricated from PP (polypropylene) and PMP (polymethylpentene) polymers and they exhibited conservative heat penetration characteristics when compared with various real food particles. Duplicate samples of simulated and real food particles were fitted with thermocouples and heated (&lt; 127 degree C) under pressurized (autoclave, 24 psi) conditions. The method developed in this study can be used for experimental validation of the safety of aseptic processing of multiphase foods and would reduce the cost and complexity of process documentation and filing with regulatory agencies and bring aseptic multiphase foods closer to commercial reality.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12202004-163904/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic Characterization of Genes Specific to &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; Epidemic-Associated Serotype 4b Strains</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Ying</field><field name="description">&lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;, a food-borne pathogen of humans and animals, can cause severe listeriosis with relatively high mortality. A cluster of closely related strains of &lt;i&gt;L. monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; (designated Epidemic Clone I) have been implicated in numerous outbreaks in Europe and North America, including the California outbreak of 1985. &lt;i&gt;L. monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; strains implicated in the 1998-1999 and the 2002 multistate outbreaks in the USA represent a unique epidemic-associated clonal group, designated Epidemic Clone II (ECII). Comparative genomic analyses across five genomes from different &lt;i&gt;L. monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; isolates and &lt;i&gt;Listeria&lt;/i&gt; species identified a genomic region (region-18) in serotype 4b strains that may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Region-18 is either absent or markedly divergent in ECII strains but conserved among other serotype 4b strains. Region-18 is flanked by a large gene encoding a putative cell-wall associated protein (&lt;i&gt;wap&lt;/i&gt;) on one side and a well-known virulence gene internalin A (&lt;i&gt;inlA&lt;/i&gt;) on the other side in serotype 4b strains. PCR primers and DNA probes derived from this ECII-specific region-18 can readily differentiate ECII strains from other serotype 4b strains. This facilitates the detection and monitoring of these strains belonging to ECII clonal group in foods, clinical samples, and the environment. Genetic characterization of &lt;i&gt;wap&lt;/i&gt; by the construction of deletion mutants suggested that the ECII &lt;i&gt;wap&lt;/i&gt; mutant but not the ECI &lt;i&gt;wap&lt;/i&gt; mutant may be involved in specific environmental adaptations such as surface adherence and possibly biofilm formation in ECII strains. Mutational and functional analyses showed that the deletion mutant of region-18 in ECII had an enhanced death rate during post-stationary incubation at 42&#8451;,suggesting that the ECII-specific region-18 may be implicated in post-stationary stress responses.Two c72.44-negative variants of epidemic-associated &lt;i&gt;L. monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; serotype 4b strains were isolated from laboratory cultures. Naturally occurring c74.22-negative variants that exist under laboratory conditions without any noticeable phenotypic differences from their original forms may complicate the analysis of phage sensitivity and pathogenic characteristics.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12202006-164934/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Telescope: A Multivariate Visualization Framework in Support of the Development of a Perceptual Visualization Hierarchy</field><field name="creator">Whitehorne, Andrew Ennis</field><field name="description">Scalability has become a major issue within the field of visualization as data gathering methodologies and display technologies diversify. To compensate for large data sets and display limitations, perceptual visualization techniques aim to optimize graphical data representations with human vision in mind. The following outlines the principles, motivations, and development behind the Telescope multivariate visualization framework. Telescope provides mechanisms for generating and manipulating visualizations in which the visual angle and display resolution of individual elements are of chief concern. This software utilizes ongoing research towards the development of comprehensive perceptual feature guidelines to provide a means of dynamically mapping several common visual features to a given data set. Specific element mappings may be disabled or enabled when the size or display resolution of the displayed data elements crosses a defined threshold. Visualization features of interest are: hue, density, direction, flicker, luminance, orientation, regularity, size, and velocity. The system also allows for the simulation of various viewing environments with concern to display size, resolution, viewing distance, and visual angle. Support is provided for the input of a common data format and the easy manipulation of system parameters by means of a rule system. The end result is a system which lays the foundation for the implementation of a comprehensive perceptual visualization hierarchy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12202007-122731/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematic study of film growth in short chain alkylsilanes including issues of phase segreagation and islanding</field><field name="creator">Guy, Laura</field><field name="description">The role of islanding and phase segregation in long and short chain alkylsilanes formed by self assembly is described.

Rehabilitation is often required due to loss of cross-section from corrosion and/or changes of the demand or use of a structure. Current techniques for strengthening steel structures have several drawbacks including requiring heavy equipment for installation, their fatigue performance, in addition to the need for ongoing maintenance due to continued corrosion attack. The current research program proposed the use of a new high modulus carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) for strengthening of steel structures. This program includes extensive research to select the resin for wet lay-up of carbon fiber sheets and the adhesives for bonding of pre-cured laminate strips. The bond behavior of FRP materials to steel structures is quite different from that of concrete structures. Preliminary test results showed the occurrence of very high bond stresses for most strengthening applications due to the amount of strengthening required for developing the material for steel structures and bridges.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12202008-112409/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Age, growth and reproduction of dolphin (&lt;I&gt;Coryphaena hippurus&lt;/I&gt;) caught off the coast of North Carolina.</field><field name="creator">Schwenke, Kara Laurice</field><field name="description">The common dolphin (&lt;I&gt;Coryphaena hippurus&lt;/I&gt;) supports economically important fisheries along the east coast of the United States. In recent years, landings of dolphin from the United States Atlantic have increased dramatically. For example, recreational landings in the US South Atlantic Bight have increased from 162,000 dolphin in the 1960s to over 1.3 million dolphin in recent years. The last age and growth study of North Carolina dolphin was conducted in the early 1960s. It is hypothesized that life history parameters may have changed due to increased exploitation. Age, growth and reproduction were studied on dolphin (n=802; size range=89 to 1451 mm FL) collected between May 2002 and May 2004 from commercial and recreational catches in North Carolina. Annual increments from scales (n=541) and daily increments from sagittal otoliths (n=126) were examined; estimated von Bertalanffy parameters were L&amp;#8734 = 1299 mm FL and k = 1.08 yr &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The maximum age observed was 3 years. No major change in length at age has occurred since the early 1960s. Daily growth increments for age-0 dolphin reduced much of the variability in length-at-age values for age-0 dolphin and provided an average growth rate of 3.78 mm/day in the first six months, which is extremely fast for a teleost fish. Growth of North Carolina dolphin is similar to that found in Florida and the Mediterranean, but differs from observed growth in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. Age at 50% maturity was around 4 months for female dolphin and 6 months for male dolphin. Monthly length-adjusted gonadal weights suggest that peak spawning occurs from April through July off North Carolina; back-calculated hatch dates from age-0 dolphin along with prior studies on the east coast of Florida suggest that dolphin spawning occurs year round with highest levels from January through June. This study provides an updated and improved (year-round sampling and otolith daily ages) age-length function for dolphin caught off the coast of North Carolina using both scale annuli and daily growth increments and provides some of the first comprehensive data on North Carolina dolphin reproduction. The life history of dolphin, including fast growth and early maturity, allows for high levels of exploitation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12212004-105009/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MANAGING LIFE AND WORK DEMANDS: THE IMPACT OF ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT ON WORK-FAMILY CONFLICT IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS</field><field name="creator">Dolcos, Sanda Monica</field><field name="description">Various workforce and societal changes have made the issue of work-family conflict relevant for employees and organizations alike. The increasing pressures for attracting and retaining talented employees have forced many public and private organizations to develop formal family friendly policies aimed at providing employees with resources to balance their work and family responsibilities. However, the effects of implementing such formal policies are not clearly established. These formal supports are often underutilized and, even when employees use them, they may not always have the intended consequences. It has been suggested that informal workplace characteristics, such as supervisor support and a supportive work-family culture, may be as important as, or even more important than, the simple provision of formal benefits. Prior research on family-friendly policies and cultures and their effects on employees? attitudes and behaviors is limited in that it has focused almost exclusively on the experiences of individuals employed in private sector organizations, with the effects on public sector employees being largely unknown. Thus, the aim of this dissertation was to address this gap by examining and comparing work-family relationships between employees working in the public and the private sectors of the economy. This study uses data from the Families and Work Institute?s 2002 National Study of the Changing Workforce, and employs institutional theory, ecological systems theory, role theory, and social exchange theory to investigate how formal support, informal support, and work characteristics may affect employees? work-family conflict, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions. The main objectives of this study were centered on practical concerns, as our investigation seeks to impact public sector?s ability to recruit, motivate, and retain qualified employees. On the whole, the findings of this study suggest both similarities and differences between public and private sector organizations with respect to the constructs measured. Contrary to our expectations and the institutional theory, there were no significant differences in the provision of formal supports between the two sectors. However, consistent with the institutional theory, the results confirmed that public sector employees enjoy higher levels of informal support and HR practices than their private sector counterparts. This study also supports the idea of social exchange between employees and their employers related to work-family issues. By revealing the key role played by the informal support in all three outcomes of interest for this study (i.e., work-family conflict, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions), our findings suggest the importance for organizations to assist their employees in maintaining good work and family relationships. Therefore, both public and private organizations seeking to help their employees manage work and family responsibilities will benefit from knowing employees? perceptions of formal support, informal support, and work characteristics, along with their specific impact on employees? work-family conflict, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12212006-093039/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EVALUATION OF THE PHOSPHORUS LOSS ASSESSMENT TOOL (PLAT) AND REVISED UNIVERSAL SOIL LOSS EQUATION (RUSLE) USING GEOSPATIAL INFORMATION</field><field name="creator">Yuan, Xu</field><field name="description">Excessive agricultural phosphorus (P) has been a major contributor to non-point source pollution. North Carolina developed the Phosphorus Loss Assessment Tool (PLAT) to evaluate the potential P loss from agricultural fields to waterbodies via four components. Our overall goal was to evaluate the potential of using spatial data to estimate P loss without physically visiting fields since many PLAT required parameters occur in spatial formats. The objective of the first study was to assess the possibility of spatial implementation of PLAT and to compare the effect of scale on the PLAT numerical results and the associated categorical rankings. Since an important input parameter, the average annual soil loss determined by the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation, is not directly available from field measurement, our objective in the second study was to assess the potential of obtaining RUSLE estimates, specifically the topography factor LS, through Digital Elevation Model data in a Geographic Information System environment. In the first study, two methods of whole field average (WFA) and grid average (GA) were used to compare the difference in modeling P loss at different scales. The same list of PLAT required parameters were prepared from soil test reports and spatial database at the coarse scale of whole agriculture field and the fine scale of 0.4-ha grid. Soil tolerance value was used to temporarily replace the soil loss data. In the second study, a widely used Arc Macro Language (AML) program for estimating RUSLE topographic factor LS was evaluated through two approaches of whole field (WF) and representative profile (RP) analysis on a North Carolina landscape. Watershed delineation technique was adopted to select the representative profiles based on the references of slope distributions and field subdivisions from NRCS water quality specialists. Results from the first study indicated that soluble and particulate P loss, which occupied 59.3% and 26.3% of the total P loss through WFA method, and 56.1% and 39.0% through GA method, were the major pathways. Leaching P loss from PLAT was negligible. Particulate P loss was sensitive to scale as verified by the 12.7% increase of proportion in total P loss. The difference of particulate P loss through two methods was significant (p &lt; 0.05), but no difference of soluble P loss and P source effect was found on a 95% confidence level. The overall P loss potential through two methods exhibited no significant difference due to the neutralization effect of individual pathways. Results from the second study showed that the AML program alone was not suitable for calculating RUSLE topographic factor on a North Carolina landscape because of the significant underestimation (~35% and ~20% through WF and RP approach, respectively). The concept of representative profile indeed improved the estimation accuracy (~15%), however, the linearity of the fitted line between field measured LS and GIS-aided LS estimate was not satisfactory. An adjustment factor was proposed rectifying the RUSLE-based AML program in order to approximate field measurements. This study demonstrated the potential of implementing PLAT model and the soil loss equation using spatial parameters derived from database instead of visiting the fields. The scale of modeling in estimating particulate P loss and RUSLE topographic factor LS was important and the adjustment factor was necessary to adapt the AML program application. The accuracy of model performance needed to be improved before claiming that GIS-aided PLAT modeling will provide a complete replacement for the field measurement.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12212006-120809/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Novel Approach for the Direct Simulation of Subgrid-Scale Physics in Fire Simulations</field><field name="creator">Balasubramanian, Sivaramakrishnan</field><field name="description">A Lagrangian framework for computing subgrid-scale combustion physics in Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of fire is formulated and validated.

The proposed ladder polymer can be synthesized through three steps; the synthesis of a poly-cyano monomer for polymerization, the synthesis of a poly-cyano precursor polymer, and a one step cascading cyclization of a poly-cyano polymer. First addressed is the rather specific palladium catalyzed coupling conditions needed for a single C-C bond forming reaction of highly electron deficient aryl cyanides. The optimization of this coupling reaction, as performed on small oligomers, illustrates that the choice of metal catalyst, supporting ligand, and most especially base have a large influence on the yield. Secondly, a new, highly selective synthetic route to a desired monomer is presented. Third, the precursor polymer is synthesized through the application of the aforementioned optimal conditions. It is observed, through an optimization study, that the highest yielding test couplings do not yield the highest molecular weight polymer. Finally, three cyclization routes, of which only one is a cascading cyclization, are discussed. Photo-physical properties of the isolated fused ring systems show that the larger fused ring oligomers have modest bandgaps and are potential candidates as semi-conducting materials.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12212009-134714/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quilted Graphs</field><field name="creator">Rakow, Matthew Allen</field><field name="description">Layered graphs find use in many applications today, including flow charts, business processes, and genealogical diagrams.

Quilted graphs draw on the strengths of matrix-style depictions already in use for unlayered graphs to reduce the impact of graph size on graph legibility.

Further examination has revealed that ring closure may also be affected via the use of N-acylpyridinium salt chemistry and progress toward this methodology will be described herein.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12222009-093300/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DNA Markers for Resistance to Post-Harvest Aflatoxin Accumulation in Arachis hypogaea L.</field><field name="creator">Rowe, Christina Ella Marie</field><field name="description">Aflatoxin contamination causes economic loss for the global peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) industry and raises human and animal health concerns. Peanut genotypes with resistance to aflatoxin accumulation should be an important part of an integrated aflatoxin management program. This study was conducted to identify AFLP markers tightly linked to genetic factors controlling reduced aflatoxin accumulation. A segregating F2 population was generated by crossing high-aflatoxin producing cultivar Gregory with low-aflatoxin producing interspecific tetraploid line GP-NC WS 2, phenotyped for aflatoxin accumulation using an in vitro assay, and screened with AFLP markers previously identified to be associated with reduced aflatoxin accumulation. An F-test was used to determine whether markers were associated with the trait, a genetic linkage map was generated, and interval mapping was used to identify regions of the genome that influence aflatoxin accumulation. Gregory produced significantly more aflatoxin than GP-NC WS 2, and the F2 population exhibited high-parent heterosis. Thirty-five of 38 AFLP markers used to screen the F2 population had segregation distortion favoring the A. hypogaea cultivar. Six markers were significantly associated with reduced aflatoxin accumulation at the 5% significance level. Thirty-three markers were included in a genetic linkage map covering 60 cM and a putative QTL was identified at map position 9 cM. Linked markers could be utilized in a marker-assisted selection program to identify individuals that support low levels of aflatoxin accumulation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12232008-101843/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coaxial Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Discharge for Treatment of Filaments and Yarns</field><field name="creator">Lee, Kyoung Ook</field><field name="description">Characteristics of non-thermal atmospheric-pressure plasma generated in a coaxial cylindrical Dielectric-Barrier Discharge (DBD) were investigated for application in treatment of polymer and 100% un-mercerized cotton yarns. The discharge characteristics were investigated by measuring the electrical parameters and utilization of developed plasma circuit models to obtain plasma electron temperature, number density and the electron-neutral collision frequency. The experiments were conducted in helium and oxygenated helium plasma in absence and presence of yarns. The discharge is capacitively-coupled and is induced by an audio-frequency, 4.5 kHz, oscillating voltage. The electrical voltage-current (V-I) characteristics optimized for plasma processing, by the oxygen and helium flow rate ratio, was found to be about 40sccm for oxygen flow. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) was used to determine the plasma composition and to evaluate plasma temperature and number density. The plasma electron number density decreased from 2.2 x 10^16 to 1.4 x 10^16 per cubic meter when oxygen flow rate was increased to 100sccm in a 10,000sccm helium flow, while the electron temperature increased from 0.15 to 0.4 eV for the same increase in oxygen flow rate. It was also found that the plasma experiences some streamers and that the streamer?s electron temperature has a wide range between 0.5 to 2 eV. The optimized oxygen flow rate for polymer yarn processing was found to be 40sccm in a 10,000sccm helium flow.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12242007-142129/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SYNTHESIS OF A FIBER-REACTIVE CHITOSAN DERIVATIVE AND ITS APPLICATION TO COTTON FABRIC AS AN ANTIMICROBIAL FINISH AND A DYEING-IMPROVING AGENT</field><field name="creator">LIM, SANG-HOON</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research has been to develop a textile finish based on chitosan that is a biopolymer. A fiber-reactive chitosan derivative was synthesized from chitosan with a low molecular weight and a high degree of deacetylation. The synthesis was composed of two steps. As a first step, a water-soluble chitosan derivative was prepared by introducing quaternary ammonium salt groups on the amino groups of chitosan. The derivative was further modified by introducing functional groups (acrylamidomethyl) on the primary alcohol groups of the chitosan backbone, which can form covalent bonds with cotton. The fiber-reactive chitosan derivative (NMA-HTCC) itself showed complete bacterial reduction against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli at the concentration of 10 ppm. The NMA-HTCC was applied to cotton fabrics by a pad-batch method in the presence of an alkaline catalyst. The 1% NMA-HTCC treated cotton showed 100% bacterial reduction against S. aureus. The fabric maintained over 99% of bacterial reduction even after 50 home launderings. The NMA-HTCC cotton was dyed with direct and reactive dyes without addition of salt. The color yield was higher than that of untreated cotton, which required a large amount salt for dyeing. The NMA-HTCC cotton showed better washfastness than untreated cotton, but the lightfastness was inferior to that of untreated cotton. The antimicrobial activity of the NMA-HTCC cotton was considerablely decreased after dyeing due to the blocking of the cationic groups of the NMA-HTCC by dye molecules.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiber and Polymer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12272002-162031/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NOVEL MANUFACTURING, SPINNING, AND CHARACTERIZATION OF POLYESTERS BASED ON 1,2-ETHANEDIOL AND 1,3-PROPANEDIOL</field><field name="creator">Pang, Kyeong</field><field name="description">Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT), poly(ethylene isophthalate) (PEI), and poly(trimethylene isophthalate) (PTI) were synthesized in a Parr reactor and melt-spun. Thermal and physical properties of the as-synthesized polymers and melt-spun fibers were determined. As-synthesized PEI and PTI were amorphous polymers and did not show any melting peaks by DSC analysis. All the polymers were thermally stable (TGA analysis). Amorphous films were made by a melt-press method with PET and PEI for determination of CO2 gas barrier properties. PEI, which has the meta-linkage of ester groups on the phenyl ring, had much lower CO2 gas permeability around one tenth that of PET, which has the para-linkage of ester groups on the phenyl ring. This is because in PET the phenyl rings are substituted in the para (1,4) positions, which allows for their facile flipping, effectively permitting gases to pass through. However, the meta-substituted phenyl rings in PEI do not permit such ring flipping, and thus PEI may be more suitable for barrier applications. The coalesced PEI was prepared from the inclusion compound of PEI with ?&#215;-cyclodextrin. The coalesced PEI may have retained partially highly extended and parallel chains from the narrow channels of the inclusion compound, resulting in better/tighter packing among the PEI chains and exhibited a higher glass-transition temperature. Cyclic oligoesters of PET, PTT, PEI, and PTI were prepared by cyclo-depolymerization of these polyesters. The cyclic oligoesters were mixtures of different sized cyclic oligomers. PET cyclic oligomers showed four melting peaks at 59, 122, 194, and 276 o C. The cyclic oligomers of PTT, PEI, and PTI showed single melting peaks at 241, 335o C and 147o C, respectively. The cyclic oligoesters could be converted to linear polyesters by ring-opening polymerization. PTT was also prepared by ring-opening polymerization of its cyclic dimer obtained as a by-product in the conventional manufacturing plant. Antimony, tin, and titanium catalysts were used with various concentrations. The highest molecular weight, 40,000 g/mol was obtained when 0.25 mol% of titanium(IV) butoxide was used.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiber and Polymer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12272004-133333/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of internal characteristics of municipal government agencies and environmental factors of municipalities on the scope and the quality of municipal e-government initiatives: Developing an integrated approach.</field><field name="creator">Pavlichev, Alexei</field><field name="description">The objective of the research has been to determine which internal characteristics of municipal government agencies and which environmental factors of the municipalities across the U.S. affect the quality and the scope of adoption of municipal electronic government (e-government) initiatives. To accomplish this objective, an integrated approach was developed. The approach combined theoretical methodologies of three frameworks applied to the public sector agencies: innovation theory, information and communication technology, and e-government. It was hypothesized that theoretical premises of these frameworks complement each other in their ability to explain municipal e-government initiatives and their combination would help to address the drawbacks that characterize the present research on municipal e-government. The dependent variable in the present research is municipal e-government score. The dependent variable measures the scope and quality of municipal e-government initiatives. The research concentrates on two sets of predictor variables: internal municipal government agency characteristics and external environmental factors of municipalities. Correlation/regression analyses were performed to explore bivariate and multivariate relationships between the dependent and predictor variables and to accomplish the following goals: (1) describe the relationship between the dependent variable and the two sets of predictors (internal municipal agency characteristics and external environmental factors); (2) determine the effects of individual predictors in explaining the rate and the scope of adoption of e-government initiatives; and (3) compare the two sets of predictors in their power to explain the rate and the scope of adoption of e-government initiatives. The results of these analyses demonstrated that external environmental factors are significantly better predictors of the quality and the scope of local e-government initiatives, as measured by the e-government score, both individually and as a set.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12282004-095954/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary Algorithms to Aid Watershed Management</field><field name="creator">Dorn, Jason Liam</field><field name="description">Watershed management is a complex process involving multiple uses, diverse stakeholders, and a variety of computer-based hydrologic and hydraulic simulation models. Exploring for efficient solutions and making decisions about the best integrated management strategies to implement can be improved through the use of quantitative systems analytic techniques. In addition to identifying mathematically optimal solutions, these techniques should also be able to consider issues that may not be properly represented in the models or may be in conflict with one another. As the complexities of the system models grow, contemporary heuristic search methods, including evolutionary algorithms (EAs), are becoming increasingly common in quantitative analysis of such challenging decision-making problems. More research is needed to enhance and extend the capabilities of these newer search methods to meet the growing challenges. Further, these new systems analytic capabilities are best made accessible to practitioners through a generic computational framework that integrates the system simulation models with the suite of search techniques. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to develop new EA-based system analytic methods for addressing integrated watershed management problems and a computational framework within which their capabilities are enabled for watershed management applications. EA-based methods to generate good alternative solutions and for multiobjective optimization have been developed and tested, and their performances compare well with those of other procedures. These new methods were also demonstrated through successful applications to realistic problems in watershed management. These techniques were integrated into and implemented within a new computer-based decision support framework that supports the integration of the user?s preferred watershed models, methods to perform uncertainty and/or sensitivity analyses thereon, and multiple state-of-the-art optimization heuristic search procedures to identify good management strategies that meet the problem-specific (e.g., fiscal or environmental) objectives and constraints. The design of the software framework is described with a demonstration of its capabilities via a case study involving several scenarios of a watershed management problem.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12282004-235442/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Coping with Unemployment: Self-Concept Repair by Displaced Managers and Professionals"</field><field name="creator">Garrett-Peters, Raymond</field><field name="description">Research on unemployment among managers and professionals has documented the experience of job loss as stressful not only because of economic strain, but because of the damage it does to valued identities and self-conceptions. Little research, however, has examined the processes through which displaced workers collectively attempt to repair this damage. Data from participant observation in four support groups for displaced managers and professionals, plus intensive interviews with twenty-two group members, are used to develop an analysis of the self-concept repair strategies used by these relatively privileged workers. Four main strategies are identified: (a) redefining the meaning of unemployment; (b) realizing accomplishment; (c) restructuring time and activities; and (d) helping others. These strategies are argued to be oriented toward bolstering feelings of self-efficacy damaged by job loss and prolonged unemployment. The analysis shows how these self-concept repair strategies depended upon resources not readily available to blue-collar workers. Also considered are the implications of these strategies for the reproduction of class advantage and for the political mobilization of professional/managerial workers in response to recession and mass unemployment.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12282005-041437/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alternaria alternata mannitol metabolism in plant-pathogen interactions</field><field name="creator">V&#233;lez, Heriberto</field><field name="description">Mannitol is purported to have role in fungi as a storage carbohydrate and has been shown to quench reactive oxygen species (ROS) both in vitro and in vivo. Mannitol metabolism in fungi is thought to occur through the mannitol cycle, which was proposed in the late 1970?s from studies of cell free extracts of the fungus Alternaria alternata. In this cycle, mannitol 1-phosphate 5-dehydrogenase (MPDH; EC 1.1.1.17) reduces fructose 6-phosphate into mannitol 1-phosphate, which is dephosphorylated by a mannitol 1-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.22) resulting in mannitol and inorganic phosphate. Mannitol also can be made through the enzyme mannitol dehydrogenase (MtDH; EC 1.1.1.138), which reduces fructose to mannitol. Here we report confirmation of these enzymes in the fungus A. alternata, the isolation of the genes, and the generation of strains mutated in MPDH, MtDH, or both genes. PCR confirmed gene replacement and enzyme assays using these mutants showed no activity for MtDH or MPDH. GC-MS analysis showed that double mutants did not produce mannitol, while single mutants had reduced mannitol production. Mannitol, as a quencher of ROS, may also have a role in host-pathogen interactions, by allowing the fungus to suppress ROS-mediated plant defense responses. To assess the contribution of mannitol in plant-pathogen interactions, wild type, single and double mutants were used in pathogenicity assays on tobacco plants. Severity of lesions caused by the MtDH disruptant was not significantly different from that of the wild type. By contrast, the MPDH disruptant and the double mutant caused significantly less disease. Microscopy analysis and histochemical staining for H2O2 showed that both the wild type strain and the double mutant were able to germinate, produced appressoria, and elicited a defense response from the host. Quantitative PCR studies showed that genes for both enzymes were upregulated in the presence of tobacco extracts, with MPDH having a stronger response. We conclude that mannitol biosynthesis is required for pathogenesis of A. alternata on tobacco, but is not required for normal spore germination either in vitro or in planta or for initial infection.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12282005-171313/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Counting Down To Change: Identifying Early Adopters and Effective Extension Multipliers of Cashew Agroforestry in Senegal</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Nevin Scott</field><field name="description">Soil degradation, persistent drought, and a continuous decline in peanut market prices combine to put Senegalese farmers in a difficult position. To avoid a complete system collapse, many have called for a paradigm shift from production to resource conservation and regeneration with the participation of rural populations (Advisory Committee on the Sahel et al., 1986; Cook, 1989; Rodale Institute, 1989; Chemonics International Inc., 2000; Franzel and Scherr, 2002). Cashew (Anacardium occidentale) alley-cropping represents an ideal opportunity for restoring soils while maintaining productivity, but farmers take time to adopt such new technologies. Some farmers are naturally more receptive to these new ideas than others (?early adopters?), and some farmers are more likely to encourage others to try new ideas (?effective advisors?). This thesis defines and identifies observable characteristics of these two types of farmers, arguing that they are the best extension multipliers and therefore good points of contact for extension agents to effect quick diffusion of the innovation through the village. This thesis contributes to the literature first, by considering time of adoption using quantitative methods that have typically been applied only to the decision whether or not to adopt at a particular point in time, and second, by incorporating into the model spatial and social relationships that are often ignored in adoption literature. The study was conducted in two small farming villages in the Sine-Saloum region of Senegal?Mamouda and Simong. I lived with a family in Simong for nine months and learned about the local culture and environment (June 2003-February 2004), and returned for three months of interviews and spatial data collection (February-April 2005). Qualitative and spatial data were analyzed, and quantitative data were used to estimate survival and probit regression models for time until cashew adoption, and OLS models for advisor effectiveness in cashew promotion. It was found that an effective extension multiplier will have assets and land with which to absorb any possible costs of failure, will have fields that are highly visible and centrally located in an area appropriate for cashew production, will be in the elder age class (more than 60 years old), and will be socially well-placed as an advisor to many and an advisee to none. Understanding the characteristics of early adopters and effective advisors will allow extension agents to quickly identify the few farmers who are most likely to adopt on the advice of an outsider and without the prior sanction of their peers, and who will then demonstrate and extend the innovation with little outside assistance. Focusing efforts on these key players should increase the effectiveness of the agent?s time spent in the village, and after a successful training and trial, the new technology should then spread with little further intervention through farmer to farmer contacts (Advisory Committee on the Sahel et al., 1986; Bunch, 1982; Rodale Institute, 1989). This should result in a quicker and more effective impact of extension on the welfare of these poor farming communities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12292005-193348/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RELIGIOUS TURMOIL: THE CONFLICT BETWEEN BUDDHISM AND CATHOLICISM IN JACK KEROUAC?S LIFE AND WRITING</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Emily Patricia</field><field name="description">Although Jack Kerouac has begun to be recognized as one of the great 20th century American writers, scholars have not yet fully explored the influence that his conflicting religious beliefs had on his work. Kerouac?s internal struggle to reconcile his Buddhist and Catholic thinking, and his ultimate attempt to embrace Catholicism, had a profound effect on his writing, giving it the religiously tumultuous charge that is essential to Kerouac?s distinctive writing style. This study addresses Kerouac?s religious life and its effect on his work by focusing primarily on three of his works: Visions of Gerard, The Dharma Bums, and Big Sur. Kerouac?s complex relationship between Buddhism and Catholicism and the effect this conflict had on his work has heretofore gone largely uninvestigated. However, it is essential to a complete understanding of his work. Exploring this element of his work sheds new light on Kerouac?s novels that illuminates his depth and solemnity as a writer. Kerouac?s religious quest was a cornerstone of his artistic development, and the three novels I have examined illustrate how Catholicism and Buddhism together informed that quest.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12302002-120607/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sexuality and Coming of Age in Two Works by George MacDonald</field><field name="creator">Ware, Stephanie Lynne</field><field name="description">This study attempts to follow George MacDonald as he engages in the strange juggling act by which he simultaneously idealizes women and releases them from the grasp of idolizing males, proclaims their purity and concerns himself with their healthy maturation into sexuality. A comparison of Phantastes and Adela Cathcart reveals the complicating role of sexuality in the coming of age process of both males and females. The male protagonist of the fantasy work Phantastes is asked to learn to control his sexuality and to abandon selfishness in love, and he does so in part by understanding that women, too, have sexual natures. In Phantastes, however, MacDonald hesitates between idealizing, and thus desexualizing, women and accepting sexuality as part of women?s nature, as Anodos?s continuing celibacy upon his return from Fairy Land illustrates. The realistic setting of Adela Cathcart compels MacDonald to address women?s sexuality. The novel demonstrates that a woman can fulfill her traditional angelic role even while confronting the demands of her sexuality. Women are fallen angels who must be taught how to live in their fallen bodies without compromising their angelic calling. In order to become the ?angel in the house,? the moral center of the home, individual women must undergo a coming of age process similar to that of the males who struggle so much with handling their sexuality. To mature successfully, and to stave off the selfishness that is threatening to manifest itself in her, Adela, like Anodos, embarks on a journey through fantasy, though she will be borne there through the imagination and words of others. Taken together, these two works by MacDonald manifest both the importance of the image of women?s natural innocence in the nineteenth century and a growing awareness of the inadequacy of that image.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12302002-232256/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of hormones in wound-stress response in Arabidopsis thaliana</field><field name="creator">David, Lisa Illene</field><field name="description">Wounding stress is a continuous threat to the survival of all organisms, and, in crop plants it leads to a dramatic reduction in crop yield. The signaling pathways that allow plants to respond to wounding stress are known to be complex. Many plant hormones such as jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), and ethylene have been identified as critical factors for the induction of wound-responsive genes in a number of plant species. However, the specific roles of each hormone in vivo, and how different hormones interact in the wound-stress response are largely unknown. Elucidation of the specific interactions of these plant hormones in response to wound stress is a major focus of wound research. The major goal of this research is to utilize Arabidopsis JA, SA, and ethylene biosynthetic and signaling mutants to analyze the role of each hormone separately and together in wound-responsive gene induction. Arabidopsis wild type, ein2, npr1, jar1, npr1/ein2, and npr1/jar1 plants were wounded and sampled at different times, after which RNA was extracted, subjected to electophoresis, transferred to filters and probed for several putative wound-regulated transcripts, which included PDF1.2, PR1, WAK1, and, LOX2. The constitutive levels of transcript expression as well as patterns of accumulation of these transcripts in response to the wounding stimulus varied in the different mutants.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12302003-172335/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Design, Analysis, Construction and Testing of an Uninhabited Aero Vehicle Platform</field><field name="creator">Burgun, Robert Scott</field><field name="description">An uninhabited aero vehicle platform design is presented.

These differences have a significant impact on individuals? quality of life. Research on educational achievement gaps has been largely focused on schools or families; while policy efforts to address these gaps have been focused on schools, with limited success. This study examines the broader community context in which schools and families are embedded. Specifically, this study addressed the policy question: Is relative inequality in employment opportunity in local areas related to relative inequality in educational achievement in the same areas in North Carolina? Employment opportunity was conceptualized as quality of employment and as earnings. Relative inequality was measured by comparing a race (Black or White), class (high school education or less vs. education beyond high school), and gender group to White males with parental education beyond high school. Relative inequality in Biology and English I achievement were measured at the school level and at a modified Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) level. Relative inequality in quality of employment and earnings were measured at the modified PUMA level, and measured separately for the local area and neighboring area. This study was unique in that it a) examined the variation in employment opportunity across communities and b) examined race, class, and gender inequality as simultaneously experienced rather than as separate inequalities. Relative inequality in local earnings had a positive relationship with relative inequality in high school Biology for most Black and White student groups. Relative inequality in local earnings had a positive relationship with relative inequality in English I for Black students. There was little support for the hypothesis that relative inequality in the local quality of employment had an effect on relative inequality in achievement. There was also little support for the effect of neighboring community employment factors on inequality in achievement. This study found reason to support policies that would reduce relative inequality in earnings in local areas as a means to reducing educational achievement gaps.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-12312002-131419/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermoregulatory adaptations of Acrocanthosaurus atokensis - evidence from oxygen isotopes</field><field name="creator">Missell, Christine Ann</field><field name="description">Isotopic analyses of bone phosphate oxygen from a modern alligator, ostrich, and elephant have provided a means for examining diagenesis and thermoregulatory strategy within the dinosaur Acrocanthosaurus atokensis.

Comparison with the modern animals yields a closer resemblance to the ostrich and elephant versus the alligator, thereby suggesting Acrocanthosaurus was endothermic.

Using Generalized Linear Models to Enhance Satellite Based Land Cover Change Detection. (Under the direction of Siamak Khorram.)&lt;p&gt;A popular satellite based land cover change detection technique is to compare the spectral information for each pixel, from two images acquired at different dates. For each pixel, if there is a big enough difference between the reflectance values from the two images, the area represented by that pixel is considered to have changed. The change detection methods are different in how they determine a "big enough difference". The analyst is left to choose which function of the reflectance values to use and where to set the "change" threshold. These choices are often subjective and affect the accuracy of the change detection. In this dissertation we describe and defend the thesis that Generalized Linear Models can be used to enhance satellite based land cover change detection. This is done by first presenting some background on satellite based change detection and then describing how the Generalized Linear Models relate to existing satellite based change detection algorithms. This is followed by an example change detection, which utilizes Generalized Linear Models. The example uses subset images from Landsat Thematic Mapper Data. The data are from 1988 and 1994. For each time period there are overlapping subset images for an area over Raleigh, North Carolina and two overlapping subset images for an area over a coastal region of North Carolina. In each region we collect a sample at 260 ground locations. For each location, land cover changes are determined from high-resolution air photo reference data. This is coupled with the satellite radiance values for the corresponding area. Generalized Linear Models are then used to regress the binary response of change/no-change (as determined from the air photos) on the radiance values extracted from the satellite imagery. In doing so, the models help determine the most appropriate function of the reflectance values to use for predicting change. For the data in this study, the GLMs indicated a combination of radiance values to be more accurate than a single band or single index. Also, the models indicate that different combinations of radiance values should be used for the different study areas. Next, the models are used to produce "accuracy assessment curves". These curves show the relationship between the location of the "change threshold" and the accuracy of the associated change classification. These curves can be used to compare two models across all possible change thresholds. Finally, the models are incorporated into the satellite imagery to produce "probability of change" (POC) images and "variability" images. In the POC image the pixels contain continuous values ranging from zero to one, representing the probability that the area has changed. The pixels in the variability image contain values corresponding to the variability of the estimated POC. Results indicate that incorporating Generalized Linear Models into satellite based land cover change detection yields a more quantitative change detection procedure and more informative change detection products. There are three ways to utilize the models. First GLMs can help select the most significant set of explanatory variables to use in the change detection. Next, the output from the GLMs can be used to produce what we will refer to as "accuracy assessment curves". These curves show the relationship between the threshold value used to classify change areas and the accuracy of this classification. The third use is through incorporate the modeling into the image data to produce continuous "probability of change" images in which the pixel values range from zero to one. These values represent the probability that the area represented by that pixel has changed.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19970411-115134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electric Current Induced Stresses Around the Crack Tip in Conductors</field><field name="creator">Cai, Xiaopeng</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electric current can have a variety of effects on the mechanical behavior of conductors, especially when flaws are present in the materials. Two of the effects, namely the magnetic effect and the thermal effect, on the stress distribution around a crack tip in a conducting material have been investigated. The conductor is assumed to be linearly elastic with constant values of mechanical and physical properties. However, the stresses is proportional to the square of the current in some cases, according to Lorentz's law and Joule's law. Static analysis as well as dynamic analysis are carried out to reveal the effects of the electric current on the stress distribution around the crack tip.&lt;p&gt;General solutions are derived for the static analyses of the thermal effect and the magnetic effect caused by an externally applied magnetic field. Analytical analyses are carried out to reveal the characteristics of stress distribution around the crack tip for these two cases. For the static analysis of magnetic effect caused by the self-induced magnetic field, a numerical analysis procedure is developed. Similar numerical procedures are also developed to analyze the effects of the electric current, both thermal and magnetic, under dynamic conditions.&lt;p&gt;Although the electric current is singular around the crack tip, the analysis results reveal that, under static conditions, the stresses caused by the electric current around the crack tip remain the original singular order of -1/2. Under dynamic conditions, however, the stress distribution does not have a consistent singular order due to the complicated temperature distribution. It is concluded that the fracture criteria based on the stress intensity factors may not be applicable because of the complicated stress distribution. A criterion in terms of critical stress at a critical distance ahead of the crack tip is used in an attempt to correlate analysis results with some existing experimental observations. The major trends are consistent between the analysis results and the experimental observations. By utilizing the analysis results, the electric current could be used to actively control the damage propagation in conductors, hence catastrophic failure could be avoided.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19970508-092022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of nisin-based treatments to control pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms associated with poultry products</field><field name="creator">Shefet, Sarid M.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;&lt;META [NAME="keywords" CONTENT="bacterial-pathogens, bacteriocins, Citric acid, EDTA, foodborne illnesses, formulation, growth curve, nisin, poultry, Salmonella, salmonella typhimurium, Salmonellosis, shelf-life, shelflife, simplex search algorithm, treatment optimization" NAME="copyright" CONTENT="&#169; Sarid M.

From 1983 to 1987, infections contribute to at least 1,000 deaths per year in the United States. &lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Poultry products are considered to be the single most important food source of contamination rates for live chickens can vary from about 13% to 80% of the flock and are invariably higher after processing (Mead, 1976; Roberts, 1988; Budnik, 1990). In 1992, the U.S. was ranked first in the world in poultry consumption with 94.8 pounds per capita, followed by Israel with 83.7 pounds, and Hong Kong with 79.3 pounds (Brown, 1993). In 1993 over 27.6 billion pounds of ready-to-cook poultry products were produced in the U.S. Per capita consumption of poultry products has increased substantially over the last two decades relative to other meat products; therefore, exposure of the consumer to poultry product-associated microorganisms including pathogens has correspondingly increased and no doubt contributes to these foodborne disease statistics.&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides bacterial pathogens, poultry products are also contaminated with a variety of spoilage microorganisms which can contribute to the development of strong off odors and/or slime formation and shortened product shelf life. These organisms, however, are not generally associated with human illness. A reduction in the population of these microorganisms or suppression of their growth often results in increased product shelf life and greater consumer acceptability. Some reports have estimated that the presence of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms on poultry may cost the American public over two billion dollars annually in foodborne disease-related expenditures and spoiled products (Roberts, 1988; Todd, 1989). &lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The bacteriocin nisin was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1988 as a GRAS (general recognized as safe) substance for use in pasteurized cheese spreads to control outgrowth and toxin production by Clostridium botulinum. Blackburn when combined with chelating agents such as disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA) and citrate. Perturbation of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria via chelation of divalent cations located in the lipopolysaccharide layer is believed to sensitize the cells by providing access to the cytoplasmic membrane where nisin-mediated inactivation occurs. &lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The initial focus of this study was to optimize the inhibitory activity of nisin against a NAR skin population, as observed with broiler drumstick skin, were detected following treatment with the four nisin-containing treatments.&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Experiments were also conducted to determine the efficacy of the nisin-based treatments against NAR-infected drumstick skin under varying exposure times and concentrations of nisin. Exposure time significantly influenced the lethality of the treatments and depending on the treatment, nisin concentrations could be reduced from 100 &#181;g/ml to 50 or 25 &#181;g/ml without loss of significant biocidal activity. In other studies, the refrigerated shelf life of broiler drumsticks was extended by 1.5 to 3 days following immersion for 30 minutes in one of the optimized nisin-containing treatments in comparison to drumsticks immersed in distilled, deionized water.&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; These findings indicate that treatments containing nisin and varying concentrations of chelating agents and/or surfactant at an acidic pH are capable of significantly inhibiting the population of -free poultry products, the identification and implementation of effective preservation methods could result in several long term benefits including greater public confidence in poultry products, an increased market potential, and increased profits for the poultry industry.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19970911-110240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">APPLICATIONS OF GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR GROWTH MANAGEMENT PLANNINGAND WATER QUALITY PROTECTION IN THE COASTAL REGION OF NORTH CAROLINA</field><field name="creator">ESSIC, JEFFERSON FORREST</field><field name="description">&lt;P&gt;ESSIC, JEFFERSON FORREST.

Then, this information may be visually displayedin a manner that supports better understanding and analysis of the physicalenvironment and the potential impacts of growth.&lt;P&gt;There have been many instances during the past decade in whichGIS has been used to meet the educational and informational needs of citizensand local officials who want to ensure a strong economy and healthy environmentis planned for the future of their community.

This paper focuses on theapplication of GIS for analyzing and implementing many of those strategieswith emphasis on local responsibility.&lt;P&gt;In particular, the natural suitability of cluster development forCurrituck County, North Carolina, is examined with GIS. Attention to growthmanagement planning in this coastal county is critical since the populationis projected to increase over 73 percent from 1990 to 2020.

Ball speed and net-to-gross-displacement (NGDR) ratio values were calculated for ball movement in the 0.9) indicating that either statistic could be used to describe the flow behavior of particles.

The fact that the movement of a particle in a given system can be documented and characterized suggests that similar comparisons of particle movements can be achieved in other systems or factors influencing flow can be readily evaluated.

An Analysis of Patterns of Computer Mediated Communication Within the Social Studies Student Teaching Experience. (Under the direction of Dr. Peter H. Martorella.) The purpose of this research has been to examine the computer mediated communication (CMC) among a cohort of middle school social studies student teachers and their university supervisors. CMC was facilitated by desktop videoconferencing and web-based groupware. Desktop videoconference sessions were held weekly using CU-SeeMe software, while, web-based groupware messages were posted voluntarily with NetForum software. The two modes of CMC provided the student teachers the opportunities for professional collaboration from their field placement. A qualitative design was used to identify patterns of discourse and to describe the participants? uses of technology. As a result of the participants? active participation in an online learning community, opportunities for peer collaboration and reflection were enhanced. Data from online conversations, interviews, and observations suggested that the intervention of CMC in the student teaching experience allowed the participants to engage in self-directed professional dialogue. The findings suggest that the participants translated the use of technology from the personal context to the classroom context. As a result of this, they acquired perceptions of themselves as technology users.Desktop videoconferencing as a mode of CMC provided more immediate and satisfactory feedback for the participants than the web-based groupware.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Curriculum and Instruction</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19980326-143218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A histological comparative study on sperm competition inside the spermathecae in the grasshopper species, &lt;i&gt;Dichromorpha viridis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Chortophaga viridifasciata&lt;/i&gt; (Orthoptera: Acrididae)</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Jeffery Allan</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The mechanism of sperm transfer and sperm organization inside the spermatheca was investigated in two grasshoppers, (Scudder) and (DeGeer). The spermathecae were examined histologically from females whose copulations were interrupted at various prescribed intervals, either during their first or subsequent mating. Sperm organization inside the spermatheca from 24 to 120 hours after copulation had terminated was also investigated in . Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were used to investigate the distribution and morphology of small hair-like structures inside the spermathecae.&lt;p&gt; In both species sperm were first observed inside the spermatheca approximately 30 minutes after the initiation of copulation. The majority of sperm transferred into the spermatheca were in the form of sperm bundles, or spermatodesmes. In the rate at which sperm bundles were transferred appeared to decrease after 13 hours into copulation (average mating duration in the laboratory was 28 hours). In the rate of sperm transfer remained constant throughout copulation (average mating duration in the laboratory was 1.3 hours). The occurrence of both an abundance of individual sperm and sperm bundles was observed only in females of who had mated previously and had a second copulation of less than 9 hours in duration and in females of that had a second copulation less than 45 minutes in duration. As mating continued, fewer and fewer individual sperm were observed, and by 15 hours into copulation in only sperm bundles were observed inside the spermatheca. Therefore, it appears that the majority of the individual sperm in the above copulations are from prior matings, while most of the sperm bundles are from the last copulation. The interrupted matings of previously mated females indicate that at least some sperm bundles remain inside the spermatheca while individual sperm were removed by some mechanism, possibly sperm flushing by an excess of seminal fluid provided by the mating male.&lt;p&gt; In some sperm bundles remained intact for at least 7 days after the termination of copulation. The sperm bundles must disassociate into individual sperm prior to fertilizing the female&amp;#39s eggs, and therefore it may be the female that provides the mechanism or chemical stimulus to initiate sperm bundle disassociation prior to oviposition or prior to a second mating or both.&lt;p&gt; The results of this investigation suggest sperm competition, perhaps mediated by female choice, as a primary reason for lengthy copulations in . Male weight in has been documented to play a significant role in female choice and mating duration, whereas in , other factors such as nutrient transfer may play a significant role in female choice and mating duration. In , males may also act as mechanical plugs by remaining in copula for an extended time after a sufficient amount of sperm has been transferred, or males may be participating in the process of sperm removal by transferring an excess of seminal fluid to &amp;#34flush-out&amp;#34 any sperm present from previous matings.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19980330-170712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Techniques to Support Multicast Traffic in Single-Hop WDM Optical Networks</field><field name="creator">ORTIZ-LAUREANO, ZEYDY</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Many applications and telecommunications services in futurehigh-speed networks will require some form of multipointcommunication. The problems associated with providing network support formultipoint communication have been widely studied within anumber of different networking contexts.As current network technologies evolve to an all-optical, largely passive infrastructure, these problems takeon new significance and raise a number of challenging issuesthat require novel solutions.&lt;p&gt;We consider the problem of supporting multipoint communication at the media access control (MAC) layer of broadcast-and-select Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) networks.In this environment, bandwidth consumption and channel utilization arise as two conflicting objectives in the design of scheduling algorithms for multicast traffic.We present a new technique for the transmission of multicast packets which is based on the concept of a virtual receiver. This is a set of physical receivers which behave identically in terms of tuning.We focus on the problem of optimally selecting the virtual receivers, and prove that it is NP-complete.We then present four heuristics of varying degrees of complexity for obtaining virtual receivers that provide a good balance between the two conflicting objectives.&lt;p&gt;The dynamic nature of multicast traffic could affect the balance obtained with the virtual receivers when the network conditions change.We study the sensitivity to changes of the virtual receiver sets and the cost associated with handling the changes.Also, the cost of three different approaches to handling the changes is analyzed.Finally, we study the performance of various strategies for scheduling a combined load of unicast and multicast traffic in a broadcast WDM network.Three different scheduling strategies are presented, namely: separate scheduling of unicast and multicast traffic, treating multicast traffic as a number of unicast messages, and treating unicast traffic as multicasts of size one.Performance is measured in terms of schedule length which directly affects both aggregate network throughput and average packet delay.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19980406-202721</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Activity-based Evaluation of Operations Management within Service Operations Organization</field><field name="creator">SHAVER, KAY A.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;SHAVER, KAY ALBRIGHT.

The subject of the study is the Operations Manager, who manages the supervision of engineering and installation of orders. Predictions of time estimates for the Operations Manager will provide information for staffing and workforce planning of the indirect activities required to manage the forecasted order workload.

Using regression analysis, the study evaluates the factors noted in the pilot survey as important to the Operations Managers. Consideration is given to order characteristics, such as size, customer relationships, schedule changes, interval, Operations Manager assigned. Consideration is also given to general characteristics, such as seasonal effects, concurrent orders, experienced installers available, and inventory levels. The analysis reveals that category of work, size of the order as measured by number of frames, seasonal impacts, the Operations Manager assigned, customer relationships, and the effort required to underspend the budget are key predictors of the time required to manage the supervision of the engineering and installation of orders.

More importantly, however, there was a significant increase in specific iron turnover rate presumably through disruption of cellular proton network. In addition, although less dramatic when compared to thermal stress effects, similar results could be obtained when was subjected to the chemical stress. By temporarily short-circuiting ?s proton network with uncouplers, the respiration capacity of cells was disrupted, leading to the increased Fe iron turnover rate.

When a delay is found it affects the earliest starts of the remaining operations on that job and the latest finishes of the preceding operations. The delays are found by repeatedly lowering the potential value of Lmax, which, in response, may increase the lower bound.

DuringVF, the electrical activity of the heart becomes disordered, the ventriclescontract erratically, and an insufficient supply of blood is pumped to the body.Identification of the electrical activation sites during VF is important for theunderstanding and improved treatment of the disorder. Unipolar electrogramsof four pigs were recorded following the induction of VF. The data from theVF recordings was preprocessed using a Rule-Based Method (RBM) , aCurrent Source Density (CSD) method, and a Transmembrane CurrentMethod (TCM) to separate local activations from distant activity. RBM usesthe magnitude of the derivative of the voltage to identify activations. CSD is ascalar quantity that represents the magnitude of the current source or sink.TCM estimates a value proportional to the transmembrane current. Afeedforward artificial neural network (ANN) using backpropagation wastrained to identify the local activations in the electrograms of VF based on theRBM and CSD calculations. Another feedforward ANN usingbackpropagation was trained using data preprocessed with not only RBM andCSD, but also TCM. In order to improve the ability of the ANNs to detect localactivations, a new training method, called staged training, was utilized. Instaged training, the ANNs were trained in stages using different sets oftraining examples. Examples were included in a particular training set basedon the minimum magnitude of the voltage derivative. When training was donein stages, both the ANN with RBM and CSD data only and the ANN with RBM,CSD, and TCM data were able to more accurately distinguish activations.Overall, the ANN, which used only RBM and CSD data, produced betterresults than the ANN that also included TCM data. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological and Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19980701-142321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Phenol-Based Ligands on Vanadate Inhibitionof the Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Yop51*D162.</field><field name="creator">Boyajian, Yvette Darlene</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Studies of vanadate inhibition of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) YOP*D162 were undertaken. Vanadate was found to be reversible competitive inhibitor with Ki,c = 1.64 &#177; 0.07 mM at pH = 5.5 and Ki,c = 3.05 &#177; 0.05 mM at pH = 7.3. Vanadate was not an uncompetitive inhibitor at either pH.A variety of ligands were surveyed to determine if they could enhance vanadate inhibition of PTP. Two, 4-nitrocatechol and 2-amino-4-nitrophenol, formed equilibrium complexes with vanadate that irreversibly inactivated PTP. The ligands catechol, protocatechol, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) reacted with vanadate to produce an inactivator of PTP. The inactivation rate had an exponential dependence on time-squared. Further studies of the vanadate/l-DOPA system demonstrate that the vanadate and l-DOPA react slowly to form a complex that inhibits PTP rapidly and stoichiometrically inhibits PTP. This inhibition is also selective for PTP, in that, it has no effect on the serine/threonine phosphatases acid or alkaline phosphatases. Spectroscopic data suggests the identity of the inhibitor is [VIVO(l-DOPA)2]2-.It was also determined that o-benzoquinone and tetrachloro-o-benzoquinone could inactivate PTP, while p-quinones had no effect on the activity of PTP.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19980722-113157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic Reconfiguration in Broadcast WDM Networks</field><field name="creator">Baldine, Ilia</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;In this research we study the problems associated with dynamic reconfiguration of broadcast WDM networks.Adaptability to the changing traffic conditions is viewed as one of the key features of multiwavelength optical networks, and this is the first comprehensive in-depth study of this problem area.Our contribution consists of identifying the three main questions related to network reconfiguration: a) how to balance the load across multiple wavelengths; b) deciding when it is best to reconfigure the network and c) performing the actual reconfiguration in an efficient manner, that minimizes cell losses.We provide novel solutions to each of these problems.Our solutions consist of an algorithm we call GLPT, which balances the cell load across wavelengths, an optimal reconfiguration policy, derived from representing the problem as a Markovian Decision Process, and a class of retuning strategies that allow us to reconfigure the system.In addition, we perform a simulated comparison of static and dynamically reconfigurable networks in order to verify the validity of our approach.The simulation also provides us with valuable insights into the behavior of an adaptable optical network.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19980723-230505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interdigitated Array Electrodes as Sensors forCopper Species</field><field name="creator">Coughlin, Jessica Urbanik</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;COUGHLIN, JESSICA URBANIK. Interdigitated Array Electrodes as Sensors forCopper Species. (Under the direction of Dr. Janet G. Osteryoung)Recent development of interdigitated array (IDA) electrodes has opened uppossibilities for their design as novel sensors. In this research IDA electrodes havebeen used to study copper because copper is environmentally significant. The goalsof this research include designing a spectroelectrochemical system to studyphotolysis reactions. The photolysis system will use IDA electrodes to obtain rateconstant information for the photolysis of copper-organic species. The second goalis to use IDA electrodes to determine the stability constants of copper corrosionproducts.A spectroelectrochemical experimental apparatus was designed that wouldenable determination of values of rate constants of photochemical reactions forcopper-organic complexes in an agarose gel matrix. These data are useful forenvironmental scientists but are difficult to measure. Novel geometries ofinterdigitated arrays and spectroelectrochemical cells for these experiments havebeen developed.The corrosion of copper in different media has been examined usinginterdigitated array electrodes. A novel experiment using IDA electrodes has beendesigned to determine the stability constants of copper corrosion products. Forthese experiments, copper was plated onto one lead of the IDA electrode. Whenthis copper lead was anodized, the corrosion product was detected and measuredat the other IDA lead. In the chloride system, where chloride ranged inconcentration from 0.5 to 1.0 M, the stability constant for CuCl2-was found to be log &#223;2 = (CuCl2-)/(Cu+)(Cl-)&#178; = 5.88 &#177; 0.03. For the bromide system, where the bromide concentration ranged from 0.05 to 0.10 M, the stability constant for CuBr2-was found to be log &#223;2 = (CuBr2-)/(Cu+)(Br-)&#178;= 6.17 &#177; 0.08. These values fall within therange of values reported in the literature. The maleic acid system was also studied,as maleic acid is a common metabolite that might contribute to biocorrosion. Thepreliminary results from these experiments were close to those values found in theliterature.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19980804-165827</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regular and Hybrid Mesons in a Non-RelativisticConstituent Quark Model.</field><field name="creator">Elliott, Louie C</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;We investigate q-qbar and q-qbar-g mesons with regularand exotic quantum numbers in a non-relativisticconstituent quark model.

In this thesis, weextend this input-modeling methodology in two directions. First,we establish the asymptotic properties of the Likelihood RatioTest (LRT) as the sample size tends to infinity. The asymptoticanalysis applies only to maximum likelihood estimation withknown endpoints and not to any other parameter estimationprocedure, nor to situations in which the endpoints of thetarget distribution are unknown. Second, we perform acomprehensive Monte Carlo evaluation of this procedure forfitting data together with other estimation procedures based onleast squares and minimum L norm estimation. In the MonteCarlo performance evaluation, several different goodness-of-fitmeasures are formulated and used to evaluate how well the fittedcumulative distribution function (CDF) compares to theempirical CDF and to the actual CDF from which the samplescame. The Monte Carlo experiments show that in addition toworking well with the method of maximum likelihood when theendpoints of the target distribution are known, the LRT alsoworks well with minimum L norm estimation and least squaresestimation; moreover, the LRT works well with suitablyconstrained versions of these three estimation methods when theendpoints are unknown and must also be estimated.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19980908-212432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Adaptive Grid Algorithm for Air Quality Modeling</field><field name="creator">Srivastava, Ravi K</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;SRIVASTAVA, RAVI K. An Adaptive Grid Algorithm for Air Quality Modeling. (Under the direction of Dr. D. Scott McRae.)The physical and chemical processes responsible for air pollution span a wide range of spatial scales. For example, there may be point sources, such as power plants that are characterized by relatively small spatial scales compared to the size of the region that may be impacted by such sources. To obtain accurate distributions of pollutants in an air quality simulation, the pertinent spatial scales can be resolved by varying the physical grid node spacing.A new dynamic adaptive grid algorithm, the Dynamic Solution Adaptive Grid Algorithm - PPM (DSAGA-PPM), is developed for use in air quality modeling. Given a fixed number of grid nodes, DSAGA-PPM distributes these nodes in response to spatial resolution requirements of the solution field and then updates the solution field based on the resulting distribution of nodes. DSAGA-PPM is implemented dynamically to resolve any evolving solution features. Tests with model problems demonstrate that DSAGA-PPM calculates advection much more accurately than the corresponding static grid algorithm (SGA-PPM) and, therefore, would assure more accurate starting concentrations for chemistry calculations. For example, after one revolution of four rotating cones, 87% of each of the cone peaks is retained using DSAGA-PPM while only 63% is retained using SGA-PPM. The root-mean-square errors in DSAGA-PPM results are about 4-5 times lower than those in the corresponding SGA-PPM results. Tests with reacting species and sources demonstrate that DSAGA-PPM provides the needed solution resolution. In simulations of a rotating and reacting conical puff, the root-mean-square errors in DSAGA-PPM results are about 4-6 times lower than those in the corresponding SGA-PPM results. In simulations of a power plant plume, the DSAGA-PPM solution reflects the early, the intermediate, and the mature stages of plume development; these stages are not seen in the corresponding SGA-PPM solution. Finally, it is demonstrated that DSAGA-PPM provides an accurate description of the ozone production resulting due to dynamic interactions between emissions from two power plants and an urban area. In general, these results reflect that DSAGA-PPM is able to provide accurate spatial and temporal resolution of rapidly changing and complex concentration fields. Performance achieved by DSAGA-PPM in model problem simulations indicates that it can provide accurate air quality modeling solutions at costs 10 times less than those incurred in obtaining equivalent static grid solutions. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19980919-174712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pattern Analysis, Tracking and Control for Autonomous Mobile Robots Using Neural Networks</field><field name="creator">Janet, Jason Andre</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Autonomous vehicles require that all on-board processes be efficient in time, complexity and data storage. Infact, an ideal system employs multi-funcitonal models where ever possible. The research documented hereproposes that the Region-Feature Neural Network (RFNN) and the Hyper-Ellipsoid Clustering (HEC)Kohonen neural network (or HECNN) are viable pattern analysis and control engines that contribute to thesolution of a variety of problems. The theoretical development of the RFNN and HECNN, along with severalproof-of-concept applications are presented in detail. The RFNN is a feed-forward, back-propagation modelthat is more general than standard textbook models because it also accomodates receptive fields and weightsharing. The RFNN uses a modified version of adaptive learning rates, called "shocking" to reduce training timeand maintain stability. Small-scale benchmark problems like the XOR and XOP problems are used todemonstrate the utility of the "shocking" model. Due to its modularity, the RFNN allows the user to constructflexible, multi-layered, feed-forward architectures as well as add to and prune from an architecture even aftertraining has begun. The RFNN also permits the user to include previously learned features, called "analogies" tofurther expedite the training process on new problems or whenever new classes are added. The HECNN is aself-organizing neural network that incorporates hyperellipsoid clustering by use of the Mahalanobis distance tolearn elongated shapes and obtain a stochastic measurement of data-node association. The number of nodes canalso be regulated in a self-organizing manner by measuring how well each node models the statistical propertiesof its associated data. This measurement, called "compactness", determines where and whether to add neuralunits or prune them completely. We make several enhancements to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov compactness testto control the triggering of mitosis and/or pruning. Because fewer nodes are needed for an HECNN than for aKohonen that uses only Euclidean distance, the data size is smaller for the HEC Kohonen, even forhigh-dimensional problems. The large-scale pattern analysis problems presented here for the RFNN includesonar pattern recognition and outdoor landmark recognition. For the HECNN, we focus on sonar patternrecognition and (topographical) map building. Both the RFNN and the HECNN can be generalized to solve orcontribute to the solution of other pattern recognition problems. Both are also multifunctional in that theyaccommodate compact geometric motion planning (MP), self-referencing (SR) and tracking algorithms.Additionally, we propose the "traversability vector" (t-vector) as an efficient bridge between the HECNN andboth motion planning and self-referencing for mobile robots. As with the RFNN and HECNN, the t-vector is amodular and multi-functional tool that minimizes the computation requirements and data size as it detects pathobstructions, Euclidean optimal via points, and geometric beacons, as well as identify which geometric featuresare visible to sensors in environments that can be static or dynamic. Tracking is made possible with Julier andUhlmann's unscented filter. The unscented filter particularly compliments the HECNN in that it performslow-level (non-linear) tracking more efficiently and more accurately than its predecessor, the extended Kalmanfilter (EKF). By estimating and propagating error covariances through system transformations, the unscentedfilter eliminates the need to derive Jacobian matrices. The inclusion of stochastic information inherent to the HECmap rendered the JUKF an excellent tool for our HEC-based map building, global self-localization, motionplanning and low-level tracking. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19981003-104929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Real-Time Control of Polysilicon Deposition in Single-Wafer Rapid Thermal Chemical Vapor Deposition Furnaces</field><field name="creator">Smith, Robert Merrill</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;This thesis describes the development of a real-time control system for depositing polysilicon films on silicon wafers by means of rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition. Results are presented which characterize the ability of the control system to deposit films of an average desired thickness and predict the film?s spatial thickness distribution.A rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition system was used to individually process wafers. During processing, a mass spectrometer monitored the chemical species present in the exhaust gases to determine the total volume of material deposited. Simultaneously, optical probes resolved the spatial temperature distribution of the wafer. The mass spectrometry and optical temperature data were combined with an Arrhenius equation to model the deposition process. Validation of the model was exsitu. After processing, film thickness measurements were made on each wafer and compared to the computer model?s predictions.Experimental results identified hydrogen, a by-product of the deposition reaction, as the metric for determining the total volume of polysilicon deposited. Process recipe control (today?s standard control technique) produced films varying over a range of 280 &#197; when repeatedly employed to deposit film?s of 900 &#197;. Application of the real-time control system produced films varying a maximum of 74 &#197; when attempting to deposit films of average thickness ranging from 800 to 1200 &#197;. Modeling results predicted the thickness of the deposited film to within 20 &#197; at the center of the wafer. Predictions at the wafers edge were off by a maximum of 160 &#197;.From the experience gained during this project, the following two recommendations are made to guide future efforts. First, the mass spectrometer?s reaction time to an event occurring in the furnace was found to be one second. Employing an optical sensor could improve control by reducing the time lag of the system. Second, designing the furnace with the necessary optical access so that the sensors can be located outside the vacuum system would greatly facilitate the accuracy and reliability of the system. This would eliminate exposure of the sensors to the high temperatures and corrosive gases present inside the furnace which can adversely affect their performance.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19981020-131153</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an Intermediate DOF Vehicle Dynamics Model for Optimal Design Studies</field><field name="creator">Lowndes, Erik M</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The demands imposed by the optimal design process form a unique set of criteriafor the development of a computational model for vehicle simulation. Due to the largenumber of simulations that must be performed to obtain an optimized design the modelmust be computationally efficient. A competing criterion is that the computational modelmust realistically model the vehicle.Current trends in vehicle simulation codes have tackled the problem of realism byconstructing elaborate full vehicle models containing dozens if not hundreds of distinctbodies. Each body in a model of this type is associated with six degrees of freedom.Numerous constraint equations are applied to the bodies to represent the physicalconnections. While the formulation of the equations is not particularly difficult, and in facthas been automated in several software packages, the resulting model requires aconsiderable amount of computational time to run. This makes the model unsuitable forthe application of computational optimal design techniques.Past research in the field of vehicle dynamics has produced numerouscomputational models which are small enough and fast enough to satisfy the speeddemands of the optimal design process. These models typically use less than a dozendegrees of freedom to model the vehicle. They do a good job of predicting the generalmotion of the vehicle and they are useful as design tools but they lack the accuracyrequired for optimal design.A model that bridges the gap between these two existing classes of models and issuitable for performing optimal design was developed. The model possesses twenty-eightdegrees of freedom and consists of eight bodies which represent the sprung mass, the rearsuspension, the left front spindle, the right front spindle, and the four wheels. A drivercontrol algorithm was developed which is capable of driving the car near its handlinglimits. The NCSU Legends race car was modeled and an attempt was made to optimizethe vehicle setup for the Kenley, NC race track.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19981022-201805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">VARIATION IN SELECTED JUVENILE WOOD PROPERTIESIN FOUR SOUTHERN PROVENANCES OF LOBLOLLY PINE</field><field name="creator">Belonger, Paul J.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;BELONGER, PAUL JAMES. Variation of selected juvenile wood properties in four southern provenances of loblolly pine. (Under the direction of Steven E. McKeand.)Gravimetric wood density, x-ray densitometry, and latewood tracheids were used to investigate the relative importance of genetic and environmental effects on various assessments of wood density, tracheid characteristics, and growth traits in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.). Breast-height wood samples were taken from four 12-year-old plantings of a genetics trial that included approximately 50 open-pollinated families of loblolly pine from diverse sources. The densitometry and tracheid analysis included wood samples from only two of the test sites and assessed variation in 51 families, and 38 families, respectively. Moderate provenance differences, but strong family and environmental differences were found for wood density and volume, and the pooled genetic correlation between volume and density was -0.30. The Atlantic Coastal and Lower Gulf sources had higher average wood density than the Marion County and Gulf Hammock sources, and the Lower Gulf source had the lowest stem volume. Provenance variation in wood density was not consistent with geographic trends indicating a need for field testing in the area of intended deployment. Location effects were very important and sites which promoted high volume production also appeared to cause low wood density. Strategies are available to combat the unfavorable negative environmental correlation (-0.91, P &lt; 0.01) between stem volume and wood density. Provenance variation was important for disk densities of early ring segments, but diminished with age and was not significant (P &gt; 0.10) beyond the segment consisting of rings 3-6. Pooled narrow-sense heritability estimates for the consecutive-ring group disk densities ranged from 0.142 to 0.225, and all groups were highly correlated with average (tree) disk density (rA &gt; 0.90). Mean latewood density and mean latewood percent both showed a strong positive genetic correlation with average disk density and the disk density of the ring 3-5 segment. Early selection for disk density can be effective.The transition to "mature" wood occurred at ring number 5.9 at the flatwoods location with higher wood density and ring number 8.9 at the upland test site with lower density. The point of transition also showed a strong provenance component (P &lt; 0.05); the higher density Atlantic Coastal and Lower Gulf Coastal Plain sources transitioned sooner than the lower density Gulf Hammock and Marion County sources. Trachied length, total diameter, lumen diameter, and cell wall thickness were measured using outer-ring latewood tracheids. Of the trachied traits, only cell wall thickness showed a marginal location effect (P &lt; 0.10). Measured in the middle-third of the cells, tracheids sampled at the Florida location were about 11% larger in total diameter, lumen diameter, and cell wall thickness, but no difference was detected for tracheid length. Provenance differences were strongest for cell wall thickness (P &lt; 0.01) and marginally important for tracheid length (P &lt; 0.16) and total cell diameter (P &lt; 0.18).Variation among families within provenances was large (P &lt; 0.01 for all tracheid traits) and resulted in relatively high narrow-sense heritability estimates of 0.58 for length, 0.34 for total diameter, 0.22 for lumen diameter, and 0.37 for cell wall thickness. The genetic correlations among these traits were all greater than 0.69 except the correlation between length and lumen diameter which was 0.42. Measurement of tracheid length can be used to assess family differences for cell diameter and cell wall thickness.None of the tracheid traits were strongly correlated with average disk density or the disk density of rings 3-5. Therefore, genetic selection for high average density in 10 to 12 year-old loblolly pines from the provenances studied here will not produce a predictable pattern in the character of outer-ring latewood tracheids.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19981027-102102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and Modeled Effects of Camshaft Manufacturing Errors on the Dynamics of High Speed Valve Trains</field><field name="creator">Lewandowski, David</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;AbstractLEWANDOWSKI, DAVID JOHN Experimental and Modeled Effects of CamshaftManufacturing Errors on the Dynamics of High Speed Valve Trains. (Under thedirection of Dr. Joseph W. David)The idea of harnessing combustion to perform mechanical work is by no means anew one. The internal combustion engine, as we know it today, has its origins in the lastcentury, however the idea for controlling combustion to perform mechanical work datesback to the Renaissance. Even with the advent of alternative sources of power forcommerce and personal applications, the internal combustion engine represents a largeportion of the power generation available in this country.There are numerous types of internal combustion engines, each with a variety ofsubsystems. While all of these types and corresponding subsystems are equally important,this investigation is focused on the valve train dynamics of a pushrod type internalcombustion engine. Operating this type of engine at too high of an engine speed usuallycauses dynamic malfunctions such as spring surge, lifter/cam pair separation, valvebounce, etc. in the valve train. Although the interaction of each of the valve traincomponents contributes to the limit speed, the shape of the cam plays a critical role.Therefore, this investigation will look at how small changes in the cam profile due tomanufacturing errors change the dynamics of a valve train in a pushrod type engine.Automotive cams can be manufactured as copied or original parts. Copied partsare typically produced on a rocker type cam grinder and the original parts are produced on a computer numerical control grinder. Therefore, various errors associated with thesemanufacturing techniques are studied herein.Installing cams with profile errors in an engine may result in the dynamicmalfunction of its valve train. In order to study the effect of these profile errors, some ofthe error cam profiles that were predicted for the rocker grinder were manufactured andtested in an actual valve train. In addition, the effects of error cam profiles wereinvestigated by using an existing valve train simulation model. It was found by bothexperimentation and simulation that camshaft errors on the order of typical shoptolerances had little impact on the dynamics of high speed valve trains.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19981029-101808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational Methods for Feedback Control in Structural Systems</field><field name="creator">Rosario, Ricardo C.H.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Numerical methods, LQR control, an abstract formulation andreduced basis techniques for a system consisting of a thin cylindrical shellwith surface-mounted piezoceramic actuators are investigated.Donnell-Mushtari equations,modified to include Kelvin-Voigt damping and passive patch contributions,are used to model the system dynamics. The voltage-induced piezoceramicpatch contributions, used as input inthe control regime, enter the equations as externalforces and moments. Existence and uniqueness of solutions are demonstratedthrough variational and semigroup formulations of the system equations.The semigroup formulation is also used to establish theoretical controlresults and illustrate convergence of the finite dimensional controlsand Riccati operators.The spatial components of the state arediscretized using a Galerkin expansion resulting in an ordinarydifferential equation that can be readily marched in time by existingordinary differential equationsolvers.Full order approximation methods which employ standard basiselements such as cubic or linear splines result in large matrixdimensions rendering the system computationally expensive for real-timesimulations. To lessen on-line computational requirements, reducedbasis methods employing snapshots of the full order model as basisfunctions are investigated.As a first step in validating the model, a shell with obtainable analyticnatural frequencies and modes was considered. The derived frequenciesand modeswere then compared with numerical approximations using full order basisfunctions. Further testing on the static and dynamic performance of the fullorder model was carried out through the following steps:(i) choose true state solutions, (ii) solve for the forces in theequations that would lead to these known solutions, and (iii) comparenumerical results excited by the derived forces with the true solutions.Reduced order methods employing the Lagrange and theKarhunen-Lo&#232;ve proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)basis functions are implemented on the model.

Increases in CCN concentrations result in an increase in the cloud droplet number concentration (N). Assuming the cloud liquid water content (LWC) stays the same, this will result in smaller cloud droplet sizes. Thus, this will increase cloud reflectance and cloud lifetime as cloud cover also increases. An accurate quantification of the aerosol forcing effect is still not possible due to the complexity involved in understanding aerosol processes and their effects on climate. There has also been a lack of a coordinated effort toward linking surface and in situ observations, as well climate model results and satellite data. Due to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in aerosol forcing, regional effects are important. In this dissertation, the direct and indirect radiative forcing effects of aerosols - primarily sulfates and to lesser extent soot aerosols at a site located in the southeastern U.S. are investigated by means of surface observations, modeling results and satellite data.During the summers of 1993-96, field experiments were conducted at Mt. Mitchell, North Carolina, at a site representative of the southeastern U.S. to determine the effect of pollutants on the cloud microphysical and optical properties. Analyses of the results from empirical relationships are used to obtain an estimate of the contribution of sulfates to indirect radiative forcing. Concurrent measurements of size resolved chemical concentrations, light scattering and absorption coefficients, aerosol size distribution and optical depth measurements were obtained during the winter of 1997 for cloud-free skies. Data from these measurements are used to investigate the chemical-physical-optical interaction between aerosols and to determine the direct forcing effect of aerosols by means of a column forcing model. Cloud water sulfate concentration is used as a measure of anthropogenic pollution. Back-trajectory analysis is used to identify the source of the air masses classified as polluted continental, continental and marine. The effect of anthropogenic pollution on cloud microphysical properties such as LWC, N, effective radii (Reff), CCN activation spectrum, cloud optical depth and reflectivity are investigated. The relationship between Reff and sulfate for different air masses, as well as the N-sulfate mass relationship, suggests that the counteracting effect of sulfates on greenhouse warming for the southeastern U.S. would be of a magnitude greater than -4.0 W m-2 obtained by previous modeling studies. Acidity variations between cloud droplets of different sizes indicated that on an average, smaller drops are enriched in sulfates, nitrates and ammonium, whereas, larger droplets have higher concentrations of sodium, calcium and magnesium. As part of a closure experiment cloud albedo calculated from in situ measurements was compared to that retrieved from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data for four years (1993-96). The nonlinear relationships between the cloud microphysical/optical properties and the sulfate content imply the existence of an optimum level for the sulfate concentration that would affect cloud albedo. In terms of the direct forcing effect, wintertime forcing obtained for an internal mixture of sulfate and soot aerosols is much lower than that obtained during summer, due to reduced sulfate concentrations in winter. A quantitative measure of the direct forcing indicates higher magnitudes both for summer and winter than is obtained from previous modeling results. Analyses of the direct and indirect radiative forcing effect of sulfates for the southeastern U.S. indicate that the negative forcing effect is of greater magnitude than is predicted by modeling results. Thus, reduction in sulfate emissions would have a significant impact on climate for the southeastern U.S. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19981102-133647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ability-Requirements of Task Dimensions</field><field name="creator">Radziewicz, Alisa</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACTRADZIEWICZ, ALISA. Ability-Requirements of Task Dimensions. (Under the direction of J. W. Cunningham.) This effort describes an analytic approach to exploring ability-requirement estimates for positions using the job-component approach. The first part of this study explored the underlying dimensionality of tasks. A job-task inventory was used to derive attribute-requirement weights for job components enabling the derivation of attribute-requirement estimates for any position that has been scored on the weighted components. Currently, little research has been conducted to examine different computational methods of deriving ability-requirements estimates outside of the work of Sparrow, Spurgeon, &amp; Barwell (1982) and more recently the work of Cunningham, Powell, Wimpee, &amp; Wilson (1996). The later research found that the use of minimum weight values with the cross-product method produced a more differentiated factor structure. Consequently, the second part of this study explored two different job-component methods for computing ability-requirement estimates using minimum values with the cross-product method. One method involved the combination of task ratings with factor ability weights, applying job-component procedures to the position rating matrix and ability weight matrix. The second method combined task cluster scores with factor ability weights. Job-component procedures were applied to a position matrix and an ability weight matrix. Each method yielded an ability-by-position matrix containing ability-requirement estimates. Correlations between the positions' ability-requirement estimates from the two job-component methods were compared via Monte Carlo procedures. The results demonstrated that although there was some convergence between the two methods there was also a lack of discrimination and differentiation within methods. Finally, the third part of this study used Monte Carlo procedures to compare two job-component derived ability-requirement estimates with direct ability dimension ratings made by incumbents. The underlying structure of each ability-requirement matrix was also examined. Results indicated that there was a lack of correspondence between the job-component derived ability-requirement estimates and those derived from incumbent judgments. It is likely that these results relate to the difficulty encountered by incumbents in rating the ability dimensions. The reliability of the incumbent ratings confirms this premise and likely influences the congruence between the data sets. These results suggest that caution should be taken when using dimensions in research, due to the cognitive challenge of rating broad constructs. In sum, this research demonstrates the need for further evaluation of the computational methods of the job-component approach.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19981102-145508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Dimensionality of Work-Related Needs and Work Reinforcers</field><field name="creator">Biederman, Julie Lynne</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;AbstractBIEDERMAN, JULIE LYNNE. The Dimensionality of Work-Related Needs and Work Reinforcers. (Under the direction of J.W. CUNNINGHAM.)Even though there have been many approaches to the study of the person-environment (P-E) fit, little research is available that makes it possible to systematically compare work-related needs and work-reinforcers across various instruments. Research suggests that the traditional concept of commensurate measurement may not be feasible at the item or scale level (Shubsachs, Round, &amp; Lofquist, 1978; Rounds, Dawis, &amp; Lofquist, 1987). This study investigated and compared the factor structures of four self-report inventories (measuring work-related needs) and three job-rating inventories (measuring work reinforcers) in a search for some common dimensionality among instruments. The underlying structures of the self-report and job-rating inventories were established and compared through three groups of analyses. In the first group, multitrait-multimethod analyses of correlation coefficients offered support for the convergent and discriminant validity of eight matched factors common to two or more self-report inventories. In the second group, multitrait-multimethod analyses of congruence coefficients supported three common constructs among the job-rating inventories. In the final group of comparative analyses, six common factors were identified across the self-report and job-rating inventories.Although the number of factors differed among the analyses, subsequent categorical groupings of factors seemed to offer a parsimonious and meaningful model for comparing self-report and job-rating inventories. The three identified categories were Existence, Relatedness, and Growth, as presented in Alderfer's (1969) E.R.G. theory of work motivation. In the future, these categories could prove useful in commensurate measurement and P-E fitting. Practical implications and suggestions for future research are addressed. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19981103-121903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using Botanical Analysis to Shape a Longleaf Restoration Project</field><field name="creator">Parker, Douglas S.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;PARKER, DOUGLAS SEABROOK.Using Botanical Analysis to Shape aLongleaf Restoration Project. (Under the direction of Gary Blank.)&lt;p&gt; This thesis focuses on the rare and endangered Piedmont TransitionalLongleaf Pine Community (PTLC) found on the Harris Research Tract (HRT)located in southern Wake County, North Carolina. The goal of this thesis is to laya foundation of knowledge to guide the restoration and preservation of the PTLC. This guidance is via three different papers with three different perspectives(current, historical, and social).&lt;p&gt; The current condition and range of the PTLC is assessed and verifiedthrough the use of the North Carolina Vegetation Survey (NCVS). During thesummer of 1997, 56 plots 20m X 50m were intensively surveyed. The data wereanalyzed using cluster analysis, detrended correspondence analysis, canonicalcorrespondence analysis, and non-metric multidimensional scaling. The 1222 acreHRT was subsequently divided into eight different forest communities of whichtwo were identified as variants of the PTLC.&lt;p&gt; The historical land use practices, identified in a previous study by ScottBode, are combined with the vegetation survey data to further refine the PTLC intoinput levels for restoration. One portion of the PTLC is seen to contain nolongleaf pine due to the practices of marine stores production, hog grazing, andselective timbering and would require high input for restoration. Another portionis seen to have only suffered fire suppression as evidenced by old photos, landrecords, and species composition and would require low input for restoration. Inaddition, the vegetative survey data is compared to other PTLC in North Carolinaand the historical record to generate a target list of species for longleaf communityrestoration. &lt;p&gt; As the study progressed, a social aspect that could become an obstacle tothe PTLC restoration effort presented itself. The negative attitude of theneighboring communities of New Hill, Holly Springs, Fuquay-Varina, and Apex toward the use of prescribed fire as a management tool became apparent after anincident in the spring of 1998. This attitude based on old information couldbecome an obstacle if unchallenged. Thus, a white paper was written to theneighboring communities to confront the mythos of the evilness of fire. Arationale discussing the need for the white paper was also included.&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19981105-104105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Marshland of Ethnolinguistic Boundaries: Conflicting Past and Present BE Paradigms in Coastal Carolina Speech.</field><field name="creator">Green, Elaine Weslee</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt; This thesis investigates the extent to which localized contact situations figure in the early development of African-American speech. Because many African American varieties of English have their roots in the rural Southern United States, evidence from the longstanding, bi-racial insular contact situation in Hyde County, North Carolina, provides a valuable opportunity to shed light on the earlier development of African-American speech. This thesis focuses on the morphosyntactic features of past tense BE and copula absence as two variables diagnostic in situating ethnolinguistic alignment for this African-American community. The analysis examines speech samples for 32 Anglo-American and African-American Hyde County speakers that show disparate patterns of ethnolinguistic alignment. I hypothesize that this mixed alignment patterning is attributable to the long-term effects of ethnic boundaries within a broader context of localized coastal identity. At the same time, I also hypothesize that AAVE in Hyde County is moving away from that local dialect identity towards a more uniform AAVE norm as part of the larger cultural reorientation of African American identity that evolved coterminous with the Civil Rights movement and school desegregation. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19981106-201702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">College Students' Perceptions of and Intentions to Engage in Sexually Abstinent versus Not Abstinent Behaviors</field><field name="creator">Bailey, Malissa Ann</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt; The purpose of the following study was to assess college students' perceptions of sexual abstinence and to determine their likelihood of refraining from sexual behaviors in the future. Research conducted by Horan, Hagan, and Phillips (1998) indicates a need to clearly communicate to students what is meant by the term "abstinence," since a significant proportion of young adults appear to consider risky sexual behaviors as "abstinent." In the present study, using an anonymous self-report survey, students enrolled in various psychology courses at North Carolina State University were asked to report their previous sexual behavior, identify those behaviors they believe constituted sexual abstinence, and predict the likelihood that they will abstain from sexual intercourse in a one year period. The results suggest that there is a discrepancy between the CDC's definition of abstinence and college students' interpretation of this practice. This is especially true for behaviors related to oral sex.

V. Young.)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Contrary to critics who assert that Elizabethan and Jacobean poets can be categorically differentiated from each other according to their philosophical outlook and style, Sir Philip Sidney' shows them to be contiguous and continuous innovators in the Petrarchan love lyric. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Both terminates with Astrophil trapped within the conditions he has defined. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This novel conclusion, although firmly based in conventional Petrarchan precepts, exposes the issues that constantly loom before any Petrarchan love lyricist; that is, the problematic identities and relationships of images, ideas, and realities; invention, inspiration, and imitation. On the other hand, in their arguments and attitudes toward love and poetry, but several of the most poignant and exploratory poems admit the necessity of idealized image-making while also accepting the inevitable irony in such images. Thus Donne's sequence can be seen as an acknowledgment of Sidney's exposure of the inherent instability involved in poetic attempts to transpose the ideal into the real, but it can also be seen as an innovative response to this problem that entails embracing the instability and irony of Petrarchan lyricism and then using that instability and irony prominently in poems whose speakers are conscious of the limitations of their conceits. As the primary example of this attitude, Donne's speaker in "A nocturnal upon S. Lucies day, Being the shortest day" explores the inherent irony in idealized images of the union of human lovers while yet recognizing the vision and direction they afford as sacramental foretypes of eternity and divine love.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19981127-152342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Develop Methods To Evaluate the Performance of Aflatoxin Sampling Plans for Shelled Corn.</field><field name="creator">Johansson, Anders Sture</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Eighteen lots of shelled corn were tested for aflatoxin contamination. The variability and distributional characteristics associated with the aflatoxin testing procedure were investigated. The total variance associated with testing shelled corn was estimated and partitioned into sampling, sample preparation, and analytical variances. All variances were found to increase with an increase in aflatoxin concentration. Using regression analysis, mathematical expressions were developed to model the relationship between aflatoxin concentration and the total, sampling, sample preparation, and analytical variances. The expressions for these relationships were used to estimate the variance for any sample size, subsample size, and number of analyses for a specific aflatoxin concentration. For example, testing a lot with 20 parts per billion (ppb) aflatoxin using a 2.5 lb sample, Romer mill and 50 g subsample, and HPLC analysis, the total, sampling, sample preparation, and analytical variances are 274.9 (CV=82.9%), 214.0 (CV=73.1%), 56.3 (CV=37.5%), and 4.6 (CV=10.7%), respectively. The percentage of the total variance for sampling, sample preparation, and analytical is 77.8, 20.5, and 1.7 %, respectively. Next, fifteen positively skewed distributions were each fitted to 18 empirical distributions of aflatoxin test results for shelled corn. The compound gamma distribution was selected to model the sample aflatoxin test results for shelled corn. The method of moments technique was chosen to estimate the parameters of the compound gamma distribution. Mathematical expressions were developed to calculate the parameters of the compound gamma distribution for any lot aflatoxin concentration and test procedure. Observed acceptance probabilities were compared to operating characteristic curves predicted from the compound gamma distribution and all 18 distributions of sample aflatoxin test results were found to lie within a 95% confidence band. Using the mean and variance relationships to compute the parameters of the compound gamma distribution, 16 sampling plans, based on four sample sizes and four sample acceptance levels were created and analyzed. For a given sample size, decreasing the sample acceptance level, using a sample acceptance level equal to the regulatory guideline: (a) decreases the percentage of lots accepted while increasing the percentage of lots rejected at all aflatoxin concentrations; (b) increases misclassification of lots (both false positives and false negatives) while decreasing the percentage of correct decisions; and (c) decreases the average aflatoxin concentration in the lots accepted and lots rejected. For a given sample size where the sample acceptance level is less than the regulatory guideline, the number of false positives increases and the number of false negatives decreases when compared to the situation where the sample acceptance level equals the regulatory guideline. For a given sample size, where the sample acceptance level is greater than the regulatory guideline, the number of false positives decreases and the number of false negatives increases when compared to the situation where the sample acceptance level equals the regulatory guideline. Increasing the sample size for a given sample acceptance level, where the legal limit equals the sample acceptance level: (a) increases the percentage of lots accepted at lower concentrations while increasing the percentage of lots rejected at higher concentrations; (b) decreases misclassification of lots (both false positives and false negatives) while increasing the percentage of correct decisions; and (c) decreases the average aflatoxin concentration in the lots accepted while increasing the average aflatoxin concentration in the rejected lots.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological and Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19981228-110754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DETERMINATION OF POSSIBLE WETLAND MITIGATIONSITES USING NC-CREWS AND AN INTEGER LINEARPROGRAMMING FORMULATION</field><field name="creator">Gainey, Kevin Wayne</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project was to develop an optimization model for wetland mitigation site selection using a geographic information system for rating wetlands and traditional operations research methodologies. This project was conducted using a GIS based wetland assessment procedure entitled North Carolina Coastal Region Evaluation of Wetland Significance (NC-CREWS) developed by the North Carolina Department of Environmental Resources' Division of Coastal Management (DCM). NC-CREWS rates possible mitigation sites by the wetland functions they could perform if fully restored. Using this component of NC-CREWS, a conceptual model to optimize the selection of restoration sites based on their functions was developed and tested on a small, fabricated example to test workability. This model was adapted to include possible restoration site ratings from an actual watershed in Craven County, NC, provided by DCM. The 0-1 integer programming model that was developed was tested using trials to address issues of problem size, functional unit level required, and order of sites used in the model. Of the 180 tests, all but 37 reached an optimal solution by 200 million iterations of a branch-and-bound algorithm. The problem size and number of functional units required had little impact on the solution time. The ordering of sites as supplied to the model resulted in nonfeasible solutions if sites were chosen based on a physical characteristic such as size or perimeter length. Given the assumptions made in the model it is possible to derive a list of possible mitigation sites to use for improving field recognizance. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19981228-141852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">COMBINATION OF HYDROENTANGLEMENT AND FOAM BONDING TECHNOLOGIES FORWOOD PULP AND POLYESTER FIBERS IN WET LAY NONWOVEN FABRICS</field><field name="creator">Gahide, Severine</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;This project searches for synergism between two binder technologies, specifically 1) low levels ofhydroentanglement energy which avoid excessive fiber loss but do not give adequate fabric strength, abrasionresistance or strain recovery, and 2) low levels of binder which do not degrade fabric aesthetics. The mainsteps were to 1) determine the fiber loss while hydroentangling, by testing three fabric weights and severalspecific energy levels for a 50% wood pulp and 50% polyester, and then 2) combine both technologies, fortwo fiber blends, at three levels of specific energy and four levels of binder add on. We found that: 1. Thecarrier screen mesh size, during hydroentanglement, was a critical factor for making the desired fabrics. 2.The fiber loss during hydroentanglement increases linearly with increasing specific energy, in the rangestudied. 3. The fabric basis weight has a very weak influence on the fiber loss during hydroentanglement. 4.Fabrics hydroentangled from one side only or on both sides lose the same amount of fibers. 5. The physicalproperties -strength, load at 5% strain, abrasion resistance- are greatly improved with an add-on of binder,while different levels of hydroentanglement energy input were found to be less significant. 6. Thehydroentangled and foam bonded fabrics are softer than those which were foam bonded only. 7. Theaddition of foam bonding up to 5% did not affect the softness of the hydroentangled fabrics. 8. The hydrogenbonding effect is shown to be significant at these levels of hydroentanglement and binder add-on. 9. Thefabric bending rigidity can be correlated with the Young's modulus of the bonded fabric for a 60% woodpulp fabric. 10. The abrasion resistance behavior is very different depending on the side tested: foam free orfoamed. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Management and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990216-135019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PURPOSEFUL USE OF A NON-RESTRICTIVE, ASYNCHRONOUS PUBLIC WEB-BASED FORUM FOR FACILITATING REFLECTIVE DISCOURSE WITH PRESERVICE SCIENCE TEACHERS</field><field name="creator">BODZIN, ALEC MICHAEL</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;BODZIN, ALEC MICHAEL. Purposeful Use of a Non-Restrictive, Asynchronous Public Web-Based Forum for Facilitating Reflective Discourse with Preservice Science Teachers. (Under the direction of John C. Park.) The purpose of this research has been to investigate the purposeful use of asynchronous telecommunications in a science education methods/curriculum course involving the use of a non-restrictive, public Web-based forum for facilitating reflective discourse with preservice science teachers. Thirty-two preservice secondary school science teachers participated in a public science teaching forum on the World Wide Web during their student teaching internship. The forum was designed with NetForum software to be a place where science teachers share ideas, reflections and conversations on teaching and implementation of technology in the classroom and other instructional pedagogy, while also providing support for each other as members of an electronic professional community. A combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods were used to explore interaction patterns that facilitated collaborative preservice teacher reflective discourse on the forum and participants? attitudes towards using asynchronous telecommunications during their student teaching internship. Data from forum discourse analysis, interviews, and survey instruments illustrate that the use of this asynchronous Web-based forum provided the participants the opportunity to discuss and examine science concepts and reflect on classroom issues that were directly relevant to their student teaching experiences. The findings revealed that most participants had positive attitudes with respect to interacting with the Web-based forum. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in attitude between participants who had access to a networked computer and those who did not have access. An analysis of the forum postings showed that saturation in the discourse can occur with large groups participating in online asynchronous conversations. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Science Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990223-160957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IMPROVED BATCHING FORCONFIDENCE INTERVAL CONSTRUCTION IN STEADY-STATESIMULATION</field><field name="creator">Steiger, Natalie Miller</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The primary objectives of this research are formulation and evaluation of an improved batch-means procedure for steady-state simulation output analysis. The new procedure yields a confidence interval for a steady-state expected response that is centered on the sample mean of a portion of the series ofsimulation-generated responses and satisfies a user-specified absolute or relative precision requirement. We concentrate on the method of nonoverlapping batch means (NOBM), which requires the sample means computed from adjacent batches of observations to be independent and identically distributed normal random variables. For increasing batch sizes and a fixed number of batches computed from a weakly dependent (phi-mixing) output process, we establish key asymptotic distributional properties of the vector of batch means and of the numerator and squared denominator of the NOBM -ratio, where the terms of the expansion are estimated via an autoregressive--moving average time series model of the batch means. An extensive experimental performance evaluation demonstrates the advantages of ASAP versus other widely used batch-means procedures.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990309-194434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">COMPUTING CALL BLOCKING PROBABILITIES IN WAVELENGTH ROUTING NETWORKS</field><field name="creator">Zhu, Yuhong</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;We study a class of circuit switched wavelength routing networks with fixed or alternate routing, with or without converts, and with various wavelength allocation policies.We first construct an exact Markov process and an approximate Markovprocess which has a closed-form solution for a single path. We alsodevelop an iterative decomposition algorithm to analyze long paths with orwithout wavelength converters effectively. Based on this algorithm, we thenpresent an iterative path decomposition algorithm to evaluate the blocking performance of mesh topology networks with fixed and alternate routing accurately and efficiently.The decomposition approach can naturally capture the correlation of both link loads and link blocking events, giving accurate results for a wide range of loads and network topologies.Our model also allows non-uniform traffic, i.e., call request arrival rates that can vary with the source-destination pair, and it can be used when the location of converters is fixed but arbitrary.Our algorithm represents a simple and computationally efficient solution to the difficult problem of computing call blocking probabilities in wavelength routing networks. Finally we show through numericaland simulation results that the blocking probabilities for the randomwavelength allocation and the circuit-switched case provide upper and lowerbounds on the blocking probabilities for two wavelength allocation policiesthat are most likely to be use in practice, namely most-used and first-fitallocation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using these two policieshas an effect on call blocking probabilities that is equivalent toemploying converters at a number of nodes in the network.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990322-203342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial Knowledge Acquired Through Navigation in a Large-Scale Virtual Environment</field><field name="creator">Barlow, Steven Todd</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The effects of changes in elevation, route distance, route complexity, and non-spatial information on memory for a virtual environment were investigated.

In this research, a simulated forest stand consists of x and y coordinates ofstems and their attributes. One-acre stem maps are mapped stem locations and attributes from thefield. The simulation procedure is a two step process. The first step is to create discrete samplesfrom a one-acre stem map. Secondly, the discrete samples are selected randomly withreplacement and placed adjacently until a simulated forest stand of desired size and shape is built. The simulated forest stands are then compared with the one-acre stem map from which they werecreated by their respective average clump size, spatial point pattern, and spatial variability of stemdiameter. Average clump size is estimated using stem counts from grids of contiguous quadrats(Greig-Smith, 1952). Spatial point pattern is classified based on the mean and variance of first,second, third, and fourth nearest neighbor distances (Smith, 1977). The spatial variability of stemdiameter is assessed using the robust semi-variogram estimator (Cressie et al., 1980) The abilityof the simulation procedure to reproduce the above mentioned spatial characteristics is related tothe second order stationarity of stem diameter in the one-acre stem map. In this case, secondorder stationarity is the premise that the mean stem diameter is constant in the one-acre stem mapand the variance is only dependant on stem separation distance. Stem locations, the speciespercentages, and the coefficient of variation of stem diameter should be assessed to determine theapplicability of this simulation procedure for a particular one-acre stem map. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990323-181716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MEASUREING VISUAL SEARCH REACTION TIME AND ACCURACY FOR A PRODUCT LABELWARNING AS A FUNCTION OF ICON, COLOR, COLUMN, AND VERTICAL PLACEMENT</field><field name="creator">Swindell, Julie Ann</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;MEASUREING VISUAL SEARCH REACTION TIME AND ACCURACY FOR A PRODUCT LABELWARNING AS A FUNCTION OF ICON, COLOR, COLUMN, AND VERTICAL PLACEMENT&lt;p&gt;SWINDELL, JULIE ANN &lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;br&gt; There is a large body of work written on how to design effectivewarnings. Within an information-processing perspective, before a warning can be heeded it must be noticed,read, understood, retained, retrieved at the appropriate time, and acted upon. If a warning is not noticed (thefirst step in the process), the linear sequence is broken and compliance behavior is much less likely to result.This study examined factors that might facilitate the noticeability of a warning in a simulated product label. Thefactors examined were icon, signal word color and placement. The experiment examined a 5 icon x 3 color x 2column x 3 placement design. Participants were to decide which of two warnings was present in a given labeland reaction time was measured. Afterwards, participants were asked to order the 16 label conditions fromthe most- to least-noticeable warnings. The results showed icon/signal word pairs presented in red or bluewere found significantly faster than those presented in black although red was not significantly greater thanblue. All icon conditions showed significantly faster reaction times than when the icon was absent, althoughthere were differences found between the icon conditions. Warnings in the left column were found significantlyfaster than those in the right column. Those warnings located at the top of the column were significantly fasterthan those located in the middle or at the bottom of a column, although no significant difference was foundbetween the latter two locations. The addition of color or icon overrode any effects of column or placement.The results of this study suggest that minor changes to a fairly extensive warning label such as the addition of anicon or color, could greatly improve warning noticeability. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990331-084420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Peer Response Groups Using Electronic and Traditional Communications: A Portraiture of a Class</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Alecia Youngblood</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACTJACKSON, ALECIA YOUNGBLOOD. Peer Response Groups Using Electronic and Traditional Communications: A Portraiture of a Class. (Under the direction of Dr. Carol A. Pope.) This participatory action research project was a qualitative inquiry into the contextual variables that influence peer response groups using electronic and traditional communications. The research participants, students of the teacher/researcher, were twenty-two university freshmen enrolled in two sections of a reading and writing course required for students with low verbal SAT scores. Students wrote five autobiographical stories in the narrative genre. For the first two writings, students paired with the same peer from their class for the face-to-face conferences. For the third writing assignment, students had both in-class conferences with the same peer in addition to an e-mail conference with a peer from the other class. Students used e-mail only to communicate with both partners about writing assignments four and five. Data collection took place throughout the fifteen weeks of the semester and consisted of participant observations, document analysis of students' reaction journals, document analysis of students? first and second drafts of writing (with peer comments), and individual interviews. Findings are presented as a portraiture of the collective classes and a portraiture of a peer response triad. The main theme that emerged from the findings is "acts of negotiation and balance." In general, students depended on the established social relationships with their in-class partners when making revision decisions. Students acknowledged that e-mail exchanges about writing were convenient and widened their audience, but they did not work to establish a relationship with their e-mail partners. Most students valued the complementary aspects of using the two different modes of communication for feedback about their writing. However, preference for mode of communication was secondary to their peers' possessing qualities of honesty, trustworthiness, and sensitivity. How peers achieved this rapport within their relationships was idiosynchratic to each response group. This study concluded that individual student attitudes, values, and expectations influence and are influenced by multiple contextual variables in the writing classroom (i.e., physical context, social context, mode of communication, the peer response group, and time). A model of reciprocity is proposed to illuminate the complex dynamics within peer response groups. Future research on peer response groups should include more systematic inquiry into contextual forces that contribute to the success or collapse of peer response groups. Teachers should work to understand the inevitable interchanges between individual students and class context in order to assist their students as they grow and develop as readers and writers in peer response groups. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Curriculum and Instruction</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990331-144521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secure Computer Applications in an Enterprise Environment</field><field name="creator">Lowman, Tim</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Sophisticated computing environments support many of the complex tasks whicharise in modern enterprises.

We focus onauthenticating users (Kerberos), establishing a secure communicationlink for private data exchange (SSL), protected space to store shareddata (AFS filesystem), and an enhanced server (Apache) to integrate thesecomponents. After presenting our secure model, we describe a prototypeapplication, built using our approach, which addresses a common problemof secure online submission of homework assignments in a universityenvironment.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990401-134848</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wildlife on Private Land: Contracting over Wildlife-Inflicted Property Damage and Abatement</field><field name="creator">Yoder, Jonathan Keith</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;In its search for sustenance and cover, wildlife imposes costs on agricultural property owners. A mosaic of privateand public contractual arrangements has evolved to address this problem, with private agricultural organizations,county commissions, wildlife agencies and state and federal departments of agriculture all involved. A set ofprevalent contractual arrangements over wildlife damage is formally examined in this dissertation, includingabatement labor sharing, abatement cost sharing, and damage sharing contracts. Wildlife is modeled as a publicand potentially common-property good that is affected by and destructive to private agricultural inputs.Independent production choices that affect the wildlife stock may impose externalities on neighboring landownersor other interested parties. Contracts develop to account for these externalities, and contract structure isdependent on the costs associated with potential contract mechanisms. A fundamental problem of contractingover wildlife damage is that abatement labor effort is difficult to monitor by participants. Contract structures reflectthis difficulty. Two of the theoretical models form the basis for empirical examinations. First, livestock producersin many western states maintain cost-share programs for predator control. A contract value function is developedfor a prevalent cost-sharing rule, and the model is used to explain the observed structure and incidence of theseprograms across counties and states. Second, landowner incentives to alter crop choice in the face ofdeer-inflicted crop damage are examined. A multicrop econometric model allowing for differential damage ratesacross crops is estimated using data from Wisconsin. The model provides implications about the effects ofchanges in certain wildlife agency policy instruments. This dissertation expands the existing economic literature onwildlife damage, as well as the literature on joint production of private and public goods, the economics of pestand wildlife management, and the empirical literature on contracting over common-property and public goods.Private landowners provide much of the land on which wildlife resides, and their incentives are important in thecalculus of wildlife management. This dissertation hopefully will provide a framework useful to wildlife managersfor understanding the impacts on and the reactions of private landowners to wildlife damage policy. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990406-105401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seasonal occurrence and epidemiology of tomato spotted wilt virus and Frankliniella fusca (Hinds) (Thysanoptera: Thiripidae) with emphasis on 3 peanut genotypes in North Carolina</field><field name="creator">Garcia, Lloyd Edward</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the research has been to further the understanding of the seasonal occurrence of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) and the insect vector, Frankliniella fusca, in relation to North Carolina peanut production. Emphasis was placed on 3 Virginia-type peanut genotypes, NC-9, NC-V11, and NC-12C, which were included in field and greenhouse experiments to determine relative disease and thrips levels and their interactions. These are components of a larger strategic goal to develop management strategies that can minimize future impacts of TSWV and be compatible with peanut production in North Carolina. Research was conducted to determine the winter, spring, and summer occurrence of F. fusca in NC peanut fields. Thrips movement in spring was significantly influenced by prevailing wind direction. No thrips were collected on sticky traps during days when maximum temperature did not exceed 18.7 C. F. fusca, caged with TSWV infected peanut plants in August, 1996 and sampled in March, 1997, were analyzed for the presence of TSWV by ELISA. A single thrips tested positive for the virus. In another experiment, three Virginia-type peanut genotypes were monitored for the incidence of TSWV symptoms and the presence of F. fusca at 3 locations in NC's peanut producing area. Overall disease incidence at the 3 locations was 6%. Of the genotypes, NC-9 ranked the highest in disease incidence (7%), followed by the genotypes NC-12C (6%), and NC-V11 (5%). F. fusca counts were greatest on NC-V11, followed by NC-9 and NC-12C. A comparison of the survival and reproductive success of F. fusca on TSWV infected and uninfected plants of the 3 genotypes was conducted under greenhouse conditions in NC. Effects of genotype and virus by genotype interaction were not significant. However, TSWV infected plants had significantly fewer adult and larval F. fusca than did uninfected plants.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990415-075759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics and Control of Magnetostatic Structures</field><field name="creator">Windsor, Jeffry</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The equations governing the dynamics of magnetostatic structures are formulated using Lagrangian mechanics.

These equations are characterized by mass, stiffness, damping, gyroscopic, and circulatory effects.Four experiments are conducted. Using the one-degree-of-freedom magnetostatic levitator, the measured static displacement is compared to those predicted by the exact nonlinear solution and the discretized approximate solution.Three experiments are performed with the two-degree-of-freedom, spherical, magnetostatic pendulum: The natural frequencies of the pendulum are predicted and compared with measurements; the pendulum is made to track a desired path using electromagnets to control the motion; and the pendulum?s oscillations about new equilibrium points are regulated using electromagnets and velocity feedback to control settling time.

A Compton Camera for Spectroscopic Imaging from 100keV to 1MeV (Under the direction of Robin Gardner and Thomas Prettyman).&lt;p&gt;Compton cameras are a particularly interesting gamma-ray imaging technology because they have a large field of view and rely on electronic rather than mechanical collimation (lead). These systems produce two dimensional, spectroscopic images using data collected from spatially separated detector arrays. A single acquisition contains data to produce image signatures for each radionuclide in the field of view. Application of Compton cameras in field of astrophysics has proven the systems capability for imaging in the 1 to 30MeV range. Other potential applications, in the 100keV to 1MeV range, include nuclear material safeguards and nuclear medicine imaging. A particularly attractive feature for these applications is that the technology to produce a portable camera is now available due to improvements in solid state room-temperature detectors. &lt;p&gt;The objective of this work is to investigate Compton camera technology for spectroscopic imaging of gamma rays in the 100keV to 1MeV range. To this end, accurate and efficient camera simulation capability will allow a variety of design issues to be explored before a full camera system is built. An efficient, specific purpose Monte Carlo code was developed to investigate the image formation process in Compton cameras. The code is based on a pathway sampling technique with extensive use of variance reduction techniques. In particular, the technique of forcing is used make each history result in a partial success. The code includes detailed Compton scattering physics, including incoherent scattering functions, Doppler broadening, and multiple scattering. Detector response functions are also included in the simulations.&lt;p&gt;A prototype camera was built to provide code benchmarks and investigate implementation issues. The prototype is based on a two-detector system, which sacrifices detection efficiency for simplicity and versatility. One of the detectors is mounted on a computer controlled stage capable of two dimensional motion (14x14cm full range with &#177;0.1mm precision). This produces a temporally encoded image via motion of the detector.&lt;p&gt;Experiments were performed with two different camera configurations for a scene containing a 75Se source and a 137Cs source. These sources provided a challenging test of the spectroscopic imaging capability of the Compton camera concept. The first camera was based on a fixed silicon detector in the front plane and a CdZnTe detector mounted in the stage. The second camera configuration was based on two CdZnTe detectors. Both systems were able to reconstruct images of 75Se, using the 265keV line, and 137Cs, using the 662keV line. Only the silicon-CdZnTe camera was able to resolve the low intensity 400keV line of 75Se. Neither camera was able to reconstruct the 75Se source location using the 136keV line. The camera has a low energy limit imposed by the noise level on the front plane detector's timing signal. The timing performance of the coplanar grid CdZnTe detector design was improved, resulting in a reduction in the full width half maximum of the coincidence timing peak between two detectors from 800ns to 30ns.&lt;p&gt;The energy resolution of the silicon-CdZnTe camera system was 4% at 662keV. This camera reproduced the location of the 137Cs source by event circle image reconstruction with angular resolutions of 10&#176; for a source on the camera axis and 14&#176; for a source 30&#176; off axis. The source to camera distance was approximately 1m. Typical detector pair efficiencies were measured as 3x10-11 at 662keV.&lt;p&gt;The dual CdZnTe camera had an energy resolution of 3.2% at 662keV. This camera reproduced the location of the 137Cs source by event circle image reconstruction with angular resolutions of 8&#176; for a source on the camera axis and 12&#176; for a source 20&#176; off axis. The source to camera distance was 1.7m. Typical detector pair efficiencies were measured as 7x10-11 at 662keV.&lt;p&gt;Of the two prototype camera configurations tested, the silicon-CdZnTe configuration had superior imaging characteristics. This configuration is less sensitive to effects caused by source decay cascades and random coincident events. An implementation of the expectation maximum-maximum likelihood reconstruction technique improved the angular resolution to 6&#176; and reduced the background in all the images.&lt;p&gt;The measured counting rates were a factor of two low for the silicon-CdZnTe camera, and up to a factor of four high for the dual CdZnTe camera compared to simulation. These differences are greater than the error bars. The primary reasons for these discrepancies are related to experimental conditions imposed by source decay cascades and the occurrence of random coincidences which are not modeled by the code.&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990507-170013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Content Features of Consumer-Catalog Websites</field><field name="creator">Helo, Julia Esperanza</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Internet has undergone a tremendous evolution during the past five years. Since 1995, consumer-catalog websites have not only come into being, but have become important business and consumer tools. Despite the upsurge and importance of these websites, it is difficult to find freely available tools that help website developers make important decisions regarding the content of these websites.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; In this pilot study, I analyze a small sample of websites to compare the features of high-ranked and low-ranked consumer-catalog websites. The purpose of this research is twofold: to determine whether it is possible to pinpoint which features are exhibited by high-ranked and low-ranked websites and to present a tool that could simplify making decisions about certain content-related features.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; I found that there are, indeed, differences between the content-related features of high-ranked and low-ranked websites. Some features are found more often in high-ranked websites than in low-ranked websites: longer, reader-based product descriptions; humor; certain types of company-related information (investor, staff, and employment information); consistent page design; consistent navigational patterns; sound; specific types of peripheral documents; alternate-language formats; sales incentives (discounts, bestsellers, advertising space, affiliate programs, and gift certificates). Following is a list of the features that are found more often in low-ranked websites than in high-ranked websites: product descriptions that are brief and jargon-laden; inconsistent page design; splash screens; inconsistent navigational patterns; fewer instances of peripheral documents and alternate-language formats than high-ranked sites; and fewer instances of sales incentives than high-ranked sites (discounts, bestsellers, and free product giveaways). I also found that it likely would be possible to develop the sort of tool described above. Implications for further research are also discussed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Technical Communication</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990512-232613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family-based methods which rely on association for the mapping of genes in human populations</field><field name="creator">Monks, Stephanie Ann</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Family-based tests, that employ association between alleles at a marker locus and a trait locus, have proven useful for the localization of genes in human genomes. Many existing tests have been derived as extensions of the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT), which was originally introduced as a test of linkage in the presence of association for a susceptibility locus. One of these tests, the sib-TDT or S-TDT, makes use of genetic information from sibships containing at least one diseased and nondiseased child and is defined for a biallelic marker. We propose an extension of the S-TDT to a multiallelic marker and provide evidence that the chi-square distribution can be used to measure statistical signicance. The test is compared to three contemporary extensions for a multiallelic marker. We also present a test for a multiallelic marker that combines data from families with and without parental genetic information. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Next, tests of linkage and association are developed for a quantitative trait that utilize families, without restrictions on the number of children per family that can be used in the analysis. Tests are introduced that can be used on family data with parent and child genotypes, only child genotypes, or a combination of these types of families. Equations are derived that allow one to determine the sample size needed to achieve desired power. Through simulation, we demonstrate that existing tests have an elevated false-positive rate, when the size restrictions are not followed, and that a good deal of information is lost by adhering to the size restrictions. Permutation procedures are introduced that are recommended for small samples, but can also be used for extensions of the tests to multiallelic markers and to the simultaneous use of more than one marker. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Finally, resampling procedures for existing tests are explored. The resampling procedures reduce families to contain the number of children allowable for a valid test of linkage and association. We show that our tests are equivalent to the use of within cluster resampling for the existing tests, but that differences exist when resampling is performed on the basis of phenotypically extreme individuals.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990514-095310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MODELING AND ANALYSIS OF NOX EMISSION TRADING TO ACHIEVE OZONE STANDARDS</field><field name="creator">Gillon, Dana Lee</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Emission trading programs are incentive-based policy instruments implemented to achieve environmental targets cost-effectively. In these programs, also known as transferable discharge permit (TDP), emission-reduction trading, and cap and trade programs, participants are required to meet established emission reductions goals through control measures or by acquiring TDPs from sources in the market that over-control. TDP programs encourage development and application of innovative control technologies and allow pollution sources more flexibility in complying with regulations. One potential drawback to a market-driven policy such as TDP is that the geographical distribution of emissions resulting from trades could locally degrade air quality if the market is not designed properly. Since such an outcome is generally undesirable, the ability for regulators to predict environmental impacts of trading prior to implementation is very important. The goal of this thesis is to present a general framework for using mathematical optimization to model and analyze different market design features for TDP programs including the potential use of trading restrictions to control the geographic distribution of permits. This framework will provide regulators with a way to identify effective market designs and implement more robust and reliable TDP programs. An important component of this framework is the use of Modeling to Generate Alternatives (MGA) to identify the range of trading outcomes that may occur in response to a TDP program.A case study using this framework was conducted for NOx emission trading in the Charlotte, North Carolina region. The study analyzed alternative trading outcomes generated using MGA, investigated limitations on source size and type in the trading program, and tested the use of zoning restrictions as a way to control the geographical distribution of permits. Trading outcomes were evaluated with respect to cost, air quality, robustness, and reliability. Results found that TDPs could be used to meet both emission limits of NOx and an ambient standard for ozone with all or a limited number of sources trading. Additionally, trading restrictions in the form of geographic zones were not particularly good at reducing local air quality impacts in the Charlotte region, although this result is believed to be (in part) attributable to the limited size of the trading region.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990514-111649</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Light-Cone Quark Model Analysis ofPseudoscalar and Vector Mesons for Radially Excited States</field><field name="creator">Arndt, Daniel</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;We present a relativistic constituent quark model to analyze the mass spectrum and hadronic properties of radially excited u and d quark sector mesons.Using a simple Gaussian function as a trial wave function for the variational principle togetherwith a QCD motivated Hamiltonian, including not only the Coulomb and confiningpotential but also a relativistic corrected hyperfine interaction term, we obtain the mass spectrum consistent with the experimental data.

Emission inventories are used for various policy-making purposes, such as characterization of temporal emission trends, emissions budgeting for regulatory and compliance purposes, and the prediction of ambient pollutant concentration using air quality models. Failure to account for variability and uncertainty in emission inventories may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding source apportionment, compliance with emission standards, emission trends, and the impact of emissions on air quality. Variability is the heterogeneity of values of a quantity with respect to time, space, or across a population while uncertainty arises due to lack of knowledge about the true value of a quantity. The sources of variability and uncertainty are distinct and hence variability and uncertainty affect policy- making in different ways. For example, variability in emissions arises from differences in operating conditions among different power plants. Uncertainty arises due to measurement errors, systematic errors, and random sampling errors. It is possible to reduce uncertainty by taking more accurate and precise measurements (i.e. reducing measurement error) or by taking a larger number of measurements (i.e. random sampling error). However, it is not possible to reduce variability. Therefore, in this research variability and uncertainty are treated separately. A methodology for simultaneous characterization of variability and uncertainty in emission and activity factors and their propagation through an emission inventory model is described. Variability was characterized using probability distributions developed on the basis of data analysis. The uncertainty due to random sampling error was characterized using parametric bootstrap simulation. A methodology for the quantification of variability and uncertainty in censored data sets containing below detection limit values was developed. This methodology is demonstrated for three case studies. In Case Study 1, the variability and uncertainty in the activity and emission factors for NO x emissions from selected coal-fired power plant systems was quantified based on data obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. An illustrative partial probabilistic NO x emission inventory was developed for the state of North Carolina. In Case Study 2, the variability and uncertainty in the total short-term average emissions and in annual emissions of nine hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from a power plant was quantified by propagating the probability distributions for coal concentrations, boiler partitioning factors, and fabric filter partitioning factors through an emissions model. In Case Study 3, the effect of various levels of censoring on the variability and uncertainty in CO and HC emission factor data sets for diesel transit buses was studied. The main findings regarding the methodology demonstrated in this research include: (1) uncertainty due to random sampling error is substantial and in many cases was found to be of the same order of magnitude as the variability in the data set; and (2) the methodology developed for quantifying the variability and uncertainty in censored data sets is reasonably robust and accurate. The main insights obtained from the application of the methodology include: (1) the uncertainty in the total NO x emissions from selected power plants in North Carolina is &#177; 25 percent around the nominal value; (2) the uncertainty in the short-term average emissions of all HAPs from a power plant is substantially high in the upper percentiles (e.g., the width of the 95 percent confidence interval on the 95th percentile is 385 lb) than in the lower percentiles (e.g., the width of the 95 percent confidence interval on the median value is 60 lb) ; (3) the range of uncertainty in the annual average emissions is much wider than the range of variability in annual average emissions from one year to another; and (4) the uncertainty in the median value of censored CO and HC emission factor data sets increases as the level of censoring increases.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990520-122639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CHARACTERIZATION OF THE BORON DOPING PROCESSUSING BORON NITRIDE SOLID SOURCE DIFFUSION</field><field name="creator">Castro, Susana Patricia</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;CASTRO, SUSANA PATRICIA.

Remote sensing technology were employed to collect exhaust emissions data. Traffic parameters were collected using an area-wide traffic detector, MOBILIZER. During the measurements, license plates were also recorded to obtain information on vehicle parameters. Data were collected at two sites, having different road grades and site geometries, over 10 days of field work at the Research Triangle area of North Carolina. A total of 11,830 triggered measurement attempts were recorded. After post-processing, 7,056 emissions were kept in the data base as valid measurements. After combining with the traffic and license vehicle parameters, a data base has been developed. Exploratory analysis has been conducted to find variables that are important to explain the variability of the emission estimates. Statistical methods were used to compare the mean of the emissions estimates for different sub-populations. For example, multi-comparison analysis has been conducted to compare the mean emissions estimates from vehicles having different model years. This analysis showed that the mean emissions from older vehicles were statistically different than the mean emissions estimates from the recent model year vehicles.One of the contributions of the research was developing an empirical traffic-based emission estimation model. For this purpose, data collected during the study were used to develop a novel model which combines the Hierarchical Tree-Based Regression method and Ordinary Least Squares regression. The key findings from this research include: (1) the measured mean CO emission estimate for Research Triangle park area of North Carolina is estimated as 340 grams/gallon, whereas the mean HC emissions estimate is found to be as 47 grams/gallon (2) inter-vehicle variability in vehicle emissions can be as high as two orders-of-magnitude; (3) intra-vehicle variability is lower compared to the inter-vehicle variability; (4) some vehicle variables such as vehicle model year and vehicle type are important factors in explaining the inter-vehicle variability in emissions estimates; (5) emission estimation model developed in this research can be applied to estimate the emissions from on-road vehicles. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990527-104246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">(+)-Desoxoprosopinine: A Model for the Total Asymmetric Synthesis of Prosopis Alkaloids</field><field name="creator">Sandelier, Matthew J.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;This work develops a general synthesis of the Prosopis africana alkaloids, using a chiral auxiliary-mediated process.

Although findings from this study are not valid for any specific city, they are intended to provide decision-makers with a template upon which to base future case studies. The air emissions tracked in this study include carbon dioxide from fossil and biomass sources (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and sulfur oxides (SOx). The research was conducted in two parts. First, the maximum potential tons avoided and marginal avoidance cost resulting from expanding recycling programs for two settings, an urban and a rural area, are compared to emission control costs at a hypothetical coal-fired power plant. Second, the marginal damage associated with each recycling program expansion was calculated using published marginal damage functions. The study's findings indicate that although solid waste management (SWM) strategy upgrades are not as cost effective as additional coal-fired power plant controls for reducing the specified pollutants, marginal benefits are incurred by upgrading most SWM strategies to include drop-off recycling of waste material because its collection costs are relatively low.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990628-100619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power Analysis and Instruction Scheduling for Reduced di/dt in the Execution Core of High-Performance Microprocessors</field><field name="creator">Toburen, Mark C</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Power dissipation is becoming a first-order design issue in high-performance microprocessors as clock speeds and transistor densitiescontinue to increase.

Inthe presence of heavily weighted regions of code, these currentspikes can cause increases in the processor's average peakpower dissipation. However, if the compiler produces largeenough regions, a certain amount of schedule slack should exist,providing opportunities for scheduling optimizations based onper-cycle energy constraints.This thesis proposes a novel approach to instruction schedulingbased on the concept of schedule slack, which builds energyefficient schedules by limiting the energy dissipated in asingle cycle. In this manner, a more uniform di/dt curve isgenerated resulting in a decrease in the execution core's averagepeak power dissipation. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990628-171119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Statistical Analysis of Long-Range Dependent Processes via a Stochastic Intensity Approach, with Applications in Networking</field><field name="creator">Tan, Phaik-Hoon</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a flexible stochastic intensity-function model for traffic arrivals arising in an Ethernet local area network. To test some well-known Bellcore datasets for long-rangedependence or nonstationarity, a battery of statistical tests was applied---including a new extensionof the classical Priestley-Rao test for nonstationarity; and the results of this analysis revealedpronounced nonstationarity in all of the Bellcore datasets. To model such teletraffic arrivalprocesses accurately, a stochastic intensity function was formulated as a nonlinear extension of theCox regression model that incorporates a general time trend together with cyclic effects andpacket-size effects. The proposed intensity-function model has anexponential-polynomial-trigonometric form that includes a covariate representing the latest packet size. Maximum likelihoodestimates of the unknown continuous parameters of the stochastic intensity function areobtained numerically, and the degrees of the polynomial time and packet-size components aredetermined by a likelihood ratio test. Although this approach yielded excellent fits to the Bellcoredatasets, it also yielded the surprising conclusion that packet size has a negligible effect on thepacket arrival rate. A follow-up analysis of the packet-size process confirmed this conclusion andshed additional light on the packet-generation mechanism in Ethernet local area networks. This research also includes the development of procedures for simulating traffic processes having a stochastic intensity function of the proposed form. An extensive Monte Carlo performanceevaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed procedure for modeling and simulation ofteletraffic arrival processes.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990706-145610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Specifying and Verifying Compliance in Commitment Protocols</field><field name="creator">Venkatraman, Mahadevan</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Interaction protocols are specific, often standard, constraints on thebehaviors of autonomous agents in a multiagent system.

Strategic Change for NATO: Incremental ResponseFrom an Organizational Perspective. (Under the direction of Dr. Roland Stephen) In his article on thepersistence of NATO after the Cold War, Robert McCalla frames the following question: How do alliancesrespond to changing strategic circumstances? The focus of this project is to explore McCalla's question froman organizational perspective. The thesis details the following chain of logic: NATO is an institution thatpossesses bureaucratic characteristics and these characteristics can be understood through theories oforganizations. Specifically, the manner in which NATO is evolving is consistent with the descriptive theory ofincrementalism. Political-military policy formation that provides the substance to the debate over NATO'sfuture is described in terms of an incrementalist model to demonstrate that change to the structure and role ofNATO will take place under predicable circumstances. Policy makers within the organizational andinstitutional regime of NATO continue to adapt to new missions that are congruent with patternedexpectations. The predominant finding is that NATO shows evidence of change under the mechanism ofincrementalism. This mechanism will remain a valid model for future determinations of NATO's persistence&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990727-103613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Examination of Association Based Tests for Localizing Genes in Outbred Populations</field><field name="creator">Nielsen, Dahlia</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Association based tests are designed to capitalize on evolutionaryforces and population history in order to localize genes affecting thetraits of interest to within very small regions. In the case-controltest, a sample of affected individuals (the cases) and a matched setof unaffected individuals (the controls) are collected, and markerallele frequency differences between the two groups are compared. Ifa significant difference between allele frequencies is found, it isdetermined that there is an association between the marker and adisease susceptibility locus. One shortcoming of this test is that ifthe cases and controls are not well matched, or if the controls arechosen from different subpopulations than the cases, spuriousassociations may be detected within the samples which do not reflectactual population values. Additionally, it is possible that genotypeinformation on a set of controls is simply not available. We explorethe relationship between Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium among affectedindividuals at a marker locus and linkage disequilibrium between themarker and a disease susceptibility locus and show that there is aconnection between these disequilibrium measures which may be usefulfor detecting association using affected individuals only. As part ofthis work, we introduce two summary disequilibrium terms, one allelicand one genotypic, which appear as factors in variousassociation-based measures.

Following up on several suggestive equations which led to the summarydisequilibrium terms, we examine the relationship between phenotypeand marker genotypes through the perspective of classical quantitativegenetics. Within this framework, we show that in a randomly matingpopulation there is a simple connection between the additive effectsof a marker locus and the additive effects of an associated traitlocus. An equivalent relationship holds between the dominancedeviations at the marker and the dominance deviations at the traitlocus. These relationships are captured by the summary disequilibriumterms introduced earlier.

Using these results, we characterize the genetic properties that lociaffecting a quantitative trait must express in order for common testsof association to be able to detect them. We examine the case-controltest and the basic form of the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT),and show that by focusing on alleles rather than on genotypes, thesetests are sensitive mainly to additive genetic effects at thesusceptibility loci. We offer several illustrations of theeffectiveness of these tests in detecting association under variousgenetic models.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990731-133658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A STRUCTURED APPROACH FOR CLASSIFYING AND PRIORITIZING PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Harold Vaughn</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;New product development involves making a series of decisions that transform vaguely defined customer needs and desires into a final product. Two important, but often overlooked, product development decisions are (1) the classification of requirements as mandatory or optional, and (2) the prioritization of requirements. This research effort addresses the current lack of theoretically sound and practical methods for classifying and prioritizing product requirements by focusing on three primary objectives. The first objective is to develop a structured approach for classifying and prioritizing product requirements. The second objective is to use the structured approach to gather, analyze, and aggregate stakeholder input. The third objective is to use the structured approach to support both group and individual learning. The first objective was accomplished through the development and demonstration of a structured requirement analysis model (SRAM). SRAM?s development involved integrating methods and concepts from the following knowledge domains: requirement analysis, Multi-Attribute Decision-Making (MADM), market orientation, organizational learning, and cognitive decision theory. The second and third objectives were accomplished through the implementation of SRAM to resolve two diverse case studies. The main case study involved classifying and prioritizing functional requirements for a proposed knowledge?based CAD engineering system. In contrast, the second case study was focused on evaluating alternative vision statements for a consulting group. After successful completion of both case studies, SRAM was formally evaluated by case study participants and a controlled group that did not participate in either case study. Thus, the three primary objectives of this thesis were verified and validated via case study implementation and impartial evaluation.SRAM uses MADM as a solution framework for classifying and prioritizing product requirements. Requirements are evaluated using market orientation based (market priority, risk, customer value, and performance) qualitative (fuzzy linguistic) and quantitative decision criteria. Within this MADM framework, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and entropy weighting are used to derive attribute importance weights and define stakeholder preference structures. Where pairwise comparison inconsistencies are passively corrected using a geometric averaging procedure for constructing supertransitive approximation to binary matrices. Each stakeholder?s requirement classifications and priorities are derived via the hierarchical application of the Technique for Order Preference By Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). While the results for an aggregated group of stakeholders are determined using weighted Borda Scoring and heuristic decision rules.Through the first and second case studies, it was discovered that resolving real-world problems requires understanding both how decision-makers should ideally behave and how they actually behave. Accordingly, quantitative results generated using traditional decision analysis methods were qualitatively analyzed using the essential elements of good decision-making (framing, gathering intelligence, coming to conclusions, and learning from feedback) as a conceptual foundation. The systematic application of structured decision-making was utilized to resolve conflict, develop consensus, define preferences, correct inconsistencies, and highlight critical issues. Emphasis was placed on supporting individual and group learning through structured decision-making. Hence, regardless of the specific outcomes of classification and prioritization decisions, SRAM helps provide users with necessary knowledge and skill to address similar problems in the future. Results from the formal evaluation of SRAM indicate participants from both case studies and a controlled group that did not participate in either case study view SRAM as being effective, practical, valid, and supportive of group and individual learning. In addition, both the second case study and the evaluation process demonstrated SRAM?s ability to be utilized in a variety of applications. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990802-215015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of Atlantic Coastal and Piedmont sources of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) seedlings and their hybrids for growth and cold hardiness</field><field name="creator">Kegley, Angelia Joyce</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Seedlings of 60 loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) families representing four populations, Atlantic Coastal, Piedmont, Coastal x Piedmont, and Piedmont x Coastal were compared for early seedling growth and cold hardiness. The objectives of this study were to examine seedling growth of the four populations in a greenhouse environment and cold hardiness of the four populations in controlled environments (preconditioning) designed to mimic environmental conditions in the Piedmont areas planned for deployment. In addition family differences within each population for seedling growth characteristics (height, root collar diameter, and volume index) and cold hardiness were evaluated. The Atlantic Coastal population was the tallest in average, followed by the Coastal x Piedmont hybrids, the Piedmont x Coastal hybrids, and the Piedmont population. All improved populations were superior in seedling growth to the unimproved Piedmont checklot. The height superiority appears to be related to length of the growing season in the provenance of origin. There was not much distinction between populations for root collar diameter although the improved populations were all superior to the checklot. Differences in volume index were related to family rather than population effects, and differences in height contributed more to volume growth than differences in diameter. Cold injury was not significantly different based on preconditioning treatments, but differences in cold hardiness were related to population and families. Hybrids behaved in a manner similar to the maternal parent. Heritability estimates were moderate for injury assessment, indicating that cold injury is under strong genetic control. Coastal families had the highest narrow sense heritability for injury (h2=0.45) followed by the Piedmont families and Coastal x Piedmont hybrids. Coastal x Piedmont hybrids had the highest heritability for survival followed by the Piedmont families. There was a strong genetic correlation between height and cold hardiness at the population level. The taller trees from Atlantic Coastal population tended to suffer more damage than the shorter trees from Piedmont population. Seven of the top ten families ranked for height were in the bottom 1/3 of families ranked by injury. These tended to be Coastal or Coastal x Piedmont families. Seven of the top twenty families ranked for height fell into the middle 1/3 of families ranked by injury. These tended to be hybrid families, although a few Coastal families were present. Based on these early results, it appears that intraspecific hybridization between the two sources of loblolly pine may provide taller trees similar to Coastal parent and cold hardiness similar to the Piedmont parent. It would appear that there is an advantage to deploy Piedmont x Coastal hybrids on the more adverse (e.g. colder Piedmont, cold area) sites. On the miler sites, deployment of Coastal x Piedmont or hardy Coastal families might be appropriate. There are risks associated with deploying families that are not hardy on these sites. Excessive mortality would cancel out the growth advantage if non-hardy tree genotypes were deployed.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990811-160315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a Decision Support Framework forIntegrated Watershed Water Quality Management and a Generic Genetic Algorithm Based Optimizer</field><field name="creator">Parandekar, Amey V.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;PARANDEKAR, AMEY, VIJAY. Development of a Decision Support Framework for Integrated Watershed Water Quality Management and a Generic Genetic Algorithm Based Optimizer. (Under the direction of Dr. S. Ranji Ranjithan.)The watershed management approach is a framework for addressing water quality problems at a watershed scale in an integrated manner that considers many conflicting issues including cost, environmental impact and equity in evaluating alternative control strategies. This framework enhances the capabilities of current environmental analysis frameworks by the inclusion of additional systems analytic tools such as optimization algorithms that enable efficient search for cost effective control strategies and uncertainty analysis procedures that estimate the reliability in achieving water quality targets. Traditional optimization procedures impose severe restrictions in using complex nonlinear environmental processes within a systematic search. Hence, genetic algorithms (GAs), a class of general, probabilistic, heuristic, global, search procedures, are used. Current implementation of this framework is coupled with US EPA's BASINS software system. A component of the current research is also the development of GA object classes and optimization model classes for generic use. A graphical user interface allows users to formulate mathematical programming problems and solve them using GA methodology. This set of GA object and the user interface classes together comprise the Generic Genetic Algorithm Based Optimizer (GeGAOpt), which is demonstrated through applications in solving interactively several unconstrained as well as constrained function optimization problems.Design of these systems is based on object oriented paradigm and current software engineering practices such as object oriented analysis (OOA) and object oriented design (OOD). The development follows the waterfall model for software development. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is used for the design. The implementation is carried out using the JavaTM programming environment&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990822-032656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Male and female mating strategies as they relate to the spermatheca in Melanoplus bivittatus (Orthoptera: Acrididae).</field><field name="creator">Hinn, Jerald Christopher</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Grasshoppers in the genus Melanoplus are known to transfer accessory reproductive gland proteins during mating, and these have been demonstrated to be incorporated in eggs. In this study, the mating strategies of males and females are explored as they relate to spermatophore transfer as a male-controlled resource. Three trials in which a female was caged with two males demonstrate that heavy males are more successful (a &gt; .042) in initially mating with a female. Females do not appear to discriminate between males over the course of their lifetime, however. Males were shown to mate preferentially with virgin females and with females who have recently oviposited. From histological preparation of the spermathecae from interrupted matings, sperm can be found in all three of the chambers by five hours of mating, but in different forms. Sperm bundles remain intact in the long apical chamber, but are increasingly more degraded over time in the distal chamber. By 8.5 hours, half of the sperm bundles in the distal chamber are completely disassociated, and loose sperm becomes increasingly scarce as time progresses. Melanoplines do not oviposit immediately after mating, delaying an average of 4.7 days from mating to oviposition. This would suggest that a part of a male?s sperm contribution, like the accessory gland proteins, is being used for nourishment. The role of sperm from secondary matings is discussed.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990825-003023</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling the Performance, Emissions, and Costs of Texaco Gasifier-Based Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Systems</field><field name="creator">Akunuri, Naveen</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Akunuri, Naveen Venkata. Modeling the Performance, Emissions, and Costs of Texaco Gasifier-Based Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Systems. (Under the guidance of Dr. H. Christopher Frey)Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) systems are an advanced power generation concept with the flexibility to use coal, heavy oils, petroleum coke, biomass, and waste fuels to produce electric power as a primary product. IGCC systems typically produce sulfur as a byproduct. IGCC systems are characterized by high thermal efficiencies and lower environmental emissions than conventional pulverized coal-fired plants. This study deals with the development and application of new systems models for estimating the performance, emissions, and cost of entrained-flow gasification-based power generation systems, including characterization of uncertainty in the estimates. The study focuses on modeling and assessment of three Texaco gasifier-based systems using ASPEN, a steady-state chemical process simulator. The first model is a coal-fueled IGCC system with a radiant and convective high temperature gas cooling design. The second and third models use a total quench high temperature gas cooling design with one of them using coal as fuel and the other using heavy residual oil as fuel. ASPEN-based performance models were developed for all three cases by substantially modifying a performance model previously developed by the U.S Department of Energy's Federal Energy Technology Center. New models for auxiliary power loads, emissions, and capital, annual, and levelized costs were developed for all three systems. The system models incorporate details regarding key process areas, such as mass and energy balances for the gas turbine and gasifier. The gas turbine process area performance model was calibrated to published data for operation on natural gas and also to data for operation on syngas. Example case studies were done on each of the IGCC system models and the results obtained were compared with each other. The models developed captured the critical interactions between the various process areas of the IGCC systems. The radiant and convective-based system has higher plant thermal efficiency of 39.4 percent, higher total capital cost of $/kW 1732, and higher cost of electricity of 50.88 mills/kWh than the total quench based-system models. The coal-fueled total quench model has lower plant efficiency of 35.0 percent when compared to that of 39.3 percent of the heavy residual oil-fueled total quench-based system model. However, the total capital cost of $/kW 1540 and cost of electricity of 47.67. mills/kWh of the former are higher when compared to those of the latter which are $/kW 1129 and 26.96 mills/kWh respectively. Since the IGCC systems are in the early stages of development, there are inherent uncertainties in the performance and cost parameters. Probabilistic performance models were developed for each of the IGCC systems using a probabilistic modeling capability previously developed for ASPEN. Probabilistic analysis provides a systematic framework for the evaluation of technological risks such as possibility of poor performance, high emissions, and high costs compared to more conventional technologies. The probabilistic analysis techniques were applied to case studies to evaluate and identify the key uncertainties in the inputs of the IGCC system models. The probabilistic analysis indicated that the range of the plant thermal efficiency of the radiant and convective coal-fueled model (38.0 - 39.5 percent) and that of the total quench heavy residual oil-fueled (37.9 - 39.5 percent) is higher than that of the total quench coal-fueled model (33.5 - 35.1 percent). However, the range of cost of electricity of radiant and convective coal-fueled model (45.4 - 55.6 mills/kWh) and that of total quench coal-fueled model (46.5 - 51.9 mills/kWh) are significantly higher than the range of cost of electricity of the total quench heavy residual oil-fueled model (27.0 - 32.2 mills/kWh) The probabilistic analysis reduced the total number of uncertainties from 40 to 16 in the coal-fueled cases and to 12 in the heavy residual oil-fueled case. The uncertainties in costs can be further reduced by providing detailed cost estimates and the need for the same has to be evaluated. The models can be utilized as benchmarks for comparison with more advanced power generation technologies.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990825-134317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF GENETIC ASSOCIATIONS</field><field name="creator">Zaykin, Dmitri V.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Zaykin, Dmitri V. Statistical Analysis of Genetic Associations.Advisor: Bruce S. Weir.There is an increasing need for a statistical treatment of geneticdata prompted by recent advances in molecular genetics and moleculartechnology. Study of associations between genes is one of the mostimportant aspects in applications of population genetics theory andstatistical methodology to genetic data. Developments of these methodsare important for conservation biology, experimental populationgenetics, forensic science, and for mapping human disease genes. Overthe next several years, genotypic data will be collected to attemptlocating positions of multiple genes affecting disease phenotype.Adequate statistical methodology is required to analyze thesedata. Special attention should be paid to multiple testing issuesresulting from searching through many genetic markers and high risk offalse associations. In this research we develop theory and methodsneeded to treat some of these problems. We introduce exact conditionaltests for analyzing associations within and between genes in samplesof multilocus genotypes and efficient algorithms to perform them.These tests are formulated for the general case of multiple alleles atarbitrary numbers of loci and lead to multiple testing adjustmentsbased on the closing testing principle, thus providing strongprotection of the family-wise error rate. We discuss an applicationof the closing method to the testing for Hardy-Weinberg equilibriumand computationally efficient shortcuts arising from methods forcombining p-values that allow to deal with large numbers of loci. Wealso discuss efficient Bayesian tests for heterozygote excess anddeficiency, as a special case of testing for Hardy-Weinbergequilibrium, and the frequentist properties of a p-value type ofquantity resulting from them. We further develop new methods forvalidation of experiments and for combining and adjusting independentand correlated p-values and apply them to simulated as well as toactual gene expression data sets. These methods prove to be especiallyuseful in situations with large numbers of statistical tests, such asin whole-genome screens for associations of genetic markers withdisease phenotypes and in analyzing gene expression data obtained fromDNA microarrays.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990914-043001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EVALUATION OF SHORELINE PLANTINGS FOR WETLAND MITIGATIONAT CODDLE CREEK RESERVOIR IN PIEDMONT NORTH CAROLINA</field><field name="creator">RANDOLPH, HENRY ANTHONY</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACTRANDOLPH, HENRY ANTHONY. Evaluation of Shoreline Plantings for WetlandMitigation at Coddle Creek Reservoir in Piedmont North Carolina. (Under the directionof E. Carlyle Franklin and Douglas J. Frederick.)Wetland mitigation provides a method of compensating for loss of vital wetlandfunctions while allowing unavoidable wetland degradation. Coddle Creek Reservoir,located in northwest Cabarrus County, North Carolina, has been developed as a drinking water reservoir for nearby municipalities experiencing dramatic populationincreases. Approximately 356 acres of shoreline plantings were installed to mitigatewetland losses associated with development of the reservoir. Recently, considerable controversy has developed over mitigation projects and their effectiveness in replacingwetland functions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the mitigation plantings atCoddle Creek Reservoir by comparing them to naturally developed shoreline vegetation at a nearby reservoir. Results will be used for long-range management of vegetation atCoddle Creek as well as future reservoir construction projects.Vegetation, soil, and hydrologic data were collected at Mountain Island Lake to determine natural community development along reservoir shorelines. Natural successionhas created distinct community types progressing from the Mountain Island Lake shorelineupslope along an elevational (moisture) gradient. Project design at Coddle CreekReservoir delineated three specific planting zones to mimic natural community developmentalong a moisture gradient. Results of this study suggest that design and initialestablishment of vegetation zones at Coddle Creek Reservoir closely resemble the naturalzonation of vegetation adjacent to Mountain Island Lake. A narrow fringe of wetlandvegetation occurs along the reservoir shoreline that progresses upslope into a zone of transitional vegetation that blends into the upland zone that dominated prior to reservoirconstruction. This wetland zone is most limited by the amount of wetland soils presentadjacent to the reservoir. The extent of wetland soil conversion is strongly correlated to the slope of the site.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990915-070432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Statistical Analysis and Numerical Simulations of the Intertropoical Convergence Zone during Normal and ENSO Years.</field><field name="creator">Roswintiarti, Orbita</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the research has been to provide a better understanding of the climatology, variability, mechanisms, physical processes, and predictability of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), one of the most prominent and important features of the tropical atmosphere. The effort is focused on six different tasks based on statistical and numerical methods. Analysis of the mean and meridional profile of the global ITCZ suggests that each tropical ocean domain has different structure and latitude preference of convection due to different interactions between the oceans and the atmosphere. Moreover, the power spectrum density analysis shows that regions of the dominant interannual variation of deep convection occur over Indonesia and the central Pacific. With respect to the annual cycle, large variations in convection are mainly over the monsoon and continental regions. At the semiannual time scale, convection is greatest over the Indian subcontinent and Australia. The relationships between sea surface temperature, large-scale atmospheric circulation, and convective activity in tropical oceans are examined in the second study by the regression analysis. The results show that the relationship between sea surface temperature and convection is strongly influenced by the large-scale circulation, particularly in the Indian and western Pacific oceans. However, the relationship between large-scale circulation and convection is less dependent on SST in all the ocean domains. In the third study, the relationship and long-term predictability between sea surface temperature anomalies over the Pacific Ocean during El Nino/La Nina events and convective anomalies over Indonesia are examined using the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) techniques. The results show that the models are potentially useful in predicting convective anomalies over Indonesia during boreal fall and winter months up to six months ahead. On the other hand, the models have lower skills in spring and summer months caused by the reduction of the east-west pressure gradients of the Southern Oscillation and the so-called spring barrier. The numerical simulations presented in the last three studies are performed to study the dynamics and the physics of the ITCZ system. The behavior of the northeast monsoon over the Indian Ocean and Indonesia during a normal and during an El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) year is compared using the Naval Research Laboratory/North Carolina State University (NRL/NCSU) model and the Fifth Generation of the Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (PSU-NCAR MM5). During the active monsoon in 1997, both models generally simulate the mean circulations up to 24 hours, but show rapid decline in the forecasts beyond that when the winds become stronger. In contrast, when the synoptic-scale dynamic forcing was strong during the 1998 ENSO event, the simulated mean flows are in good agreement with the analyses up to 48 hours. It is also found that the rates and distributions of oceanic and land mass rainfall are more realistically simulated by the NRL/NCSU model than by the PSU-NCAR MM5 for these two cases. The model errors can be attributed among others to the inaccuracies in the PBL parameterization and uncertainties in the initial conditions. In the fifth study, the transport of air parcels during the 1997 forest fires in Kalimantan, Indonesia is investigated using simulated wind fields from the PSU-NCAR MM5. The interactions between the synoptic conditions and the regional winds are found to be very important on the long-range mean transport. Drought conditions and the persistence of strong easterly winds caused air masses from east and south Kalimantan to travel a distance of 1500 km in only four days. Finally, in the sixth study the PBL structure simulated from the PSU-NCAR MM5 and its role in the transport of air masses during the Indian Ocean Experiment 99 (INDOEX 99) are examined. Results indicate that during undisturbed conditions, the PBL over the Indian Ocean reaches its maximum height in the night hours and minimum height in the early morning hours. Near the coast, localized low-level circulations are simulated in which the air parcels are trapped. An elevated land plume is also simulated over the ocean.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990919-040718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A STUDY OF DIRECT AND CLOUD-MEDIATED RADIATIVE FORCING OF CLIMATE DUE TO AEROSOLS</field><field name="creator">YU, SHAOCAI</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has reported that in the southeastern US and eastern China, the general greenhouse warming due to anthropogenic gaseous emissions is dominated by the cooling effect of anthropogenic aerosols.

This indicates that the high rate of increase in annual mean minimum temperature in eastern China results in a slightly warming trend of daily temperature, while the high rate of decrease in annual mean maximum temperature and low rate of increase in annual mean minimum temperature lead to the cooling trend of daily temperature in the southeastern US. We found that the warming from the longwave forcing due to both greenhouse gases and aerosols was completely counteracted by the shortwave aerosol forcing in the southeastern US in the past 46 years. A slightly overall warming trend in eastern China is evident; winters have become milder. This finding is explained by hypothesizing that increasing energy usage during the past 44 years has resulted in more coal and biomass burning, thus increasing the emission of absorbing soot and organic aerosols in eastern China. Such emissions, in addition to well-known Asia dust and greenhouse gases, may be responsible for the winter warming trend in eastern China that we have reported here.The sensitivity of aerosol radiative properties to aerosol composition, size distribution, relative humidity (RH) is examined for the following aerosol systems: inorganic and organic ions (Cl-, Br-, NO3-, SO42-, Na+, NH4+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCOO-, CH3COO-, CH3CH2COO-, CH3COCOO-, OOCCOO2-, MSA-1); water-insoluble inorganic and organic compounds (elemental carbon, n-alkanes, SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and other organic compounds). The partial molar refraction method was used to calculate the real part of the refractive index. It was found that the asymmetry factor increased by ~48% with the real part varying from 1.40 to 1.65, and the single scattering albedo decreased by 24% with the imaginary part varying from -0.005 to -0.1. The asymmetry factor increased by 5.4 times with the geometric standard deviation varying from 1.2 to 3.0. The radiation transmission is very sensitive to the change in size distribution; other factors are not as significant.To determine the aerosol direct radiative forcing (ADRF), the aerosol optical depth (AOD) values at the three operational wavelengths (415, 500 and 673 nm) were determined at a regionally representative site, namely, Mt. Gibbs (35.780 N, 82.290 W, elevation 2006 m) in Mt. Mitchell State Park, NC, and a site located in an adjacent valley (Black Mountain, 35.660 N, 82.380 W, elevation 951 m) in the southeastern US. The two sites are separated horizontally by 10 km and vertically by 1 km. It was found that the representative total AOD values at 500 nm at the valley site for highly polluted (HP), marine (M) and continental (C) air masses were 0.68+/-0.33, 0.29+/-0.19 and 0.10+/-0.04, respectively. A search-graph method was used to retrieve the columnar size distribution (number concentration N, effective radius reff and geometric standard deviation sg) from the optical depth observations at three operational wavelengths. The ground albedo, single scattering albedo and imaginary part of the refractive index were calculated using a mathematically unique procedure involving a Mie code and a radiative transfer code in conjunction with the retrieved aerosol size distribution, AOD, and diffuse-direct irradiance ratio. It was found that N, reff and sg were in the ranges of 10 to 1.7x104 cm-3, 0.09 to 0.68 mm and 1.12 to 2.95, respectively. The asymmetry factor and single scattering albedo were in the ranges of 0.63 to 0.75 and 0.74 to 0.97 respectively. The ground albedo for the forested terrain and imaginary part of refractive index were found to be in the ranges of 0.06 to 0.29 and 0.005 to 0.051 respectively. On the basis of these aerosol radiative properties obtained at the research sites and computations using the Column Radiation Model (CRM) of National Center of Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model (CCM3), it was found that the average cloud-free 24-hour ADRF values were -13+/-8, -8+/3, -33+/-16 W m-2 for marine, continental, and polluted air masses, respectively. On the assumption that the fractional coverage of clouds is 0.61, it was estimated that the annual mean ADRF was 7+/-2 W m-2 in the southeastern US.The review with respect to the current knowledge of organic acids shows that aerosol formate and acetate concentrations range from 0.02 to 5.3 nmol/m3 and from 0.03 to 12.4 nmol/m3 respectively, and that between 34% to 77% of formate and between 21% to 66% of acetate are present in the fine fraction of aerosols. It was found that although most (98-99%) of these volatile organic acids were present in the gas phase, their concentrations in the aerosol particles were sufficient to make them a good candidate for cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). It is hypothesized that organic acids are at least one of the primary sources of CCN in the atmosphere due to their ubiquitous presence in the troposphere, especially over the continental forested areas. The results of our measurements at Palmer Station, Antarctica show that the daily average CCN concentrations at 0.3% and 1% supersaturations ranged from 0.3 to 160 cm-3 and from 4 to 168 cm-3, respectively, during the period from 17 January to 26 February, 1994. New evidence for substantial and definitive CCN enhancement near and within cloud has been observed at Mt. Mitchell, North Carolina. The results show that the average monthly CCN concentrations were 460+/-217, 386+/-286, 429+/-228 and 238+/-134 cm-3 for in-cloud, overcast, clear and rainy conditions, respectively. The typical CCN spectra show that there were a lot of small CCN produced and the ion concentrations (especially H+ and SO42-) were very high during the CCN enhancement period. The significantly positive correlation between black carbon (BC) and CCN at 1% supersaturation indicates that a percentage of the BC measured at the site may be in the form of an internal mixture and participated in the formation of CCN. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19990924-062253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technology-Assisted-Reflection: A Study of Pre-service Teacher Education in Middle School Language Arts and Social Studies and Secondary English Education and Social Studies</field><field name="creator">Hsiang, Yung-Lai Michelle</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this quasi-experimental research was to examine a new approach to information delivery and communication within Teacher Education courses.

An area of great change has been electronic scholarly publication. One question this change has brought about is how we can prepare undergraduates as professionals prepared to meet this challenge. To this end, in 1996 I and the Center for Communication in Science, Technology, and Research began a two-year experimental online journal to publish "excellent" undergraduate research: the NCSU Student Researcher. Our goals were to introduce undergraduates from across the NC State campus to the challenges of electronic publication, to reward and enhance their class research by publishing their class papers, to highlight excellent NC State student writing across campus and beyond, and to explore electronic participation and presentation. The "peer" review procedure involved two faculty nominating the paper as "excellent" undergraduate research. We received a great deal of enthusiastic interest and input from many students and faculty, yet ultimately the Researcher received only two submissions. This thesis, the final report for the project, explores factors affecting student and faculty participation. Three different approaches to audience analysis were practiced in designing the journal (Schriver, Dynamics in Document Design, 1997): intuition-driven, classification-driven, and feedback-driven. The design process provides excellent examples of strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, and the superior approach of feedback-driven audience analysis, which was applied via systems analysis (Senge, The Fifth Discipline, 1990). The use of Senge's systems analysis as a form of audience analysis was a crucial contribution to understanding the journal's outcome. This thesis also discusses the dynamic model of scholarly communication uncovered by systems analysis. Rather than a linear process beginning with author and ending with reader, as found in the scholarly literature on scholarly publication, journals and other document series exist within an "interactive communication environment," not as single documents with a relatively distinct beginning and end, but a planned, dynamic series of documents that relies on its audience for input in order to survive. Feedback-driven audience analysis as practiced by systems analysis is particularly appropriate for analyzing audiences for such environments, which include periodicals, listservs, and chatrooms, as well as planned revisions based on audience feedback. Gathering feedback from the audience throughout the course of designing such an environment is critical if the environment depends on that audience for its survival. Systems analysis/feedback-driven audience analysis ultimately pinpointed the source of the Student Researcher's failure. The model of scholarly publication applied in the early design stages, derived by intuition- and classification-driven audience analysis, focused on authors (students) as the source of journal submissions. This conflicted with the mindset of faculty and students, because many conceived of no "disciplinary space" in which undergraduate publication is appropriate ("undergraduates are not authors"). Also, Writing Across the Curriculum initiative at NC State had caused most faculty to rethink what they considered "excellent" undergraduate writing, so publicly nominating a paper as "excellent" at that time was problematic. Systems analysis identified faculty, rather than the students, as the motivators in the publication process and thus the appropriate target for marketing and audience feedback. Because I did not seek systematic faculty and student input throughout the journal design process, I was unaware of the effect of the WAC initiative, and unaware that most faculty did not believe undergraduate publication per se was worth their effort. Because I focused on the students and not the faculty in marketing the journal, I had not invited broad faculty input in the design of the journal, a design that may have departed from the standard scholarly model in order for them to perceive it as appropriate for their students.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Technical Communication</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19991001-154729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of the Press Extraction Method for Plug Substrate Analysis</field><field name="creator">Scoggins, Holly L.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt; The goal of this research was to develop and assess the effectiveness of the press extraction method (PEM) for nutritional analysis of bedding plant plug substrates. Conventional testing methods for soilless substrates are either unsuited for plug production or interpretive standards have not been published for pH, soluble salts, or specific nutrients. With the PEM, the rooting substrate is irrigated to container capacity and after a period of one hour the plug surface is pressed with a finger or thumb to expel the solution. The first series of experiments examined potential variation in pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and extractable nutrients (NO3-N, NH4+-N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, B, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn) associated with differing extraction forces. A press modified from a fruit penetrometer was designed to apply a range of force (similar to what could be exerted manually) to a 35 g sample of soilless substrate. Testing done on a peat-based substrate fertilized with a single fertilizer rate (20N-4.3P-16.6K at 75 mg.L-1 N) and then fertilized with a range of rates (75, 125, and 175 mg.L-1 N). A coir-based substrate was also tested at one rate (125 ppm mg.L-1 N). For all experiments, the range of extraction forces within a fertilizer rate did not affect chemical properties. When testing included a range of fertilizer rates, the method's ability to detect changes in pH and EC was demonstrated. The second study compared the PEM to the saturated media extract (SME) and the 2:1 water : substrate (v/v) suspension method (2:1). The extraction methods were used on plug trays of a peat-based germination mix treated with 20N-4.3P-16.6K at 50, 100, 150, and 200 mg.L-1 N. Sample sizes of 20 and 60 plugs were used to determine if similar results could be obtained with the smaller, less destructive sample size.. Values for pH were similar among the three methods. The PEM method resulted in the highest EC, NH4+-N, NO3--N, K, Ca, and Mg. Testing 20 plugs was sufficient since sample size accounted for little variation in the results. In a second experiment comparing peat- and coir-based substrates, the coir extract pH averaged 1.5 units higher with much higher levels of K and Na regardless of extraction method when compared to the peat. Solution from the peat substrate was higher in NH4+-N, NO3--N, P, Ca, and Mg. Within each substrate, pH, EC, and nutrients tested were similar between the PEM and SME. The similarity between the PEM and SME nutrient analysis in the second experiment suggested existing SME interpretation standards may be used for the PEM but further investigation was needed. The third study was designed to provide the necessary correlations between the methods to allow for development of pH, EC, and nutrient interpretive ranges for actively growing plugs. First, a wide range of bedding plant plugs grown at various commercial greenhouses were collected and the substrate solution extracted with the PEM, SME, and 2:1 methods. This quickly and inexpensively provided the varied population necessary to establish relative comparisons and correlations between the methods when performed on actively growing plugs. A second experiment provided comparisons of the three extraction methods performed on plugs grown at low, medium, and high fertility rates with a variety of bedding plant species; celosia (Celosia argentea L. var. cristata (L.) Kuntze Plumosa Group), impatiens (Impatiens wallerana Hook. f.), marigold (Tagetes erecta L.), petunia (Petunia &#215; hybrida Hort. Vilm.-Andr.), and salvia (Salvia splendens F. Sellow ex Roem.&amp; Schult.) Thirty days after planting (DAP), shoots were harvested and the solution extraction methods were performed on each flat. For both experiments, the PEM EC was consistently higher and the pH equal to or lower than the SME. The pH with the 2:1 method was similar to that for the PEM, however EC was consistently low ith this method due to the dilution effect. Solution NO3--N, P, and K were well-correlated between the PEM and SME. However, between the two experiments, there were anomalous results for most nutrients extracted by the PEM and SME methods. As found in previous studies, Ca and Mg levels were consistently higher in the PEM extracted solution. The pH and EC relationships between the three extraction methods remained consistent throughout the study. As a result, quantitative interpretation ranges for these two analyses were calculated between the PEM and SME. Plug growers can now use the PEM for on-site pH and EC testing and compare their results with the previously published sufficiency ranges for the SME.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19991014-093421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AQUEOUS COLLOIDAL DISPERSIONS WITH GRAFTEDPOLY(ETHYLENE OXIDE) CHAINS: SYNTHESIS, MICROSTRUCTURE,AND RHEOLOGY</field><field name="creator">SHAY, JENNIFER SUSAN</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;SHAY, JENNIFER SUSAN. Aqueous Colloidal Dispersions with GraftedPoly(Ethylene Oxide) Chains: Synthesis, Microstructure, and Rheology. (Underthe direction of Saad A. Khan.)&lt;p&gt;Water-based coatings are an environmentally benign alternative to thesolvent-based systems traditionally used in industry. Water-based systems containcolloidal particles dispersed in an aqueous medium and are typically stabilizedthrough electrostatic means. Widespread acceptance of water-based coatings hasbeen hindered by their low solids content, which leads to slow drying rates andinconsistent quality. This study focuses on developing a model coating systembased upon a novel poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based macromer that can be graftedto the surfaces of the colloidal particles, stabilizing the particles against flocculationand allowing the coating to be processed at a high solids content. The initial phaseof this study involves the synthesis of colloidal polystyrene (PS) latex dispersionssterically stabilized with these PEO-based macromers, and the identification of theeffects of synthesis parameters on molecular and structural properties. Electronmicroscopy reveals the spherical, submicron morphology of the latex particles, andproton nuclear magnetic resonance data confirms a direct correlation between theamount of macromer in the reaction feed and the amount grafted to the PS particles.In the second phase of the research, rheological techniques are used to investigateflow behavior and interparticle interactions for latex dispersions with differentamounts of grafted macromer. Dynamic rheological experiments reveal that, at high macromer concentrations, the PEO surface layer effectively shields theattractive interactions between the core PS particles that lead to flocculation.However, at low macromer concentrations, strong interactions are seen even at lowparticle weight fractions, indicating the presence of a flocculated system. Steadyshear rheological evaluations show that the latex systems possess suitable flowbehavior for coating applications, even at high particle contents. Steady shear data,in conjunction with the Krieger-Dougherty model, confirm that the stabilizing layerthickness decreases as particle concentration increases, indicating a compressiblesystem. In addition, the relationship between the strength of interparticleinteractions and PEO graft density is gauged by a power law model relating theelastic modulus to particle concentration. The third phase of the study examines theeffects of temperature on interparticle interactions and dispersion stability.Dynamic rheological experiments reveal a sol-gel transition as temperature isincreased, with the transition temperature being dependent on the PEO graftdensity. Dynamic light scattering measurements show a change in apparent particlesize at the sol-gel transition. The transition is postulated to be due to the collapseof the PEO chains as temperature is increased (i.e., solvent quality is decreased),which allows the attractive forces between the PS particles to dominate the stericrepulsion provided by the stabilizing layer. The PEO chain collapse is attributed tothe disruption of the structured orientation of the hydrogen-bonded water moleculesthat surround the PEO.&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19991028-144944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heuristic Methods for Gang-Rip Saw Arbor Design and Scheduling</field><field name="creator">AKSAKALLI, VURAL</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;AKSAKALLI, VURAL. Heuristic Methods for Gang-Rip Saw Arbor Design and Scheduling. (Under the direction of Dr. Yahya Fathi).This research considers the problem of designing and scheduling arbors for gang-rip saw systems. Such systems are typically used within the furniture manufacturing industry for processing lumber, where lumber boards are first ripped lengthwise into strips of different widths, and then, cut to the required lengths to be used in manufacturing.A saw with multiple cutting channels is used to perform this operation. This saw has fixed blades at specific positions on a rotating shaft which rips incoming lumber boards into required finished widths. The pattern of cutting channels (i.e., the setting of the blades) along the saw shaft is referred to as an ''arbor''.A typical instance of the problem consists of (1) a set of required finished widths and their corresponding demands, (2) a frequency distribution of lumber boards in the uncut stock, (3) a shaft length, and (4) a blade width. The objective is to design a set of (one or more) arbors and the corresponding quantity of lumber to run through each arbor, such that the total amount of waste generated is minimized while the demand is satisfied.In the research, we focus on solving the problem using only one arbor. First, we discuss the computational complexity of the problem and propose a total enumeration procedure which can be used to solve relatively small instances. Then, we develop algorithms based on heuristic approaches such as local improvement procedures, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. Our computational experiments indicate that a local improvement procedure with two nested loops, performing local search with a different neighborhood structure within each loop, gives very high quality solutions to the problem within very short execution times.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19991102-031914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of Weather-based Modeling for Disease Management of Early Leaf Spot of Peanut and Glume Blotch of Wheat</field><field name="creator">Aris, Virginie Marie</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Weather based models help time fungicide applications to the periods when the diseases are most likely to occur. The first objective of this work was to compare and adapt weather-based advisories developed for the control of Cercospora arachidicola on peanuts for resistant cultivars. It was achieved by comparing the disease progress curves of the 1997-1999 growing seasons in Lewiston NC, to spray schedules simulated by the Virginia Advisory, the Parvin, Smith and Crosby Advisory (PSC), NC Advisory, and AU-Pnuts Advisory and their adaptations for resistance. Field trials were conducted in 1997, 1998 and 1999 to test adaptations for resistant genotypes based on the NC Advisory. In all three years the leaf spot epidemics started late in the season (September). There was no yield difference due to leaf spot control except in 1999 in Lewiston for the susceptible genotypes (NC 7 and NC 11). All the advisories had a tendency to overspray at the beginning of the season, this might be due to a lack of inoculum at this time. The resistant genotype used for the study, GP-NC 343, did not lose any yield due to leaf spot in any of the tests and therefore did not need to be sprayed. The model that had the best fit to the disease progress curve of the susceptible genotypes was the AU-Pnuts 12/4. The AU-Pnuts advisory 7/3, currently used in the Southeastern US, started spraying to early in the season for NC. The Virginia advisories also oversprayed. The NC advisory and the PSC were considered almost equivalent, and the adaptations for the PSC did not differ from the PSC itself.The second objective was to develop a simulation model to predict epidemics of Stagonospora nodorum on winter wheat. The CERES-Wheat model was used to simulated leaf area indexes (LAI) for the wheat plant throughout the season. The disease model developed in this work simulated the spread of spores onto the plant leaves and heads, infection, the latent period and, lesion extension. The model equations were inferred from the literature and were calibrated with disease assessments made on Coker 9904 during the spring of 1998 in Plymouth NC. For 1998 and 1999, disease increase in the lower leaves took place 20 days after the disease increase was simulated by the model both years. The most effective spray timing corresponded to a period when disease was first observed in the lower leaves, no disease was seen on the flag leaf, and simulated onset of disease on the flag leaf had occurred. A sharp simulated disease increase in the flag leaf compartment may be a very good indicator for a spray recommendation. Combining a disease model to an already existing crop growth model facilitated modeling disease progress. Further work will be needed to fully validate both the CERES-wheat and the S. nodorum models in North Carolina Coastal Plains.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19991104-074954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wavelet Transform Adaptive Signal Detection</field><field name="creator">Huang, Wensheng</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Wavelet Transform Adaptive Signal Detection is a signal detection method that uses the Wavelet Transform Adaptive Filter (WTAF). The WTAF is the application of adaptive filtering on the subband signals obtained by wavelet decomposition and reconstruction. The WTAF is an adaptive filtering technique that leads to good convergence and low computational complexity. It can effectively adapt to non-stationary signals, and thus could find practical use for transient signals. Different architectures for implementing the WTAF were proposed and studied in this dissertation. In terms of the type of the wavelet transform being used, we presented the DWT based WTAF and the wavelet tree based WTAF. In terms of the position of the adaptive filter in the signal paths of the system, we presented the Before-Reconstruction WTAF, in which the adaptive filter is placed before the reconstruction filter; and the After-Reconstruction WTAF, in which the adaptive filter is placed after the reconstruction filter. This could also be considered as implementing the adaptive filtering in different domains, with the Before-Reconstruction structure corresponding to adaptive filtering in the scale-domain, and the After-Reconstruction structure corresponding to adaptive filtering in the time-domain. In terms of the type of the error signal used in the WTAF, we presented the output error based WTAF and the subband error based WTAF. In the output error based WTAF, the output error signal is used as input to the LMS algorithm. In the subband error based WTAF, the error signal in each subband is used as input to the LMS algorithm. The algorithms for the WTAF were also generalized in this work. In order to speed up the calculation, we developed the block LMS based WTAF, which modifies the weights of the adaptive filter block-by-block instead of sample-by-sample. Experimental studies were performed to study the performance of different implementation schemes for the WTAF. Simulations were performed on different WTAF algorithms with a sinusoidal input and with a pulse input. The speed and stability properties of each structure were studied experimentally and theoretically. It was found that different WTAF structures had different tradeoffs in terms of stability, performance, computational complexity, and convergence speed. The WTAF algorithms were applied to an online measurement system for fabric compressional behavior and they showed encouraging results. A 3-stage DWT based WTAF and a block WTAF based on a 3-stage DWT was employed to process the noisy force-displacement signal acquired from the online measurement system. The signal-to-noise ratio was greatly increased by applying these WTAFs, which makes a lower sampling rate a possibility. The reduction of the required time for data sampling and processing greatly improves the system speed to meet faster testing requirements. The WTAF algorithm could also be used in other applications requiring fast processing, such as in the real-time applications in communications, measurement, and control.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19991104-151423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Online Characterization of Fabric Comprssional Behavior</field><field name="creator">Huang, Wensheng</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;HUANG, WENSHENG. Online Characterization of Fabric Compressional Behavior. (Under the direction of Tushar K. Ghosh and Winser E. Alexander)Response of a fabric to applied forces normal to its plane is known as fabric compressional behavior. It is one of the important properties that determine fabric performance in many applications. The principle of a system used to measure fabric compressional characteristics, online, is proposed in this paper. A controllable nip formed by a pair of rollers is employed to apply compressional deformation to a moving fabric while the compression force and displacement are continuously recorded. The influence of various system parameters on the sensitivity of the system has been analyzed. By assuming a stepwise anisotropic behavior in the thickness direction, Incremental Differential Algorithm (IDA) is developed to calculate the pressure-displacement relationship from the measured force-displacement data obtained from the online system. A prototype online measurement system has been developed based on this principle. A number of woven and nonwoven fabrics have been evaluated using the online system as well as a number of other commercially available fabric compression testers. The compressional characteristics obtained from the online measurement system compare well with the same parameters measured using the other commercially available compressional testers.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiber and Polymer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19991105-032423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complete Spectroscopy of &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;P</field><field name="creator">Grossmann, Chris Allen</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;GROSSMANN, CHRIS ALLEN.Complete Spectroscopy of P.(Under the direction of Dr. Gary E.

In addition, the simulations indicated an offset and mobile iron-sulfur core. In contrast, the rigid dendrimers were open with a more central and relatively immobile iron-sulfur core. Heterogeneous electron transfer rate constants measured using cyclic voltammetry and Osteryoung square wave voltammetry, indicated that the rigid dendrimers were more effective at attenuating the rate of electron transfer than were the flexible dendrimers of comparable molecular weight. These key structural differences for alternatively stiff and flexible dendrimers turned out to play a critical role in rationalizing their electron transport properties. That is, the offset positioning of the core in the flexible dendrimers permits facile electron transfer to/from a poised platinum electrode compared to the rigid dendrimers, where the core is centrally positioned. While the dendrimers containing rigid ligands had better encapsulated redox cores for a given molecular weight, these molecules had higher electron transfer rates for a given molecular radius. Moreover, for the rigid dendrimer series, the attenuation of electron transfer was modest as the molecular size increased, indicative of a highly ?conductive? medium. This behavior was not observed in the flexible series. Here, a steeper attenuation of the electron transfer rate constant was observed as molecular size increased, indicative of a comparably more insulating electron transfer medium.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19991119-052717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">. Drilling Parameters and Their Effect on Chip Clogging and Surface Roughness</field><field name="creator">Joshi, Sandesh Surendra</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;In the woodworking industry, drilling (boring) is one of the most extensively used processes. Due to the traditional nature of the woodworking industry, not much data on machining has been recorded, only a fraction of this on drilling. This lack of information hinders the understanding and thus improvement in the process of drilling. The objective of this research is to provide a pilot study on chip clogging and the surface finish generated while drilling wood and also to examine the surface breakout at the point of drill entry and exit while drilling. This will help the industry by giving an insight into the drilling of wood for furthering research in focused areas. Experiments on chip clogging were carried out with two sizes of standard twist drills and the effect of feed (in/rev), spindle speed (rpm), passage of air jet, pecking cycle and rotational tool were studied on chip clogging. For the study of surface finish, a full factorial experimental design was implemented to evaluate the effect of factor level combinations of four wood types, four drill types, grain directions (along and across the grain), spindle speed (rpm) and feed (in/rev) and their interactions with respect to the surface quality of the machined workpiece. These 128 factor level combinations were replicated three times for a total of 384 experiments. The data obtained was statistically tested by using the analysis of variance techniques to prove the level of significance for each factor and interaction with respect to the surface finish. Work on chip clogging shows promise and needs further investigation for the benefit of the industry. Results on the surface finish study show trends in the behavior of parameters and future work should include developing mathematical models for accurately predicting responses with respect to the input parameters.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-19991220-172709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological and Molecular Characterization of a Brassionosteroid-Deficient Tomato Mutant</field><field name="creator">Koka, Chalapathi Rao</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;We found that a dwarf tomato (&lt;P&gt;Another approach to understanding the mode of action of BR is to isolate BR-regulated genes and determine the mechanism of gene regulation by BR.

One way of considering American late capitalism is to treat it as a mass movement with striking similarities to more overtly tyrannical mass movements like Nazism and Mooneyism. DeLillo makes such comparisons in White Noise and Mao II, and his fiction ultimately suggests that an unchecked late capitalist consumer culture is frighteningly capable of not only tyranny, but also of liquidating individuality. A more acute analysis of the methodology employed by mass movements can be made using a Frankfurt School approach. Theodor Adorno?s essay, ?Freudian Theory and the Pattern of Fascist Propaganda,? offers a useful framework for studying how mass movements are able to seduce, manipulate, tyrannize, and incorporate individuals. Adorno argues that Nazism depended on knowledge of certain psychological desires to seduce individuals. This essay argues that the American consumer culture uses similar methods to seduce individuals by not only employing psychological weapons, but also by taking advantage of a highly systemetized technological apparatus whose development has coincided with the unprecedented rise of the American consumer culture. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000107-153024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of background strain on the hematologic toxicity ofinhaled benzene in FVB/N-Tg.AC and C57BL/6- Trp 53 +/- knockout mice.</field><field name="creator">Healy, Laura N</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Benzene is an industrial solvent and a ubiquitous environmental pollutant that induces hematopoietic damage; although, the mechanism by which this damage occurs is uncertain. The hematologic effects of benzene vary widely among different mouse strains, and intermittent exposure of mice to benzene is more highly toxic and carcinogenic than low, constant exposure. The goal of the research described in this dissertation was to investigate the sensitivity of two genetically engineered mouse models of carcinogenesis, Tg.AC and p53 +/- mice, and parental strains FVB/N and C57BL/6 respectively, to hematologic toxicicity resulting from inhaled benzene. Tg.AC mice contain an activated v-Ha-ras oncogene, and the p53 +/- mouse is haplosufficient for the p53 gene. Hypotheses of this work included that benzene ishematotoxic, and that greater genotoxic damage caused by benzene would be evident in the p53 +/- mouse. Another hypothesis was that benzene would induce Tg.AC transgene expression in the spleen. The research was divided into three specific aims. First, genotoxicity resulting from exposure to benzene was determined by micronucleus formation in blood. These studies showed a time-dependent, but not a concentration-dependent increase in micronuclei following benzene exposure. The p53 +/- mice were not more sensitive to benzene-induced micronuclei than the parental strain (p53 +/+). For the second specific aim, benzene hematotoxicity was assessed and spleen analyses were conducted. Benzene induced a significant cytopenia and reduced spleen weight in all of the strains examined. The C57BL/6 mice were less sensitive to benzene hematotoxicity than the FVB/N strain for all of the hematologic parameters examined. For the third specific aim, expression of theTg.AC transgene mRNA was assessed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of splenic tissue. Evidence of the Tg.AC transgene expression was absent in these tissues. Overall, the findings showed a marked strain-related difference between FVB/N and C57BL/6 mice in the hematotoxicity of benzene. In most parameters investigated, the Tg.AC or p53+/- genetic alterations were not useful adjuncts for investigating the hematotoxic mechanisms of benzene. Investigation of the genetic differences between these two mouse strains may lead to further understanding of the biological determinants of benzene hematotoxicity.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000110-094819</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of Affinity Chromatography Combined with Capillary Electrophoresis or Mass Spectrometry in the Biochemical Analysis</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Wei</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt; The focus of the research has been to develop combined techniques, such as affinity chromatography combined with capillary electrophoresis or mass spectrometry, for the structural analysis of biologically important proteins. In the first part of the research, a method that allows the direct analysis the peptides affinity-bound to the immobilized metal ion media by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI/MS) has been developed and applied to detect sequence errors of recombinant proteins occuring at the N-terminus and to locate phosphorylation sites in proteins. This method allows the fast identification of two recombinant proteins with expression errors, one is proteins p24, a major capsid protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the other is Vif, a viral infectivity factor required for the efficient transmission of free virus. Phsophorylation sites on proteins p53 and p21 that are involved in determining cellular response to DNA damage are also detected using this method. Huge gain in terms of selectivity, sensitivity and structural information are achieved with minimal sample consumption. In the second part of the research, affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE) has been applied to evaluate biomolecular interactions, such as protein-drug and antibody-antigen interactions, and to better understand the interaction. ACE with laser induced fluorescence detection (LIF) is used to systematically evaluate binding between phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (Sd, potential anti-HIV drugs) and viral envelope glycoprotein HIV-1 gp120. The results show that the interaction has a strong dependence on the sulfur phosphorothioate backbone. Chain length and the sequence of Sd also affect the ability of binding to gp120. The results may provide useful information to clinical trial. ACE is also used to examine the effect of each residue of the epitope of HIV-1 capsid protein p24 on their affinity to an anti-p24 monoclonal antibody. Each amino acid within epitope is successively substituted by alanine, and the effect of the substitutes on their affinity for the antibody is examined by ACE. We are able to determine the relative importance of each amino acid within the epitope to the binding affinity of the peptide. The results provide a better understanding of these interactions. High separation power and ease of automation of ACE offer an effective and rapid means to study of these types of biological interaction.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000117-220916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design, Preparation, and Characterization of Metallo-Adducts of the Histidine-Containing Phosphocarrier Protein from Bacillis Subtilis</field><field name="creator">Ferguson, Stephen Scott</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Ferguson, Stephen Scott. The expression, purification, and characterization of metallo-adducts of the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein (HPr) from Bacillus Subtilis and two of its engineered mutants. (Under the direction of Charles R. Cornman)Expression of recombinant HPr and its mutants HPrgamma?n (S12Y, R17H, E84Y) and HPrbeta (S12Y, R17H) was performed in the Escherichia coli organism. The proteins were purified via calmodulin affinity resin to yields of ~40 mg/L of culture. The native HPr protein was shown to be active by mutant complementation assays, while the engineered mutants HPrgamma, and HPrbeta were inactive to phosphotransfer reactivity. Mass spectroscopy analyses verified the masses of the proteins relative to that predicted from the constructed DNA sequences. Iron-binding studies with HPrgamma were designed to coordinate iron (III) ions in a manner analogous to the metalloenzyme protocatechuate 3,4 dioxygenase. This mode of coordination, however, was not observed with iron in our examination of HPRgamma. Alternate metal-binding studies with copper and manganese revealed that HPrgamma, at physiological pH values, does not form stable complexes with several transition metal ions. The HPrbeta mutant protein and, to a degree, native HPr , however, do show transition metal-binding properties through UV-Vis and EPR spectroscopies.A plausible cause for our inability to form an HPrgamma-iron complex is the formation of a hydrophobic pocket at pH = 8.0, between the engineered pairs of proximal histidine and tyrosine residues of HPrgamma. CD denaturation studies to examine this possibility revealed that HPrgamma has an increased stability to thermal denaturation from 60 degrees C for HPr and HPrbeta, to 65 degrees C for HPrgamma.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000120-044505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Delignification of Kraft-AQ Southern Pine Pulp with Hydrogen Peroxide Catalyzed by Mn(IV)2-Me4DTNE</field><field name="creator">Cui, Yu</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Over the years, hydrogen peroxide has been used to improve the brightness of pulp at the end of a bleaching sequence. However, the degree of delignification achieved by a hydrogen peroxide stage is usually modest. That is because in alkaline condition the hydroperoxy anion reacts with chromophores in pulp as a nucleophile that does not oxidize residual lignin to a significant extent. In order to enhance the reactivity of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant, a binuclear manganese complex Mn(IV)2-Me4DTNE was added. As a result, the degree of delignification was significantly improved, while at the same time, the strength properties of the pulp were better preserved compared traditional in hydrogen peroxide delignification. In order to better understand the mechanism of this delignification process, lignin model compound oxidation and kinetics of pulp delignification were studied. In addition, residual lignin was isolated from the pulp before and after delignification and then characterized by GPC, FTIR, and 1H-13C 2D NMR. Shown by the model compound study, hydrogen peroxide is able to oxidize 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanol, E-diphenylethene, and 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-propene to a considerable extent when catalyzed by Mn(IV)2-Me4DTNE, indicating that the reactivity of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant is significantly improved. Indeed, as shown by the kinetic study of pulp delignification, the degree of delignification as well as the rate of delignification were greatly improved when the catalyst was applied. In addition, the catalyzed delignification process benefits from the concerted reaction mechanism that regulates the formation of hydroxyl radicals responsible for the severe damage to the fibers. As a result, the strength properties were well preserved. Shown by the characterization of residual lignin before and after the delignification, residual lignin was oxidized to a good extent which accounts for the significant degree of delignification. The process simulation of this catalyzed delignification process by WinGEMS4.0 showed that this process was profitable if the cost of the catalyst was kept below $330/kg.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wood and Paper Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000203-202106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Packet Loss Recovery for Unicast Interactive Video Transmission over the Internet</field><field name="creator">Joshi, Srinath R</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The current Internet is not reliable; packet loss rates are frequently high, and varying over time. Transmitting high-quality interactive video over the Internet is challenging because the quality of compressed video is very susceptible to packet losses. Loss of packets belonging to a video frame manifests itself not only in the reduced quality of that frame but also in the propagation of that distortion to successive frames. This error propagationproblem is inherent in many motion-based video codecs due to the interdependence of encoded video frames. Recently a new approach to improving error resilience of compressed video, called Recovery from Error Spread using Continuous Updates(RESCU), has been proposed. In RESCU, picture coding patterns can be adjusted to enable the use of transport level recovery schemes in recoveringlost packets without having to introduce any playout delay at the receiving end. In this thesis, we propose dynamic loss recovery schemes which when combined with RESCU, effectively alleviate error propagation in the transmission of interactive video. In these schemes, picture coding patterns are dynamically adapted to current network conditions in order to maximize the effectiveness of hybrid transport level recovery (employing both forward error correction and retransmission) in reducing error propagation. Through an experimental study based on actual Internet transmission traces representing various network conditions, we study the effectiveness and limitations of our proposed techniques and compare their performance with that of existing video error recovery techniques such as Intra-H.261 and H.263+(NEWPRED). Our study indicates that the proposed techniques exhibit better error resilience and incur much less bit overhead than existing video error recovery techniques. This document also describes the implementation of a prototype interactive video transmission system employing a proposed loss recovery scheme.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000215-204201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FUNCTIONAL STUDIES OF FERRITIN 3-FOLD AXIS: EFFECTS OF MUTATIONS NEAR SUBUNIT INTERACTION SITES</field><field name="creator">Pancorbo, Bruno Marco</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Pancorbo, Bruno Marco. Functional studies of ferritin 3-fold axis: effects of mutations near subunit interaction sites. (Under the direction of Dr. E. C. Theil)Ferritin is an iron storage protein whose metabolic importance is reflected in its ubiquitousness in living organisms. Ferritin is a multi-subunit protein (24 subunits) and one of its most interesting features is its 3-dimensional structure: a sphere-like structure with a 4-3-2 symmetry that has a hollow interior where iron is stored. This 3-dimensional structure is highly conserved among ferritins of different living organisms even when the homology of the primary structure of the different ferritins is as low as 22%. Such a degree of structural conservation can only be interpreted as the result of a near perfect balanced between ferritin's structure and function. Among the highly conserved residues are arginine 72 and aspartate 122 which form a salt bridge near the 3-fold interface. To study the importance of these residues in ferritin function, site-directed mutagenesis was used to disrupt and rescue this salt bridge. The properties of the mutants were tested and compared with those of the parent proteins.The greatest difference between mutants and parent proteins was seen in the amount of iron each released. Mutants were found to release a greater percentage of their initial iron than the parents released. Some mutants also showed an increased rate of iron release over the parent proteins, but the effect of the mutation differed depending on the type of subunits used. Another finding was that disruption of the salt bridge caused some of the ferritin subunits to have an increase in volume which seems to correlate with the difference in iron uptake rates for the different ferritin mutants.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000228-182046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computation for Markov Chains</field><field name="creator">Cho, Eun Hea</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;A finite, homogeneous, irreducible Markov chain $\mC$ with transitionprobability matrix possesses a unique stationary distribution vector.

The Effect of Learning Style, Major, and Gender on Learning Computer-aided Drawing in an Introductory Engineering/Technical Graphics Course. (Under the direction of Dewey A. Adams and Barbara M. Kirby)This correlational descriptive study examined factors that might affect students? achievement in learning computer-aided drawing and engineering/technical graphics concepts in introductory classes at North Carolina State University. The study involved 38 subjects enrolled in introductory classes that combined the teaching of computer-aided drawing and technical graphics. The three dependent variables used in the study were CAD project grade, CAD posttest score, and final course grade. The seven independent variables examined were gender, learning style, major, student classification, final exam grade, final exam with the posttest score removed, and pretest score. Subjects' learning styles were established by the Group Embedded Figures Test, which measures field-dependence and field-independence. Kendall?s Tau B correlations and multiple linear regression models were used in the analysis of the data. The alpha used for statistical significance was .05.Analysis of the data revealed that the research subjects were primarily field dependent, and exactly half of them had prior drafting experience. Subjects in the study represented 19 different majors. Eighteen students were from engineering programs and 20 from non-engineering programs. Females in the sample reported a lower level of computer experience and less prior drafting experience than males. For the total sample, statistically significant correlations were found between the project grade and the final grade with the project score removed, learning style and the final exam grade with the project score removed, computer experience and gender, and the final exam grade and gender. Correlations were found between gender and the final exam grade with the posttest score removed and between learning style and the final exam with the posttest score included. For females, a statistically significant relationship was found between prior drafting experience and the project grade; this was the strongest correlation found in the study. For males, statistically significant relationships were found between learning style and final exam grade, learning style and the final exam grade with the posttest removed, the project grade and the final grade with the project score removed, the project grade and the pretest score, and the pretest and posttest score.Three multiple linear regression models were created as part of the study, two as predictors of computer-aided drawing achievement and one as a predictor of achievement in learning the course content. Model 1 used the final project grade as its dependent variable to measure CAD achievement. The independent variables used in this model were gender, the pretest score, and major. The model?s R square was 0.31 (p = 0.005). Model 2, which used the posttest score as its dependent variable, was the second measure of CAD achievement. The independent variables used in this model were the pretest score, the Group Embedded Figures Test score, and the final exam grade with the posttest score removed. Its R square was 0.19 (p = 0.056). Model 3 used the final course grade as its dependent variable to measure achievement in learning the course content. The independent variables included in this model were gender, the Group Embedded Figures Test scores, and student classification. The R square for this model was 0.21 (p = 0.043).&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Occupational Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000321-151615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Particulate Generation During Disruption Simulation on the SIRENS High Heat Flux Facility</field><field name="creator">Sharpe, John Phillip</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Successful implementation of advanced electrical power generation technology into the global marketplace requires at least two fundamental ideals: cost effectiveness and the guarantee of public safety. These requirements can be met by thorough design and development of technologies in which safety is emphasized and demonstrated. A detailed understanding of the many physical processes and their synergistic effects in a complicated fusion energy system is necessary for a defensible safety analysis. One general area of concern for fusion devices is the production of particulate, often referred to as dust or aerosol, from material exposed to high energy density fusion plasma. This dust may be radiologically activated and/or chemically toxic, and, if released to the environment, could become a hazard to the public. The goal of this investigation was to provide insight into the production and transport of particulate generated during the event of extreme heat loads to surfaces directly exposed to high energy density plasma. A step towards achieving this goal was an experiment campaign carried out with the Surface InteRaction Experiment at North Carolina State (SIRENS), a facility used for high heat flux experiments. These experiments involved exposing various materials, including copper, stainless steel 316, tungsten, aluminum, graphite (carbon), and mixtures of carbon and metals, to the high energy density plasma of the SIRENS source section. Material mobilized as a result of this exposure was collected from a controlled expansion chamber and analyzed to determine physical characteristics important to safety analyses (e.g., particulate shape, size, chemical composition, and total mobilized mass). Key results from metal-only experiments were: the particles were generally spherical and solid with some agglomeration, greater numbers of particles were collected at increasing distances from the source section, and the count median diameter of the measured particle size distributions were of similar value at different positions in the expansion chamber, although the standard deviation was found to increase with increasing distances from the source section, and the average count median diameters were 0.75 micron for different metals. Important results from the carbon and carbon/metals tests were: particle size distributions for graphite tests were bi-modal (i.e. two distributions were present in the particle population), particles were generally smaller than those from metals-only tests (average of 0.3 micron), and the individual particles were found to contain both carbon and metal material. An associated step towards the goal involved development of an integrated mechanistic model to understand the role of different particulate phenomena in the overall behavior observed in the experiment. This required a detailed examination of plasma/fluid behavior in the plasma source section, fluid behavior in the expansion chamber, and mechanisms responsible for particulate generation and growth. The model developed in this work represents the first time integration of these phenomena and was used to simulate mobilization experiments in SIRENS. Comparison of simulation results with experiment observations provides an understanding of the physical mechanisms forming the particulate and indicates if mechanisms other than those in the model were present in the experiment. Key results from this comparison were: the predicted amount of mass mobilized from the source section was generally much lower than that measured, the calculated and measured particle count median diameters were similar at various locations in the expansion chamber, and the measured standard deviations were larger than those predicted by the model. These results implicate that other mechanisms (e.g., mobilization of melted material) in addition to ablation were responsible for mass removal in the source section, a large number of the measured particles were formed by modeled mechanisms of nucleation and growth, and, as indicated by the large measured standard deviations, the larger particles found in the measurement were from an aerosol source not included in the model. From this model, a detailed understanding of the production of primary particles from the interaction of a high energy density plasma and a solid material surface has been achieved. Enhancements to the existing model and improved/extended experimental tests will yield a more sophisticated mechanistic model for particulate production in a fusion reactor.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000323-115005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PESTICIDE AVAILABILITY FOR US FOOD CROPS: UNDERSTANDING MARKET AND SAFETY FORCES IN PRODUCT ENTRY, MAINTENANCE, AND WITHDRAWAL DECISIONS</field><field name="creator">Courbois, Claude-Bertrand</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Pesticide firms in the United States must undertake costly, crop-specific Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) safety tests to register their pesticides for sale to farmers of commercial crops. Firms also must pay annual registration fees and periodically undertake additional safety tests on each pesticide?s crop-specific registrations. These requirements create a market unlike others because firms may not freely enter or remain in a crop?s pesticide market. The EPA can raise and lower registration requirements to discourage or encourage registration of pesticides with certain safety characteristics on crops with particular production or consumption patterns. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Used effectively, these powers can enable the EPA to promote safety by encouraging registration of the safest pesticides in the widest number of markets, while limiting availability of unsafe pesticides. Used poorly, these powers can restrict even safe pesticides from reaching markets, especially minor ones. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;This dissertation evaluates the success of the pesticide regulatory system. A model that includes the EPA?s standard-setting process and a representative pesticide firm?s registration decision-making is used to demonstrate how registrations come about. The model shows how EPA and firm behavior cause registrations to depend on the characteristics of pesticides and crops. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The study required compilation of an extensive dataset of crop and pesticide characteristics and registration data through the 1990s. The data are used in logit analysis to evaluate the relative importance of crop and chemical characteristics in determining registrations. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The results show some evidence that the system successfully encourages registration of safer pesticides. Pesticides that are less likely to cause chronic health damage are more likely to be registered. Pesticides that are safer for the eyes of farm workers are more likely to be registered. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The results also show undesirable relationships. Crops with lower national value are less likely to have registrations. After controlling for crop value, herbicides are less likely to be registered for fruits and vegetables and for crops with high per-acre value.

A method of rheological evaluation (vane method) initially employed in the study of soils was used to evaluate protein foam rheology. The method was shown to be a reliable method for determining large-scale rheological properties of protein foams. Egg white protein produced foams with higher yield stress at lower concentrations and shorter whip times than did whey protein isolate. Short lifetime decreases in yield stress were observed in foams of higher protein concentration of both types, which were both concentration and whip time dependent. This is considered to be the result of a restructuring of the system as opposed to collapse of the foam. Cakes made from foams of both types showed different performance properties as well. Cakes produced from egg white protein exhibited a minimum concentration of protein (between 5 and 10% w/w of foam) necessary to form a cake of satisfactory volume. Whey protein isolate was unable to form a satisfactory cake regardless of the concentration studied. Phase contrast microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry studies suggested that the difference in behaviors might be due to a high degree of phase separation between egg white protein and soluble starch that was not seen in whey protein containing systems. This phase separation appears to allow significant matrix development in egg white protein containing cakes that can support the volume of the final product. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000327-174729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Adaptive Non-parametric Kernel Method for Classification</field><field name="creator">Kaszycki, Gregory John</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;One statistical method of estimating an underlying distribution from a set of samples is the non-parametric kernel method. This method can be used in classification toestimate the underlying distributions of the various classes. Since it can be shown that there is no perfect shape to a kernel function used to estimate an underlyingdistribution, several functions have been proposed and none is superior in all cases. This thesis demonstrates that a function can be created that adapts its shape to fitthe properties of the underlying data set. The function adapts its shape based on a pair of parameters and the algorithm uses a hill-climbing algorithm to determine thebest pair of parameters to use for the data set. This method gets consistently better accuracy than existing non-parametric kernel methods and comparable accuracy toother classification techniques. &lt;p&gt;In addition, this method can estimate information about the underlying characteristics of the data, based on the optimal parameters to thekernel function.

Li, Lu, Park, Kim, Brinkley and Peterson (1999)derived multivariate version of the zero-inflated Poisson distribution andapplied it to detect equipment problems in electronics manufacturingprocesses.&lt;p&gt;Zero-inflated distributions assume that with probability 1 - p the onlypossible observation is 0, and with probability p, a random variabledescribing defect counts in the imperfect state is observed. For example, when manufacturing equipment is properlyaligned (perfect state), there may be no defects. Otherwise, defects may occuraccording to a distribution of the imperfect state. The defect counts inimperfect statecould follow Poisson, negative binomial, or other distributions but most of the current researches use Poisson distribution. Although the maximum likelihood (ML) method is widely used in estimatingparameters in the zero-inflated distributions, there is no theoreticalstudy on the properties of the ML estimates.In Chapter 1, we propose a generalframework for generalized zero-inflated models (ZIM), which assume only thatthe distribution of the imperfect state has the support of the nonnegativeintegers and satisfies appropriate regularity conditions. We study the properties of the ML estimates of ZIM parameters,including their existence, uniqueness, strong consistencyand asymptotic normality under regularity conditions. By focusing on the univariate ZIM, we give detailedrigorous proofs to the lemmas and theorems stated in the thesis. Then, we study covariate effects in the univariate and multivariate zero-inflated regression models. Because the zero-inflated model involves both Bernoulli parameter p and the imperfect state parameter lambda,building the model separately does not use the information efficiently and the resulted model is more complicated than needed. This problem gets worse in the multivariate ZIM, where the number of model terms increases drastically. Our procedure selects limited important model terms to maximize the ZIM likelihood functions. &lt;p&gt;In Chapter 2, we review current researches on zero-inflated Poissonmodels. Some new results on multivariate Poisson and multivariate zero-inflated Poisson distributions are given. By generalizing theresults in Lambert (1992) and Li, et al (1999), we propose a multivariatezero-inflated Poisson regression model. An example from Nortel process development research is used to illustrate the model selection procedure for the zero-inflated regression models and computational details. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000330-121134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Variable Resolution Nonhydrostatic Global Atmospheric Semi-implicit Semi-Lagrangian Model</field><field name="creator">Pouliot, George</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACTPOULIOT, GEORGE. A Variable Resolution Nonhydrostatic Global Atmospheric Semi-implicit Semi-Lagrangian Model. (Under the direction of Dr. Fredrick H.M. Semazzi.)The objective of this project is to develop a variable-resolution finite difference adiabatic global nonhydrostatic semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian (SISL) model based on the fully compressible nonhydrostatic atmospheric equations. To achieve this goal, a three-dimensional variable resolution dynamical core was developed and tested.The main characteristics of the dynamical core can be summarized as follows: Spherical coordinates were used in a global domain. A hydrostatic/nonhydrostatic switch was incorporated into the dynamical equations to use the fully compressible atmospheric equations. A generalized horizontal variable resolution grid was developed and incorporated into the model. For a variable resolution grid, in contrast to a uniform resolution grid, the order of accuracy of finite difference approximations is formally lost but remains close to the order of accuracy associated with the uniform resolution grid provided the grid stretching is not too significant. The SISL numerical scheme was implemented for the fully compressible set of equations. In addition, the generalized minimum residual (GMRES) method with restart and preconditioner was used to solve the three-dimensional elliptic equation derived from the discretized system of equations. The three-dimensional momentum equation was integrated in vector-form to incorporate the metric terms in the calculations of the trajectories. Using global re-analysis data for a specific test case, the model was compared to similar SISL models previously developed. Reasonable agreement between the model and the other independently developed models was obtained. The Held-Suarez test for dynamical cores was used for a long integration and the model was successfully integrated for up to 1200 days. Idealized topography was used to test the variable resolution component of the model. Nonhydrostatic effects were simulated at grid spacings of 400 meters with idealized topography and uniform flow. Using a high-resolution topographic data set and the variable resolution grid, sets of experiments with increasing resolution were performed over specific regions of interest. Using realistic initial conditions derived from re-analysis fields, nonhydrostatic effects were significant for grid spacings on the order of 0.1 degrees with orographic forcing. If the model code was adapted for use in a message passing interface (MPI) on a parallel supercomputer today, it was estimated that a global grid spacing of 0.1 degrees would be achievable for a global model. In this case, nonhydrostatic effects would be significant for most areas.A variable resolution grid in a global model provides a unified and flexible approach to many climate and numerical weather prediction problems. The ability to configure the model from very fine to very coarse resolutions allows for the simulation of atmospheric phenomena at different scales using the same code. We have developed a dynamical core illustrating the feasibility of using a variable resolution in a global model.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000403-180910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A WAVELET-BASED PROCEDURE FOR PROCESS FAULT DETECTION</field><field name="creator">Lada, Emily Kate</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a procedure for detectingfaults in a particular process by analyzing data generated by theprocess on a compressed wavelet scale. In order to compress the data,three different methods are compared for reducing the number ofwavelet coefficients needed to obtain an accurate representation ofthe data. One method is ultimately chosen to compress all data usedin this study. This method, which involves minimizing the relativereconstruction error, effectively balances model parsimony againstreconstruction error. The compressed data from seven in-control runsis used to define a standard, or baseline, by which to compare newdata sets. The compressed baseline process is defined by forming theunion set of the top, or coarsest, coefficient positions selected bythe relative reconstruction error method for each of the seven runs.In order to determine if a new, compressed data set differssignificantly from the baseline, a variant of Hotelling'sT&#178;-statistic for two-sample problems is formulated. This statisticis tested by applying it to four induced-fault data sets, as well asto 21 in-control data sets. The results provide substantial evidenceof the statistic's effectiveness in detecting process faults fromcompressed data. It is also shown that traditional bootstrappingmethods cannot be implemented in this case.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000404-160239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Pattern Language Describing Apparel Design Creativity</field><field name="creator">Pechoux, Beatrice Le</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The apparel design process involves gathering and analyzing information on fashion trends, markets, past line sales and editing ideas for successful combinations of fabric, style and price. These ideas are the result of creativity. Creativity is most often modeled as a problem solving process involving complex chaotic systems. In the fields of architecture and software design, pattern languages have been developed to help understand the various fundamental components and dynamics of complex systems by using a series of related generic problem-solving patterns empirically proven to be successful in a specified context of forces. Patterns record existing knowledge to make it rapidly and easily accessible and communicated between different users. The research objective of this dissertation was to develop a pattern language describing the initial creative phase of the apparel design process. First, an archetype of the initial creative process in apparel design was constructed based on the literature reviewed to integrate the intervening marketing and design components, and suggest a set of links between these components and the various stages of the process. Second, patterns describing these links and the archetype were developed to form a pattern language representing the dynamics of the archetypal model, i.e. the articulation and interdependencies of all its components and stages. Design professionals reviewed the pattern language. Students used it to develop product concepts and storyboards, which were evaluated by a panel of judges. Feedback from these participants indicates the pattern language offers a "design manual" that can be used by all team members to improve design efficiency and effectiveness, i.e. higher success rates of new products in a timely manner. Combining information technology and the pattern language could make an even greater contribution to apparel design, both at an operational level and a strategic planning level. This research provides a working example of a pattern language and shows the benefits to be attained. Also, the dissertation includes a guide on constructing pattern languages in the hope of reaching the ultimate goal of encouraging industry and academic apparel design experts to contribute to the necessary ongoing developments of the pattern language. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Technology Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000404-214300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blackwater: A Collection of Stories</field><field name="creator">Roughton, Dean Morris</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;AbstractRoughton, Dean Morris. Blackwater: A Collection of Stories. (Under the direction of Angela Davis-Gardner.)The stories in this collection all either take place in or deal with characters from Blackwater, a fictional town in eastern North Carolina. Blackwater is not meant to represent any real town, but is more an amalgamation of the small towns that exist in the region. Eastern North Carolina serves as a point of convergence for various waters, salt and fresh, alkaline and acidic. The term blackwater refers to a specific kind of water often found in the slow moving rivers of the region and named for its dark color which is, as described on a plaque at the entrance of a river boardwalk/nature trail in an eastern NC town, "the result of a continuous process by which bacteria and fungi in the wetland soil break down plant material." The visitor will often comment upon perceiving a foul odor rising from this highly acidic water, a byproduct of the dense nutrients in suspension. Despite the displeasing smell, these waters are home to an abundance of wildlife, fish and aquatic animals, which would not thrive so readily in different waters but which do manage to survive and even do reasonably well at the points of converging waters where a mixture of elements is achieved.I find blackwater an apt metaphor for the culture in the region and, so, have named my fictional town accordingly. Life in eastern North Carolina, comparatively speaking, is often slower on the surface than in more metropolitan areas. However, there is a rich undercurrent of events, which often are avoided in conversation.The stories in this collection, for the most part, are not given to monumental action, but instead focus on what lies beneath the surface. In addition, several of the stories investigate the way characters develop from or respond to a convergence of waters. It is my purpose in writing these stories neither to condemn nor uphold life as it exists in Blackwater; nor is it my purpose to condemn or uphold life as it exists in the waters that converge. I write in the hope that the reader will recognize that, though the breadth of towns like Blackwater is less than that of other areas, the depth is not lacking.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000406-105121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-Systems Operation and Control</field><field name="creator">Fenner, Joel S.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The typical process modeling and control approach of dealingwith each manufacturing process stage in isolation is re-evaluated anda new approach is developed for the case of a series ofprocess stages and the case of several similar processesoperating in parallel at different sites.

Associated with this growth has been a shift from traditional small family farm units to large confined housing operations. North Carolina, with 9.5 million swine, has been the leader in the development of large, efficient swine operations and is second only to Iowa in pork production. This change has resulted in production of more swine on less land and an increase in animal waste application to adjoining farm land. The repeated application of swine waste may result in increased accumulation of copper and zinc in soils. There is concern that these two metals, which are added to swine feed, will accumulate to phytotoxic levels in agricultural soils. The objective of the research described in this thesis was to investigate the ability of fungi to remove copper and zinc from swine wastewater. The imperfect fungus Aspergillus niger was found to be the most resistant (of six fungi examined) to copper, and the one best able to remove copper from culture media and swine wastewater. A. niger was able to remove as much as 91% of the copper and 70% of the zinc from hog wastewater collected from an aerobic/anaerobic swine waste treatment facility. Interestingly, the majority of the copper and zinc removed by the fungus was by absorption. Absorption of metal by fungi has not been reported as a useful method for bioremediation. These studies show that A. niger is a promising candidate for the removal of copper and zinc from swine wastewater.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000413-153002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Proposed Framework for Establishing Optimal Genetic Designsfor Estimating Narrow-sense Heritability</field><field name="creator">Silva, Carlos H.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt; We develop a framework for establishing sample sizes in breeding plans, so that one is able to estimate narrow-sense heritability with smallest possible variance, for a given amount of effort. We call this an optimal genetic design. The framework allows one to compare the variances of estimators of narrow-sense heritability, when estimated from each one of the alternative plans under consideration, and does not require data simulation, but does require computer programming. We apply it to the study of a peanut (Arachis hypogaea) breading example, in order to determine the ideal number of plants to be selected at each generation. We also propose a methodology that allows one to estimate the additive genetic variance for the estimation of the narrow-sense heritability using MINQUE and REML, without an analysis of variance model. It requires that one can build the matrix of genetic variances and covariances among the subjects on which observations are taken. This methodology can be easily adapted to ANOVA-based methods, and we exemplify by using Henderson's Method III. We compare Henderson's Method III, MINQUE, and REML under the proposed methodology, with an emphasis on comparing these estimation methods with non-normally distributed data and unbalanced designs. A location-scale transformation of the beta density is proposed for simulation of non-normal data. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000414-113213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental Regulation and Implications for the U.S. Hog and Pork Industries</field><field name="creator">Metcalfe, Mark</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;This study examines the effect of increasing environmentalregulation on hog production in the U.S. domestic market and on thecompetitiveness of U.S. pork in the international market. Agriculturalpollution from animal feeding operations (AFOs) is becoming a majorenvironmental consideration in the high hog production regions of the UnitedStates as well as in the heavy production areas of Northern Europe. Asenvironmental concerns increase and governmental regulations are imposed toprotect the environmental quality in these areas, will there be changes inproduction signaling an increase in competitiveness for regions with more laxenvironmental regulatory standards? This is an important question for theU.S. hog and pork industries from both a domestic (interstate) and aninternational perspective.The first half of this study examines differences in U.S. state water qualityregulations and their influence on the location of hog production in theUnited States. Modeling the profit maximization decision of hog producersallows investigation as to whether or not the current changes in theindustry towards larger and more geographically concentrated operations havebeen influenced by differences in environmental regulation. This analysis isconducted separately on small and large operations in order to allowexamination of the differences in the regulatory effect by size of operation.The results of this analysis provide evidence that environmental compliancecosts are significant for small hog feeding operations, while hog productionon large operations does not seem to be influenced by the level ofenvironmental stringency. Implications for policy making include the factthat the observed movement of large hog operations out of traditionalmid-western states is not primarily a consequence of differences inenvironmental regulation and, therefore, current policy proposals calling forharmonized Federal AFO manure management standards may not be necessary.Also, policy makers concerned with the economic and social implications ofdecreasing small farm production will want to consider the detrimentaleffects of increasing environmental regulation on these small producers.The second half of the study examines the effects of increasing U.S. andEuropean Union (EU) environmental regulation on the competitiveness of theU.S. pork exporting industry. An equilibrium displacement model is developedto estimate the magnitude of the effect on U.S. pork export quantities andalso to calculate producer welfare changes. A review of information on theenvironmental regulation imposed on the major pork exporters is provided asbackground to the current policy environment in each of these countries.Results show that the expected increase in U.S. hog producers' compliancecosts lead to only minor losses in competitiveness for the U.S. porkindustry and in fact it is the hog producers, not the pork processors, whobear the majority of the economic loss. Changes in EU environmentalregulation over the next few years are expected to be more restrictive thanthose imposed in the United States. Examining these changes in EU regulationshows that over a range of EU regulatory scenarios, U.S. pork becomes morecompetitive as EU pork prices increase significantly in the face of verystringent EU environmental regulation. Future trade policy implications ofthese results include the need of EU countries to negotiate harmonizedenvironmental standards to equate environmental compliance costs acrossmajor pork exporting countries.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000414-164328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of Pasture and Confinement Dairy Feeding Systems Using Jersey and Holstein Cattle.</field><field name="creator">White, Sharon</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Today, dairy farmers in the U.S. are faced with the challenge of reducing the cost of producing milk. Milk prices have risen very little in the past decade, while the cost of producing milk has risen steadily. In North Carolina alone, dairy farm numbers have dropped more than 30% in the last ten years, and the trend is expected to continue. Dairy farmers have been forced to increase their profitability to stay in business. In addition, farmers have been forced to comply with stricter environmental regulations. Over the past few years, interest has been shown in intensive management rotational grazing systems. This four-year comparison trial was designed to compare the milk production, herd health, reproductive performance, and environmental impacts of pasture-based and confinement feeding systems using Holstein and Jersey cattle for the Mid-Atlantic region. The project had both Spring and Fall calving herds with breeding via artificial insemination in 75-day periods. Each seasonal herd replicate had 36 cows on pasture and 36 cows in the confinement group. Similar numbers of Holsteins and Jerseys were included in each year. Paddocks grazed comprised 29 ha of cool and warm season pasture species in 37 paddocks for year-round grazing. Pasture-fed cows received variable amounts of grain and baled silage as needed depending upon pasture availability. Confinement cows were housed in a covered freestall barn with access to an exercise lot and received a total mixed ration with corn silage as the primary forage. Confinement cows produced significantly more milk than pasture-fed cows, both for total lactation and average daily production. Reproductive performance of the two treatments did not differ with an overall 75-day pregnancy rate of 68%. Jerseys in both systems did have higher percentages of cows inseminated (96.5%), conception rate (59.6%), and 75-day pregnancy rate (78%) compared to Holsteins (86%, 49%, 57.9% respectively). The percentage of cows infected with at least one case of clinical mastitis was higher in the confinement herd than the pasture-fed herd (43% vs. 24%) with Holsteins higher than Jerseys (41% vs. 26%). Interactions of breed and feeding system and average somatic cell count scores were not significantly different. Pasture-fed cows had lower average body condition scores than confinement cows, ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 points lower on a 5-point scale.In a short-term trial, intake measurements were taken from pasture-fed Holsteins and Jerseys consuming a grain supplement. This supplement was similar to those that were fed to the pasture-fed cows during the four-year trial. It was determined that Jerseys could consume as much as Holsteins at three different feeding levels (6.8, 4.5, and 2.3 kg/cow per feeding). This experiment showed that in certain time frames, Jersey cattle can consume equal amounts of supplements compared to Holsteins. Therefore in mixed groups Jerseys can consume relatively more supplemental energy relative to body size and milk production compared the Holsteins. In another short-term trial using cows from a spring season replicate, milk samples were obtained from pasture-fed and confinement-fed cattle and analyzed for fatty acid composition. The pasture grazed was a warm-season pasture, while the confinement-fed cattle consumed a corn-silage based TMR. The major fatty acid of interest was conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which has been shown to be a potent anticarcinogen. Concentrations of CLA were 80% higher in pasture-fed cattle compared to the confinement-fed cattle. In addition concentrations of CLA were higher in Holsteins compared to Jerseys. To study the distribution of manure in a pasture-based system, pastured cows were observed for several 24-h periods. Data included: (1) times and location of all feces and urine events from eight cows, observed while in the pasture, feed area, milking parlor or in transit; and (2) all urine and feces events on pasture for all 36 cows each grazing period. The locations of urine and feces events were surveyed, mapped and analyzed. Percentages of the manure events in each area were highly correlated with time spent in each area (r= .99). Feces and urine (estimated at .12 m2 and .36 m2, respectively) from six observational periods covered 10% of the total paddock. Within 30 m2 of the portable waterer and gate, concentrations of feces and urine from the warm season observations were significantly greater than concentrations during the cool season observations. Manure on pasture was relatively evenly distributed over multiple grazing periods with the exception of the area around the water tank during summer grazings. These experiments showed that when compared to confinement-fed cattle, pasture-fed cattle produced less milk, produced more conjugated linoleic acid, had less mastitis and had lower body condition scores, while reproductive performance did not differ between the two groups. Jerseys had less mastitis, produced less conjugated linoleic acid, and performed better reproductively when compared to Holstein cattle. In addition, pasture-fed Jersey cattle can consume as much supplemental grain in certain time frames as pasture-fed Holstein cattle. Manure distribution on a pasture-based system is highly correlated with time spent in an area and is fairly evenly distributed over the paddock area over multiple grazing periods except for the area around the water tank during heat stress temperatures.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000414-220827</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of A Small In-Stream Constructed Wetland in North Carolina's Coastal Plain</field><field name="creator">Bass, Kristopher</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The use of in-stream wetlands is a growing practice being used to mitigatethe impacts of non-point source (NPS) pollution. Wetlands promote physical,chemical, and biological processes that attenuate and convert nutrientswhich can lead to improved water quality. Wetland performance is sensitiveto site conditions, making it difficult to precisely quantify their possibleimpact. Factors such as site specific soil, hydrologic, and vegetativecharacteristics influence wetland effectiveness. Typical design criteriainclude surface area/depth, retention time, plant coverage, and other hydrodynamicrecommendations. One recommendation made by Scheuler (1992) for stormwaterwetlands is that the design surface area be at least 1% of the contributingwatershed size. Most urban areas are severely limited with regard to availableland areas for wetland creation, thus, to be practical, smaller wetlandswill be necessary in many locations.&lt;p&gt;This research involved a two year study to quantify impacts of an in-streamconstructed wetland on water quality. The one hectare (2.4 ac) in-streamwetland was built to intercept drainage waters from approximately 240 hectares(600 ac) of agricultural and urban watershed, which resulted in a wetland:watershedarea ratio of 0.004:1. The wetland was instrumented to monitor hydrologyand water chemistry.&lt;p&gt;Water level recorders were used to measure stage at the wetland inletsand at the outlet. Weir equations and discharge curves combined with statisticalmodeling and calibration techniques were used to determine the flows throughthe wetland. A water balance was computed using inflow, outflow, precipitation,and potential evapotranspiration. A watershed scale balance showed thatthe total volume of flow leaving the wetland was comparable to the estimatedvolume of drainage and runoff from various land uses.&lt;p&gt;Water quality samples were analyzed for total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN),ammonium-nitrogen (NH-N),total phosphorus (TP), and ortho-phosphorus (OP). Measurements of watertemperature and dissolved oxygen levels were also made within the wetland.Background data acquisition began in early 1996. The evaluation periodbegan in August of 1997 and continued through December of 1999.&lt;p&gt;Over the evaluation period, NO-N concentrations were reducedthrough the wetland by 60%, NH-N concentrations by 30%, andTKN levels by 9.5%. This resulted in a 20% drop in total nitrogen concentration.Phosphorus levels increased 55% between the wetland inlets and outlet.Actual reduction of NH-N and TKN concentrations may be slightlyunderestimated due to unaccounted for inputs. This may also contributeto the increases in phosphorus concentrations observed between the inletsand the outlet. In the first full year, NO-Nlevels were reduced 70% and 33%, respectively. A significant decrease inNO-N concentrations through the wetland was detected duringthe first winter, and in other nitrogen forms in the first full growingseason. NO-N levels were 60% lower at the wetland outlet throughoutthe year. Ammonium nitrogen concentrations dropped 30% through the wetlandduring the growing season and 20% during the dormant season.

To understand the domain morphology, a developedselection criterion indicates their shape and/or orientationbased on the system's shear moduli. Subjected to external stresses, precipitates and theirorientation can be altered continuously intolamellar configurations. For moderate external strain, late-time,large-scale splitting of domains is observed.

The model combines boundary-layer conservation equations with a k-omega turbulence model and multi-group radiation transport, and uses plasma models for fluid properties such as viscosity, thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity. The resulting TURBFIRE computer code is the most comprehensive simulation to date of boundary-layer turbulence and radiation transport in electric launcher plasmas.&lt;p&gt;TURBFIRE was run for cases with and without ablation. Temperature and velocity profiles are presented for all code runs, as are values of heat flux to the wall. The results indicate that both radiation transport and turbulence are important mechanisms of energy transport in the boundary layer, and therefore that both should be modeled in future simulations. Additionally, heat flux to the wall via both conduction and radiation was found to be significant for all cases run. Other authors have theorized that conduction could be neglected, but the current results show that this is not the case near the wall.&lt;p&gt;This research is also novel for its advances in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The energy equation was written in terms of internal energy and discretized in a manner more implicit than in typical CFD codes. These changes were necessary to enable the code to accurately calculate heat capacity, which changes greatly with temperature for even weakly-ionized plasmas. Additionally, zero-gradient boundary conditions were used at the free stream for the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate (k and omega). Experimentally determined freestream values of k and omega are typically used in CFD codes, but these data are not available for most plasma devices.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000427-184805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A New Monte Carlo Assisted Approach toDetector Response Functions</field><field name="creator">Sood, Avneet</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The physical mechanisms that describe the components of NaI,Ge, and SiLi detector response have been investigated using Monte Carlosimulation.

The purpose of this research was to determine the mechanism of toxicity. The peritoneal mesothelium is a (rat) target organ of potassium bromate carcinogenicity, but has not been studied due to the inherent difficulties of working with this one cell layer-thick tissue. Data from a two-year bioassay were used to more precisely map the location of origin, revealing that these tumors in the male F344 rat originate on the mesorchium of the tunica vaginalis testis, the mesosplenium, or at a point in between. An in vitro cell culture system was developed to study the mechanism of toxicity. It was demonstrated that KBrO3 caused cell cycle arrest and markedly increased the number of apoptotic cells. KBrO3 is a powerful oxidant and glutathione (GSH) is the major cellular antioxidant. Therefore, GSH-related responses were studied revealing mesothelial cells contained substantially less GSH than a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (Hep-G2). Studies employing GSH ester or N-acetyl cysteine (a GSH precursor) pre-treatment demonstrated abatement of toxicity in mesothelial, but not Hep-G2, cells. Experiments carried out to determine the chemical or enzymatic nature of the reaction between GSH and KBrO3 revealed differences between the reaction kinetics of the unbuffered and buffered chemical and cell-free/cell lysate reactions, probably due to reaction pH. Both chemical and cellular reactions exhibited a similar first step reaction between GSH and KBrO3; thus, enzyme participation is probably not required. Experiments using diethylmaleate, which depletes GSH by a reaction involving KBrO3, showed that GSH depletion greatly enhanced KBrO3 toxicity, indicating GSH glutathione S-transferase, buthionine sulfoximine (which prevents synthesis of GSH) and was protective. This does not support the hypothesis that the reaction of KBrO3 and GSH itself produces a radical/reactive species that oxidatively damages lipids, proteins and DNA. Rather, depletion of GSH likely precedes oxidative damage. Gene expression studies demonstrated that peritoneal mesothelial cells displayed expression changes in a discrete set of genes, including oxidative stress-responsive genes, after treatment with KBrO3 for four or 12 hours. Mesothelial cells severely damaged by five days KBrO3 treatment recovered from complete cell cycle arrest after four weeks and exhibited explosive growth, focus formation and altered morphology. The redox imbalance created by GSH depletion appears to mediate increased expression of known oxidative stress responsive genes (e.g., HO-1,GADD45, GADD153, QR), activation of transcription factors (AP-1 and NFkB) and down-regulation of cell cycle initiating cyclins (and up-regulation of the CDK inhibitor p21waf1/cip1) in KBrO3-mediated toxicity. These alterations may permit cell survival, as observed after severe toxicity, and may be accompanied by transforming mutations or clastogenic changes. Taken together, these data suggest that mesothelial cells represent a population susceptible to KBrO3-mediated toxicity in vitro, and suggest that tissue susceptibility in vivo plays a role in the nascence of mesotheliomas in the male F344 rat.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toxicology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000509-143301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel Adaptive Power and Rate Control in Third GenerationWideband CDMA Mobile Systems</field><field name="creator">Sadri, Ali Soheil</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Ali Soheil Sadri: Novel Adaptive Power and Rate Control in Third GenerationWideband CDMA Mobile Systems, under the direction of Dr. Winser Alexander.This Dissertation proposes novel adaptive power control and rate change schemesand investigates the performance of a Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA)system in conjunction with these adaptive techniques. In these schemes, thetransmit power and rate are adapted to the variations of the fading channel using adaptivethresholds based on the probability distribution function (pdf) of the predicted mobilechannel power values.We define a policy similar to the traditional power control technique withthresholds except that the thresholds are set based on several regions of operation in ourAdaptive Transmitter Power Control (TPC) and Adaptive Seamless Rate Change (SRC)schemes. These regions are defined by means of the probability distribution function(pdf) of the total average channel power. The pdf is initially constructed based on thehistory of the predicted channel power values derived from the long-range predictionalgorithm. These regions can be defined such that the system operates at a constant ratioof energy per bit over noise power.In a 1-user model with one channel path, the pdf of the channel power would bean exponential or chi-square function with 2 degrees of freedom. However, in a W-CDMAsystem, normally the rake receiver has several fingers. That is, at the receiver,the system either estimates or predicts the channel coefficients at each rake finger andperforms maximal ratio combining by multiplying each finger with its conjugate or chooses the ones with the highest energy and performs maximal ratio combining on theselected fingers.In a two-user system where the multi-access interference is modeled as theStandard Gaussian Approximation (SGA), the system performance and error probabilityof our W-CDMA system becomes similar to the one for our one-user system.Consequently, in a single user detector system, when all users adopt a similar policy fortheir adaptive power and rate control, the average total Multi-Access Interference (MAI)will be reduced. The resulting channel capacity of the system in this case will beincreased and the system may operate in a lower transmit power level.We evaluate the performance of these schemes using a detailed block diagramsimulation of a W-CDMA system. We model and simulate all major components of thesystem including an accurate model for realistic mobile channels. We present simulationresults to verify that the proposed novel schemes are superior to the traditionalapproaches for transmitter power control and rate change. Furthermore, our simulationresults show that our proposed techniques reduce the effect of Multi Access Interferencein a multi-user system.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000512-145426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ENHANCEMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA AGRICULTURAL AUTOMATED WEATHER NETWORK AND DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED COMMUNICATION, DATA ACQUISITION, AND DISSEMINATION SYSTEMS</field><field name="creator">Parameshwara, Vinayak Kota</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;AgNET is a weather network, which collects surface and subsurface meteorological data in North Carolina. Each AgNet weather station measures a variety of weather parameters such as air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, barometric pressure, solar radiation, photosynthetically active radiation, soil temperature, soil moisture and precipitation. The station summarizes the above parameters for every hour and stores them in its local memory. Currently the data collected over the entire day are then transferred to a central server through phone lines. The data collected at the central server are published on the Internet and disseminated by other means as well. The purpose of this thesis is to describe the modernization of the AgNet weather network by making the network conform to standards, implement a uniform sensor configuration and improve the methods of data acquisition, dissemination and display of weather data.Since phone-based communication is not economical for real time data transfers other techniques such as Radio Frequency (RF) communication and satellite based communication were evaluated. RF communication was the most promising communication technique. Since RF is limited by distance, a combination of RF and Internet was designed. In this type of communication, data are transmitted from the weather station and received by a base station that is on the Internet. The received data are then forwarded to a central server at the State Climate Office where they are archived and disseminated. A successful test was conducted as proof of concept between Lake Wheeler road Field laboratory site, Raleigh and Varsity Laboratory, NC State University.Since every system has inherent noise, data collected at each station have to go through different quality control algorithms to insure data quality.

Several approaches for inconsistency identification exist, however, the techniques introduced in this thesis are targeted specifically for analyzing goals in conjunction with the Goal-Based Requirements Analysis Method (GBRAM). Reducing inconsistency in a requirements specification greatly impacts its quality, as well as the overall success of a software development effort. Addressing and reducing the number of inconsistencies before development begins, minimizes the need to continually revisit what needs to be developed (the requirements), and consequently reduces development time and costs since inconsistencies are resolved early on (prior to system design and implementation). This thesis introduces a series of techniques and associated heuristics for identifying and resolving inconsistency in requirements specifications. These techniques and heuristics are demonstrated in the analysis of two case studies, the second of which is further described in Deriving Goals from a Use Case Based Requirements Specification for an Electronic Commerce System [ADS00]. The main contributions of this thesis include techniques that augment the GBRAM which provide specific guidance to the identification of inconsistency, and a structured goal syntax to aid analysts in forming goals for future analysis, and heuristics to aids in inconsistency identification and resolution&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000615-220414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information-based Group Sequential Tests With Lagged or Censored Data</field><field name="creator">Kung, Meifen</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Conventionally, values of nuisance parameters given in a statistical design are often erroneous, thus may result in overpowering or underpowering a test using traditional sample size calculations. In this thesis, we propose to use Fisher Information data monitoring in group sequential studies to not only allow an early stopping in a clinical trial but also maintain the desired power of the test for all values of nuisance parameters. Simulation studies for the simple case of comparing two response rates are used to demonstrate that a test of a single parameter of interest with a specified alternative achieves the desired power in information-based monitoring regardless of the value of the nuisance parameters, provided that this parameter of interest can be estimated efficiently. The emphasis in this part is to show how information-based monitoring can be implemented in practice and to demonstrate the accuracy of the corresponding operating characteristics in some simulation studies.When there is lag time in reporting, standard statistical techniques often lead to biased inferences on interim data. A maximum lag estimator ensures complete information by using data before a lag time period. The estimator is unbiased but less powerful. We propose an inverse probability weighted estimator which accounts for censoring and is consistent and asymptotically normal in estimating mean of dichotomous variables. The joint distribution of test statistics at different times have the covariance structure of a sequential process with independent increments. This allows the use of information-based monitoring. Simulation study shows that our estimator preserves the type I and type II errors, and reduces the number of participants required in a trial. Future approach in finding an efficient estimator is also suggested in chapter 3. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000619-120546</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DEVELOPMENT OF MODELS FOR CALCULATING THE LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY OF METHANOL BY LIQUID PHASE AND CONVENTIONALPRODUCTION PROCESSES</field><field name="creator">VASWANI, SUDEEP</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Vaswani, Sudeep. Development of Models for Calculating the Life Cycle Inventory of Methanol by Liquid Phase and Conventional Production Processes. (Under the direction of Drs. Morton A. Barlaz and H. Christopher Frey).This study deals with the development of an ASPEN PLUS process model for the liquid phase methanol (LPMEOH) process,which is in the demonstration phase at Eastman Chemical Company, TN. The model will ultimately be integrated with MSW gasification model being modeled separately and used inan integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) system to co-produce methanol and power from syngas obtained from MSWgasification. The LPMEOH process uses syngas as a startingmaterial for methanol production. Model results for anexample case are presented and the life cycle inventory (LCI) of methanol has been calculated starting from syngas. When methanol is produced from the LPMEOH process, its production by conventional processes is avoided. Thus, an EXCEL spreadsheet model of methanol production using conventional process has also been developed. This model calculates the LCI of methanol from conventional process which is used to calculate the emissions avoided per kg ofmethanol produced by the LPMEOH process. For LPMEOH process model, it is found that the performance of the model is dependent on syngas conversion in methanol reactor. Syngas conversion is a function of reactor pressure, syngas space velocity in methanol reactor, molar ratio of recycle gases to fresh syngas feed, and H2/CO molar ratio in syngas feed. The syngas composition mainly depends on the source from which it is obtained (e.g. coal gasification, MSW gasification). LPMEOH process model has the capability to process syngas of varying compositions.Sensitivity analysis of LPMEOH process model has been presented. Based on the sensitivity analysis, it is shown that for syngas compositions limited in hydrogen content, the reactor pressure of or higher than 750 psig must be used. Further it is shown that recycling the unreacted gases has an advantage of more methanol production compared to the case with no recycle. It is also shown that the syngas feed with low H2/CO ratio has lower methanol production than syngas with higher H2/CO ratio. It therefore recommended that the syngas with low H2/CO ratio be adjusted via water-gas shift reaction such that the H2/CO ratio increases thereby resulting in a higher methanol production. It is also learnt that net steam demand in the LPMEOH process increases as the syngas becomes limited in its hydrogen content. This is expected to have some implications when the LPMEOH process is combined with an IGCC system. The LCI of methanol produced by LPMEOH process varies widely with change in syngas composition and process conditions such as reactor pressure, space velocity in methanol reactor, and recycle ratio. The main contribution to the LCI occurs from the combustion of purge gases to produce steam in a boiler. The steam generated offsets the emissions from other contributors of the LCI. The sensitivity analysis of the LCI of methanol production from LPMEOH reveals that the methanol LCI is quite sensitive to the changes in syngas composition, reactor pressure, syngas space velocity and the recycle ratio.The sensitivity analysis of conventional methanol production has also been discussed. It is found that the LCI of conventional process is not very sensitive to changes in natural gas composition, which is used as a raw material for methanol production. The change in syngas conversion in methanol reactor also does not cause the overall LCI of methanol to change significantly.The ultimate objective of the study is to compare the LCI of methanol produced by conventional process with that by LPMEOH process to determine if there is any advantage to methanol production by using LPMEOH technology on syngas derived from MSW gasification. The effect of an LPMEOH process on a gasification system would be an incremental increase in fuel use. Because of the incremental fuel use there would be an increase in elemental sulfur recovered, slag production, and some pollutant emissions. However, an overall LCI of methanol for LPMEOH process would require the calculation of the LCI associated with gasification.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000626-113020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic Optimization Infrastructure and Algorithms for IA-64</field><field name="creator">Hazelwood, Kim Michelle</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Dynamic Optimization refers to any program optimization performed after the initial static compile time. While typically not designed as a replacement for static optimization, dynamic optimization is a complementary optimization opportunity that leverages a vast amount of information that is not available until runtime. Dynamic optimization opens the doors for machine and user-specific optimizations without the need for original source code. &lt;P&gt;This thesis includes three contributions to the field of dynamic optimization. The first main goal is the survey of several current approaches to dynamic optimization, as well as its related topics of dynamic compilation, the postponement of some or all of compilation until runtime, and dynamic translation, the translation of an executable from one instruction-set architecture (ISA) to another.&lt;P&gt;The second major goal of this thesis is the proposal of a new infrastructure for dynamic optimization in EPIC architectures. Several salient features of the EPIC ISA prove it to be not only a good candidate for dynamic optimization, but such optimizations are essential for scalability that is up to par with superscalar processors. By extending many of the existing approaches to dynamic optimization to allow for offline optimization, a new dynamic optimization system is proposed for EPIC architectures. For compatibility reasons, this new system is almost entirely a software-based solution, yet it utilizes the hardware-based profiling counters planned for future EPIC processors. &lt;P&gt;Finally, the third contribution of this thesis is the introduction of several original optimization algorithms, which are specifically designed for implementation in a dynamic optimization infrastructure. Dynamic if-conversion is a lightweight runtime algorithm that converts control dependencies to data dependencies and vice versa at runtime, based on branch misprediction rates, that achieves a speedup of up to 17% for the SpecInt95 benchmarks. Several other algorithms, such as predicate profiling, predicate promotion and false predicate path collapse are designed to aid in offline instruction rescheduling.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000629-110017</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Fluorescent Yellow Warning Signs at Hazardous Locations</field><field name="creator">Krull, Kimberly A.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Yellow warning signs are an important and abundant type of traffic control device. Improving warning signs could be a cost-effective countermeasure at hazardous locations, especially rural locations where approximately 61% of the Nation's traffic fatalities occur. The use of fluorescent yellow sheeting in place of standard yellow sheeting provides a method to increase the conspicuity of the traffic sign while conforming to the guidelines specified by the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. The 3M Corporation, and later other companies, developed a long-lasting fluorescent yellow retroreflective sign. Although the properties of the fluorescent yellow sheeting indicate that the conspicuity of the signs is much higher, the increased conspicuity ultimately must prompt a change in motorist behavior for highway safety to be improved. Therefore, the purpose was this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of fluorescent yellow warning signs in improving highway safety at hazardous locations. A before and after study used surrogate measures to evaluate the safety effectiveness of replacing existing yellow warning signs (engineer or high intensity grade) with fluorescent yellow warning signs (diamond grade) at seven hazardous locations. The results of this effort indicate that fluorescent yellow warning signs increased the safety at four of the seven sites by providing a more conspicuous warning to motorists.

Embedded systems are now targets for contradictory requirements: they are expected to occupy a small amount of physical space (e.g., low package count), be inexpensive, consume low power and be highly reliable. Regardless of the decades of intensive research and development, there are still areas that can promise significant benefits if further researched. One such area is the quality of the data which embedded system operates upon. This includes both code and data segments of an embedded system application. This work presents a unified, compiler-driven approach to solving the redundancy problem. It attempts toincrease the quality of the data stream that embedded systems are operating upon while preserving the original functionality. The code size reduction is achieved by Huffman compressing or tailor encoding the ISA of the original program. The data segment size reduction is accomplished by modified Discrete Dynamic Huffman encoding.

Previous research suggested that anomalous peak broadening observed in the voltammetry of cyt c may be the manifestation of surface effects at the SAM/solution interface (heterogeneous adsorption sites). To examine this matter further, research was directed at 1) deciphering the role of the gold substrate's topography in both SAM formation and cyt c voltammetry; 2) understanding the protein binding interactions at the SAM/solution interface that influence cyt c adsorption and electrochemical response, and 3) investigating the microscopic properties of all the surfaces involved. Electrochemical and scanning probe microscopy techniques were used to explore the influence of gold topography in cyt c / COOH SAM / Au systems. COOH SAMs (11-mercaptoundecanoic acid and 14-mercaptotetradecanoic acid) were prepared and characterized on a variety of gold surfaces including evaporated, bulk, single crystal, and expitaxially grown on mica gold substrates. Each type of gold surface exhibited specific topographical features and characteristic roughness. SAMs were found to have a decreasing number of defects as the topography of the gold became smoother, as evidenced by an increased ability to block solution probe molecules. As the SAMs become less defective on the smoother gold, the extent of adsorption and the magnitude of the electrochemical response of adsorbed cyt c decreased significantly. These results show cyt c adsorption and electrochemistry to be intimately related to the density of defects in the SAM, which, in turn, are heavily influenced by the gold topography. Additionally, as the gold roughness decreased, the double layer capacitance of the films was observed to increase. A physical model was proposed in which the structure and properties of COOH SAMs are dictated by significant endgroup interactions in addition to chain-chain interactions. The model illustrates how gold topography plays an intricate role in determining the structure and application of COOH terminated SAMs. Research was also performed on the SAM/solution interface by thermally healing SAMs on gold and utilizing SAMs on Ag-UPD modified gold. Thermal healing, by reducing the number of defects in the SAMs, was also found to affect both SAM structural properties and cyt c adsorption. SAMs that had been thermally healed exhibited a lower density of defects while, at the same time, supported lower electroactive cyt c coverage. Ag UPD layers were tested as a means of creating more stable, less defective COOH SAMs for cyt c immobilization and possibly allowing for more ideal voltammetry of the proteins. Preliminary research has shown that SAMs with Ag-UPD layers have fewer defects and greater inherent stability. Finally, scanning probe microscopy techniques were employed to investigate the structure of the gold substrate, the SAM/solution interface, and adsorbed cyt c. In addition to cyt c / SAM / Au research, results from the following investigations are presented: electrochemistry of adsorbed cyt c at indium tin oxide electrodes and the electron transfer (ET) properties of iron-sulfur metallodendrimers. The metallodendrimers exhibited attenuated ET properties with increasing generations of dendritic ligands in a solventless, polymeric media. The electrochemistry of Cu(II) in physiological pathways that may be related to neurological and ocular diseases was also explored. Research on these systems revealed that the reduction of Cu(II) by certain peptides and catabolites may play a vital role in the development of these diseases. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000713-192513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational approaches for maximum likelihood estimation for nonlinearmixed models.</field><field name="creator">Hartford, Alan Hughes</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;The nonlinear mixed model is an important tool for analyzingpharmacokinetic and other repeated-measures data.In particular, these models are used when the measured response for anindividual,,has a nonlinear relationship with unknown, random, individual-specificparameters,.Ideally, the method of maximum likelihood is used to find estimates forthe parameters ofthe model after integrating out the random effects in the conditionallikelihood. However, closed form solutions tothe integral are generally not available. As a result, methods have beenpreviously developed to find approximatemaximum likelihood estimates for the parameters in the nonlinear mixedmodel. These approximate methods include FirstOrder linearization, Laplace's approximation, importance sampling, andGaussian quadrature. The methods are availabletoday in several software packages for models of limited sophistication;constant conditional error variance is requiredfor proper utilization of most software. In addition, distributionalassumptions are needed. This work investigates howrobust two of these methods, First Order linearization and Laplace'sapproximation, are to these assumptions. The findingis that Laplace's approximation performs well, resulting in betterestimation than first order linearization when bothmodels converge to a solution. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A method must provide good estimates of the likelihood at points inthe parameter space near the solution. This workcompares this ability among the numerical integration techniques,Gaussian quadrature, importance sampling, and Laplace'sapproximation. A new "scaled" and "centered" version of Gaussianquadrature is found to be the most accurate technique.In addition, the technique requires evaluation of the integrand at onlya few abscissas. Laplace's method also performswell; it is more accurate than importance sampling with even 100importance samples over two dimensions. Even so,Laplace's method still does not perform as well as Gaussian quadrature.Overall, Laplace's approximation performs betterthan expected, and is shown to be a reliable method while stillcomputationally less demanding. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This work also introduces a new method to maximize the likelihood.This method can be sharpened to any desired levelof accuracy. Stochastic approximation is incorporated to continuesampling until enough information is gathered to resultin accurate estimation. This new method is shown to work well for linearmixed models, but is not yet successful for thenonlinear mixed model.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000719-081254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">REACTIONS FOR YTTRIUM SILICATE HIGH-K DIELECTRICS</field><field name="creator">Chambers, James Joseph</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;CHAMBERS, JAMES JOSEPH. Reactions for Yttrium SilicateHigh-k Dielectrics. (Under the advisement of Dr. GregoryN. Parsons.)The continued scaling of metal-oxide-semiconductor-field-effect-transistors (MOSFETs) will require replacing the silicon dioxide gate dielectric with an alternate high dielectric constant (high-k) material. We have exploited the high reactivity of yttrium with both silicon and oxygen to form yttrium silicate high-k dielectrics. Yttrium silicate films with composition of (Y)&lt;SUB&gt;1-x&lt;/SUB&gt; and x = 0.32 to 0.87 are formed by oxidizing yttrium on silicon where yttrium reacts concurrently with silicon and oxygen. The competition between silicon and oxygen for yttrium is studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and medium energy ion scattering (MEIS). The initial yttrium thickness mediates the silicon consumption, and a critical thickness (~40-80 &#197;) exists below which silicon is consumed to form yttrium silicate and above which Y forms without silicon incorporation. Engineered interfaces modify the silicon consumption, and a nitrided silicon interface results in film with composition close to Y. The silicon consumption also depends on the oxidation temperature, and oxidation at higher temperature generally results in greater silicon incorporation with an activation energy of 0.3-0.5 eV. Yttrium silicate films (~40 &#197;) formed by oxidation of yttrium on silicon have an amorphous microstructure and an equivalent silicon dioxide thickness of ~12 &#197; with leakage current . Yttrium silicate formation on silicon is also demonstrated using plasma oxidation of yttrium on silicon, reactive sputtering of yttrium and annealing/oxidation of yttrium on thermal SiO. The interface reactions described here for yttrium are expected to be active during both physical and chemical vapor deposition of other high-k dielectrics containing Hf, Zr and La.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000721-183205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATION OF NINE NOVEL ANALOGS OFTRYPSIN MODULATING OOSTATIC FACTOR (TMOF)IN THE MOSQUITO, Aedes aegypti</field><field name="creator">Miller, Maria R.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The search continues for an environmentally safe, low cost, fast acting insecticide formosquitoes.

The study has been careful toidentify and separate the effects of the hydrodynamic near field and the geometric near field. The near and far field radiation regions of a model propeller were consideredseparately. Firstly to determine if far field control affects the near field noise levels and secondly to determine how the far field noise levels are affected by near field control. It has been found that active noise control (ANC) of the propeller blade passing tone (BPT)can be achieved within the geometric near field, however the extent of the effective control is small. The near field optimized ANC can result in as much as 10.5 dB ofreduction of the BPT, however this noise reduction can only be achieved over a small spatial region. For this experimental arrangement there is no effective ANC directlybehind the propeller. Whenever ANC is optimized for near field noise it results in far field noise levels of up to 15.2 dB above the uncontrolled far field propeller levels.

The response has been well characterized in yeast and mammals where it has been associated with a variety of metabolic pathways, such as phospholipid biosynthesis, translational inhibition, and ER associated degradation. In plants, however, the connections of the ER stress response with metabolic pathways other than those involved in chaperone biosynthesis have not been characterized. This study defines a connection between phospholipid synthesis and the ER stress response in plants. Two model systems were used to characterize this association, the maize mutant floury-2 (fl2), which displays a unique endosperm specific ER stress response mediated by a mutant seed storage protein, and soybean cell cultures treated with the pharmacological agents tunicamycin (Tm) or azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZC). These chemicals interfere with normal protein synthesis and processing events, and are well characterized inducers of ER stress responses in animals, plants, and yeast. Investigation of both of these systems revealed a common theme; induction of the ER stress response in plants leads to increased activity and/or expression of various phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes. These increases were correlated with previously described amplifications in expression of the molecular chaperones binding protein (BiP), protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and calreticulin. Certain aspects of the ER stress response may be unique to plants. A seed-specific result of the ER stress response was the accumulation of triacylglycerols (TG), which specifically increased in the endosperm of the fl2 mutant to more than 3-fold higher than normal endosperm levels by 36 days after pollination (DAP). The maize and soybean systems used in this study provide a starting point for the investigation of other details of the ER stress response in plants and represent important tools for future efforts to define the components of the signaling pathway. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000729-161702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of Frequentist and Bayesian Inferences by Relevant Simulation</field><field name="creator">Kim, Yuntae</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Statistical inference procedures in real situations often assume not only the basic assumptions on which the justification of the inference is based, but also some additional assumptions which could affect the justification of the inference. In many cases, the inference procedure is too complicated to be evaluated analytically. Simulation-based evaluation for such an inference could be an alternative, but generally simulation results would be valid only under specific simulated circumstances. For simulation in the parametric model set-up, the simulation result may depend on the chosen parameter value. In this study, we suggest an evaluation methodology relying on an observation-based simulation for frequentist and Bayesian inferences on parametric models. We describe our methodology with the suggestions for three aspects: factors to be measured for the evaluation, measurement of the factors, and evaluation of the inference based on the factors measured. Additionally, we provide an adjustment method for inferences found to be invalid. The suggested methodology can be applied to any inference procedure, no matter how complicated as long as it can be codified for repetition on the computer. Unlike general simulation in the parametric model, the suggested methodology provides results which do not depend on specific parameter values.The argument about the new EPA standards for particulate matter (PM) has led to some statistical analyses for the effect of PM on mortality. Typically, regression model of mortality of the elderly is constructed. The covariates of the regression model includes a suite of highly correlated particulate matter related variables in addition to trend and meteorology variables as the confounding nuisance variables. The classical strategy for the regression model having a suite of highly correlated covariates is to select a model based on a subset of the covariates and then make inference assuming the subset model. However, one might be concerned about the validity of the inferences under his classical strategy since it ignores the uncertainty in the choice of a subset model. The suggested evaluation methodology was applied to evaluate the inference procedures for the PM-mortality regression model with some data from Phoenix, Arizona taken from 1995 to early 1998 . The suggested methodology provided valid evaluation results for various inference procedures and also provided adjusted inferences superior to Bonferroni adjustment. Based on our results, we are able to make conclusions about the short-term effect of PM which does not suffer from validity concerns.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000803-090904</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating Placement Algorithms with the DREAM Framework for Reconfigurable Hardware Devices</field><field name="creator">Eatmon, Dedra</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field programmable gate array (FPGA) has become one of the most utilized configurable devices in the area of reconfigurable computing. FPGAs have alarge amount of flexibility and provide a high degree of parallel computing capability. Since their introduction in the 1980's, these configurable logicdevices have experienced a dramatic increase in programming capabilities and performance. Both factors have been significant in the changing roles ofconfigurable devices in custom-computing machines. However, the improvements in capability and performance have not eliminated the issues related toefficient placement of applications on these devices.&lt;p&gt;This thesis presents a tool that evaluates placement algorithms for configurable logic devices. Written in Java, the tool is a framework in whichvarious placement algorithms can be executed and the performance and quality ofeach placement evaluated using a cost function. Based on devices thatsupport relocatable hardware modules (RHMs), the tool places modules with user-specified placement algorithms and provides feedback that can be usedfor a comparative analysis. The framework manages module mappings to the logicdevice that are both independent of each other and do not requirepin-to-pin routing connections. Such a tool is valuable for the identification of effective placement algorithms for real-time placement of RHMs in run-time reconfigurable systems.&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;ynamic &lt;b&gt;Re&lt;/b&gt;source &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;llocation and &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;anagement (DREAM) framework, has been designed and developed to evaluate FPGA placement algorithms/heuristics. Aportion of the evaluation is based on a simplistic cost function that calculates the amount of contiguous unused space remaining on the device intwo dimensions. In our experiments, we use an FPGA logic core generator to produce several rectangular RHMs. In addition to the rectangular RHMs producedby the logic core generation tool, our framework can handle arbitrary circuit profiles. Several scenarios consisting of approximately 500insertions/deletions of both rectangular and non-rectangular RHMs are used as test data sets for placement. Three placement algorithms are presented todemonstrate the flexibility of the framework. The first algorithm tested in the DREAM framework is a random placement algorithm. The second algorithm isan adaptation of a traditional best-fit algorithm that we call exhaustivesearch. The third algorithm is a modified version of first-fit.Future work will involve the development of additional placement algorithms andthe incorporation ofplacement issues that relate to requests for central reconfigurable computing resources originating from a remote site.&lt;p&gt;The DREAM framework answers the call for a tool that is sorely needed to identify placement algorithms that can be effectively used for real-timeplacement. In addition to providing results that can be used to benchmark the performance of placement algorithms in real-time on a configurablesystem, this tool also allows the end-user methods to store and load placementsfor future optimization. By taking full advantage of the partial andfull dynamic reconfiguration capabilities of logic devices currently used in run-time reconfigurable systems, the goal of DREAM is to provide a tool with whichthe quality of placement algorithms can be quantified and compared.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000807-062016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantification and Modeling of In-Stream Processes in Agricultural canals of the lower coastal plain</field><field name="creator">Birgand, Fran&#231;ois</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;BIRGAND, FRAN&#199;OIS. Quantification and Modeling of In-Stream Processes in Agricultural Canals of the Lower Coastal Plain. (Under the direction of Dr. R. Wayne Skaggs).Excess nutrient loads have been recognized to be the major cause of serious water quality problems recently encountered in the North Carolina estuaries and coastal waters. There has been a particular concern in coastal watersheds because agricultural and forested lands are located in close proximity to recreational and environmentally sensitive waters. The key to nutrient management at the watershed scale is the understanding and quantification of the fate of nutrients at the field scale and after they enter the aquatic environment. There is no accepted method to describe and predict fate of nutrients in canals and streams. The purpose of this research was to investigate the magnitude of the effects of in-stream processes in agricultural canals of the lower coastal plain and to propose a modeling approach for quantifying nitrogen transformations in such canals. This was accomplished in four steps.The first step was an extensive review of the literature on nitrogen retention in agricultural streams. Nitrogen removal rates in most agricultural canals and streams vary between 50 and 800 mg N/m&#178;/d, with mass transfer coefficient varying between 0.01 and 0.10 m/d. The magnitude of nitrogen retention in streams and canals of agricultural watersheds has been reported to vary between less than 5% to more the 60% of the gross load. In the second step, the effects of biogeochemical processes on chemical and nutrient loads was evaluated in a 1125-m long agricultural canal reach of the lower coastal plain near the town of Plymouth, NC. Chemical and nutrient loads at both ends of the reach were measured by continuous measurement of flow and concentrations. Flow measurements were made using trapezoidal flumes in which flow velocity and depth was continuously measured and recorded with velocity meters. Nutrient concentrations were measured on water samples taken both manually and automatically at strategic times along the hydrographs so that linear interpolation between two consecutive samples could be made. Nutrient addition due to seepage along the reach was estimated. After corrections for lateral contribution, it was estimated that, over the 14-month measuring campaign, 3% of the total nitrogen load entering the upstream end was retained within the reach. This was mostly due to the combination of nitrate retention and release of organic nitrogen (ON) within the reach. Up to 10.2 % of the total phosphorus load measured at the upstream station was retained while 10% of the total suspended solids was also retained. There was a release of inorganic carbon equal to 18.7% more that the load measured at the upstream end.Measurements of algae and macrophyte biomass within the reach, and, measurements of nitrogen and carbon concentration profiles at the sediment-water interface revealed that most of nitrate retention was likely due to denitrification after diffusion from the water-column to the sediment. Release of organic nitrogen was attributed to flux of refractory organic nitrogen from the sediment into the water-column. Assimilation by algae and macrophytes may have accounted for as much as 20% of the total retention of inorganic nitrogen. Rates of nitrate removal and release of organic nitrogen were estimated using the model DUFLOW. Nitrate removal rates varied between 200 and 800 mg NO3-N/m&#178;/d, while release rates of organic nitrogen varied between 100 and 400 mg ON/m&#178;/d. A mass transfer coefficient of 0.3 m/d was obtained for nitrate at two distinct periods of the year.A simple approach was proposed for modeling nitrogen transformations in canals of the lower coastal plain. Transformations are simplified as the combination of downward diffusion of water-column nitrate into the sediment and an upward diffusion of organic nitrogen from the sediment.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological and Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000807-154716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fiber Length Measurement by Image Processing</field><field name="creator">Ikiz, Yuksel</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;IKIZ, YUKSEL. Fiber Length Measurement by Image Processing. (Under the direction of Dr. Jon P. Rust.) This research studied the accuracy and feasibility of cotton fiber length measurement by image processing as an alternative to existing systems. Current systems have some weaknesses especially in Short Fiber Content (SFC) determination, which is becoming an important length parameter in industry. Seventy-two treatments of five factors were analyzed for length and time measurements by our own computer program. The factors are: Sample preparation (without fiber crossover and with fiber crossover), lighting (backlighting and frontlighting), resolution (37-micron, 57-micron, 106-micron, and 185-micron), preprocessing (4-neighborhood and 8-neighborhood), and processing (outlining, thinning, and adding broken skeletons). The best results in terms of accuracy, precision and analysis time for images without fiber crossovers were: 106-micron resolution with frontlighting using an 8-neighborhood thresholding algorithm and using an outline algorithm for length determination. With fiber crossovers, 57-micron resolution with backlighting using an 8-neighborhood thresholding algorithm and using a thinning algorithm combined with an adding algorithm for combining broken skeletons. Using the above conditions, 1775 area can be analyzed using our current equipment in 15 seconds. In the case of images with crossovers, only 117 can be analyzed in 15 seconds. This research demonstrates that successful sample preparation without fiber crossovers would create the best fiber length measurement technique, however with fiber crossovers the system efficiency has been proven as well.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiber and Polymer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000809-225316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of the Methanococcus jannaschii RNase P holoenzyme.</field><field name="creator">Andrews, Andrew J.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The RNase P RNAs from Methanococcus and Archaeoglobus lack secondary structural features essential for the recognition of pre-tRNA.

Themajor contribution of this work is the design of a machine independent optimizer,munger, that transforms code generated originally for a Very Long Instruction Word(VLIW) processor, called Tinker, to one that can run on the IA-64 architecture.The munger does this transformation by reading in a set of rules that specify amapping from Tinker specific code to IA-64 specic code.

This would alsopreclude rewriting the existing back-end significantly, to support the new architecture.The primary motivation for this approach was the fairly large similarity betweenthe Tinker, and the IA-64 architectures. Besides, Tinker is an experimental VLIWarchitecture that supports a number of features to exploit instruction level parallelism(ILP) and can be easily extended to support new features.

Prediction and Numerical Simulation of the Regional Climate of Equatorial Eastern Africa. (Under the direction of Dr. Fredrick H. M. Semazzi.). The objective in this investigation was to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms and physical processes responsible for climate variability over the equatorial eastern Africa, and explore potential for short-term climate prediction. Both statistical and numerical methods have been employed in this research. Application of cluster analysis yields 8 and 9 homogeneous climatic zones respectively for the variability of the annual and seasonal rainfall. Regions that are prone to drought or floods during the different phases of El Ni&#241;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are delineated. Positive rainfall anomalies occur in much of the region during March-May (MAM) and October-December (OND) of the ENSO(0) years and negative anomalies dominate during the following ENSO(+1) years. These rainfall patterns are useful for short-term climate monitoring over the region. The relationship between the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) in the lower stratospheric zonal winds and the long-rains of MAM is more significant in lagged than in simultaneous, with the most distinct relationships occurring over the western parts of the region. The QBO-index explains about 36% of the seasonal rainfall variance. There is a 60/63 percent likelihood for the occurrence of above/below normal rainfall during the westerly/easterly phase of the QBO-index. The NCAR Regional Climate Model (RegCM2) simulations have demonstrated the added value of the nesting approach in improving regional climate simulations. The model reproduces the observed characteristics of the Turkana low-level jet. The study has shown the importance of orographic forcing, the large-scale background monsoon flow and depth of the channel in the development and maintenance of the jet. Thermal and frictional forcing play equivalent roles as that of the large-scale winds in the formation of the jet. The identified regions of strong winds associated with the jet are important to the safety in the aviation industry and are also potential for alternative renewable energy resources in the form of wind energy. Large-scale orography is the most important factor. Divergence and anticyclonic vorticity partly explains the observed split in the jet cores. The dynamics of the flow in the channel and the dry conditions observed over the wider part of the valley is in partly explained by the Bernoulli theorem as applied to barotropic steady and non-viscous flows. Air-sea interaction phenomenon over the Indian Ocean, and the latitudinal location and intensity of the large-scale Walker and Hadley circulations are the main physical mechanisms responsible for the climate variability over the region during the wet and dry years. Abundant rainfall is associated with the presence of a midtropospheric cyclonic wind shear across the equator, and a negative vertical wind shear. Likewise, dry conditions are associated with the presence a strong westerly/southerly wind anomaly that occurs throughout the troposphere. Short-term climate prediction models developed in this study are capable of skillfully reproducing the space-time evolutions and distribution of the seasonal rainfall over the region, and specifically the observed floods that occurred during the 1997 ENSO year. Preliminary application of the RegCM2 in the prognostic mode successfully produces a 3-months projection of the extreme seasonal anomalies associated with the 1997 ENSO event. These models can be exploited further in operational short-term climate prediction over equatorial eastern Africa.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000810-143914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supercritical Fluid Assisted Polymer Processing: Plasticization, Swelling and Rheology</field><field name="creator">Royer, Joseph Robert</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The use of supercritical carbon dioxide, scCO is a gas under atmospheric conditions, it can be used as a processing aid and then easily removed from a polymer through evaporation to obtain the original physical properties of the unplasticized polymer matrix.

However, the biggest challenge hindering the widespread use of CO as a plasticizer involves a lack of understanding of and data quantifying its effect on polymer swelling and the concomitant reduction in material viscosity. In this work, a three-step approach is used to investigate and quantify the physical phenomena associated with CO-induced plasticization of polymer melts.First, a novel experimental apparatus was designed and constructed to measure equilibrium swelling, swelling kinetics and diffusion of CO into a polymer melt. It was found that diffusion of CO pressure had a negligible effect on the diffusion coefficient; however, the system temperature directly affected the diffusion coefficient. Increased pressure was found to enhance the extent of swelling whereas a maximum was observed with increasing temperature, at pressures above 15 MPa. The Sanchez-Lacombe equation of state was found to be in good agreement with the experimentally calculated variables, and thus, can be used as a predictive tool to obtain physical properties of the CO-PDMS system.Secondly, a high pressure extrusion slit die rheometer was constructed to measure the viscosity of polymer melts plasticized with low concentrations of CO. Polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate), polypropylene, low density polyethylene, and poly(vinylidene fluoride) were all investigated. CO was found to be an efficient plasticizer for all of these polymer materials, generally lowering the viscosity of the melt 30-80%, depending on processing conditions. Predictive viscoelastic scaling models based on free-volume principles and a prediction of Tg depression from a diluent were developed to quantify the effects of CO concentration, pressure and temperature on viscosity. This unique free-volume approach allows the high pressure polymer/CO rheology to be predicted based solely on physical parameters of the polymer melt and CO solution behavior over the concentration and temperature ranges for which the models are valid.Finally, a novel high pressure magnetically levitated sphere rheometer (MLSR) was developed to further investigate the effects of CO on the viscosity of polymer melts. The MLSR measures the difference in magnetic intensity required to levitate a magnetic sphere in a sample fluid while the fluid is at rest and under shear. The observed change in magnetic intensity is directly proportional to the viscoelastic force imposed on the sphere by the surrounding fluid, and thus is used to calculate the fluid viscosity from a calibration of known viscosity standards. The rheometer eliminates many of the disadvantages associated with other high pressure rheometers and can operate over a wide range of CO concentrations at constant pressure with excellent reproducibility. This rheometer was used to measure the viscosity reduction of poly(dimethyl siloxane) by CO were investigated. The viscosity of the polymer melt could be lowered in excess of 97% of its original value at atmospheric pressure by adding a CO concentration of approximately 30 wt%. Additionally, experimental evidence revealed that the elevated pressure significantly increased the polymer/CO viscosity.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000810-144737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Noninferior Surface Tracing Evolutionary Algorithm(NSTEA) for Multiobjective optimization</field><field name="creator">Chetan, Srigiriraju Kishan</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary algorithms are becoming increasingly valuable in solving large-scale, realistic engineering problems. Most of these problems deal with sufficiently complex issues that typically conflict with each other, thus requiring multi objective (MO) analyses to assist in identifying compromise solutions. The focus of this paper is to develop and test a new multi objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). The new procedure, Noninferior Surface Tracing Evolutionary Algorithm (NSTEA), builds upon two fundamental concepts that are established in the mathematical programming literature for MO analysis. Implicit implementation of Pareto optimality and beneficial seeding of initial population are instrumental in the improved performance. NSTEA was evaluated by solving a suite of test problems reported in the MOEA literature. Performance with respect to accuracy, coverage, and spread of noninferior solutions generated by NSTEA is evaluated and compared with those of solutions generated by four other MOEAs that are widely accepted. Also, in some cases, comparisons are made with noninferior sets generated using mathematical programming techniques. Overall, NSTEA performs relatively better than the other MOEAs when tested on these problems. Application and performance evaluation of NSTEA in solving a real-world MO engineering optimization problem was also conducted. In comparison to published mathematical programming-based noninferior solutions, the NSTEA solutions performed well. In summary, this paper contributes to the MOEA literature by presenting NSTEA as a good alternative evolutionary algorithm-based multi objective method that is relatively simple to implement and to incorporate into existing implementations of evolutionary algorithm-based optimization procedures. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000815-163114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seismic Design of Vertically Irregular Reinforced Concrete Structures</field><field name="creator">Das, Satrajit</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Seismic building codes, such as the Uniform Building Code (UBC) do not allow the equivalent lateral force (ELF) procedure to be used for structures with vertical irregularities. The UBC defines a structure to be irregular based on the ratio of magnitudes of either strength, stiffness, mass, setback or offset of one floor to that of an adjacent floor. The criteria defining the limits of irregularity are somewhat arbitrary, but are introduced in the code to provide unambiguous, enforceable provisions. The purpose of this study is to quantify the definition of irregular structures for four different vertical irregularities - stiffness, strength, mass and nonstructural masonry infills. A total of 87 building structures with interstory stiffness and strength ratios ranging from 0.09 to 1.89 and 0.27 to 1.07, respectively, and mass ratios of 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 are considered for a detailed parametric study. The lateral force resisting systems (LFRS) considered are special moment resisting frames and shear walls. These LFRS's are designed based on the forces obtained from the equivalent lateral force procedure. An ELF) analysis. Finally, nonlinear dynamic analysis is performed in order to assess the seismic performance of these buildings. The results show that the restrictions on the applicability of the equivalent lateral force procedure are unnecessarily conservative for irregular structures. Most structures considered in this study, designed on the basis of the ELF approach, perform reasonably well. In some cases, however, there is an initiation of an undesirable collapse mechanism. It is recommended that capacity based criteria in the design phase be appropriately used in the vicinity of the irregularity in order to ensure desired performance and behavior.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000820-165307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nonparametric Spatial analysis in spectral and space domains</field><field name="creator">Kim, Hyon-Jung</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;KIM, HYON-JUNG. Variance Estimation in Spatial Regression Using a NonparametricSemivariogram Based on Residuals. (Under the direction of Professor Dennis D. Boos.)The empirical semivariogram of residuals from a regression model withstationary errors may be used to estimate the covariance structure of the underlyingprocess.For prediction (Kriging) the bias of the semivariogram estimate induced byusing residuals instead of errors has only a minor effect because thebias is small for small lags. However, for estimating the variance of estimatedregression coefficients and of predictions,the bias due to using residuals can be quite substantial. Thus wepropose a method for reducing the bias in empirical semivariogram estimatesbased on residuals. The adjusted empirical semivariogram is then isotonizedand made positive definite and used to estimate the variance of estimatedregression coefficients in a general estimating equations setup.Simulation results for least squares and robust regression show that theproposed method works well in linear models withstationary correlated errors. Spectral Analysis with Spatial Periodogram and Data Tapers.(Under the direction of Professor Montserrat Fuentes.)The spatial periodogram is a nonparametric estimate of the spectral density, which is the Fourier Transform of the covariance function. The periodogram is a useful tool to explain the dependence structure of aspatial process.Tapering (data filtering) is an effective technique to remove the edge effects even inhigh dimensional problemsand can be applied to the spatial data in order to reduce the bias of the periodogram.However, the variance of the periodogram increases as the bias is reduced.We present a method to choose an appropriate smoothing parameter for datatapers and obtain better estimates of the spectral densityby improving the properties of the periodogram.The smoothing parameter is selected taking intoaccount the trade-off between bias and variance of the taperedperiodogram. We introduce a new asymptotic approach for spatial datacalled `shrinking asymptotics', which combines theincreasing-domain and the fixed-domain asymptotics.With this approach, the tapered spatial periodogram can be usedto determine uniquely the spectral density of the stationary process,avoiding the aliasing problem. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000822-235839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Statistical Delay Bounds Oriented Packet Scheduling Algorithms in High Speed Networks</field><field name="creator">Zhu, Kai</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Zhu, Kai. &lt;b&gt;Statistical Delay Bounds Oriented Packet Scheduling Algorithms inHigh Speed Networks.&lt;/b&gt; (Under the direction of Prof. Yannis Viniotis)&lt;P&gt;We first present a strategic analysis of end-to-end delay bounds and identify heuristics for scheduler design, then propose three new schedulers that are targeted at statistical delay bounds: Deadline-curve basedEarliest Deadline First (DC-EDF), Adaptive Quasi-Earliest Deadline First (AQE)and General Dynamic Guaranteed Rate Queueing (GDGRQ).&lt;P&gt;Under DC-EDF, local deadlines are assigned as strict time-shifted versions ofsource packet arrival times. This is quite different from the well-known RC-EDF(Rate-controlled EDF), which deploys traffic shaping at each switching node. Weshow that even without traffic shapers, DC-EDF provides not only end-to-enddelay bounds, but also a schedulable region as large as that of RC-EDF. DC-EDFis self-adaptive in local delay bound assignments. This property makes DC-EDFsuitable as the scheduler at intermediate switching nodes along a flow's route.&lt;P&gt;AQE is an enhancement of EDF with intelligence of adaptive scheduling. Under AQEpercentile delay bounds are the delay QoS metric. AQE behaves like EDF whenbandwidth is sufficient. When bandwidth becomes deficient, however, AQE onlyschedules a subset of flows which currently have relatively worse performance;other flows are completely blocked and will be unblocked only when bandwidthbecomes sufficient again. Essentially, AQE enforces shaping on packet delaydistributions. AQE is most suited for scheduling at the last switching nodealong a flow's route. The combination of DC-EDF and AQE provides a good solutiontowards statistical end-to-end delay bounds.&lt;P&gt;GDGQR is designed for networks with fixed packet sizes. It is a subclass of thewell-known Guaranteed Rate (GR) schedulers, thus can guarantee minimum rates toflows. The GR property of GDGRQ is retained through a sophisticated datastructure called cell transmission table. The unique feature of GDGRQ is that itallows controllable adaptive strategy of excess bandwidth distribution, which isrealized by short-term rate adjustment according to queue measurement. GDGRQ isa framework for designing schedulers that can both provide (possibly large)deterministic delay bounds and allow statistical delay bounds.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000911-100735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Energy-Based Boundary Element Method for High-Frequency Broadband Sound Fields in Enclosures</field><field name="creator">Rouse, Jerry Wayne</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;This work sets forth a new method for predicting the spatialvariation of mean square pressure within two-dimensionalenclosures containing high-frequency broadband sound fieldsand light to moderate absorption. In the new method, theenclosure boundaries are replaced by a continuousdistribution of broadband uncorrelated sources, each ofwhich provides a constituent field expressed in terms ofmean square pressure and time average intensity variables.Superposition of these fields leads to the overall meansquare pressure and time average intensity as a function ofposition. Boundary conditions for radiating and absorbingsurfaces are recast in terms of energy and intensityvariables. The approach is implemented as a boundaryelement formulation for efficient evaluation of the pressureand intensity fields in enclosures. In contrast totraditional boundary element methods, the new method isindependent of frequency. A two-dimensional model problemenclosure is investigated to verify the new method. The exact analytical solution for the mean square pressuredistribution within the model problem enclosure is obtainedand compared to the results predicted by the new method.The comparisons indicate that the new method is asignificant improvement upon classical diffuse field theoryand computationally efficient relative to traditional boundary element methods and ray tracing techniques.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000911-161316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exile, Home, and Identity in Toni Morrison</field><field name="creator">Audi, Evelyn L.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the research has been to develop a theory of identity that addresses Toni Morrison?s treatment of home as a metaphor for self-identity, not just an idealized locus in the past. One application of this theory has been explored in the novel Tar Baby in which Morrison addresses the predicament of homelessness in relationship to African-American love relationships. Another application of this theory deals with the problem of being at home in a cultural and psychological sense and being at home in a physical and bodily sense.&lt;p&gt; In both Beloved and Tar Baby, Toni Morrison reveals that these considerations are indivisible. There is also consideration that Beloved reveals Morrison?s theory on writing the female black body in response to the treatment of that body in historical documents. For Morrison the black female body is peripheral either in previous slave narratives or in historical master narratives. Thus, for Morrison, a theory of self-identity includes the idea that cultural and bodily identity are inseparable from notions of home and together these elements give insight into self-identity, self-direction and self-fulfillment. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000914-142830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrostatic Effects on the Physical Properties of Particulate Whey Protein Isolate Gels</field><field name="creator">McGuffey, Matthew K.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Whey protein isolate (WPI) forms particulate, heat-induced gels under conditions of low electrostatic repulsion among proteins. Particulate gels appear opaque, release water when deformed, and can be formed by 1) adjusting the pH to near the isoelectric point (pI) of beta-lactoglobulin (?pH treatment?), and 2) addition of &gt;200 mM NaCl at pH 7.0 (?NaCl treatment?). The objective of our research was to understand the electrostatic contribution to particulate gel formation, using large strain rheology and microstructural techniques to characterize gel properties.Gels of WPI (10% protein w/v) were formed by heating at 80 degrees C for 30 minutes. The large strain fracture properties of shear strain at fracture, shear stress at fracture, and slope ratio (R0.3) (indication of non-linear stress/strain behavior) were measured with a torsion gelometer. Gel microstructure was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Gel permeability (Bgel) was evaluated by measuring the flow of solvent through a fixed gel matrix and calculating the permeability coefficient based on Darcy's Law. Fracture properties for both treatments were determined from pH 5.2 to 5.8 and NaCl concentration from 0.2 to 0.6 M (pH 7). When fracture stress and fracture strain curves for pH and NaCl treatments were overlaid, there was a distinct overlap. Based on this, treatment pairs were formulated to match rheological properties. The "high stress" pair was matched at pH 5.47 and 0.25 M NaCl, pH 7.0 (fracture stress=23 kPa and fracture strain=1.86) and the "low stress" pair at pH 5.68 and 0.6 M NaCl, pH 7.0 (fracture stress=13 kPa and fracture strain=1.90). Each pair was not significantly different for fracture stress(p&gt;0.05), and there was no significant difference among all treatment pair values for fracture strain (p&gt;0.05). However, the R0.3 was treatment, not pair specific. The NaCl treatments (0.25 M NaCl, pH 7 and 0.6 M, pH 7) had R0.3 values of 1.23 and 1.26, respectively, which were not significantly different (p&gt;0.05). The gels formed at pH 5.47 and 5.68 had R0.3 values of 1.05 and 1.11, respectively, which were significantly different (p1) have been related to the presence of more than one structural component in the gel network (Bot et al., 1996). The increased strain hardening for NaCl treatments may be largely due to intermolecular disulfide bond formation, which is preferred at pH 7 relative to isoelectric pH due to the pKa of the thiol group. Random coil structure may be the other structural component that contributes to strain hardening in WPI gels, but more research is needed in this area.With the fracture properties normalized, no relationships were observed with the permeability or the microstructure between treatments. Lower permeability values were found for the treatment values (0.25 M NaCl, pH 7 and pH 5.68) near the fine-stranded transition regions (~pH 6 and 0.2 M NaCl, pH 7). These networks had more of a stranded-type structure with smaller, less defined aggregates as observed in SEM. This further demonstrates that there is little relationship between fracture rheology and microstructure of particulate gels. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000920-163429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design, Characterization, and Reactivity of Copper(I)-Zirconium(IV) Halide Analogs of Metal Chalcogenides</field><field name="creator">Dattelbaum, Andrew Martin</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;In this work, new metal-halide materials are designed by using a novel charge matching methodology whereby structural analogs of metal chalcogenides are prepared using a halide-for-chalcogenide substitution strategy. In particular, the metal-halide materials prepared herein are analogous to known phosphate, phosphonate, and silicate-based clay-type materials. Following this charge matching strategy, dimethyl ammonium cations were shown to organize copper(I) and zirconium(IV) primary building blocks into (CuZrCl6)- chains, which are analogous to the thiophosphate chains in (MPS4)-. Hydrogen bond formation to the dimethylammonium cations results in significant distortions to the metal chloride building blocks, which can be understood as second order Jahn-Teller-type distortions. In the absence of an extra-framework cation, the primary tetrahedral and octahedral building blocks were assembled into a condensed three-dimensional network Cu2ZrCl6, which is constructed from adamantane-type building blocks. Cu2ZrCl6 is shown to undergo reversible thermochromic phase changes because of a structural distortion of the cuprous chloride tetrahedra due to second-order mixing. This material also exhibits an approximately temperature independent (TIP), or Van Vleck, paramagnetism that increases at the low temperature phase transition. The change at the phase transition appears to be related to the band gap differences in the low- and high-temperature phases of Cu2ZrCl6. The reactivity of Cu+ in the presence of the Lewis acidic Zr4+ is then demonstrated by the solvothermal reaction of Cu2ZrCl6 in benzene, which breaks up the three-dimensional framework into a one-dimensional [((bz)CuCl3)2Zr]&#165; chain that is described as a metal-halide phosphonate analog. Chains of ((bz)CuCl3)2Zr are linked along the crystallographic c direction via an edge-to-face p-stacking of the coordinated benzene molecules. The crystal packing forces are shown to influence dramatic second-order Jahn-Teller distortions making each of the two ((bz)CuCl3)2- units distinct. The distortions of the distinct ((bz)CuCl3)2- units emphasize the unique donor and acceptor properties of the Cu(I) ion. Addition of ZrCl4 to the solvothermal reaction of Cu2ZrCl6 in benzene yields the molecular species (bz)2Cu2Zr2Cl10obz, which loses solvent in a stepwise fashion. These desolvated materials exhibit reversible binding of ethylene reminiscent of the reversible sorption behavior typically observed for silicate-based clays.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20000922-124541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deposition and Electrical, Chemical and Microstructural Characterization of the Interface Formed between Pt, Au and Ag Rectifying Contacts and Cleaned n-type GaN (0001) Surfaces.</field><field name="creator">Tracy, Kieran M</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The characteristics of clean n-type GaN surfaces and the interface between this surface and Pt, Au and Ag, have been investigated. Gallium-terminated (0001) surfaces of GaN, free of carbon and oxygen within the detection limits of XPS have been achieved by annealing in ammonia at 860&#176;C for 15 minutes. Additional, in-situ surface analysis indicated a flat, stoichometric, and unreconstructed surface free of other contaminants. The electron affinity of this surface was 3.1 &#177; 0.2 eV. The valence band maximum was located 3.0 &#177; 0.1 eV below the Fermi level, indicating the presence of a surface state near the valence band maximum. Individual layers of Pt, Au or Ag were deposited in-situ on the cleaned surface and the interfaces characterized using XPS, UPS, LEED and TEM. All as-deposited metal/GaN interfaces were abrupt and unreacted; the Pt and Au were deposited epitaxially. The Schottky barrier heights obtained from photoemission measurements were 1.2, 0.9 and 0.5 &#177; 0.2 eV for Pt, Au and Ag, respectively. Values of the metal work function from UPS results were 5.7, 5.3 and 4.4 &#177; 0.2 eV for Pt, Au and Ag, respectively.

The feed treatments comprised: Control Control (CC) - ad libitum fed throughout the study, Control Restricted (CR) - feed restricted from 16-24 WOA, Restricted Control (RC) - feed restricted from 3-16 WOA and Restricted Restricted (RR) - feed restricted from 3-24 WOA. Feed restriction was implemented so that restricted fed hens achieved a 45% reduction in BW as compared to Control hens at 16 WOA. From 16-24 WOA restriction was implemented to maintain a slight increase in BW. At the completion of the respective restriction period, hens were gradually released back to ad libitum feeding. At the time of photostimulation (30 WOA) all treatments were divided into sub-treatments by weight: HEAVY, MEDIUM and LIGHT, resulting in four treatments with three sub-treatments within each. All hens continued on ad libitum feeding throughout a 20 wk lay cycle. Body weight (BW) for all treatments differed significantly (P&lt;.05) at 16 and 30 WOA. At the end of lay (53 WOA) treatment CR no longer significantly differed in BW from treatment CC as did treatment RR no longer significantly differ in BW from treatment RC. Treatment CC reached maximum feed consumption at 12-15 WOA, whereas restricted treatments CR, RC and RR did not reach maximum feed consumption until just prior to photostimulation (30 WOA). At the end of the study, cumulative feed consumption was significantly less for restricted treatments. Previous research reported (Trial 1), concluded that restricting hens early in rearing preceding a lay cycle in the Winter season resulted in numerical increases in egg production. The time period for this study (Trial 2) was inverted from that of Trial 1, in that hens were photostimulated for Summer season egg production. For Trial 2, RC and RR hens laid significantly more eggs than did CC and CR hens for the first 1-5 weeks of lay (wol). However, within Trial 2, once house temperature increased to over 80-85 oF RC and RR egg production suffered dramatically, cumulating in a significant decrease in production. Hens restricted early in rearing (3-16 WOA) also cumulatively laid more soft shelled eggs and reported a decrease in hatch of fertile eggs for Trial 2. Determining why hens restricted fed early in rearing decreased egg quality and production soon after peak lay in the Summer season was a focal point of this study. Due to the fact that hens considered ?out-of-production? had circulating levels of prolactin up to 5 times less than that of hens ?in-production?, incubation behavior and broodiness were not considered to be a factor. Therefore, body composition, carcass conformation and hormonal and enzyme activity were analyzed to determine the effect feed restriction had on each of these variables. Early feed restriction reduced the percent body fat of breeder candidates while increasing the percentage of moisture and ash. Relative weights of organ and tissues samples revealed that early feed restriction resulted in a larger percentage of crop, liver and total visera for restricted fed hens. Early feed restriction also increased the percentage of bone structure regarding femur and keel bone development. However, treatments which were restricted fed early exhibited a significant reduction in absolute and relative weight of breast and thigh muscles in comparison to ad libitum fed hens at 15 WOA. Although these differences were not reported at 30 WOA on a relative basis, absolute weights remained significantly different with respect to breast muscle. This same variation with regards to breast muscle was then noted throughout the 20 wk lay cycle. The sub-treatment ?weight?, LIGHT, MEDIUM and HEAVY hens responded very much in the same manner irrespective of their initial treatment (CC, CR, RC and RR). This analysis results in the conclusion that a LIGHT hen is destined to be a LIGHT hen irrespective of her feed allotment. This phenomena is more than likely attributed to the genetic material compiled by each hen. LIGHT hens within each treatment exhibited a greater tendency for compensatory growth as compared to MEDIUM and HEAVY hens. However, egg production suffered within LIGHT hens as these hens at times laid a significantly smaller and undesirable quality of an egg. MEDIUM hens expressed a larger portion of BW through breast muscle, therefore appearing to make them the more reproductively oriented sub-treatment. In fact, MEDIUM hens did lay at a numerically higher hen housed production percentage. In conclusion, if turkey breeder hens are to lay in the Winter season, restricting feed early in rearing can prove economically beneficial. However, if hens are to lay during the Summer season, feed restriction early in rearing appears to be detrimental to subsequent reproduction in that initial breast and fat loss is never fully recuperated for the lay cycle. Therefore, feed restriction should be limited to later in rearing if any economic benefits are to be reported. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Poultry Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001009-084659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Landscape effects on breeding songbird abundance in managed southern Appalachian forests</field><field name="creator">Lichstein, Jeremy William</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Lichstein, Jeremy William. Landscape effects on breeding songbird abundance in managed southern Appalachian forests. Chair of advisory committee: Theodore R. Simons.Many studies have demonstrated adverse effects of forest fragmentation on breeding forest songbirds in North America, and the viability of regional populations is thought to depend on large, unfragmented forests. However, we know relatively little about the landscape scale consequences of management in the forested landscapes that are presumed to be important to maintaining songbird metapopulations. The southern Appalachians, a mostly forested region, contains the largest network of public lands in the eastern U.S. Most of these public lands are managed by the U.S. Forest Service. To begin to understand the landscape scale effects of forest management in the southern Appalachians, I examined the relationship between the relative abundance of different species of breeding songbirds and local and landscape scale habitat variables in two predominately mid- to late-successional National Forests in the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA: the French Broad Ranger District of Pisgah National Forest (North Carolina) and the Nolichucky Ranger District of Cherokee National Forest (Tennessee). As part of the study, I explored two statistical problems frequently encountered in species-environment analysis: count data and spatial autocorrelation. Results from classical normal-errors regression models were similar to results from Poisson and negative binomial models that explicitly model counts. Normal-errors regression models were then modified to account for spatial autocorrelation using a conditional gaussian autoregressive model. Most species, especially Neotropical migrants, were significantly correlated with at least one landscape variable. These correlations included both landscape composition (i.e., the proportion of different landcover types) and landscape pattern (i.e., the spatial arrangement of landcover types) variables at 500 m to 2 km landscape scales. However, these landscape effects explained only a small fraction of the variation in bird relative abundance, and most species appear to respond primarily to elevation and local habitat factors in my study area. My results are consistent with other studies that have reported only weak to moderate landscape effects on songbird abundance in large managed forests. These results should not be interpreted as being inconsistent with results from studies in highly fragmented forests that have reported strong effects of patch size, patch isolation, and landscape scale forest cover on breeding songbirds.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001010-181554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling and Control of Thin Film Growth in a Chemical Vapor Deposition Reactor</field><field name="creator">Beeler, Scott Colvin</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;This work describes the development of a mathematical model of ahigh-pressure chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD) reactor and nonlinearfeedback methodologies for control of the growth of thin films in thisreactor. Precise control of the film thickness and composition is highlydesirable, making real-time control of the deposition process veryimportant. The source vapor species transport is modeled by the standardgas dynamics partial differential equations, with species decompositionreactions, reduced down to a small number of ordinary differential equationsthrough use of the proper orthogonal decomposition technique. This systemis coupled with a reduced order model of the reactions on the surfaceinvolved in the source vapor decomposition and film deposition on thesubstrate wafer. Also modeled is the real-time observation technique usedto obtain a partial measurement of the deposition process. The utilization of reduced order models greatly simplifies the mathematicalformulation of the physical process so it can be solved quickly enough to beused for real-time model-based feedback control. This control problem isfairly complicated, however, because the surface reactions render the modelnonlinear. Several control methodologies for nonlinear systems are studiedin this work to determine which performs best on test examples similar tothe HPCVD problem. One chosen method is extended to a tracking control toforce certain film growth properties to follow desired trajectories. Thenonlinear control method is used also in the development of a stateestimator which uses the nonlinear partial observation of the nonlinearsystem to create an estimate of the actual state, which the feedback controlformula then can use to guide the HPCVD system. The nonlinear trackingcontrol and estimator techniques are implemented on the HPCVD model and theresults analyzed as to the effectiveness of the reduced order model andnonlinear control.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Applied Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001013-152408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Charaterization of the Growth of Aluminum Nitride and Gallium Nitride Thin Films on Hydrogen Etched and/or cleaned 6H-SiC(0001) Surfaces.</field><field name="creator">Hartman, Jeffrey David</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The surface morphology and atomic structure of nitrogen doped, n-type 6H-SiC(0001)Si wafers before and after various surface preparation techniques were investigated. As-received wafers were exposed to in-situ cleaning with or without excess silicon to obtain either a (rt3 x rt3)R30&amp;#176 or a (3 x 3) reconstructed surface. The resulting surfaces were characterized using reflection high-energy electron diffraction, photo-electron emission microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. An atomically clean, reconstructed surface was obtained via thermal annealing at 950&#186;C. Cleaning with excess silicon resulted in the formation of silicon islands on the surface. The surface morphology of hydrogen etched wafers depended upon their doping concentrations. Wafers with doping concentrations of greater than or equal 2.5 x 10E18 and less than 7 x 10E17 (ND-NA)/cm3 were investigated with the former exhibiting more surface features. The microstructure of all the samples showed regions with full and half unit cell high steps. An atomically clean, ordered, stepped surface was achieved via annealing at 1030 degrees Celcius. Chemical vapor cleaning resulted in the formation of silicon islands. The initial growth of AlN and GaN thin films on the cleaned, hydrogen etched 6H-SiC(0001) substrates were investigated using PEEM and AFM. The AlN films nucleated immediately and coalesced, except in the areas of the substrate surface which contained half unit cell height steps where pits were observed. The GaN films grown at 800&#186;C for 2.5 minutes exhibited nucleation and three-dimensional growth along the steps. The GaN films deposited at 700&amp;#176 C for 2 minutes grew three-dimensionally with coalescence of the film dependent upon the step structure. Almost complete coalescence occurred in regions with unit cell high steps and incomplete coalesce occurred in regions with half unit cell height steps. Films of AlN grown for 30 minutes via GSMBE on hydrogen etched surfaces exhibited two-dimensional growth and had an RMS roughness value of 4 &amp;Aring. Films grown at 1000 &amp;#176 C exhibited an SK growth mode and had rocking curve FWHM of 150-200 arcsecs. MOCVD grown films on hydrogen etched wafers had an RMS roughness value of 4 &amp;Aring and a XRD rocking curve FWHM of approximately 260 acrsecs. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Material Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001013-161053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BIOAVAILABILITY OF OIL-BASED AND&amp;szlig-LACTOGLOBULIN COMPLEXED VITAMIN AIN A RAT MODEL</field><field name="creator">SHAW, JU-JEAN</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;SHAW, JU-JEAN. Bioavailability of Oil-Based and &amp;szlig-Lactoglobulin Complexed Vitamin A in a Rat Model. (Chair: Jonathan C. Allen and Co-chair: Harold E. Swaisgood)The goal of this research was to determine the bioavailability of a retinyl palmitate-&amp;szlig-lactoglobulin complex in fortified skim milk and non-milk liquids using a rat model. Vitamin A plays a crucial role in many biological functions such as vision, cell differentiation, gene expression, central nervous system development, bone development and immune system function. Fluid milk products have been fortified with vitamin A (along with Vitamin D) since the 1930s to reduce the incidence of disorders caused by fat-soluble vitamin deficiency in the USA. Low-fat and non-fat fluid milk products are fortified with vitamin A and other nutrients to restore that which is removed with the lipid phase. Vitamin A preparations for milk fortification have either oil-based carriers or water-based carriers. Although it was suggested that the oil-in-water emulsions are preferred rather than oil-based preparation, vitamin A- fortified milk is often unable to comply with nutrition labeling requirements. Because retinyl palmitate, a vitamin A form most used in food products, can bind with &amp;szlig-lactoglobulin, a major component of bovine whey, in a molar ratio of 2:1, we propose &amp;szlig-lactoglobulin could be a carrier to fortify skim milk with retinyl palmitate. The bioavailability of this vitamin A-&amp;szlig-lactoglobulin complex has not been tested yet so we designed and conducted experiments to test the bioavailability of this complex in the skim milk and water-based liquids.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001014-213024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PARAMETRIC MODELING IN THE PRESENCE OF MEASUREMENT ERROR: MONTE CARLO CORRECTED SCORES</field><field name="creator">Novick, Steven Jon</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Parametric estimation is complicated when data are measured with error. The problem of regression modeling when one or more covariates are measured with error is considered in this paper. It is often the case that, evaluated at the observed error-prone data, the unbiased true-data estimating equations yield an inconsistent estimator.The proposed method is a variant of Nakamura's (1990) method of corrected scores and is closely related to the simulation-based algorithm introduced by Cook and Stefanski (1994). The corrected-score method depends critically on finding a function of the observed data having the property that its conditional expectation given the true data equals a true-data, unbiased score function. Nakamura (1990) gives corrected score functions for special cases, but offers no general solution.It is shown that for a certain class of smooth true-data score functions, a corrected score can be determined by Monte Carlo methods, if not analytically. The relationshipbetween the corrected score method and Cook and Stefanski's (1994) simulation method is studied in detail. The properties of the Monte Carlo generated corrected scorefunctions, and of the estimators they define, are also given considerable attention. Special cases are examined in detail, comparing the proposed method with establishedmethods.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001018-111251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phonons and phonon-related effects in prospective nanoscale semiconductor devices</field><field name="creator">KOMIRENKO, SERGIY MYKHAYLOVYCH</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt; The research was devoted to the theoretical investigation of lattice vibrations in low-dimensional heterostructures and bulk materials with strong polaronic coupling. The purpose of the research has been to develop the phonon theory for technologically-important materials such as nitrides of Ga and Al as well as to locate new phonon-related effects which can be utilized in artificially-created heterostructures. The electron-phonon interaction has been considered quantum mechanically.The main findings can be summarized briefly as follows: 1. Consideration of carrier-induced renormalization of acoustic phonon spectra in quantum wires revealed the possibility for the Peierls phase transition into a state with periodic lattice distortion and charge-density waves of macroscopic period in artificially-prepared structures. The phase diagram for this transition has been determined. An analytical dispersion relation for the coupled electron-phonon excitation has been derived.2. It is found that the drift of two-dimensional electrons in quantum wells can lead to efficient amplification (generation) of sub-THz coherent confined acoustic vibrations due to the Cerenkov effect when the velocity of the drifted electrons exceeds the sound velocity in the given medium. A theory has been developed to describe the confinement of acoustic modes propagating along the high-symmetry directions in cubic quantum wells.3. A theory of confinement of optical phonon modes in wurtzite quantum wells has been developed. A formalism has been derived for calculation of electron scattering rates in optically anisotropic (uniaxial) crystals and quantum wells. 4. From the comparison of the energy losses to the lattice as function of the carrier velocity obtained in frameworks of perturbative model and path-integral Thornber-Feynman approach it is found that perturbation theory can be applied for materials with intermediate polaronic coupling such a GaN and AlN. Moreover, the theoretical possibility of unique low-field runaway transport in these materials has been demonstrated. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001030-145518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of factors affecting the accuracy, reliability and validity of job analysis task ratings</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Kristin Freund</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACTMURPHY, KRISTIN FREUND. An examination of factors affecting the accuracy, reliability and validity of job analysis task ratings. (Under the direction of Mark A. Wilson.) This study examined several issues related to evaluating job analysis information. The first issue concerned the relationship between job analysis reliability and accuracy and the utilization of these variables to gain an estimation of job analysis validity. In this study, the performance on reliability and accuracy indices was compared to determine the extent to which such indices identify a consistent set of reliable and accurate raters. Similar to Green and Stutzman (1986), this study also compared the rating profile of the selected accurate and reliable raters with that of the entire rater population. The second issue concerned the impact of other individual differences concerning job tenure and experience on the validity of job analysis ratings. In addition, the effect of individual rater's fatigue may have on job analysis reliability was explored. Finally, the study addressed whether the distinction between in-role and extra-role behavior may help explain some of the variance in job analysis ratings. Thus, the study examined whether the nature of the task has any impact on job analysis reliability or accuracy. A significant relationship was found between reliability and accuracy. Highest mean reliabilities were found for the reliable raters as compared to accurate raters and the incumbent population. Thus, the impact of the reliability of raters on the validity of the instrument was demonstrated. A correlation analysis among reliability and accuracy scores and individual difference variables revealed a significant negative correlation between reliability and organization tenure. No significant relationships were found between education and reliability scores or between education and accuracy scores. An analysis of reliability over the course of a job analysis inventory showed that mean reliabilities trend downwards initially and slope slightly back upwards. The downwards trend may suggest that fatigue impacts the reliability of the rater over time. The sudden change in trend could indicate that point at which incumbents changed survey format (from computer to paper-pencil or vice-versa). Lastly, nature of the task appears have an impact on reliability of job analysis ratings as in-role task mean reliabilities were higher than extra-mean reliabilities. In sum, this study sought to explain the potential impact of the factors of accuracy, reliability, individual differences and the nature of the task on the validity of job analysis ratings. This study expands the knowledge base concerning inter-relationship among these factors and the extent to which this knowledge could lead to a model of selecting accurate and reliable job analysis subject matter experts (SMEs).&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001031-205007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Mannitol and Mannitol Dehydrogenase in Plant-Pathogen Interactions</field><field name="creator">Jennings, Dianne Brooks</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to act as both signaling molecules and direct antimicrobial agents in plant defense against pathogens. Many plant pathogens have the ability to synthesize mannitol, a potent ROS quencher, and there is growing evidence that at least some phytopathogenic fungi use mannitol to suppress ROS mediated defenses. Here we show that mannitol production and secretion in the phytopathogenic fungus, Alternaria alternata is induced in the presence of host plant extracts. Additionally we demonstrate that the catabolic enzyme mannitol dehydrogenase (MTD) is induced in a non-mannitol-producing plant in response to both fungal elicitor and specific inducers of plant defense responses. This indicates a mechanism whereby the plant can counteract fungal suppression of ROS-mediated defenses by catabolizing mannitol of fungal origin. To further clarify this interaction, tobacco plants were transformed with celery mannitol dehydrogenase cDNA under a constitutive promoter, resulting in an enzymatically active MTD protein. This constitutive MTD expression conferred enhanced resistance to A. alternata, and this resistance did not correlate with expression of PR1a, a protein often used as an indicator of systemic acquired resistance. Constitutive Mtd expression did not enhance tolerance to two non-mannitol secreting pathogens, the fungal pathogen Cercospora nicotianae and the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that MTD plays a role in plant resistance to mannitol secreting fungal pathogens by catabolizing mannitol of fungal origin. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001102-175638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Data Reduction and Model Selection with Wavelet Transforms</field><field name="creator">Martell, Leah A.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Martell, Leah. Data Reduction and Model Selection with Wavelet Transforms. (Under the directiion of Dr. J. C. Lu.)With modern technology massive quantities of data are being collectedcontinuously. The purpose of our research has been to develop amethod for data reduction and model selection applicable to large data setsand replicated data. We propose a novel wavelet shrinkage method byintroducing a new model selection criterion. The proposed shrinkage rule hasat least two advantages over the current shrinkage methods. First, it isadaptive to the smoothness of the signal regardless of whether it has a sparsewavelet representation, since we consider both the deterministic and thestochastic cases. The wavelet decomposition not only catches the signalcomponents for a pure signal, but de-noises and extracts these signalcomponents for a signal contaminated by external influences. Second, theproposed method allows for fine ``tuning'' based on the particular data athand. Our simulation studyshows that the methods based on the model selection criterion have better meansquare error (MSE)over the methods currently known. Two aspects make wavelet analysis the analytical tool of choice.First, thelargest in magnitude wavelet coefficients in the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) ofthe data, extract the relevant information, while discarding the resteliminates the noise component. Second, the DWT allows for a fast algorithmcalculation of computational complexity O(n). For the deterministic case we derive a bound on the approximation error of thenonlinear wavelet estimate determined by the largest in magnitude discrete wavelet coefficients. Upper bounds for the approximation error and the rateof increase of the number of wavelet coefficients in the model areobtained for the new wavelet shrinkage estimate. When the signal comes from astochastic process,a bound for the MSE is found, and for the bias of its estimate. A corrected version of the model selection criterion is introduced and some of its properties are studied. The new wavelet shrinkage is employed in the case of replicated data. An algorithm for model selection is proposed,based on which a manufacturing process can be automatically supervised for quality and efficiency. Weapply it to two real life examples. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001106-104839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analytical and Numerical Study of Granular Flows in Hoppers</field><field name="creator">Matthews, John V. III</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;This work investigates the characteristics of a steady state flow of granular material,under the influence of gravity, in two and three dimensional hoppers of simple geometry.Simulations of such flows are of particular interest to various industries, such as the foodand mining industries, where the handling of large quantities of granular materials in hop-persand silos is routine. While understanding and simulation of time-dependent phenomenaare the ultimate goals in this field, those phenomena are still poorly understood and thustheir study is beyond the scope of this research. It has been observed that steady flowscan provide reasonable approximations, and the corresponding steady state model has con-sequentlybeen the focus of a great deal of research. Historically, these steady state modelshave been approached using only smooth radial fields, and even today most practical hop-perdesign uses these fields as their basis. Our work represents the first time that qualitynumerical methods have been brought to bear on the model equations in their original form,without assuming smoothness of the resulting fields. Two different, yet related, models forstress/velocity consisting of systems of hyperbolic conservation laws and algebraic relationsare considered and discussed. The radial stress and velocity fields, and the stability of thosefields, are studied briefly with both analytical and numerical results presented.

Rigid bodies are subjected to simulated single component of horizontal earthquake time histories. The effect of the baseline correction, applied to simulated excitations, on the rocking response is first examined. The sensitiveness of rocking motion to the details of simulated earthquakes and the geometric properties of rigid bodies (i.e., slenderness ratio and sizeparameter) as well as the coefficient of restitution is investigated. Because of the demonstrated sensitivity of rocking response of rigid bodies to these factors, prediction of rocking stability must be made in the framework of probability theory. Therefore, using a large number of simulated earthquakes, the effects of duration and shape of intensity function of simulated earthquakes on the overturning probability of rigid bodies are next studied. In the case when a rigid body is placed on any floor of a building, the corresponding overturning probability is compared to that of a body placed on theground. For this purpose, several shear frames with fundamental natural period of vibration ranging from 0.5 sec(stiff) to 2.0 sec (flexible) are employed. Finally, the viability of the energy balance equation which was introduced by Housner in 1963 (The behavior of inverted pendulum structures during earthquakes, Bulletin of Seismological Society of America, 53, 2, 403-417) and widelyused by the nuclear power industry to estimate the rocking stability of rigid bodies is evaluated. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001108-020814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Methodology for Furniture Finishing System Capacity Planning</field><field name="creator">Melton, Ryan Heath</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;This research developed a methodology for the capacity planning of a furniture finishing system using both deterministic analysis and stochastic simulation.

The Excel-based interface de-couples data input from the simulation model construction and execution. This provides a user-friendly tool for analyzing a finishing system. A manufacturing manager unfamiliar with simulation techniques can use the interface to conduct simulations and experiment with various input parameters such as line loading techniques and line speeds. Through the interface, results from the simulation can be used in an iterative process to analyze and refine design parameters of the finishing system.

Effects of Block Scheduling on the Level of Student Achievement of Agricultural Education Students in North Carolina. Under the direction of Dr. Jim Flowers. The primary purpose of this study was to determine the impact of block scheduling on VoCATS scores of Agricultural Education students in North Carolina. The research objectives of this study were to determine if block scheduling affects student performance on VoCATS assessments and to determine if there is a relationship between size of school and level of achievement of students on block scheduling. Data were collected using the survey method. Surveys were mailed to VoCATS coordinators of identified schools. The data were collected during the late summer of 1999. The use of block scheduling is prevalent in high schools in North Carolina. According to analysis of data, overall block scheduling does not have a significant affect on student achievement, however there were areas of significant differences noted. School size as an interaction with schedule type does not affect student achievement, however data analysis of schedule type reveled that it was significant in the interaction between schedule and school size of Horticulture I mastery scores. More research to determine effects of block scheduling other than just student achievement was recommended. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural and Extension Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001109-130251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fiber Crimp And Crimp Stability In Nonwoven Fabric Processes</field><field name="creator">Bauer-Kurz, Ina</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Bauer-Kurz, Ina. Fiber Crimp and Crimp Stability in Nonwoven Fabric Processes. (Under the direction of Dr. William Oxenham and Dr. Donald A. Shiffler.)In nonwovens, crimp characteristics of synthetic fibers are, along with finish, major contributors to processing efficiency, web cohesion, fabric bulk and bulk stability. However, the meaning of measurable crimp parameters and their influence on processing and fabric characteristics has not been quantified. The purpose of this study is to quantify the mechanical fiber behavior during crimp removal, and relate it to fundamental fiber properties, nonwoven fabric properties, and processibility in nonwoven equipment.Single fiber tensile tests in the crimp removal region have been performed on various fibers with the Textechno FAVIMAT and have also been monitored optically. Based on empirical evidence, a basic understanding of the physical crimp removal mechanism is obtained. A methodology is developed, to identify the true crimp removal region of the whole single fiber load-extension curve during a tensile test. A mechanical model accounting for the nonlinear load-deflection behavior during crimp removal is developed. According to this model, a logarithmic function can be used to describe the material behavior in the crimp node during crimp removal. This function is fit to experimental data and delivers two fitting parameters that characterize the shape of the experimental load-extension curve in the crimp region.The extracted characteristic crimp parameters are being evaluated in terms of fiber material characteristics, such as fiber type, crimp processing settings and carding performance during nonwoven production. A dependence of the shape of the crimp removal curve on crimping settings during crimp production is established. The characteristic crimp parameters are also correlated to the sequence of processing stages during nonwoven production and cylinder speed during carding.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiber and Polymer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001109-183351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Engineering Design Approach for Accelerating Innovative Design Solutions in a Rapid Prototyping Environment</field><field name="creator">Gibson, Nathan Scott</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;With time as a major competitive factor in today's marketplace, it is crucial to bring products to the market and solve problems in existing products in a swift manner. Rapid prototyping methods are very effective ways of streamlining this effort. However, current rapid prototyping methods generally apply after a solution concept has been selected. Many current conceptual design methods were reviewed and it was shown that a need exists for similar acceleration of the problem identification, idea generation, and concept selection portions of the design process. This would bring the conceptual front end of the design process under the umbrella of what is considered "rapid prototyping". The Ideal Final Result (IFR) of each of the three major conceptual steps was developed to be able to formulate a series of steps to accelerate the process by performing only what is necessary to accomplish the IFR's. The existing methods and custom-designed methods provided for filling in what was needed for each step. An "Ideality-based" concept selection method was developed to make the idea selection process more complete. The entire methodology is explained in detail, and a case study to use the new methodology was performed on an existing, real problem situation to show the useful and accelerated nature of the method. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001110-123920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS OF COMPLETE PHASE EQUILIBRIA FOR BINARY MIXTURES</field><field name="creator">Hitchcock, Monica Renee</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The objective of this thesis is to study the phase equilibria ofbinary mixtures using molecular simulation. Vapor-liquid,vapor-solid, liquid-liquid, and liquid-solid coexistence lines arecalculated for binary mixtures of Lennard-Jones spheres using MonteCarlo simulation and the Gibbs-Duhem integration technique. Completephase diagrams, i.e., showing all types equilibrium betweenvapor, liquid, and solid phases are constructed. The calculations presented in this thesismark the first time that molecular simulation hasbeen used to obtain phase diagrams describing all types of equilibriabetween vapor, liquid, and solid phases.We present complete phase diagrams for binary Lennard-Jones mixtureswith diameter ratios ranging from 0.85 to 0.95 and attractivewell-depth ratios ranging from 0.45 to 1.6, at reduced pressuresranging from 0.002 to 0.1. The Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules areused to calculate the cross-species interaction parameters. Wesystematically explore how the complete phase diagrams change as afunction of the diameter ratio, well-depth ratio, binaryinteraction parameter, and system pressure.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;We first calculate complete phase diagrams for several binary mixtures at a single pressure and find that for well-depth ratios of unity (equal attractions among species) there is no interference between the vapor-liquid and solid-liquid coexistence regions. As the well-depth ratio increases or decreases from unity, the vapor-liquid and solid-liquid phase envelopes widen and interfere with each other, leading to the appearance of a solid-vapor coexistence region. For diameter ratios of 0.95, the solid-liquid lines have a shape characteristic of a solid solution (with or without a minimum melting temperature); as the diameter ratio decreases the solid-liquid lines fall to lower temperatures until they eventually drop below the solid-solid coexistence region, resulting in either a eutectic or peritectic three-phase line.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;We then vary the binary interaction parameter in the Berthelotcombining rule to study the effect of unlike pair attractions onbinary mixture phase behavior. When the binaryinteraction parameter is unity we find a vapor-liquid coexistence region with a eutectic solid-liquidcoexistence region. These two regions are separated by a completelymiscible liquid phase. When the binary interactionparameter is less than unity we find that the vapor-liquid andsolid-liquid coexistence regions interfere. This interference resultsin the appearance of a vapor-solid coexistence region bounded above and below bysolid-liquid-vapor coexistence lines. We also find that when the binary interaction parameter is less than unity, there is a region ofliquid-liquid immiscibility that is metastable with respect to thesolid-fluid phase equilibria.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Next we calcuate temperature versus composition phase diagrams for one mixture at five reduced pressures in order to examine the effects of pressure on complete phase behavior. We observe interference between the vapor-liquid and solid-liquid coexistence regions at the lowest pressure. As the pressure increases, the vapor-liquid coexistence region shifts to higher temperatures, while the solid-liquid coexistence region remains essentially unaffected. Eventually, the vapor-liquid coexistence region lifts off the solid-liquid coexistence region, ending the interference. We then present pressure versus temperature projections for several mixtures to explore how the three-phase loci change with variations in diameter ratio and well-depth ratio. We find that as the diameter ratio decreases, the maximum pressure in the solid-liquid-vapor locus decreases and the characteristic shape of the solid-liquid coexistence region changes from peritectic to eutectic. As the well-depth ratio decreases, the maximum pressure in the solid-liquid-vapor locus increases.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001110-142041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Statistical Inference for Gap Data</field><field name="creator">Yang, Liqiang</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;This thesis research is motivated by a special type of missing data - Gap Data, which was first encountered in a cardiology study conducted at Duke Medical School. This type of data include multiple observations of certain event time (in this medical study the event is the reopenning of a certain artery), some of them may have one or more missing periods called ``gaps'' before observing the``first'' event. Therefore, for those observations, the observed first event may not be the true first event because the true first event might have happened in one of the missing gaps. Due to this kind of missing information, estimating the survival function of the true first event becomes very difficult. No research nor discussion has been done on this type of data by now. In this thesis, the auther introduces a new nonparametric estimating method to solve this problem. This new method is currently called Imputed Empirical Estimating (IEE) method. According to the simulation studies, the IEE method provide a very good estimate of the survival function of the true first event. It significantly outperforms all the existing estimating approaches in our simulation studies. Besides the new IEE method, this thesis also explores the Maximum Likelihood Estimate in thegap data case. The gap data is introduced as a special type of interval censored data for thefirst time. The dependence between the censoring interval (in the gap data case is the observedfirst event time point) and the event (in the gap data case is the true first event) makes the gap data different from the well studied regular interval censored data. This thesis points of theonly difference between the gap data and the regular interval censored data, and provides a MLEof the gap data under certain assumptions.The third estimating method discussed in this thesis is the Weighted Estimating Equation (WEE)method. The WEE estimate is a very popular nonparametric approach currently used in many survivalanalysis studies. In this thesis the consistency and asymptotic properties of the WEE estimateused in the gap data are discussed. Finally, in the gap data case, the WEE estimate is showed to be equivalent to the Kaplan-Meier estimate. Numerical examples are provied in this thesis toillustrate the algorithm of the IEE and the MLE approaches.

Jack Johnson: Victim or Villain. (Under the direction of Dr. Linda McMurry, Dr. Pamela Tyler, and Dr. Walter Jackson.)Jack Johnson reigned as the first African-American heavyweight champion of the world from 1908 until 1915. Unfortunately, unlike future African-American athletes such as Joe Louis and Jackie Robinson, Jack Johnson infuriated Americans of all ages, classes, races, and sexes with his arrogant attitude; his expensive and usually imported automobiles, champagne, and cigars; his designer clothes and jewelry; his frequent trips to Europe, usually in the company of at least one beautiful white woman; his inclination to gamble and race sports cars; and his many well-publicized nights of dancing and playing jazz on his prized seven foot bass fiddle. However, his worst offenses, during his reign as heavyweight champion, were his two marriages to and numerous affairs with white women. The purpose of the research has been to place Jack Johnson within the context of late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century culture, economics, law, politics, race, and sex. The influences of late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century American commercialization, immigration, industrialization, and urbanization on perceptions of femininity, masculinity, sexuality, and violence are investigated; and the implications of Jack Johnson?s defiance of racial and sexual constraints on the African-American community are interpreted.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001114-192450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Riparian Buffers and Controlled Drainageon Shallow Groundwater Quality in the North CarolinaMiddle Coastal Plain</field><field name="creator">Dukes, Michael Dale</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt; Degradation of water quality in the streams and estuaries of North Carolina in recent years has resulted in regulations to reduce the introduction of numerous types of contaminants to this system. In the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins, excessive amounts of nitrogen have been identified as causing increased algal growth, low dissolved oxygen concentrations, and have been linked to increased growth of toxic microorganisms such as Pfiesteria piscicida. There are numerous sources of nitrogen to the basins; however, agricultural nonpoint sources have been identified as the largest contributor of nitrogen. Riparian buffers, controlled drainage, and nutrient management have been identified as effective BMPs for reducing nitrogen transport to streams under many landscape conditions. As a result, a combination of nutrient management, controlled drainage, and riparian buffer best management practices have been mandated in the Neuse River Basin to reduce the loss of agricultural nonpoint source pollution. A large portion of the agricultural nonpoint source nitrogen losses to surface waters in the Neuse River Basin originate in the Middle Coastal Plain. These lands are drained by irregularly spaced first and second order streams that have often been channelized (i.e. deepened) to enhance drainage. The riparian vegetation has often been removed from these channelized streams. The effectiveness of riparian buffers and controlled drainage are not well documented under these landscape conditions that are common in the Middle Coastal Plain region. Controlled drainage may not be economical in this region because multiple control structures would be required to maintain a suitable water table elevation in this gently sloping landscape. Implementation of riparian buffers has met strong resistance from the agricultural community due to the potential loss of land. A few studies have also found that nitrogen rich groundwater may enter deeply incised or channelized streams below the active treatment zone of the buffer, rendering the buffer ineffective. A study to evaluate the effect of riparian buffer vegetation type and width on shallow groundwater quality was implemented at the Center for Environmental Farming Systems near Goldsboro, North Carolina. The effect of controlled drainage, riparian buffers, and a combination of both was studied. The hydrologic portion of the riparian ecosystem management model (REMM) was evaluated and tested against field measurements.Five riparian buffer vegetation types were established as follows: cool season grass (fescue), deep-rooted grass (switch grass), forest (pine trees), native vegetation, and no buffer (no-till corn and rye rotation). These vegetation types were established at two buffer widths perpendicular to the channelized streams, 8 m (25 ft) and 15 m (50 ft). In addition, a continuous native vegetation buffer under free drainage and a continuous no buffer treatment under controlled drainage was established. For about 50% of the time monitored, the 15 m riparian buffer plots resulted in a statistically lower NO3-N concentration in the mid depth ditch wells (screen depth 1.5-2.1 m below ground surface) compared to the 8 m plots. Width was not a statistically significant variable at the deep well depth (2.1-3.5 m screen depth). Vegetation type had no statistically significant effect on NO3-N concentration. Nitrate concentration decreased 69 and 28% as groundwater flowed beneath the 8 m wide riparian buffer plots toward the channelized streams and 84 and 43% in the 15 m plots, at the deep and mid depth, respectively. The wider buffers were approximately 15% more effective at removing nitrate, but the improvement was not linearly correlated to the width increase. The primary reason vegetation differences were not observed was likely due to the limited time for vegetation establishment and development during the relatively short 2.5 year study period. Five years or longer may be required for some types of vegetation to mature to the point of impacting the nitrogen in the shallow groundwater. Furthermore, differences in localized groundwater flow paths and soil physical and chemical properties may indefinitely over shadow vegetation effects at this site. Controlled drainage did not raise the water table elevation near the ditch as compared to the free drainage treatment. Over seventeen storm events, the riparian buffer (free drainage) treatment had an average groundwater table depth of 0.92 m, compared to 0.96 and 1.45 m for the combination and controlled drainage treatments, respectively. Again, the lack of hydrologic treatment effect may be due to localized differences in soil properties and groundwater flow paths. Percent NO3-N concentration decrease for those treatments was 22 and 35%, 75 and 51%, and 77 and 69%, for the deep and mid depth wells, for each respective treatment. Although more nitrate was apparently removed from the groundwater on the controlled drainage treatments, this effect could not be correlated to water table depth.Daily predicted water table depth from the riparian ecosystem management model (REMM) was compared to observed depths over a simulation period of two years. The model performed well during some periods but poorly during large storm events. Average absolute errors ranged from 150 to 650 mm. Model instability during large storm events and anomalies in evapotranspiration calculations must be addressed before this model can be a reliable planning tool for regions such as the Middle Coastal Plain of North Carolina.Based on this research, several recommendations for further study are presented. Monitoring of riparian buffer vegetation plots should continue with the expectation that vegetation may have a significant impact over time as the vegetation types become established. Eventually the vegetation in the buffer will reach a steady state with respect to nitrogen in the buffer; however, this may take many years. Quantification of the relative proportion of dilution and denitrification for a given nitrate concentration decrease beneath the buffers should be investigated. One approach would be installation of redox probes at the deep well depth to give an indication if conditions are favorable (i.e. reducing) for denitrification. Also, the deep groundwater (i.e. below the impermeable layer) chemistry should be compared to the shallow groundwater chemistry to determine the relative proportions of constituents such as calcium and magnesium. This analysis would give an indication if dilution of the shallow groundwater were occurring as a result of deep groundwater upwelling. The REMM simulations may be improved by measuring groundwater velocity into the riparian buffer, improving the estimates of surface water runoff into the riparian buffers, and by modifying the model to simulate a single buffer zone rather than three.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological and Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001115-105028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">U.S. Trends in Short Staple Spinning</field><field name="creator">Dodd, Erin Linnea</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this research has been to examine possible factors which effect yarn production and prices in the U.S.The research approach first involved gathering the data from different sources about yarn production and prices.

These factors included enduse demand, cotton consumption, the effect of spinning systems, labor cost and demand, machinery hours and shipments, and the level of imports and exports. Third, the data was compared and conclusions were made based solely on the obvious trends in the data. Fourth, current situations in the textile market were examined in order to conclude if any have had an effect on yarn production and price. The main issues which are facing the textile industry and were included in this analysis were NAFTA, CBI, Asia and the WTO. The effect that these have had and will have on the spinning industry was examined in detail. Fifth, a statistical analysis was conducted. The analysis included the use of a correlation matrix for both yarn production levels and yarn prices in order to see which factors statistically had the strongest impact on these.

In- and Ex-Situ Analysis of SiliconOxide, Silicon Oxynitride, and Silicon Nitride Interfaces bySecond Harmonic Generation and Correlation with Other LinearOptical Techniques. (Under the direction of David E. Aspnes.)Our objective is to gain insight about the physics and chemistry of silicon-dielectric (mainly Si-SiO) interfaces by nondestructive optical techniques: in-situ second harmonic generation (SHG) after interface processing, and ex-situ SHG, spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), and reflectance difference spectroscopy (RDS) before and after high temperature anneals. The linear optical spectroscopies, SE and RDS, illustrate differences in dielectric responses due to chemical differences at interfaces and vicinal-sample cut directions, and assist in the interpretation of the SHG data. We analyzed the SHG anisotropy with a primitive phenomenological model that associates adjustable parameters for electric field amplitude and phase to each Fourier component expected in the observed anisotropy. Ambiguities of this model limited our ability to interpret the SHG data in terms of the parameters found by least squares analysis. To overcome these limitations we introduce a new model that describes SHG data in terms of the microscopic nonlinear polarization of individual bonds, and generates the observed far-field radiation in terms of dipole radiation resulting from these bonds. The adjustable parameters in this microscopic model correspond to complex polarizabilities along each of the onds. Our results show that the nonlinear polarizabilitiesperpendicular to the bonds do not need to be considered, asexpected from the essentially rotationally symmetric nature of the bonds. This greatly simplifies the model by reducing the set of needed parameters to those describing polarization along the bonds. We show that specific lineshape features in the azimuthal dependencies can be related to specific bond properties, allowing in some cases bond properties such as nonlinear absorption to be detected by inspection. We use least squares analysis to obtain changes in bond polarizabilities that occur before and after the anneal procedure. We conclude with a qualitative description of the results of the linear spectroscopic experiments.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001117-154856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interpolation Methods for the Bayer Color Array</field><field name="creator">Ramanath, Rajeev</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;RAMANATH, RAJEEV.

This requires that the data be interpolated to recover all the scene information. Many existing interpolation (demosaicking) algorithms that can reconstruct the scene use modifications of the bilinear interpolation method, intro-ducing a variety of artifacts in the images. These algorithms have been investi-gated. A new method for restoring these color images using an optimization method known as Mean Field Annealing is introduced using a variety of image prior models.

The biologically-based controlled growth and differentiation model is based on a model originally developed by Leroux et al. (1996). The original model had two basic states; precursor cells and differentiated cells with both states subject to a linear birth-death process. The research discussed in this dissertation describes the development of a mathematical model that is both biologically- and statistically-based. The model is developed with a highly controlled birth and death process for precursor cells. This model limits the number of replications allowed in the development of a tissue or organ and more closely reflects the presence of a true stem cell population. The mathematical formulation of the Leroux et al. (1996) model was derived from a partial differential equation for the generating function that limits further expansion into more realistic models of mammalian development. The same formulae for the probability of a defect (a system of ordinary differential equations) can be derived through the Kolmogorov forward equations due to the nature of this Markov process. This modified approach is easily amenable to the expansion of more complicated models of the developmental process. Comparisons between the Leroux et al. (1996) model and the controlled growth and differentiation (CGD) model are also discussed.The versatility of the CGD model is highlighted through a discussion of two general applications. The normal developmental process of spermatocytogenesis is investigated as the first application. Time delays are introduced into the system to more accurately mimic the development of male germ cells. As the second application, the spermatocytogenesis model is then altered to demonstrate a modeling strategy for hormesis. Asymptotic stability is investigated using the system of delay differential equations for spermatocytogenesis. The direct Lyapunov method for linear differential equations without delay is modified to establish delay-dependent stability conditions for delay differential equations with multiple delays. The stability conditions are expressed in terms of the existence of a positive definite solution to the Riccati matrix equations. Numerical simulations further verify the stability conditions.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001120-152601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determination of the Fracture Parameters in a StiffenedComposite Panel</field><field name="creator">LIN, CHUNG-YI</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;A modified J-integral, namely the equivalent domain integral, is derived for athree-dimensional anisotropic cracked solid to evaluate the stress intensity factor alongthe crack front using the finite element method. Based on the equivalent domain integralmethod with auxiliary fields, an interaction integral is also derived to extract the secondfracture parameter, the T-stress, from the finite element results. The auxiliary fields arethe two-dimensional plane strain solutions of monoclinic materials with the plane ofsymmetry at x3=0 under point loads applied at the crack tip. These solutions areexpressed in a compact form based on the Stroh formalism. Both integrals can beimplemented into a single numerical procedure to determine the distributions of stressintensity factor and T-stress components, T11, T13, and thus T33, along a three-dimensionalcrack front.The effects of plate thickness and crack length on the variation of the stressintensity factor and T-stresses through the thickness are investigated in detail for through-thicknesscenter-cracked plates (isotropic and orthotropic) and orthotropic stiffenedpanels under pure mode-I loading conditions. For all the cases studied, T11 remainsnegative. For plates with the same dimensions, a larger size of crack yields largermagnitude of the normalized stress intensity factor and normalized T-stresses. The resultsin orthotropic stiffened panels exhibit an opposite trend in general. As expected, for thethicker panels, the fracture parameters evaluated through the thickness, except the regionnear the free surfaces, approach two-dimensional plane strain solutions. In summary, thenumerical methods presented in this research demonstrate their high computationaleffectiveness and good numerical accuracy in extracting these fracture parameters fromthe finite element results in three-dimensional cracked solids.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001122-103139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population biology and genetics of Rhizoctonia solani anastomosis group 3 (AG-3)</field><field name="creator">Ceresini, Paulo cezar</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt; Anastomosis group 3 (AG-3) of Rhizoctonia solani is frequently associated with diseases of potato and tobacco. Although isolates from the two hosts are taxonomically related, previous studies have shown differences in their biology, fatty acid composition, pathogenicity and ribosomal DNA. However, the genetic diversity of populations of R. solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco are not known. In this study, the genetic diversity of field populations of R. solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco in North Carolina were examined using somatic compatibility and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP). A sample of 32 isolates from potato and 36 from tobacco were paired in all possible combinations on PDA plus activated charcoal and glass slides and examined for somatic interactions. Approximately 5% of tobacco isolates and less than 0.5% of potato isolates were somatically compatible. Twenty-eight and eight distinct somatic compatibility groups (SCG) were identified in the potato and tobacco samples, respectively. AFLP analyses indicated that the potato sample of R. solani AG-3 was more genetically diverse (32 AFLP patterns) than the tobacco sample (26 AFLP patterns). None of the potato or tobacco isolates were somatically compatible or shared a common AFLP pattern. Clones (i.e., cases where two or more isolates were somatically compatible and shared the same AFLP pattern) were identified only in the tobacco sample. Eight clones of R. solani AG-3 from tobacco represented 22% of the total sample. All eight SCG of R. solani AG-3 from tobacco were associated with more than one AFLP pattern. Compatible interactions between potato isolates only occurred between isolates from the same field (two isolates in each of four different fields), with similar but not identical AFLP pattern. For analysis of the population structure of R. solani AG-3 from potato, a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was used to identify and differentiate genotypes. A population sample of 104 isolates from five counties in eastern NC was analyzed using polymorphic codominant single-locus PCR-RFLP markers identified after sequencing and screening anonymous DNA from a fungal genomic library. Multilocus genotypes were determined screening isolates using combinations of PCR product/polymorphic enzyme for each locus, generating seven PCR-RFLP markers. There was evidence for high levels of gene flow between populations of R. solani AG-3. The five samples were genetically similar with one another. When data was clone-corrected and samples pooled into one single population from NC, random associations of alleles within and between loci were found for all the loci or pairs of loci, indicating random mating. However, when all genotype were analyzed the observed genotypic diversity deviated from panmixia and alleles within and between loci were not randomly associated. These findings support a model of population structure for R. solani AG-3 on potato that includes both recombination and clonality. This study describes the application of a population genetics-based statistical method for detecting migration in populations of R. solani AG-3 from potato using multilocus PCR-RFLP genotypes. The effect of migration from source populations of the pathogen on potato seed tuber on the magnitude of gene flow with a recipient (soil population) in NC was also examined. Analysis of genetic data indicated that the NC population of R. solani AG-3 has experienced recent migration. There was also an indication of high levels of gene flow between the source and the recipient population. Unidirectional migration from source population(s) followed by establishment of migrant genotypes in the recipient population, through colonization, is postulated to explain the high level of gene flow observed.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001122-164118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital Vegetation Delineation on Scanned Orthorectified Aerial Photography of Petersburg National Battlefield</field><field name="creator">Millinor, William A.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;I developed a new methodology to produce an orthorectified mosaic and a vegetation database of Petersburg National Battlefield using mostly digital methods. Both the mosaic and the database meet National Map Accuracy Standards and proved considerably faster than traditional aerial photograph interpretation methods. I classified vegetation polygons to the formation level using the Nature Conservancy?s National Vegetation Classification System. Urban areas were classified using Mitchell?s Classification Scheme for Urban Forest Mapping with Small-Scale Aerial Photographs. This method reduced the production time by 2/3, compared to traditional methods. It also reduced the chance of user error because re-tracing of the linework is not required. &lt;P&gt;My method started with scanning 75 aerial color IR photos, provided by Petersburg National Battlefield, at 600 dpi. Erdas Imagine was used to rectify the images using United States Geological Service (USGS) Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and black and white USGS Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangles (DOQQ) as reference. The images were then mosaiced to create a seamless color infrared orthorectified basemap of the park. The vegetation polygons were drawn onscreen using ArcMap from Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI) with the color, orthorectified mosaic as a background image. Stereo pairs of the aerial photos were referenced as needed for clarification of the vegetation. I used a minimum mapping unit (mmu) of 0.2 hectares, which exceeds guidelines defined by the United States Geological Survey ? National Park Service Vegetation Mapping Program. This methodology is easily learned quickly and has already been applied to several other studies. &lt;P&gt;The production of an orthorectified mosaic, created during the process, from the aerial photographs greatly increases the value of the photographs at little additional cost to the user. The orthorectified basemap can then be used as a backdrop for existing data layers or it can be used to create new GIS data layers. I used a minimum mapping unit (mmu) of 0.2 hectare, which exceeds guidelines defined by the United States Geological Survey-National Park Service Vegetation Mapping Program&lt;P&gt;Traditionally, vegetation polygons are delineated on acetate for each photograph. The linework on the acetates is then transferred to a basemap using a zoom transfer scope or other transfer instrument. The linework is traced again to digitize it for use in a GIS program. This process is time consuming, and the linework is drawn three times. The redundant tracing increases the chance of user error. My new methodology requires that polygons be delineated only once. I wanted to avoid using the zoom transfer scope and to avoid the redundant linework.&lt;P&gt;A total of 228 polygons were delineated over 20 separate vegetation and land cover classes with an overall thematic accuracy of 87.42% and a Kappa of .8545. Positional accuracy was very good with a RMSE of 1.62 meters in the x direction and 2.81 meters in the y direction. The Kappa and RMSE values compare favorably with accuracies obtained using traditional vegetation mapping methods.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001123-131211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constitutive Modeling of the Unloading Behavior of Paper Material Using the Asymtotic Fiber and Bond Model</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yun Yeng</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;AbstractWANG, YUN YENG. Constitutive Modeling of the Unloading Behavior of Paper Material Using the Asymptotic Fiber and Bond Model. (Under the direction of Dr. M. K. Ramasubramanian)Current constitutive models for paper and paperboard material are focused on the prediction of the sheet stress-strain behavior during loading. The unloading process has not been widely addressed. This work will focus on modeling the unloading behavior of paper material in one- and two-dimensional problems. For the one-dimensional problem, i.e. uniaxial tensile test, the asymptotic fiber and bond model by Sinha (1994) is extended to determine the plastic (permanent strain) of a sample upon unloading. In Sinha's micromechanics model, a representative load bearing, i.e. fiber at a fiber-to-fiber bond site, was used to derive the fiber stress and subsequently the sheet stress. In the asymptotic fiber and bond model, the fiber and bond condition (of elasticity or plasticity) was assumed to be the same throughout the fiber. In this work, the fiber and bond begins in elastic state. As the applied load or strains increase, the bond yields, while fiber remains elastic throughout the loading process. When unloading, both fiber and bond behave elastically. The model parameters for the asymptotic fiber and bond are obtained by fitting the model to experimental data from uniaxial stress-strain curves. The unloading model is then used to predict the plastic strain after unloading of uniaxially strained samples. The model prediction corresponds well with the experimental data. For a two-dimensional problem, a sample was deformed in a Mullen burst tester and then unloaded. A Mullen tester is used to conduct burst test by applying a uniform pressure to one surface of the sample that is clamped down on the pressure chamber. In a burst test, the sample deforms into hemispherical shape and eventually fails with a 'H' pattern in the center. For testing the unloading model, the sample is deformed to a given pressure and unloaded. The central displacement of the sample throughout the loading and unloading process is recorded together with the applied pressure, for comparison with model predictions. Since the asymptotic fiber and bond model has limited application in one-dimensional problems, a combination of continuum and micromechanics methods was used by Sinha and Perkins (1995) to reap the benefits the two types of approach have to offer. The hybrid model was applied in finite element analysis using the finite element analysis code ABAQUS and its user subroutine UMAT. A similar approach was utilized in this work to model the unloading process in two-dimensional problems. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001127-081238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radio Frequency Applications of Barium Strontium Titanate Thin Film Tunable Capacitors</field><field name="creator">Tombak, Ali</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;TOMBAK, Ali.

Methodology: Subjects were recruited from Caucasian Control (CC) (n=10), African American Control (AC) (n=10), Caucasian Diabetics (CD) (n=5), African American Diabetics (AD) (n=10) groups. The diabetics were type II diabetics on daily insulin injections (age and sex-matched in both racial groups). The evaluations consisted of: three day dietary record, serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TRG), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), glucose (Glu), hemoglobin A1C (A1C), insulin (Ins) levels and RBC membrane lipid composition including, fatty acids, phospholipids (PL), cholesterol (CH) and RBC insulin binding (IB), RESULTS: Cholesterol intake did not show any correlations with any blood constituents, membrane lipids or membrane properties. The macronutrient intake did not show a significant correlation with blood lipid levels, membrane properties and the anthropometric measurements as expected.

The CH/PL revealed strong correlation between LDL (r=0.42, P &lt;0.01) and HDL (r= -0.56, P &lt;0.05). The PM trans fatty acid levels (TFA) were highest in AD (P &lt;0.01), but no correlations with IB &amp; Glu. The PM saturated/polyunsaturated ratio (S/P) was higher in diabetics (P &lt;0.05) correlating with insulin level (r= 0.42, P &lt;0.01) &amp; IB (r= -0.45, P &lt;0.05), but no correlations with serum lipids occurred. The PL analysis showed no significant group differences for phosphatidyl inositol (PI) levels; however, significant racial differences were observed in phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidyl choline (PC). The W showed higher PE levels than BL and lower PC. The RBC rheological (PE/PS) properties (deformability) was lower in diabetics and AC than CC. The saturated nature of RBC [(SPH+PC)/(PE+PS)] was the lowest in CC (P&lt; 0.056). The combination of increased S/P, and increased saturated nature, decreased PE/PS, increased CH/PL indicate decreased membrane fluidity and decreased RBC deformability, which might contribute to decreased IB in DMII. Differences in PE and PC levels between BL and W possibly indicate a racial difference in cause of insulin resistance. The racial differences in developing DMII need to be recognized so the therapeutic agents can target the exact problem in the metabolic pathway to correct the insulin resistance.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001130-153236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Implementation of Differentiated Services In A Linux Environment</field><field name="creator">Narasimhan, Kesava Prasad</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Narasimhan, Kesava Prasad. An Implementation of Differentiated Services In A Linux Environment. (Under the direction of Dr. Yannis Viniotis and Dr. Mladen Vouk.)The purpose of this project has been to implement a differentiated services (diffserv) router in software in a Linux environment. The objective is to enable the construction of a test-bed of such diffserv routers. One of the design goals is to make the software as modular as possible. This permits the various modules of the diffserv router to be configured easily. In addition, a very user-friendly script file interface was designed to configure the diffserv modules. Consideration was also given to the fact that in future, this code is expected to be integrated with a policy server. In this project, the emphasis was on functionality and not on performance. Hence, not much effort was taken towards optimizing the performance of the diffserv router. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001205-201236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Global Modeling of Nonlinear Microwave Circuits</field><field name="creator">Christoffersen, Carlos Enrique</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;A global modeling concept for modeling microwave circuits isdescribed. This concept allows the modeling of electromagnetic (EM)and thermal effects to be included in the simulation of electroniccircuits, by viewing EM and thermal subsystems as subcircuits. Then,circuit analysis techniques are developed from a general statevariable reduction formulation. This general formulation, based on thestate variables of the nonlinear devices, allows the analysis of largemicrowave circuits because it reduces the size of the nonlinear systemof equations to be solved. One of the derived analysis techniques isbased on convolution and therefore provides modeling offrequency-defined network elements not present in conventional circuitsimulators. Another analysis technique based on wavelets that wouldenable the multiresolution analysis of circuits is investigated. Also,a reduced state variable formulation using conventional time marchingschemes is developed. It is shown that this can achieve more than anorder of magnitude improvement in simulation speed compared to that oftraditional circuit simulation methods. All these developments areimplemented in a circuit simulator program, called Transim. Thisprogram provides unprecedented flexibility for the addition of newdevice models or circuit analysis algorithms. Transim supports thelocal reference concept, which is fundamental to the analysis ofspatially distributed circuits and also to simultaneousthermal-electrical simulations. Transim is applied to the transientsimulation of a 47-section nonlinear transmission line consideringfrequency dependent attenuation for the first time and the transientsimulation, also for the first time, of two quasi-optical poweramplifier arrays.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001206-175435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Classification and Predictive Modeling of Plant Communities in the Gorges State Park and Gamelands, North Carolina</field><field name="creator">Phillips, Ross Johnson</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;A method of rapid field assessment and predictive modeling was developed to characterize vegetation communities of the Gorges State Park and Gamelands and to create predictive community maps for the area.

Three sets of discriminant functions were created to meet the different needs of persons interested in using these maps.

One proposedsolution has been to disperse channelized surface runoff in the receiving portion of the filter zonewith level spreaders. An initial feasibility study demonstrated that level spreaders substantiallyimproved filter strip performance and reduced non-point source pollution (NPSP) outputs tosurface water. However, widespread adoption of level spreaders as a best management practicerequires designs that are both functional and cost effective over a range of site characteristicsincluding filter zone (FZ) condition and with varying sources of NPSP and under differing ratesof loading.The main objective of this research was to evaluate different level spreader designs andconfigurations for dispersing channelized agricultural runoff and to evaluate them for enhancingFZ effectiveness on several sites with greatly differing watershed characteristics. Otherobjectives included estimating construction and maintenance costs and developingrecommendations for level spreaders for specific watershed and FZ conditions. Level spreaders with associated instrumentation were constructed on eight watersheds from 1989to 1997 representing a wide variety of watershed and FZ conditions. Spreaders withoutassociated instrumentation were constructed on three watersheds. Source areas included cropsunder both conventional and conservation tillage, a pasture, a dry-lot for dairy cattle, and a pavedand partly-roofed cattle containment area. All spreaders tested were designed to be permanentinstallations. Designs tested included commercial galvanized gutters, treated wood, fabric-linedditches with gravel just above and below the ditch, and vegetated berm and trench. Reductions in NPSP through-puts were a function of filter zone size, input concentration, runoffvolume, and season. Filter zones where FZ area was greater than two percent of source-area sizegenerally removed a least a third of each analyte. Of the six sites with dispersed flow which didnot have large unaccounted contributions to the FZ, only one failed to reduce N by 30 percent.All spreader designs improved FZ performance. Level spreaders with larger cross-sectional areaswere more effective for high peak-flow events. However, spreaders with limited cross sectionalsuch as above-ground gutters have potential where excavation of ditches or shaping of spreaderswith large equipment is a problem such as in forests or on steep slopes. The most easilymaintained design is a vegetated berm and trench spreader shaped from soil. However, its use ispractical only where tree roots are minimum and where farm equipment can maneuver duringinstallation. This design also allows limited vehicle traffic over the spreader.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001213-143554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">COMPARISON OF REFUSE DECOMPOSITION IN THE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE OF LEACHATE RECIRCULATION AT THE YOLO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA TEST CELLS</field><field name="creator">Mehta, Rinav</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;MEHTA, RINAV C. Comparison of Refuse Decomposition in the Presence and Absence of Leachate Recirculation at the Yolo County, California Test Cells. (Under the direction of Morton A. Barlaz.)A side by side comparison of two 8,000-metric ton test cells, one operated with (enhanced) and one without (control) leachate recirculation, was performed to evaluate the effects of leachate recirculation on refuse decomposition at Yolo County, CA. After about three years of operation, refuse was excavated in three borings of the enhanced cell (E1, E2 and E3) and two borings in the control cell (C1 and C2). The objective of this study was to present a comparison of test cell performance with respect to moisture content, settlement, methane production and solids decomposition. Refuse moisture content data show that leachate recirculation resulted in an increase in refuse moisture content, but also show that the refuse in the enhanced cell was not uniformly wet. The average moisture content in E1, E2 and E3 was 38.8, 31.7 and 34.8%, respectively, while the average moisture content in C1 and C2 was 14.6 and 19.2%, respectively. The extent of decomposition was determined by the biochemical methane potential (BMP) and the ratio of cellulose plus hemicellulose to lignin ((C+H)/L). BMP analysis showed the average methane potential in the enhanced and control cells to be 24.0 and 30.9 mL CH4/dry-gm, respectively, and the (C+H)/L of 1.09 and 1.44. These data correlates well with the measured methane production in the enhanced and control cell of 54 and 26 L CH4/wet-kg, respectively. Thus, laboratory and field data shows more decomposition in the enhanced cell relative to the control cell. While the overall averages may not appear significantly different, a closer look at the performance of E1 shows a difference in both moisture content and solids decomposition when compared to the control cell. Hence, the extent of decomposition varies within the enhanced cell. The sampling program conducted for the Yolo County test cells, in concert with data on settlement, methane production and the volume of liquid actually recycled, represents perhaps the most complete set of data available to date on a field-scale leachate recirculation landfill.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001219-110441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Critical Evaluation of Factors Required to Terminate the Post-closure Monitoring Period at Solid Waste Landfills.</field><field name="creator">Rooker, Alexandria Pettway</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ROOKER, ALEXANDRIA PETTWAY. A Critical Evaluation of Factors Required to Terminate the Post-closure Monitoring Period at Solid Waste Landfills. (Under the direction of Dr. Morton Barlaz).The objective of this research is to identify and evaluate parameters that could be useful for defining the end of the post-closure monitoring period, or that time at which the landfill is stable with respect to environmental emissions. Parameters evaluated in the report include leachate composition, leachate production, and gas production. In addition, the evaluation of leachate composition and quantity is combined to evaluate surface water impacts associated with the release of leachate to surface water. To determine if a landfill has reached stability, the following data are needed: the concentrations of ammonia and BOD in the leachate, leachate production rates, and gas production rates. In order for the landfill to be declared stable, the leachate should not deplete oxygen resources, exert toxicity, or increase eutrophication if it is released to surface water. In addition, gas production rates should be low enough so that their emission does not represent a significant release of a greenhouse gas or cause an odor nuisance or explosion hazard. Ultimately, the technical criteria for landfill stability evaluated in this research should be applied to a full-scale landfill to test the usefulness of the proposed approach. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001219-114515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non Aqueous Treatment of Fabrics Utilizing Plasmas</field><field name="creator">Canup, Laura</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The contents of this paper present information from work conducted by utilizing plasma technology for fabric treatment. Initially, experimentation was done in low-pressure plasma systems to change the hydrophilic properties of denim fabric. From these experiments, data was collected that proved denim fabric, both sized and desized, could obtain hydrophobicity through a fluorocarbon plasma treatment. Using C3F6 fluorocarbon gas provided a greater level of hydrophobicity than using CF4 plasma gas. The desized denim showed a greater amount of hydrophobicity, in both gases, than the sized denim. These results can be found in chapter IV. The remaining work, found in chapters II and III, focuses on the utilization of atmospheric plasmas on the treatment of nylon 6,6 fabric. Atmospheric plasmas could allow continuous treatment of fabric and shorter treatment times for fabric, all of which would be better suited for industrial processing, more specifically in textiles. Nylon 6,6 fabric was treated with air-He plasma as well as air-He-O2 plasma, where the levels of O2 varied. A significant decrease in tensile strength was found in treatments lasting five minutes or longer. However, micrographs of the fiber surface illustrate instances of surface treatment, even at times less than five minutes. Continuing work on the project includes the building of a prototype machine for industry (currently in progress), the treatment of many different kinds of fabrics, and the evaluation of their mechanical, chemical, and physical properties and functionability thereafter.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001220-102603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computer-Aided Engineering of Plywood Upholstered Furniture Frames</field><field name="creator">Oltikar, Akhil Manohar</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Until the early 1900s, furniture was built by hand, one piece at a time. The industrial revolution and modern manufacturing technology has changed all of that. Today, as the furniture industry moves firmly into the next century, computerized systems and automated manufacturing have become more common to the industry. This thesis represents an effort to analyze the current practices in computer-aided design of upholstered furniture, specifically plywood frame furniture, and to develop new procedures for reducing the lead-time in upholstery product development. Different 3-D modeling techniques for designing plywood furniture frames and their features have been developed and implemented. A plywood frame feature library has been created, and geometric relations needed to fully constrain each feature type have been developed. This reduces modeling time and also increases consistency in the solid models. A new reverse engineering procedure, using an articulating arm, has been proposed, implemented, and tested for 3-D digitization of plywood frames. The proposed methodology eliminates some of the traditional processes currently followed in the industry, thus making the product development faster and more streamlined. Further, an algorithm has been developed, implemented and tested for automatically mirroring plywood upholstery frame assemblies in a CAD system. The algorithm considerably reduces the modeling lead-time in the product development process. Finally, some future work that considers currently available 3-D CAD technologies has been recommended which would help close the gap between upholstery designers and manufacturers.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001221-130641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of the Water Quality Management DecisionSupport System (WQMDSS) in an Illustrative WatershedManagement Study</field><field name="creator">Murray, Thomas L.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACTMURRAY, THOMAS LANG. Application of the Water Quality Management Decision Support System (WQMDSS) in an Illustrative Watershed Management Study (Under the direction of Dr. S. Ranjithan.)Development of total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for critical pollutants in impaired watersheds is becoming a standard approach in environmental management. This requires the identification of future loading of contributing pollutants, and the development of a plan to allocate the necessary reductions among the point and nonpoint sources in the watershed to achieve this loading. To support water quality model-based TMDL development, US EPA has released the modeling framework BASINS-Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint Source, which incorporates several watershed water quality models within a GIS-based data management system. Current capabilities of BASINS enable simulation of watershed water quality associated with a TMDL, thus supporting TMDL development via a trial-and-error approach. The limitations of the trial-and-error approach are addressed via systematic search procedures implemented within the Water Quality Management Decision Support System (WQMDSS) that is designed to aid stakeholders and decision-makers efficiently identify TMDLs. The focus of the research presented in this paper is to demonstrate the applicability of WQMDSS in developing TMDLs for a realistic illustrative case study. Using the data for the Suwanee Creek Watershed in Georgia, which underwent a recent TMDL study, a series of illustrative scenarios are examined to consider varying target total suspended solids (TSS) loading rates, as well as different instream water quality parameters. The instream water quality is estimated using a calibrated HSPF model. Future land use development plans, with and without consideration of riparian buffer strips for nonpoint source control, to meet instream water quality goals are identified. Through this illustrative study, a range of uses of WQMDSS in watershed-scale TMDL development is demonstrated.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001228-165937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three Dimensional Simulation of Time-Dependent Scramjet Isolator /Combustor Flowfields Implemented on Parallel Architectures</field><field name="creator">McDaniel, Keith Scott</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;McDaniel, Keith S. Three Dimensional Simulation of Time-DependentScramjet Isolator / Combustor Flowfields Implemented onParallel Architectures, ( Under the directions of Dr. J. R. Edwards). The development of a parallel Navier-Stokes solver for computing time-dependent,three-dimensional reacting flowfields within scramjet (supersonic combusting ramjet)engines is presented in this work. The algorithm combines low-diffusion upwinding methods, timeaccurate implicit integration techniques, and domain decomposition strategies to yield an effectiveapproach for large-scale simulations. The algorithm is mapped to a distributed memoryIBM SP-2 architecture and a shared memory Compaq ES-40 architecture using the MPI-1 message-passingstandard. Two and three-dimensional simulations of time-dependent hydrogen fuel injection into a modelscramjet isolator / combustor configuration at two equivalence ratios are performed. Thesesimulations are used to gain knowledge of engine operability, inlet performance, isolatorperformance, fuel air mixing, flame holding, mode transition, and engine unstart.Results for an injection at a ratio of 0.29 show qualitative agreement withexperiment for the two-dimensional case, but revealed a slow progression towardengine unstart for the three-dimensional case. Injection at an equivalence ratio of 0.61resulted in engine unstart for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases.Engine unstart for the three-dimensional case occurs as a response to the formation and growthof large pockets of reversed flow along the combustor side wall. These structuresdevelop at an incipient pressure above 154 kPa and result in significant blockage of the core flow,additional compression, and chemical reaction within the boundary layer. All of these factors promotea much more rapid unstart as compared with the two-dimensional case.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20001228-204538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic Analysis of Diallel Tests of Loblolly Pine (Pinus taeda L.)</field><field name="creator">Xiang, Bin</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;AbstractBIN XIANG Genetic Analysis of Diallel Tests of Loblolly Pine (Pinus taeda L.) (Under the direction of Dr. Bailian Li)A new approach was developed for analyzing diallel tests with SAS PROC MIXED and PROC IML. The new method can estimate variance components, obtain BLUE (best linear unbiased estimators) of fixed effects and BLUP (best linear unbiased predictors) of random genetic effects simultaneously. A new formula based on BLUP was further developed to predict individual tree breeding values. This new analytical method was validated using computer simulation and was compared with other existing programs. To analyze disconnected diallel mating designs with more than one diallel, simulated data generated with known parameters were analyzed using BLUP to compare three alternative models, which include diallel as fixed effect (Model 1), random effect (Model 2) or no diallel effect (Model 3). Both Model 1 and Model 3 produced unbiased GCA (general combining ability) variance estimates, while Model 2 resulted in downward biased GCA variance estimate. The accuracy of BLUP prediction for three models was very close, with Model 3 slightly better than the other two. Statistical approaches were also evaluated for combining multiple disconnected diallel test series in a given region. The best GCA sample variance prediction in the class of linear combination of local variance estimates was derived. Simulation study showed that a checklot adjustment was very critical to improve the prediction of genetic values obtained using BLUP analysis. Additional adjustment with improved GCA sample variance prediction could improve the correlation slightly beyond checklot adjustment.Analysis of annual measurement through age 8 from a total of 275 parents, 690 full-sib families from 23 diallel tests of loblolly pine in Northern, Coastal and Piedmont test regions showed: 1) dominance variance was small (20-40% of total genetic variance) relative to additive variance; 2) heritability increased over time, and the magnitude of heritabilities for diameter at breast height (DBH) and volume was comparable with the corresponding heritabilities for height; 3) DBH and volume had higher genetic correlation with 8-year volume than height. Genetic gain prediction in year-8 volume for selection on height and volume indicated that: 1) selection on volume yielded more gain than selection on height; 2) Coastal population had the greatest correlated response, followed by Piedmont and Northern population; 3) family plus within family selection based on total genetic component can capture the most genetic gain; 4) for all selection methods, additional gain (10-40%) can be achieved by capturing non-additive genetic component.Selection efficiency study of height and volume for three test regions indicated that earlier selection appeared to be more efficient than direct selection on year-8 volume in most selection methods. Family selection can be performed at age 2 or 3 for height and at age 4 for DBH and volume. Combined selection (family plus within family) was highly efficient at age 3 or 4. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010105-093243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deadlock Analysis of Message-Passing Programs with Identical Processes</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Jun</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Deadlocks are a common type of faults in message-passing programs. One approach to detecting deadlocks in a message-passing program is to perform reachability analysis, which involvesderiving possible global states of the program. The resulting state graph is referred to as a reachability graph (RG). The size of the RG of a message-passing program, in the worst case, is anexponential function of the number of processes in the program. This problem, referred to as the state explosion problem, makes reachability analysis impractical for message-passing programs withmany processes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Assume that P is a message-passing program that contains one process type T with a dynamic number of instances. Let P_m denote the version of P that has m instances of T. To detect deadlocks inP, we apply reachability analysis to P_1, P_2, ..., and P_n, where n is an integer chosen randomly or according to some criterion. If the value of n is large, reachability analysis of P_n is impractical. Ifthe value of n is small, we have little confidence on whether P_k is deadlock-free for any k &gt; n. A deadlock cutoff number c for P means that under certain conditions, if P_c has no deadlocks, then P_khas no deadlocks for any k &gt; c. For message-passing programs that contain two or more process types with dynamic numbers of instances, their deadlock cutoff vectors are defined in a similar way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this dissertation we present four approaches to finding deadlock cutoff numbers for synchronous message-passing programs. These approaches are based on the use of observational equivalence,projection equivalence, client/server reachability graphs, and abstract client/server reachability graphs, respectively. The first three approaches assume that each process in a synchronousmessage-passing program is modeled as a labeled transition system (LTS). The fourth approach assumes that each process in a synchronous message-passing program is modeled as acommunicating finite state machine (CFSM) or extended CFSM. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Observational equivalence is an important concept in verifying properties of LTS systems. Let L be an instance of process type T in P. The environment of L in P_m, m&gt;0, is defined to be thecomposition of processes in P_m excluding L. In other words, P_m is the composition of L and its environment in P_m. We show that if there exists an integer n such that the environments of L in P_nand P_{n+1} are observational equivalent and P_n has no global deadlocks, then P_k, k&gt;n, has no global deadlocks and n is a deadlock cutoff number for P. We also show how to apply this approach toring-structured programs. One major problem with this approach is that it fails to find deadlock cutoff numbers for many message-passing programs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To improve the above approach, we define a new equivalence relation called projection equivalence, which is weaker than observational equivalence. The projection of L in P_m, i&gt;0, is defined to bethe behavior of L in P_m. The environments of L in P_i and P_j, i=\=j, are said to be projection equivalent if L has the same projection in P_i and P_j. We show how to apply projection equivalence tofind deadlock cutoff numbers for client/server programs and ring-structured programs. A client/server program contains a server and a number of clients. Clients call the server to request service;they do not communication with each other. The server cannot call individual clients. For client/server programs, we define a new type of reduced reachability graphs, called client/server reachabilitygraphs or CSRGs. The size of the CSRG of a client/server program is a polynomial function of the number of clients. Based on CSRGs, we show how to determine the existence of a deadlock cutoffnumber for a client/server program and how to find this number if it exists. We also show how to find deadlock cutoff vectors for client/server programs with two or more types of clients. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, we consider client/server programs with two-way communication, which allows the server to call individual clients. Each client in such a program is represented as a communicating finitestate machine (CFSM), while the server is represented as an extended CFSM. For such programs, we define a new type of reduced reachability graphs, called abstract CSRGs or ACSRGs. Basedon ACSRGs, we show how to find deadlock cutoff numbers for client/server programs with two-way communication. Our empirical studies show that ACSRGs are much smaller than theircorresponding RGs. For example, for a solution to the gas station problem with one pump and six customers, its ACSRG has 74 states and its RG has 25394 states. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010105-233920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ON REAL-TIME INTRUSION DETECTION AND SOURCE IDENTIFICATION</field><field name="creator">CHANG, HO-YEN</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;This thesis work consists of two distinct parts: a study ofreal-time intrusion detection on network link-state routingprotocol attacks (Part I), and a study of source identification for spoofed IP packets (Part II). These two parts could be united into a common framework consisting of an intrusion detection system and an intrusion response system. However, in many ways they are distinct and self-contained. In Part I, a real-time knowledge-based network intrusiondetection model for a link-state routing protocol is presented to detect different attacks for the protocol. This model includes three layers: a to parse packets and dispatch data, an to abstract predefined real-time events for the link-state routing protocol, and an to express thereal-time behavior of the protocol engine and to detect the intrusions by pattern matching. The timed FSM named JiNao Finite State Machine (JFSM)&lt;/I&gt; is extended from the conventional FSM with timed states, multiple timers, and time constraints on statetransitions. The JFSM is implemented as a generator which can createany FSM according to a description in a configuration file. Theresults show that this approach is very effective for real-timeintrusion detection. This approach can be extended for use in othernetwork protocol intrusion detection systems, especially for thosewith known attacks.In Part II, a security management framework, the Decentralized Source Identification System (DECIDUOUS)&lt;/I&gt;, is presentedto identify the ``true'' sources of network-based intrusions. The premise of this approach is that if an attack packet has been correctly authenticated by a certain router, the attack packet must have been transmitted through that router.&lt;/I&gt; It utilizes security associations to dynamically deploy secure authentication tunnels in order to further trace down the possible attackers' locations. We present the algorithms to support the tracing of multiple attacks launched from different locations, even across several administrative domains. Our results show that the DECIDUOUS system is reasonably efficient, flexible and robust. Our approach could serve as the basis for future research on different tracing strategies for differenttypes of attacks in large-scale networks.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010107-210805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ritz Vector Approach for Evaluating the Dynamic Properties of Structural Systems and Incabinet Spectra</field><field name="creator">Yang, Jianfeng</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;YANG, JIANFENG.

(1998) for evaluating the dynamic properties of the cabinets and the incabinet spectra. Modifications are needed to overcome the limitations encountered in the application to actual cabinets. The accuracy of the modified formulations is evaluated by comparison of results for actual cabinets with the corresponding results obtained from detailed finite element analyses. The modified Ritz vector approach can account for actual rotational constraints imparted by supporting structural members such as stiffeners. It can also be applied to bench board type cabinets in which instruments are mounted on plates or frames that are inclined to the global axes as well as to frames in which parallel frame members can vibrate in different vibration shapes.In this dissertation, detailed finite element analyses are used to study the rocking behavior of cabinets and to show that accurate representation of the boundary conditions at the cabinet base is essential in the evaluation of cabinet rocking mode. Simple formulations are developed for evaluating the rocking stiffness in three different types of cabinet mounting arrangements. These formulations enable incorporation of a cabinet rocking mode in the Ritz vector approach.The Ritz vector approach is also used to develop new formulations for evaluating static and dynamic characteristics of rectangular slabs with edge beams. The effect of elastic edge restraints is considered by including appropriate integrals for edge beams in the expressions for total kinetic and potential energies in a Rayleigh-Ritz approach. The effect of various types of boundary conditions at the beam ends is accounted for by considering the corresponding Ritz vectors. The contribution of beam mass to the total kinetic energy is also considered in the proposed approach.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010109-114554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">COMPUTATIONAL EVALUATION OF QUIET TUNNEL HYPERSONIC BOUNDARY LAYER STABILITY EXPERIMENTS</field><field name="creator">Manning, Melissa Lynn</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Manning, Melissa Lynn. Computational Evaluation of Quiet Tunnel Hypersonic Boundary Layer Stability Experiments. (Under the direction of Dr. Ndaona Chokani.) A computational evaluation of two stability experiments conducted in the NASA Langley Mach 6 axisymmetric quiet nozzle test chamber facility is conducted. Navier-Stokes analysis of the mean flow and linear stability theory analysis of boundary layer disturbances is performed in the computations. The effects of adverse pressure gradient and wall cooling are examined. Calculated pressure, temperature and boundary layer thickness distributions show very good overall agreement with experimental measurements. Computed mass flux and total temperature profiles show very good quantitative agreement with uncalibrated hot-wire measurements obtained with the hot-wire operated in high and low overheat modes respectively. Comparisons between calibrated hot-wire data and mean flow computations show excellent agreement in the early stages of the transitional flow. However, examination of the wire Reynolds number and mass flux and total temperature eigenfunction profiles suggest that when operated in high overheat mode the sensitivity of the hot-wire to total temperature is significant. Thus, while uncalibrated hot-wire measurements are useful to characterize the overall features of the flow, calibrated hot-wire measurements are necessary for quantitative comparison with stability theory. Computations show that adverse pressure gradient and wall cooling decrease the boundary layer thickness and increase the frequency and amplification rate of the unstable second mode disturbances; these findings are consistent with the experimental observations. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010112-081130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Root-Knot Nematode Resistance in Sweetpotato and Development of Sweetpotato Differential Host Genotypes for Meloidogyne spp.</field><field name="creator">Cervantes-Flores, Jim Carlos</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Root-knot nematodesrepresent a significant problem in sweetpotato, Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam., causing reduction in yield and quality of the storageroots. The following experiments were conducted to: (1) test the use of an alternative screening method for root-knotnematode resistance; (2) assess the effect of different root-knot nematode spp. on sweetpotato cultivars; and (3) develop a setof sweetpotato differential host genotypes for Meloidogyne species. In the first study, five sweetpotato cultivars were selectedand evaluated for resistance to Meloidogyne incognita race 3, M. arenaria race 2, and M. javanica. Screening was conductedin 400-cm3 square pots and 150-cm3 Conetainers. Nematode infection was measured as the percentage of root systemgalled, percentage of root system necrosis, and the number of nematode eggs per gram of root tissue. Means of dependentvariables were not significantly different between the two container types. Conetainers were the more efficient pot type,because they required less space and permitted an easier assessment of nematode infection. Resistance responses differeddepending on the nematode species and sweetpotato cultivar. All cultivars were resistant to M. arenaria race 2, while'Hernandez', 'Excel' and 'Jewel' were also resistant to M. incognita race 3 and M. javanica. In the second study, twenty-sevensweetpotato genotypes were evaluated for their resistance to North Carolina root-knot nematode populations: M. arenaria(races 1 and 2), M. incognita (races 1, 2, 3, and 4), and M. javanica. Sweetpotato plants were evaluated in 150-cm3Conetainers. Nematode infection was assessed as the number of egg masses per root system. Different sweetpotatogenotypes were hosts for different Meloidogyne populations. Five out of the 27 genotypes ('Beauregard', L86-33, PDM P6,'Porto Rico', and 'Pelican Processor') were selected as sweetpotato differential hosts because of their resistance reaction to theMeloidogyne spp. These genotypes were tested against twelve M. incognita populations belonging to the four standardizedhost races collected from different geographical locations worldwide. Virulence of the M. incognita populations varieddepending on the sweetpotato genotype and did not always correspond to host race as classified by the North CarolinaDifferential Host Test. 'Beauregard', L86-33, and PDM P6 were hosts for the 12 nematode populations, but differences in theaggressiveness of the populations were observed among the three sweetpotato genotypes. 'Porto Rico' and 'Pelican Processor'had differential host status to the M. incognita populations irrespective of their host race. These results suggest that: 1) multiplefactors might be responsible for conferring virulence in the nematodes; 2) multiple genes could be involved in the resistance toroot-knot nematodes in sweetpotato; and 3) the final outcome of root-knot nematode resistance in sweetpotato would dependon the specific interaction of these two factors. Further, these results suggest that Meloidogyne populations should be testedagainst sweetpotato differential hosts in order to determine the pathotypes affecting sweetpotato. This would help tostandardize the evaluation of resistance to root-knot nematodes in sweetpotato breeding programs, and possibly identifyreliable sources of resistance to numerous pathotypes of Meloidogyne spp. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010112-111943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE MOLECULAR SCALE NATURE OF COPPER(II) AND ARSENATE BONDING WITH GOETHITE-HUMATE COMPLEXES</field><field name="creator">Alcacio, Tim</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Alcacio, Tim. The Molecular Scale Nature of Copper(II) and Arsenate Bonding With Goethite-Humate Complexes. In soils, interactions between clay minerals and natural organic matter are known to affect the cycling of heavy metals and anions. Contaminant structures at mineral surfaces that contain adsorbed organic matter will have a significant influence on the bioavailability of the contaminant. The structure of copper(II) and arsenate complexes on goethite in the presence and absence of adsorbed humic acid were studied with extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and with x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The copper(II) and arsenate formed edge shared inner-sphere surface complexes with goethite. The copper(II) itself was present in a distorted octahedral configuration, and ternary complexes involving bonding with both the humic acid and the goethite (Type A complexes) or adsorbed humic acid (Type B complexes), occurred at pH 5.6. At pH 8, the copper(II) was found to display a stronger affinity for the goethite surface and the formation of ternary complexes did not occur. The EXAFS analyses demonstrated that arsenate was present in a tetrahedral configuration and was predominantly bonded to goethite surface sites. Regardless of the level of adsorbed humic acid, the arsenic coordination environment was similar and indicated that ternary complexes could not be distinguished. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010113-190843</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Numerical Modeling Study of the Coupled Variability of Lake Victoria in Eastern Africa and the Regional Climate</field><field name="creator">Song, Yi</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;SONG, YI. A Numerical Modeling Study of the Coupled Variability of Lake Victoria in Eastern Africa and the Regional Climate. (Under the direction of Dr. Fredrick H. M. Semazzi.). The objective of this investigation was to investigate and study the coupled atmosphere-lake climate system over the Lake Victoria basin, and determine the corresponding physical mechanisms that are involved. The primary research vehicle for the investigation is a fully coupled model of the regional climate of Eastern Africa and Lake Victoria which has been developed and applied in this study. The atmospheric component of the model is the NCAR Regional Climate Model (RegCM2). The lake component of the model is based on the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) configured for Lake Victoria by replacing the open boundaries in the standard version of the model with a closed coastline and adopting the bythemetry of Lake Victoria. The horizontal resolution is 20 km for both the atmosphere and lake model components.The results show that the bythemetry and geometry of the lake play a fundamental role in determining the climatology of Lake Victoria. There exists Kelvin-like waves in the thermocline trapped along the coast and they propagate clockwise around Lake Victoria with periodicity of about 30 days. The oscillations entirely disappear in the case of the isothermal conditions. The 3-dimensional model produces a surface temperature pattern indicative of horizontal lake water mixing associated with the horizontal spiral pattern that is not present in the 1-dimensional model. Preliminary comparison of the coupled RegCM2-POM model simulation results with the observations indicates that the model produces more realistic lake surface temperatures (LST) and rainfall over and around the lake than the standard version of RegCM2 in which a simple one dimensional thermal diffusion lake model is used. Over Eastern Africa, the regional climate variability is significantly influenced by the circulation over the Lake Victoria basin. Moisture advection contribution is important but secondary to evaporation in explaining the heavy rainfall over the lake. The interaction between the lake-land breeze and the prevailing northeasterly flow accounts for the asymmetry in the distribution of the diurnal rainfall variations and the southwestward movement of the dominant bands of divergence/convergence. During the 1982 El Nino when the averaged LST over the lake was higher than that during the normal year, the LST gradient was weakened along the SW-NE axis over the lake by the strong lake circulation. This results in LST distribution whereby the southwestern region of the lake is cooled while the region of maximum LST moves to the central-eastern region of the lake from the southwestern region of the lake. The net change in rainfall distribution over the lake during the 1982 El Nino is a combination of the effect associated with the large-scale convergence pattern and the meso-scale climate changes associated with the shift of the region of maximum rainfall toward the central-eastern part of the lake from the western part of the lake in response to the LST redistribution. Conversely, the weaker lake circulation enhances the LST gradient over the western part of the lake, especially over the northwestern region, and the rainfall maxima is still found over the northwestern sector of the lake. Therefore, the hydrodynamics of the lake play an important role in determining the coupled variability of the lake circulation and the lake basin-wide climatic conditions. This outcome based on the use of the coupled 3-dimensional lake model is not reproducible from the corresponding simulations based on the coupled 1-dimensional lake model. It is therefore apparent, that neglecting the lake's hydrodynamics and basing the lake model only on thermodynamical considerations deprives the coupled regional climate model of the ability to transport heat efficiently within the lake and thereby degrades the simulation of the climate downstream over the rest of the lake and the surrounding regions. The potential climate change resulting from total clearing of the tropical rain forests in Africa was also investigated by the standard version of the NCAR CCM3 global climate model. Over Eastern and Western Africa the impact of deforestation is primarily characterized by reduction in rainfall, however the CCM3 resolution of T42 which we have adopted may not be adequate to resolve the large contrasts in terrain and vegetation types. A striking result is that the strong remote response of the Southern Africa region to deforestation over Central Africa. This may be attributed to the role of the trapped large amplitude Rossby waves which transmit the response signal a long distance away from the source region. Based on the present results we infer that, the downscaling would be highly beneficial not only for the immediate region of Eastern and Central Africa where significant removal of tropical forest vegetation cover could occur in the coming decades, but also for the region further south to infer the projected detailed response of the Southern Africa region to remote deforestation effects.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010118-225323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constitutive Modeling for Cyclic Plasticity and Ratcheting</field><field name="creator">Bari, MD. Shafiqul</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT BARI, MD. SHAFIQUL Constitutive Modeling for Cyclic Plasticity and Ratcheting. (under the supervision of Dr. Tasnim Hassan)This study critically evaluates the performance of a number of constitutive models in predicting ratcheting responses of carbon steel for a set of uniaxial and biaxial loading histories. Two types of modeling schemes, coupled and uncoupled, are evaluated. The coupled models from Prager, Armstrong-Frederick, Chaboche, Ohno-Wang, and Guionnet are examined. The Prager and the Armstrong-Frederick models perform inadequately. The Chaboche and Ohno-Wang models perform well for uniaxial ratcheting responses, but overpredict the biaxial ratcheting. The Guionnet model simulates one set of biaxial ratcheting response well, but fails in others. Performances of several kinematic hardening rules, when used with the uncoupled Dafalias-Popov model are also evaluated. The Armstrong-Frederick rule simulates one set of biaxial response reasonably. The Voyiadjis-Sivakumar, Phillips, Tseng-Lee, Kaneko and Xia-Ellyin rules fail to simulate the biaxial ratcheting responses. The Chaboche rule, with three decomposed terms, performs reasonably for the whole set of responses. The Ohno-Wang rule also performs reasonably, except for one biaxial response. This study indicates a strong influence of the kinematic hardening rule and its parameter determination scheme on multiaxial ratcheting simulations. The coupled models by McDowell, Jiang-Sehitoglu, Voyiadjis-Basuroychowdhury and AbdelKarim-Ohno, where additional multiaxial parameters are included in the hardening rules, are also investigated. None of these models perform consistently for the whole set of experiments. A modified kinematic hardening rule using the idea of Delobelle and his co-workers in the framework of the Chaboche model is proposed. This new rule performs impressively for all of the ratcheting responses considered. Several models for anisotropic deformation of the yield surface are scrutinized. Most of these models use complex and numerically extensive higher order tensors for the yield surface formulations and thus become less attractive for implementation with a cyclic plasticity model. This study demonstrates the methodology and promise in incorporating the equi-plastic-strain surface proposed by Shiratori and his co-workers into the Dafalias-Popov model for general multiaxial ratcheting simulations.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010118-225417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Climate for Computer-Mediated Communication Technology Implementation and Implementation Success</field><field name="creator">Meyer, David C</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010119-154920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation Optimization Using Soft Computing</field><field name="creator">Medaglia, Andres L.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;To date, most of the research in simulation optimization has been focused on single response optimization on the continuous space of input parameters. However, the optimization of more complex systems does not fit this framework. Decision makers often face the problem of optimizing multiple performance measures of systems with both continuous and discrete input parameters. Previously acquired knowledge of the system by experts is seldomincorporated into the simulation optimization engine. Furthermore, when the goals of the system design are stated in natural language or vague terms, current techniques are unable to deal with this situation. For these reasons, we define and study the fuzzy single response simulation optimization (FSO) and fuzzy multiple response simulation optimization (FMSO) problems.&lt;p&gt;The primary objective of this research is to develop an efficient and robust method for simulation optimization of complex systems with multiple vague goals. This method uses a fuzzy controller to incorporate existing knowledge to generate high quality approximate Pareto optimal solutions in a minimum number of simulation runs.&lt;p&gt;For comparison purposes, we also propose an evolutionary method for solving the FMSO problem. Extensive computational experiments on the design of a flow line manufacturing system (in terms of tandem queues with blocking) have been conducted. Both methods are able to generate high quality solutions in terms of Zitzlerand Thiele's "dominated space" metric. Both methods are also able to generate an even sample of the Pareto front. However, the fuzzy controlled method is more efficient, requiring fewer simulation runs than the evolutionary method to achieve the same solution quality.&lt;p&gt;To accommodate the complexity of natural language, this research also provides a new Bezier curve-based mechanism to elicit knowledge and express complex vague concepts. To date, this is perhaps the most flexible and efficient mechanism for both automatic and interactive generation of membership functions for convex fuzzy sets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010124-233615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BAYESIAN ANALYSIS FOR THE SITE-SPECIFIC DOSE MODELING IN NUCLEAR POWER PLANT DECOMMISSIONING</field><field name="creator">LING, XIANBING</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Decommissioning is the process of closing down a facility. In nuclear power plant decommissioning, it must be determined that that any remaining radioactivity at a decommissioned site will not pose unacceptable risk to any member of the public after the release of the site. This is demonstrated by the use of predictive computer models for dose assessment. The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate the methodologies of site-specific dose assessment with the use of Bayesian analysis for nuclear power plant decommissioning. An actual decommissioning plant site is used as a test case for the analyses. A residential farmer scenario was used in the analysis with the two of the most common computer codes for dose assessment, i.e., DandD and RESRAD. By identifying key radionuclides and parameters of importance in dose assessment for the site conceptual model, available data on these parameters was identified (as prior information) from the existing default input data from the computer codes or the national database. The site-specific data were developed using the results of field investigations at the site, historical records at the site, regional database, and the relevant information from the literature. This new data were compared to the prior information with respect to their impacts onboth deterministic and probabilistic dose assessment. Then, the two sets of information were combined by using the method of conjugate-pair for Bayesian updating. Value of information (VOI) analysis was also performed based on the results of dose assessment for different radionuclides and parameters. The results of VOI analysis indicated that the value of site-specific information was very low regarding the decision on site release. This observation was held for both of the computer codes used. Although the value of new information was very low with regards to the decisions on site release, it was also found that the use of site-specific information is very important for the reduction of the predicted dose. This would be particularly true with the DandD code.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010130-141644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CHARACTERIZATION OF HIGH-K GATE STACKS IN METAL-OXIDE-SEMICONDUCTOR CAPACITORS</field><field name="creator">Li, Wenmei</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this research has been to use off-line characterization techniques to establish material-specific properties of gate-stack constituents (i.e., high-k dielectric stacks and electrodes) and complete gate-stack structures. Hence, the characterization methodologies were established to evaluate high-k dielectrics at various processing levels, which, in part, determine the final characteristics of an advanced gate-stack device. Material systems that were investigated include: Al-O, Hf-Si-O, Zr-Si-O, Ti-O, Ta-O and Sr-Ti-O. Various physical and electrical characterization techniques were used to establish fundamental understandings of the materials selected, thin-film growth/deposition processes, and gate-stack structures. General conclusions for stable and unstable gate-dielectric materials have been establishedregarding the presence of a problematic interfacial layer at the Si/dielectric interface, graded dielectric layers, and the stability of gate electrodes on high-k dielectrics.The nanometer-scale chemistry of a gate-stack capacitor whose expected structure is Si/SiOxNy/Ta2O5/TiN/Al was studied by high-resolution electron-energy-loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope. Elemental profiles with near-atomic-level resolution for Si, Ti, N, Al, and O demonstrate that the device structure deviates drastically from the expectation and is chemically complex.It is concluded that the graded distribution of certain elements across the gate-stack capacitor completely precludes a band-structure model that assumes abrupt interfaces and chemically discrete layers. This study impacted on subsequent interpretations of flatband voltage extractions and electrical degradation following backside metallization/postmetallization annealing for capacitors whose dielectric-stack was based on Ta-O.Detailed and extensive electrical characterizations of Pt/SiOx/Sr-Ti-O/Si MOS capacitors were carried out to investigate reliability issues in a bi-layer gate dielectric. Based on these studies, models are proposed to describe the carrier transport and dielectric degradation for a Sr-Ti-O capacitor. It is concluded that conduction is dominated by Frenkel-Poole emission from mid-gap trap levels. The trap barrier height is estimated to be 1.51eV. A model based on the atomic and electronic structure of oxygen vacancies can account for the reported leakage-current characteristics. In addition, it is tentatively proposed that anode-hole injection and hole trapping control the dielectric degradation under gate injection.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Material Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010202-100109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Model of Saturation Flow Using Traffic Subgroups</field><field name="creator">Nevers, Brandon L.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;This thesis presents a methodology for estimating saturation flow rates at signalized intersections by traffic subgroups. A subgroup is defined as a group of vehicles of a specific vehicle classification that make a single directional movement from one lane. The subgroup method is founded on the procedures described in the 1997 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) (Transportation Research Board, 1997) but extends beyond the HCM's lane group model to provide results that can be aggregated at multiple levels. Rather than assuming homogeneous conditions within each lane or lane group as is the case with many capacity guides, the subgroup method decomposes a traffic stream into individual components, each of which have unique saturation headways. Comparisons with the HCM show that under similar assumptions, the subgroup method produces similar saturation flow rates when aggregated at the lane group level. This gives confidence for applying the subgroup approach to estimate individual lane performance.The most critical element of the subgroup model is the estimation of lane volumes. Lane volume field data were gathered at four sites. Results of an evaluation of lane distribution strategies for estimating lane volumes when a choice is present indicate that the equal back of queue strategy best reflects driver behavior. Based on the observed field data, the equal back of queue strategy outperforms the equal delay strategy and the equal flow ratio strategy which are widely used in various international capacity guides. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010205-180834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MODELING THE PERFORMANCE AND EMISSIONS OF BRITISH GAS/LURGI-BASED INTEGRATED GASIFICATION COMBINED CYCLE SYSTEMS</field><field name="creator">Pickett, Mathew Michael</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the risks and potential pay-offs of a new technology, a systematic approach for assessment must be developed. Characterization of the performance and emissions of the technology must be made comparable to conventional and other advanced alternatives. This study deals with the design and implementation of a performance and emission model for a gasification based power system fueled with municipal solid waste (MSW) and coal in ASPEN PLUS &#168;C a chemical process simulation software package. The power system modeled is an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and has several advantages over conventional combustion plants including lower pollutant emissions; higher thermal efficiencies; and the ability to co-produce several products aside from electricity. The model was developed to analyze and quantify the expected benefits associated with MSW gasification. This research models a British Gas/Lurgi (BGL) Slagging gasifer-based IGCC power and methanol production facility firing coal and MSW. The ASPEN PLUS IGCC model consists of 153 unit operation blocks, 24 FORTRAN blocks and 32 design specifications. The performance model calculates mass and energy balances for the entire IGCC system. For validation, the model was calibrated to a design study by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) of a BGL gasifier based IGCC system (Pechtl et al., 1992). First developed and calibrated for a coal fueled IGCC system, the model was then converted to process MSW. Three fuels are used in this study: a Pittsburgh No. 8 bituminous coal; a German waste blend; and an American 75/25 percent mixture of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) and Pittsburgh No. 8 Bituminous coal. Methanol plant sizes of 10,000, 20,000 and 40,000 lb methanol/hr, each with and without recycling the methanol plant purge gas to the gas turbine, were modeled for each fuel. Regardless of the type of fuel fired, all systems were more efficient when the purge gas from the methanol plant was recycled for combustion in the gas turbine. Another trend observed between the fuels is that as a system produces more methanol, the overall thermal efficiency of the plant decreases. Systems fueled with German waste performed most efficiently, followed by the Pittsburgh coal and American waste.Compared to conventional combustion power plants, Integrated Gasification Combined Cycles are relatively new technologies promising decreased pollutant emissions and increased thermal efficiencies. Additionally, IGCC systems can co-produce chemicals, further increasing the marketability of the plant. The ASPEN PLUS model can be used with several other analysis tools and techniques. The model can be used in conjunction with life cycle analysis to quantify the benefits associated with the avoided (prevented) emissions and avoided use of virgin feedstock. Probabilistic analysis can be utilized in the model to identify which model parameters most affect performance and to quantify the uncertainty and variability associated with the system.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010208-005018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics and Management of Sub-divided Populations</field><field name="creator">Brooks, Elizabeth N.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Multi-site Leslie matrices for sub-divided populations are explored with respect to optimization of management goals and transient dynamics associated with implementing actions to achieve those goals. The management goals explored were minimizing the cost associated with controlling a pest species (Yellow Legged Herring gull, Larus cachinnans), and maximizing the yield from a commercially valuable species (Artco-Norwegian cod, Gadus morhua). Transient dynamics were evaluated for a representative r- and K-selected species, and time to convergence was compared between one-site versus multi-site models, and for different migration patterns, migration levels, and proportion of the population migrating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a density-independent model for the Yellow Legged Herring Gull, the most efficient control technique was to focus management actions on the better quality sites, because breeders at high quality sites had higher expected life-time reproductive values. The amount of harvest required to maintain equilibrium was a function of site quality and the balance between immigration and emigration-cost (and effort) increased as dispersal favored better quality sites. Given a choice between destroying eggs or culling adult breeders, culling required ten times less effort per-capita and would be the optimal strategy as long as per-capita culling cost is no more than ten times greater than the per-egg destruction cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A density-dependent model of Arcto-Norwegian cod revealed that the theoretical yield was maximized from harvesting age 6 individuals. If only the minimum age harvested could be controlled, then the constrained yield was maximized from harvesting ages five and older. Yields were compared between a reserve model with 25% of fishing area closed and a no-reserve model. Yields in the reserve model exceeded the non-reserve model when transfer rates out of the reserve were higher, when higher fecundity was realized in the reserve (which could result from improved habitat quality), and when fishing rates in the non-reserve model were 1.5 and 2.0 times the optimal level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In both a density-independent and a density-dependent context, I showed that the optimal strategy could be determined from inspection of elements of the left eigenvector (i.e. reproductive value) divided by a vector of age specific harvest value (or cost of control action, in the case of a pest species). The maximum sustained yield was obtained when the age class with the smallest ratio was harvested; the minimum cost comes from removing individuals with the largest ratio. In one-site models, the optimal strategy involved the harvest of no more than two age classes, where the second (younger) age class had the second smallest ratio (for maximization) or largest ratio (for minimization). However, in multi-site models, the presence of migration permitted the replenishment of age classes beyond the one fully exploited in a harvested site, and thus the optimal strategy could involve the harvest of more than two age classes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Optimal solutions to the above models corresponded to equilibrium conditions. However, the amount of time between the implementation of a management action and the attainment of equilibrium can be great. Analysis of transient dynamics revealed that the time to convergence is affected by many factors. I defined convergence as the time when a measured population growth rate (and the growth rate in all subsequent years) was within 1% of the asymptotic growth rate (corresponding to equilibrium for a given action). Comparing single-site versus multi-site models, the multi-site models converged more slowly. Multi-site models that incorporated low levels of migration and migration in only the first age class (as opposed to migration in all age classes) converged slowest. Models for the longer-lived K-selected species generally converged more slowly than the short-lived r-selected species, although for some migration patterns (particularly when emigration out of the site receiving a management action exceeded immigration into that site) models for both species converged quickly. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010219-171526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION AND STATIONARITY TESTING IN THE PRESENCE OF TREND BREAKS</field><field name="creator">Huh, Seungho</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Traditionally it is believed that most macroeconomic time series represent stationary fluctuations around a deterministic trend. However, simple applications of the Dickey-Fuller test have, in many cases, been unable to show that major macroeconomic variables are stationary univariate time series structure. One possible reason for non-rejection of unit roots is that the simple mean or linear trend function used by the tests are not sufficient to describe the deterministic part of the series. To address this possibility, unit root tests in the presence of trend breaks have been studied by several researchers.In our work, we deal with some issues associated with unit root testing in time series with a trend break.The performance of various unit root test statistics is compared with respect to the break induced size distortion problem. We examine the effectiveness of tests based on symmetric estimators as compared to those based on the least squares estimator.In particular, we show that tests based on the weighted symmetric estimator not only eliminate thespurious rejection problem but also have reasonably good power properties when modified to allow for a break.We suggest alternative test statistics for testing the unit root null hypothesis in the presence of a trend break. Our new test procedure, which we call the ``bisection'' method, is based on the idea of subgrouping. This is simpler than other methods since the necessity of searching for the break is avoided.Using stream flow data from the US Geological Survey, we perform a temporal analysis of some hydrologicvariables. We first show that the time series for the target variables are stationary, then focus on finding the sample size necessary to detect a mean change if one occurs. Three different approaches are used to solve this problem: OLS, GLS and a frequency domain method. A cluster analysis of stations is also performed using these sample sizes as data.We investigate whether available geographic variables can be used to predict cluster membership. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010222-121906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MACROSCOPIC TRAFFIC PARAMETERS AND VEHICLE EMISSIONS</field><field name="creator">Colyar, James Daniel</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;COLYAR, JAMES DANIEL. An Empirical Study of the Relationships between Macroscopic Traffic Parameters and Vehicle Emissions. (Under the direction of Dr. Nagui Rouphail.)Understanding the relation between traffic parameters and vehicle emissions is an important step toward reducing the potential for global warming, smog, ozone depletion, and respiratory illness. Traffic engineers, through improved roadway design and traffic control, have the ability to reduce vehicle emissions. However, current vehicle emissions models do not allow traffic analysts to easily and accurately predict vehicle emissions based on commonly used macroscopic traffic parameters (i.e., control delay, corridor stops, average speed).The primary purpose of this thesis is to develop a corridor-level methodology for quantifying the individual effects of delay and stops on hydrocarbon (HC), nitric oxide (NO), and carbon monoxide (CO) vehicle emissions. A secondary, but equally important, purpose is to evaluate the impact of signal coordination on vehicle emissions through a before and after study. This is an important funding issue because signal coordination projects currently receive CMAQ funding with the expectation of a reduction in vehicle emissions.The study focused on three signalized arterials in Research Triangle Park and Cary, North Carolina. The data collection procedure differed from the majority of past emissions research in focusing on the collection of real-world, on-road data from instrumented vehicles. Sixteen different vehicles and ten drivers were tested, resulting in a total of approximately 825 corridor runs, 140 vehicle-hours, and 3,060 vehicle-miles of simultaneous vehicle emissions and engine diagnostic data. The latter were manipulated to produce macroscopic traffic parameters such as free flow speed, delays, and stops.An important result from this thesis is that vehicle emissions are generally highest while vehicles are accelerating and lowest while idling. In addition, control delay and corridor stops have a quantifiable effect on vehicle emissions, as an increase in control delay and corridor stops produces an increase in emissions. HC emissions show the strongest dependence on delay and stops, while NO and CO emissions show a weaker dependence.For the most part, the results of the before and after study showed no statistically significant changes in traffic parameters (speed, delay, and stops). As a result, no statistically significant changes occurred in the vehicle emissions. However, when arranging the data into groups of congested and uncongested runs, a significant direct relationship was found between HC emissions and traffic congestion. NO and CO emissions did not change significantly, even with significant changes in traffic congestion.Overall, this thesis presents a first-of-a-kind investigation into the trends between traffic parameters and real-world, on-road vehicle emissions.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010302-101100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of Absorption and Post-Absorptive Metabolism of Inorganic and Organic Zinc Sources</field><field name="creator">Wright, Cody LeForge</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;A series of experiments was conducted to examine the absorption and post-absorptive metabolism of zinc (Zn) from inorganic and organic sources.

However, when Zn was supplemented at 500 mg Zn/kg DM for 12 d, plasma and tissue Zn concentrations were greater in bulls that received Zn proteinate (ZnProt) than in those that received ZnSO and Ca only, uptake and transport of Zn from inorganic and organic Zn sources were similar. However, when added at high concentration in the presence of dietary antagonists, Zn uptake from organic sources appeared to be greater than from inorganic sources.

Non-Classical Damping Properties and Modal Correlation Coefficient for Dynamic Analysis of Structures. (Under the direction of Abhinav Gupta and Ajaya Gupta.)The seismic response of secondary systems depends, in addition to their uncoupled dynamic characteristics, on the interaction with primary structures supporting them. This dissertation presents a verification study of the formulations to evaluate the seismic response of non-classically damped building-piping systems by modal synthesis approach. The existing studies consider only simple representative primary-secondary systems. No real-life like coupled system such as building-piping was used in these studies. Further, the majority of simple systems considered in these studies do not represent realistic coupled systems with significant effect of non-classical damping as they have either high values of mass ratios or systems with detuned modes.In this dissertation, different configurations of simple representative systems as well as real-life like building-piping systems are considered. Responses obtained from modal superposition time history analyses as well as response spectrum analyses are compared with the corresponding responses obtained by Brookhaven National Laboratory from the direct integration time history analyses. Modal superposition time history analyses results and direct integration time history analyses results are almost identical. The mean and standard deviation of responses from response spectrum analyses are close to the corresponding values evaluated using direct integration time history analysis. In addition to the verification results, a detailed discussion is also presented on the significance of non-classical damping. It is shown that the effect of non-classical damping is significant in systems that have nearly tuned modes and sufficiently small values of modal mass ratios. It is also illustrated that composite modal damping is an alternate form of classical damping that can result in incorrect responses in non-classically damped systems. Possible reasons for numerical and modeling differences that can occur in real-life like building-piping system are identified and their effect on the dynamic characteristics of the coupled system is illustrated.In the response spectrum method, the maximum modal responses are combined using an appropriate formulation for the modal correlation coefficient. This dissertation presents a new formulation which is based on the observation that the response spectrum method is a design method such that the statistical values of responses evaluated from multiple time history analyses should be close to the corresponding values obtained from the response spectrum method. Results from a numerical study using several real earthquake records are used to develop the new formulation. Different expressions are proposed for combining modal responses that have same algebraic sign and for those that have opposite algebraic signs.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010305-150413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Operating System Kernel for All Real Time Systems</field><field name="creator">Pinnix, Justin Everett</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;PINNIX, JUSTIN EVERETT.

We utilized radio telemetry during 1999 and 2000 to quantify the effects of dam removal on striped bass () and American shad () spawning migrations and habitat used. Locations oftelemetered striped bass and American shad were monitored continually throughout the spawning season. Spawning microhabitat utilized by American shad was compared to that available to them on the spawning grounds. No spawning habitat data werecollected for striped bass as they were widely distributed throughout the river and spawning was not observed. Of 22 telemetered American shad providing useable data,12 migrated beyond the former dam site. The average maximum distance migrated in 1999 and 2000 was 226 and 251 rkm, respectively. Of 23 striped bass providing usabledata, 15 migrated beyond the former dam site. The mean maximum distance migrated by striped bass in 1999 and 2000 was 218 and 250 rkm, respectively. In both years of this study, the primary American shad spawning grounds were located at rkm 239, 14rkm above the former dam site. Compared to available habitat, American shad used relatively coarse substrates consisting of gravel, cobble, and boulder. They also used intermediate current velocities (0.20-0.60 m/s) and depths (50-125 cm).

Use of Slurry Infiltrated Fiber Concrete in Hinge Regions of Earthquake Resistant Structures. (Under the direction of Dr. John Hanson, Distinguished Emeritus Professor of Civil Engineering)This dissertation reports on an experimental and analytical study of the use of precast slurry infiltrated fiber concrete (SIFCON) flexural hinges to improve the seismic resistance of reinforced concrete moment frames. The main thrust of the research was to investigate how different variables effect the nonlinear, cyclic, flexural behavior of reinforced SIFCON hinges, and to determine how to optimize hinge performance. In addition, a conceptual analysis was performed to evaluate the improvement in seismic resistance from using SIFCON hinges in concrete structures. Seven 10? wide, 16? deep, and 26? long reinforced SIFCON hinges were designedand fabricated, then tested under quasi-static loading. All specimens were fabricated using between 9 and 11%, by volume, Dramix 30/50 fibers, made by the Bekaert Corporation. Grade 60, Grade 75, and ASTM A722 (Dywidag) bars were used, in combination with three different SIFCON compression strengths. Additionally, various end connection details were used in testing three different reinforcing arrangements. It was shown that precast SIFCON hinges can exhibit better performance than reinforced concrete hinges. The maximum curvature ductility achieved was 26.4 over a 4? inch long interior region of a specimen. The curvature ductility of this hinge specimen, when taken over the full 26 inch hinge length, was 10.5. SIFCON hinges absorb approximately 30% more energy than fiber-reinforced concrete hinges. SIFCON hinge ductility is limited by the ultimate tensile strain of the reinforcing steel. Grade 60 reinforcing resulted in the best hinge behavior seen in testing. Transverse ties may be required to prevent buckling of compression reinforcing. SIFCON flexural stiffness is approximately half that of comparable strength reinforced concrete beams.It was found that SIFCON material behavior is highly variable. Fiber orientation and size effects are the main variables that affect SIFCON behavior. Fabrication technique and skill of workmanship greatly affects fiber orientation, while size effects make it difficult to predict insitu SIFCON properties. State-of-the-art models are not accurate enough to facilitate using SIFCON hinges to build more earthquake resistant structures. With present models, the weakest region of a beam may actually be the strongest region. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010312-183801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulations of Protein Refolding and Aggregation Using a Novel Intermediate-Resolution Protein Model</field><field name="creator">Smith, Anne Voegler</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The objective of this thesis is to study the phenomena of amorphousand ordered protein aggregation. For this work, we developed anintermediate-resolution protein model for use with the discontinuousmolecular dynamics algorithm. With this model, we simulatedmulti-protein systems at a greater level of detail than has previouslybeen possible and probed the energetic and structural characteristicsof amorphous and fibrillar protein aggregates.We first developed an intermediate-resolution protein model and testedits ability to produce realistic protein dynamics. Each model residueconsists of a three-bead backbone and a single-bead sidechain. Excluded volume, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactionsare represented by discontinuous potentials. Results show that themodel's backbone motion is limited to realistic regions ofphi-psi conformational space. In a series of simulations ondifferent homopeptides, trends in helicity as a function of residuetype are found to be consistent with results from previous studies.In simulations on a four-peptide system designed to produce a fourhelix bundle, the resulting native structure is consistent withexperimental and previous simulation studies.We then studied the competition between model protein refolding andamorphous aggregation for a model four helix bundle. Assembly of thebundle is found to be optimal within a fixed temperature range, withthe high-temperature boundary a function of the complexity of theprotein (or oligomer) to be folded and the low-temperature boundary afunction of the complexity of the protein's environment. As seenelsewhere, protein folding properties are strongly influenced by thepresence of other proteins, and aggregates have substantial levels ofnative secondary structure.Next we studied the stability, nucleation, and growth of a modelfibril aggregate. The stability of the model fibril is the result ofinter-peptide hydrophobic interactions, as has been suggested byexperimental studies, not of inter-peptide hydrogen bonds. A criticalordered substructure exists that must be present to ensure formationof the fibril. We also suggest, based on the model fibrilstructure, that the characteristic asymmetry of fibrils may be adirect result of the energetics of the system.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010313-213159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RESULTANTS OF COMPOSED POLYNOMIALS</field><field name="creator">MINIMAIR, MANFRED</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MINIMAIR, MANFRED.

The first and second moments of the input speech signal are mapped to the shape of the mouth. Predictor surfaces are built for four external shape parameters of the mouth. The surfaces include shapes for vowels and some voiced fricatives. Described also is a method for developing real time animation synchronized with sound for vowel and voiced fricative utterances with or without silence and sequences of utterances. The content or kind of speech is not known in advance. Spectral analysis is used to classify the type of sound. Training sounds are used to generate predictor surfaces. Voiced samples containing single sound without any mouth movement during utterance are used to train the system. All the extreme mouth positions and frequently occurring mouth shapes are taken into consideration during training. Relative values of the mouth parameters are set for these sounds; interpolatory surfaces are built using this known data and are used to predict the parameter values for future recordings. Hermite cubic polynomials are used to generate the shapes necessary to depict a human mouth and the jaw. Voice of three speakers is recorded and a comparison of the surfaces of these speakers is made. A speaker-dependent lip synchronization system that develops animation for vowel and voiced fricative utterances is developed.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010318-122753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Large-eddy Simulations of the Convective and Evening Transition Planetary Boundary Layers</field><field name="creator">DeCroix, David Scot</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Large-eddy simulation (LES) is a very useful tool in computationalfluid dynamics.

When some implicit Runge-Kutta methods are implemented as approximations to the dynamics of an optimal control problem, a loss of accuracy occurs when the dynamics are stiff or constrained. A new grid refinement strategy which exploits the variation of accuracy is discussed. In addition, the use of a residual function in place of classical error estimation techniques is proven to work well for stiff systems. Computational experience reveals the improvement in efficiency and reliability when the new strategies are incorporated as part of a direct transcription algorithm. For index three differential-algebraic equations, the solutions of some implicit Runge-Kutta methods may not converge. However, computational experience reveals apparent convergence for the same methods used when index three state inequality constraints become active. It is shown that the solution chatters along the constraint boundary allowing for better approximations.

Affinity, size exclusion, and ion-exchange chromatography were utilized to purify the protein to homogeneity. Protein DE purity was demonstrated using one and two-dimensional electrophoresis. Using the purified sample, an accurate molecular mass of 27,534 Daltons was determined using electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry. After four chromatographic steps, Protein DE was efficiently separated from all detectable epididymal proteins. This report provides the first rapid and reproducible method for purifying protein DE to homogeneity.Using western blot analysis and immunofluorescence, protein D is initially detected in rat epididymal tissue and associated with sperm from the distal caput region. In contrast, when sperm were recovered from the female reproductive tract seven hours after mating, protein D was not detected by western blot, but did display faint immunofluorescence. Additionally, using photoactivatible cross-linking, a 120 KD sperm membrane protein that specifically interacts with protein D was identified. A population of membrane bound protein D was released from NaCl washed epididymal sperm when incubated in the presence of phosphatidyl-inositol specific phospholipase C. This report is the first demonstrating that both the secretion and sperm-association of protein D occur in the distal caput region of the rat epididymis. It is the only report showing western blot analysis and immunolocalization of sperm-associated protein D on sperm deposited in the female reproductive tract after mating.

However, conventional methods of generatingand collecting of Lamb waves usually require bulky instruments and manual interference, thus can not be applieddirectly for in-situ or in-service monitoring of thestructural health. Especially, the method of interpretingthe Lamb waves in an active structural health monitoring(SHM) system with built-in piezoelectric sensors/actuatorsis not available yet. The objective of this study was to propose and validate, through numerical simulation and experimental studies, the feasibility of adopting the geophysical migration method to interpret the ultrasonic Lamb wave signals for the purpose of realizing quantitative damage identification. A homogeneous isotropic plate with a surface-mountedlinear piezoelectric ceramic (PZT) disk array is studied as an example. The piezoelectric disks act as actuators to excite Lamb waves and also as sensors to receive the waves reflected from the structural anomaly in the plate. The migration technique, which is an advanced technique in geophysics to reverse the reflection wave field and to image the Earth interior, is then used to back-propagate the recorded wave signals and to visually image the damage in the plate. Mindlin plate theory is adopted to model the propagating waves, and a two-dimensional 2-6 order explicit finite difference algorithm is used to synthesize the reflection waves and to implement the migration process. The stability and accuracy criteria of the finite differencealgorithm when used in plate problems is discussed. An analytical solution is derived for the transient Lamb waves of an infinite plate subject to a point loading. This solution is used to verify the accuracy of the finite difference calculation. Both poststack and prestack migration are studied to propagate the reflection energy back to the damages. For the poststack migration, a one-way version of flexural wave equation is derived and the data pre-processing procedures before migration, such as muting direct arrival, deconvolution and stacking, are discussed. For prestack migration, an excitation-time imaging condition specifically for the migration of waves in a plate is introduced based on ray-tracing concepts and the asymptotic properties of flexural wave velocities and the migration is proceeded through the full-way wave equation. The results of numerical simulation show that the migration method possesses the capability of identifying multiple discrete damages without a priori assumption on the distribution pattern of the damages. Thus not only the existence but also the shape and the dimensions of the damages can be visually identified. An experimental apparatus is then set up to validate the conclusions drawn from the synthetic data. For calibration of the system, an analytical model of the waves in a plate incorporated with PZT sensors/actuators is developed.

The research was motivated by potential inconsistencies in the level-of-service thresholds between the 1994 and 1997 Highway Capacity Manuals. The research identified four existing analytical models that describe the stopped to control delay relationship, Reilly-Gardner, Akcelik, Teply, and Quigora-Bullock. &lt;p&gt;The research also identified five variables as having an impact on the stopped to control delay relationship, namely the delay magnitude, controller type, number of lanes, percent split, and approach speed. Focusing on actuated controllers, a comprehensive simulation-based dataset was developed using CORSIM that allowed for direct comparison of the existing analytical models noted above. None of the four models proved capable of describing all the factors that affect the stopped to control delay relationship. The CORSIM dataset was also used to test the consistency of the 1994 and 1997 level-of-service thresholds, which were found to be inconsistent. Using control delay and the 1997 thresholds tended toward a worse level-of-service than using stopped delay with the 1994 thresholds. &lt;p&gt;Using the same CORSIM dataset, three new analytical models describing the stopped to control delay relationship were developed. Both the existing and the newly developed analytical models were validated using field data. The validation steps showed that one of the newly developed models, called the Multivariate-Linear Model, provided the best overall description of the stopped to control delay relationship. This model was used to develop a new set of level-of-service thresholds for use with control delay. This new set of thresholds was shown to be more consistent with the 1994 Highway Capacity Manual stopped delay thresholds than the 1997 Highway Capacity Manual control delay thresholds.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010329-180327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Hypersonic Aircraft Inlets Using Flow Adaptive Mesh Algorithms</field><field name="creator">Neaves, Michael Dean</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The numerical investigation into the dynamics of unsteady inlet flowfields is applied to a three-dimensional scramjet inlet-isolator-diffuser geometry designed for hypersonic type applications.

TO FISH SECRETA</field><field name="creator">Cancellieri, Paul Joseph</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Dinoflagellates represent a diverse group of both auxotrophic and heterotrophic protists. Most heterotrophic dinoflagellates are raptorial feeders that encounter prey using ?temporal-gradient sensing? chemotaxis wherein cells move along a chemical gradient in a directed manner toward the highest concentration. Using short-term ?memory? to determine the orientation of the gradient, dinoflagellates swim in a ?run-and-tumble? pattern, alternating directed swimming with rapid changes in orientation. As the extracellular concentration of the attractant increases, a corresponding increase in the ratio of net-to-gross displacement results in overall movement toward the stimulus.The dinoflagellates Pfiesteria piscicida and P. shumwayae are heterotrophic estuarine species with complex life cycles that include amoeboid, flagellated, and cyst stages, that have been implicated as causative agents in numerous major fish kills in the southeastern United States These organisms show documented ?ambush-predator? behavior toward live fish in culture, including rapid transformations among stages and directed swimming toward fish prey in a manner that suggests the presence of a strong signalling relationship between live fish and cells of Pfiesteria spp.Zoospores of the two species of Pfiesteria can be divided into three functional types: TOX-A designates actively toxic isolates fed on fish prey; TOX-B refers to temporarily non-toxic cultures that have recently (1 week to 6 months) been removed from fish prey (and fed alternative algal prey); and NON-IND refers to isolates without apparent ichthyotoxic ability (tested as unable to kill fish in the standardized fish bioassay process; or without access to fish for ca. 1.5 years). Several Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates have been isolated from samples in which P. piscicida and P. shumwayae are also present, including several cryptoperidiniopsoid species that have repeatedly been tested as lacking ichthyotoxic capability under ecologically relevant conditions (cell densities that occur in estuaries).Microcapillary assay techniques were employed to determine the attraction of P. piscicida and P. shumwayae zoospores to sterile-filtered fish mucus and excreta. Differences in attraction were measured among functional types, and between these two species and several isolates of cryptoperidiniopsoids, in ten-minute trials in which zoospores entering tubes filled with test substances were observed and counted. TOX-A zoospores of both P. piscicida and P. shumwayae were strongly and comparably attracted to fish secreta/excreta, relative to their behavior toward microcapillary tubes that were filled with filtered seawater. TOX-B zoospores of both Pfiesteria species showed intermediate attraction toward fish materials that appeared to be inversely related to time isolated from fish prey. NON-IND zoospores exhibited low attraction to fish materials. Cryptoperidiniopsoid zoospores showed moderate attraction with no apparent influence of previous exposure to fish.In an additional experiment that examined the signal activity in fish materials over time after collection from fresh fish, unfiltered fish materials ceased to attract P. piscicida zoospores after approximately 48 hours and ultrafiltered materials maintained attractive ability over the duration of the experiment (72 hours). These data show that filtration of fish materials may be used to extend the useful life of the chemical signal, possibly by removing bacteria that consume or degrade it.In recent years, several researchers have identified fish kairomones (pheromones that benefit the recipient) present in fish mucus that induce life history and behavioral changes in a range of zooplankters. It is likely that one or more of these kairomones, or similar compounds, are responsible for the behavioral and developmental changes observed in Pfiesteria spp. in the presence of live fish. Data from these experiments support the current understanding that significant behavioral differences exist between functional types of Pfiesteria spp., and between these toxic dinoflagellate species and known lookalike dinoflagellates without ichthyotoxic activity under ecologically relevant conditions.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010402-173118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Appearance Preserving Data Simplification</field><field name="creator">Walter, Jason David</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Many visualization environments constantly face the issue of dealingwith large, complex datasets. Often these datasets are so complexthat rendering a visualization would seem impractical. Likewise,enormous amounts of data may overwhelm the human visual system; therebyrendering the data incomprehensible. Thus, the need arises to deal withthese datasets in some arbitrary manner such that the resultingdataset represents the original whole --- while reducing thecost on the human and computer visual system. &lt;p&gt;A closely related problem can be found in geometric models, typicallyrepresented as a piecewise linear collection of connected polygons (amesh). Meshes can be obtained from range scanners or created with acomputer aided design package. However, these obtained meshes areoften very dense and have high spatial frequency. An active area ofcomputer graphics research is directed at the simplification of thesedense meshes. Initially, mesh simplification research aimed atpreserving only the topology, but the most recent research, appearancepreserving mesh simplification, is aimed at simplification whilepreserving surface properties of the mesh, such as color or texture.&lt;p&gt;Our work addresses the use of appearance preserving meshsimplification in a data simplification environment, as well as, theissues of doing so. As a result, we present and demonstrate a generalmethod to simplify large multidimensional datasets using anyappearance preserving mesh simplification algorithm. We add the use ofprincipal components analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the dataprior to simplification, which allows faster simplification on highdimensional data, and despite the reduction in dimensionality we haveshown full preservation of key features in the dataset.

Fault Detection and Model Identification in Linear Dynamical Systems. (Under the direction of Dr. Stephen La Vern Campbell.) Linear dynamical systems, Ex'+Fx=f(t), in which E is singular, are useful in a wide variety of applications. Because of this wide spread applicability, much research has been done recently to develop theory for the design of linear dynamical systems. A key aspect of system design is fault detection and isolation (FDI). One avenue of FDI is via the multi-model approach, in which the parameters of the nominal, unfailed model of the system are known, as well as the parameters of one or more fault models. The design goal is to obtain an indicator for when a fault has occurred, and, when more than one type is possible, which type of fault it is. A choice that must be made in the system design is how to model noise. One way is as a bounded energy signal. This approach places very few restrictions on the types of noisy systems which can be addressed, requiring no complex modeling requirement. This thesis applies the multi-model approach to FDI in linear dynamical systems, modeling noise as bounded energy signals. A complete algorithm is developed, requiring very little on-line computation, with which nearly perfect fault detection and isolation over a finite horizon is attained. The algorithm applies techniques to convert complex system relationships into necessary and sufficient conditions for the solutions to optimal control problems. The first such problem provides the fault indicator via the minimum energy detection signal, while the second problem provides for fault isolation via the separating hyperplane. The algorithm is implemented and tested on a suite of examples in commercial optimization software. The algorithm is shownto have promise in nonlinear problems, time varying problems, and certain types of linear problems for which existing theory is not suitable.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010403-112605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cylindrical Wire Electrical Discharge Truing of Metal Bond Diamond Grinding Wheels</field><field name="creator">Rhoney, Brian Keith</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The goal of this research was to use the wire Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) to profile a metal bond diamond grinding wheel, and then study the wear and grinding performance of the EDM trued wheel. Diamond wheels are known to exhibit low wheel wear for precision grinding of ceramics but create difficulty in creating precision trued forms. With the increased use of hard engineering ceramics in mechanical design, new methods of truing these wheels had to be investigated. In profiling a vitrified bond diamond wheel, a Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) single point diamond or a diamond crush roll is often used. However, due to the high strength of the metal bond matrix, these methods cannot be implemented with a metal bond diamond wheel. Instead of applying a mechanical force, Wire Electrical Discharge Truing (WEDT) process utilizes electrical sparks to erode the metal matrix, which allows the non-conductive diamonds to simply fall away. A precision spindle was first built to rotate the wheel inside a traditional wire EDM machine. Once the process proved feasible, grinding studies were developed to compare the performance of a WEDT wheel against a diamond rotary trued/stick dressed wheel. Grinding force, surface finish of the ground silicon nitride parts, and wheel wear were all examined. The surfaces of both truing methods were compared using Stereo-Scanning Electron Microscopy to measure the protruding diamonds' height and identify the wear mechanism. Result of the research shows promise for the future use of WEDT as a truing method for metal bond wheels. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010404-133336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EPRAM: A Risk Analysis and Mitigation-Based Evolutionary Prototyping Model for Quality Requirements Development.</field><field name="creator">Carter, Ryan Alden</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary prototyping focuses on the iteration of software planning, implementation, and evaluation while gathering a correct and consistent set of requirements. The process lends particular strength to building quality software due, in part, to the ongoing clarification of existing requirements and the discovery of previously missing or unknown requirements. Traditionally, however, the iterative reexamination of a system?s requirements has not been the panacea that practitioners sought due to the predisposition for requirements creep and the difficulty in managing it. This thesis describes the use of evolutionary prototyping in conjunction with an aggressive risk-mitigation strategy. Together, these techniques support successful requirement discovery and clarification and guard against the negative effects of requirements creep; an aspect that general evolutionary prototyping methodologies have not mastered. These techniques are embodied in a comprehensive software development model, which has been christened as the EPRAM (Evolutionary Prototyping with Risk Analysis and Mitigation) model. To ensure that quality is inherent within this process model, the Software Engineering Institute?s (SEI) Capability Maturity Model (CMM) was tailored to conform to the development environments of small teams, projects, and organizations and was used as a mature base upon which to build the model. The model was intentionally designed to comply with the Level 2 Key Process Areas (KPA) of the CMM. Validation of the EPRAM model has occurred on several software development efforts employing the model to support the rapid development of electronic commerce applications. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010404-143113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deterministic Modeling and Long Range Prediction ofFast Fading Channels with Applications to Mobile Radio Systems</field><field name="creator">Eyceoz, Tugay</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;In wireless communication systems, the direct signal andthe reflected signals form an interference pattern resulting in a received signal given by the sum of these components. They are distinguished by their Doppler shifts at the mobile. Since the parameters associated with these components are slowly varying, the fading coefficients can be accurately predicted far ahead. We introduced a novel algorithm for long range predictionof fading channels. This algorithm finds the linear Minimum MeanSquared Error (MMSE) estimate of the future fading coefficientsgiven a fixed number of previous observations. We show that thesuperior performance of this algorithm is due to its longer memoryspan achieved by using lower sampling rate given fixed model orderrelative to the conventional (data rate) methods of fadingprediction. This long range prediction capability for fading channels would provide enabling technology for accurate power control, reliable transmitter and/or receiver diversity, more effective adaptive modulation and coding and improvements in many other components ofwireless systems. In this thesis, we demonstrate that largeimprovements in the performance are possible for both flat andfrequency-selective rapidly varying fading channels when theproposed prediction method is used.

The grinding mechanism tests, which are outlined, suggest involvement of a thermal mechanism, a hypothesis of which is outlined. In order to validate this hypothesis, an investigation of flash grinding temperatures, an indicator of heat generation and thereby a means to validate the hypothesis, was conducted.The theoretical background, actual implementation, and results of each of three different temperature analysis methods are presented. The first method, a single-wavelength infrared camera, provided indications of temperature distribution. However, it did not provide temperature indications because of uncertainties in the grinding process that make calibrations ambiguous. The second method, a dual-wavelength ratio method, verified the possibility for fast time-response analysis of the grinding process. As an adequate calibration was not achieved for this method, it provides no quantitative results. The third method is the implementation of a spectrometer, which provided repeatable calibrated flash temperature indications. Results from this portion of the study indicate temperatures that, for the range of wheel speeds and downfeed rates tested, depend solely on the wheel and workpiece used. For these tests, dense vitreous bond silicon carbide grinding wheels generate temperatures of 3000 K for grinding MgO-doped zirconia and temperatures of 2400 K for grinding alumina. When grinding these materials with a diamond abrasive wheel, temperatures of 3000 K for grinding zirconia were registered, and no signal was registered for grinding alumina.

Business process modeling methodologies are surveyed and the methodology of choice, Actionworkflow?, is presented. As the basis for method development Language/Action and Speech Act theories, underlying the Actionworkflow? methodology, are examined for potential concepts aiding the development of the method. Their history and surrounding philosophies are presented. Critique of the Actionworkflow? methodology is presented and discussed.The major focus of the research is the development of the model-based method to conceptually design communications in coordination systems. Its development, structure and components are presented and explained. The method is illustrated with a simple, everyday-life, application example. Applications of the method to examine web-based e-commerce sites are presented. It has been determined that the application for these environments is insightful. The examples discussed are ebay, an auction provider, e-trade, an on-line broker, and priceline.com, a purchasing service applying a unique process for the purchase of services and goods. Consequently the application of the method to establish the feasibility of designing coordination support systems for textile new product development is provided. Coordination model development and design of communications are discussed in parallel. Application results show that the method can successfully be used for conceptually designing coordination support systems, although practical issues have to be further investigated.Finally underlying assumptions are displayed and discussed, model validation provided, performance evaluation, as to the goals set forth for the research undertaken, and recommendations for future research provided. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Management and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010405-170340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FAMILY EXPRESSIVENESS AND EMOTION UNDERSTANDING: A META-ANALYSIS OF ONE ASPECT OF PARENTAL EMOTION SOCIALIZATION</field><field name="creator">Eaton, Kimberly L.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACTEATON, KIMBERLY LINHART.

This work is especially germane given: 1) the rising costs and complexity of manufacturing; 2) the increasing deluge of data provided by process andequipment sensors that are developed, in part, to address these costs; and 3) the lack of adequate tools for handling the information overload. The sheer quantity of data is currently outstripping conventional means of storage and analysis; as a result, an increased fraction of this data must be discarded or incompletely processed. Ultimately, by developing advanced tools and methodologies to address these issues, cost and performance-driven decisions can be made in a timely and cost-effective manner. The content of this dissertation impacts these critical issues through the following specific contributions. Wavelet-based methodologies were developed for the localized modeling and compression of key process-relevant information, especially information pertaining to the detection of equipment and process faults. These methodologies significantly contribute to the following general problems: 1) identification of specific local features in potentially large nonstationary data sets; 2) compression of entire data sets consisting of disjoint smooth and nonsmooth segments; and 3) improvement in the quality of modeling for important local features carrying key information. This thesis addressed these problems using wavelet networks, as the tool, and the following novel approaches: 1) a novel objective function that incorporates both global and local error as well as model parsimony; 2) a novel adaptive network initialization scheme; 3) a novel application of the wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM) representation to help determine and prioritize the set of local features; 4) a new network construction procedure; and 5) a new errorspace analysis (ESA) technique, to assist in the visualization of both local and global network approximation errors during wavelet network construction. Information gathered in situ using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) sensor facilitated the development of a novel and unique approach for monitoring the selective film thickness during selective growth of silicon epitaxy. Moreover, this approach is applicable to the detection of one particularly critical process fault --- loss of selectivity. In particular, since QMS sensors are currently in widespread use in most vacuum systems, this technique represents a viable, cost-effective solution to selectivity loss detection that appears readily transferable to other process chemistries. In general, by correlating similar in situ process metrics (e.g., signal area) to ex situ process observables (e.g., thin-film thickness), contributions are made to: 1) thin-film metrology and metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) gate-stack engineering; 2) run-to-run detection of aberrant signalmodes, including process and equipment faults; and 3) decision-making using wavelet-compressed spaces. The methodologies developed in this thesis appear to be broadly applicable to otherdisciplines and fields of endeavor, including intelligent manufacturing and information technology. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010406-123426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">COMPUTER AIDED TOOLSFORSEAMLESS HIGH DENSITY INTERCONNECTS</field><field name="creator">Varma, Ambrish Kant</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Varma, Ambrish Kant.

Both species readily utilized rhododendron as a nesting substrate but was lowest for nests initiated mid-season (0.9472 &#177; 0.009 and 0.9519 &#177; 0.012, respectively) as opposed to early (0.9664 &#177; 0.008 and 0.9652 &#177; 0.009, respectively) or late (0.9708 &#177; 0.006 and 0.9862 &#177; 0.006, respectively) in the season.Both species selected nest sites with high cover of low shrubs and small disturbances. However, nests in rhododendron (t = 3.58, df = 56, p &lt; 0.05) and over all (t = 6.89, df = 122, p &lt; 0.001). Nest fate was dependent on cover 1 m above the nest for both species. These results highlight the subtle differences in the ecology of similar species that may allow for species coexistence. Additionally, small changes in management can potentially affect similar species differently. High nest success of in the southern Appalachians indicates that these forests may indeed be source populations. Future research should be directed towards mortality during other times in these species' annual cycle.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010416-214515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development Of An Instrument To Measure Proportional Reasoning Among Fast-Track Middle School Students</field><field name="creator">Allain, Ashley</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ALLAIN, ASHLEY. Development of an Instrument to Measure Proportional Reasoning Among Fast-Track Middle School Students. (Under the direction of North Carolina State University Graduate Faculty). The purpose of the study was to develop a reliable and valid instrument for measuring proportional reasoning among fast-track middle school girls in Wake County, North Carolina. The study sample consisted of 70 girls who attended the summer 2000 Girls on Track program at Meredith College located in Raleigh, North Carolina. The grade level for each of the participants ranged from 6th grade through 8th grade for the 2000-2001 school year. The instrument used in this study is the Proportional Reasoning Assessment Instrument. This instrument was developed by the researcher and is based upon problems discussed in relevant literature. The test items chosen include missing value, comparison, mixture, associated sets, part-part-whole, graphing and scale problems. The instrument is comprised of 10 open-ended items of varying difficulty levels. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Version 10.0 (SPSS) and EXCEL. A four-point grading rubric was used to score each test item. Two measure of internal consistency were calculated to determine reliability: Chrombach?s coefficient alpha and inter-rater reliability. A panel of experts examined the test instrument for the qualities of relevance, balance, and specificity to establish content validity. Criterion validity was established through determining the correlation between students? scores on the Proportional Reasoning Assessment Instrument and the students? scores on the North Carolina End-of-Grade exam. A detailed item analysis was performed including item difficulty, item discrimination, item means, item variances, and inter-item correlations.Results from the study reveal the Proportional Reasoning Assessment Instrument is a reliable and valid test instrument for measuring proportional reasoning among fast-track middle school girls. In addition, the instrument revealed common misconceptions among the students in the sample. The overall coefficient alpha is and inter-rater agreement was 96%. The average difficulty is and the average discrimination is . Each test item contributed to the central purpose of the instrument due to the absence of negative discrimination indices.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010417-144134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Comparison of Digital Vegetation Mapping and Image Orthorectification Methods Using Aerial Photography of Valley Forge National Historical Park</field><field name="creator">Koch, Frank Henry Jr.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;In recent years, mapping software utilizing scanned?or ?softcopy??aerial photographs has become widely available. Using scanned photos of Valley Forge (PA) National Historical Park, I explored some of the latest tools for image processing and computer-based vegetation mapping. My primary objective was to compare different approaches for their efficiency and accuracy. In keeping with the USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program protocol, I classified the park?s vegetation according to The Nature Conservancy?s National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS).&lt;p&gt;Initially, I scanned forty-nine 1:6000 color-infrared air photos of the area at 600 dpi using an Epson desktop scanner. I orthorectified the images by two different methods. First, I did so on a single-image basis using ERDAS Imagine. In this approach, United States Geological Survey (USGS) Digital Ortho Quarter Quadrangles (DOQQ) and a 10-meter Digital Elevation Model (DEM) served as references for between seven and twelve ground control points per photo. After achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 1 meter for an image, I resampled it into an orthophoto. I then repeated the process using Imagine Orthobase. Via aerial triangulation, Orthobase generated an RMSE solution for the entire block of images, which I resampled into orthophotos using a batch process. &lt;p&gt; Positional accuracies were remarkably similar for image mosaics I created from the single-image as well as the Orthobase orthophotos. For both mosaics, planimetric x-coordinate accuracy met the U.S. National Map Accuracy Standard for Class 1 maps, while planimetric y-coordinate accuracy met the Class 2 standard. However, the Orthobase method is faster?reducing process time by 50%?and requires 20% (or less) of the ground control points necessary for the single-image method.&lt;p&gt;I delineated the park?s vegetation to the formation level of the NVCS. Using ESRI ArcMap, I digitized polygons of homogeneous areas observed from the orthophotos. This on-screen mapping approach was largely monoscopic, though I verified some areas using a scanning stereoscope and the original hard-copy photos. The minimum mapping unit (MMU) was 0.5 acres (ac), smaller than that recommended by the USGS-NPS protocol. Based on field data, thematic accuracy for this map met the National Map Accuracy Standard of 80%. Misestimation of the hydrologic period of certain polygons resulted in some classification errors, as did confusion between evergreen and deciduous vegetation. &lt;p&gt;In addition to orthophotos, Orthobase creates a stereo block viewable in ERDAS Stereo Analyst, a digital stereoscopic software package. Using Crystal Eyes? eyewear and a high-refresh-rate monitor, a user can observe imagery full screen, three-dimensionally. Features delineated on the images are stored in ESRI shapefile format. I created a preliminary vegetation map at the alliance level of the NVCS with this software. Thematic accuracy of this map will be known when assessment is completed this summer. Notably, the classification scheme has required revision to accommodate the anthropogenically altered landscape of Valley Forge. &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it is clear that Stereo Analyst offers advantages for vegetation and other types of mapping. Stereoscopic view and sharp zoom-in capabilities make photo interpretation straightforward. Because features are delineated directly into a GIS, Stereo Analyst cuts process time by 70% and avoids two steps that can introduce errors in conventional mapping methods (i.e., transfer to map base and digitizing). Perhaps most importantly, joint use of Orthobase and Stereo Analyst allows simultaneous orthophoto creation and GIS data collection; in contrast, the ArcMap approach requires finished orthophotos before features can be delineated. Ultimately, though, both monoscopic and stereoscopic methods have roles in vegetation mapping projects. The level of detail required for the project should determine which technique is most appropriate. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural Resources</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010417-180334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient Trialing Methods for Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.)

Matsum. &amp; Nakai). (Under the direction of Dr. Todd C. Wehner) Researchers interested in evaluating watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. &amp; Nakai) cultivars for yield use multiple-row plots to simulate the monoculture system growers use, or single-row plots to save on land, labor, and seeds. We were interested in whether there is a significant interaction of border with center row when diverse cultivars are planted in adjacent rows. Charleston Gray, Crimson Sweet, and Sugar Baby were chosen to represent long, medium, and short vined cultivars, respectively. Cultivars were planted in three-row plots with all nine combinations of the three represented in border and center rows. Each cultivar combination of center row and border rows represented one treatment. The experiment was a randomized complete block with nine plot treatments, two locations (Kinston, Clinton), and three replications. Vine length was measured during the season, and fruit were graded (marketable and cull), counted and weighed at four harvests. Results showed that Charleston Gray had the longest vines, followed by Crimson Sweet and Sugar Baby. In the analysis of variance, the largest effects (F ratio size) on yield were from cultivar, location, and the interaction of the two. The smallest effects were due to the interaction of center with border row, although center by border interactions were significant (5% level) in some cases. Therefore, researchers interested in running trials with many cultivars and small seed quantities can obtain good data using single-row plots. However, there is a small (but significant) interaction of center with border in some cases, so testing at the final stage should be with trials having multiple-row plots or grouping cultivars by vine length. Cultivars having extreme plant types (dwarf vines for example) should be tested in separate trials. One of the most expensive stages of breeding is field testing. This encourages breeders and researchers to make efficient use of limited land, labor and seed in order to maximize information obtained while minimizing the costs of trialing. We were interested in whether smaller single-row plots could be used that would effectively be able to achieve and predict yields obtained from plots with larger dimensions when diverse cultivars were evaluated. The 13 cultivars Allsweet, Fiesta, Regency, Starbrite, Sultan, Florida Favorite, Charleston Gray, Hopi Red Flesh, Crimson Sweet, Jubilee, Navajo Sweet, New Hampshire Midget, and Sugar Baby were used to represent a wide range in yield. Cultivars were planted in single-row plots of three different plot lengths (7.3 m, 3.7 m, and 2.4 m) with all cultivars represented in each plot size. Each combination of cultivar and plot size represented one treatment. The experiment was a randomized complete block with 39 plot treatments, two locations (Kinston and Clinton) and three replications. Fruit were graded (marketable and cull), counted and weighed at five harvests. Analysis of variance indicated the largest effects (F ratio size) on plot yields were from location, plot size and cultivar. The smallest effects were due to the interactions of location with plot size, and cultivar by location by plot size. A location by cultivar interaction was also present, but F ratios were small indicating a small effect. Yields from 7.3 m and 3.7 m plots were consistently no different from each other. Regression analysis of 2.4 m and 3.7 m plots in prediction of 7.3 m plot yields showed 3.7 m plots to have higher R2 (0.90), lower mean square error, lower standard deviations and a lower coefficient of variation than was found for 2.4 m plots. Therefore, researchers interested in maximizing information obtained while minimizing costs in trials with many cultivars can obtain data representative of large 7.3 m plots using 3.7 m plots. However, alleys separating 7.3 m and 3.7 m plots required a yield correction to compensate for the extra growing space allotted to these plots.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010418-163521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE GIFT OF TIME: THE IMPACT OF POLITICAL AND HUMAN NATURE PERSPECTIVES ON THE DECISION TO VOLUNTEER</field><field name="creator">HOLSOPPLE, ELIZABETH HATCH</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt; This study examines the relationship between a person?s volunteer activity and their attitude toward government involvement in social programs, feelings of efficacy in the political system and interest in politics in general. The connection between political views and volunteering is an important one to consider when evaluating public outcry against government intrusion into what some claim is a community?s prerogative to take care of their own. Does the outcry emanate from citizens who shoulder responsibility for communal problems and involve themselves in its activities and needs? In addition, the analysis tests part of Robert Putnam?s Social Capital Theory by evaluating its role in determining who volunteers in America. It seeks to prove that an individual?s positive feelings of trust, helping behavior and fairness in others are a motivating force behind his or her decision to volunteer. Finally, the study attempts to confirm that those who read the newspaper more and watch television less are more apt to give time back to their communities. Survey data from the 1996 General Social Survey was used to create an index measurement of the dependent volunteering variable. Next, indexes were created to gauge both a person?s feeling of efficacy within the political system and their attitude towards government?s role in supporting social programs. When tested against the dependent variable, survey respondents? views regarding personal efficacy within the political system, faith in American democracy in general, and support for government responsibility in multiple social areas did not play a significant role in determining whether or not a person volunteered. Supporting existing literature, however, interest in politics in general did have a positive and significant relationship to volunteering. The same volunteer index was tested against various factors that were considered to approximate aspects of Putnam?s theory. Time spent watching television did not have an impact on the level of volunteering among respondents to the survey. Similarly, frequency of reading the newspaper did not increase one?s propensity to volunteer, despite the findings of Putnam which positively associated news reading with stronger levels of social trust and group membership. The variable asking respondents whether people are helpful most of the time, versus people look out for themselves, did not have a significant effect on the dependent variable. However, an individual?s opinion that it is important to teach children to help others yielded the strongest positive standardized coefficient within its particular model than all other independent variables tested in the analysis. Finally, the feeling that people are fair and can be trusted had a small, yet significant, effect on the volunteer variable. In keeping with Putnam?s argument, trust makes volunteering more likely, and that increased involvement in one?s community ? in theory ? could encourage an even greater level of community efficacy and trust.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010418-231851</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perception-Based Development and PerformanceTesting of a Non-Linear Map Display</field><field name="creator">Mountjoy, Daniel Neal</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The use of non-linear display methodologies has been successfullydemonstrated in a number of text- based and simple, graphic networkapplications; however, most studies have focused on computationalefficiency with very little attention to human perceptual limitations.While the benefits of non-linear displays are purported to be due toadditional context with no loss of required detail, reports of end-userperformance gains have been limited at best. This research entailed thedesign of a non-linear tactical map display, where the distortionparameters were based upon empirical test results of navigation- relatedtasks combining various scales and distortion techniques. A total ofthree experiments were conducted: two to define the non-linear displayparameters, and the third to attempt to validate the display through aperformance test using military participants. Results indicate thatadditional scales can indeed be combined on the same map surface with nosignificant penalty in navigation accuracy. However, there may be aresponse time difference depending on the particular distortion techniqueapplied. A modified fisheye distortion proved to be better suited to thistask environment than a Cartesian bifocal distortion. Performance testingversus a traditional, pan and zoom display interface yielded nodifferences in navigation task accuracy or response times. However, theexpected gain in random event detection (through display of additionalcontext) was not evident. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010419-154212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CONSTRUCTION WORKERS' REACTIONS TO STRUCTURAL ALIENATION AND INEQUALITY</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Robert</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ROBINSON, ROBERT. Construction Workers' Reactions to Structural Alienation and Inequality. (Under the direction of L. Richard Della Fave.) Using a participant observation approach, this study documents specific examples of structural alienation in the lifeworlds of 35 residential construction workers (in North Carolina and Virginia) who perform finish work--such as painting and floor refinishing--on expensive houses. It includes a look at what these workers think about the inequalities that they see and help to create within the society. Despite the fact that they get to see how some of the richest individuals in this society live, the workers in this study believe in the legitimacy of inequality and in the premise of the equity principle--that individuals deserve unequal rewards depending upon how much they produce within the society. There were a number of ways that the workers coped with the structural alienation and relative deprivation that they experienced on the job. Many of these workers experienced economic conditions where they were just trying to survive and they mainly focused their attention on this aspect of their lives. Other ways that they coped included attempting to maximize their position within the status hierarchy of the job, exhibiting pride in their work and craft skills, and focusing their attention on what they were doing when they were not working--such as interacting with family, friends, and members of their status groups who share common consumption patterns with themselves. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010419-222746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">N-SYMPLECTIC ANALYSIS OF FIELD THEORY</field><field name="creator">McLean, Michael A.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Two techniques for relating n-symplectic geometry tothe jet bundle formulations of classical fieldtheory are presented.The tangent bundle of the frame bundle of a manifoldM is shown to be a principal fiber bundle over thejet bundle of the tangent bundle of M.

Tunablity isprovided only at the one end, namely at thetransmitter. Our objective is to schedule multicast transmission in a tunable transmitterand a fixed receiver broadcast WDM network. In a Single-hop WDM network having fixedreceivers, the unicast and multicast traffic can be scheduled by a single scheduling algorithm.If so, the problem of scheduling multicast traffic, reduces to a Wavelength Assignmentproblem as to assign wavelengths to the fixed receivers before scheduling multicast packettransmission. A receiver-to-channel assignment has to meet two con icting requirements.The first requirement is to minimize the number of retransmissions. The retransmissionsare caused when members of a multicast group are assigned to different wavelengths andthe group traffic is transmitted on each of these wavelengths. The second requirement is tomaximize the channel utilization, to balance the incoming traffic optimally on all the avail-able wavelengths. We address a fairly general version of the problem as we allow arbitrarytraffic demands and arbitrary multicast group membership distribution. First, we definethe Wavelength Assignment problem formally and prove it to be NP-Hard problem. Sincethe problem is intractable in nature, next we develop different heuristics. The heuristicsare evaluated based on their success in achieving the tradeoff between lower running timerequirements and the accuracy of the obtained result to the optimum solution. Finally, wevary the different system parameters such as the number of nodes, channels and multicastgroups and analyze their in uence on the performance of the developed heuristics.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010430-154109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solving Systems of Linear Inequalities</field><field name="creator">Chen, Shyh-Huei</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The problem of finding a feasible solution to a system of linear inequalities arises in numerous contexts.

This approach takes into account the model,parameter, and stochastic uncertainties that are inherent in mostsimulation experiments in order to yield valid predictive inferences aboutthe output quantities of interest. We use prior information to specify theprior plausibility of each candidate input model that adequately fits thedata, and to construct prior distributions on the parameters of eachmodel. We combine prior information with the likelihood function of thedata to compute the posterior model probabilities and the posteriorparameter distributions using Bayes' rule. This leads to a BayesianSimulation Replication Algorithm in which: (a) we estimate the parameteruncertainty by sampling from the posterior distribution of each model'sparameters on selected simulation runs; (b) we estimate the stochasticuncertainty by multiple independent replications of those selected runs;and (c) we estimate model uncertainty by weighting the results of (a) and(b) using the corresponding posterior model probabilities. We alsoconstruct a confidence interval on the posterior mean response from theoutput of the algorithm, and we develop a replication allocation procedurethat optimally allocates simulation runs to input models so as to minimizethe variance of the mean estimator subject to a budget constraint oncomputer time.

Algorithms for the multi-stage parallel machine problem with buffer constraints. (Under the direction of Yahya Fathi).We study two problems in the context of scheduling N jobs on parallel machines in L successive stages with the primary objective of minimizing the makespan. In the first problem we assume that there are unlimited buffer capacities between successive stages. We refer to this problem as the FSPM problem. In the second problem, we assume that the buffer capacities are finite and given, and we refer to it as FSPM/b problem. Both problems are shown to be NP-hard.We focus our attention in developing heuristic search procedures for solving both problems. These procedures include the local improvement, the genetic algorithm, and the tabu search. In this context, we use two different solution representations, namely the matrix representation and the vector representation. To evaluate these procedures on an empirical basis, we carry out an extensive computational experiment consisting of two different types of data sets. The problem instances in one data set are constructed in such a manner that the corresponding optimal makespan can be easily determined. The optimal makespan of the instances in the second data set are not known. We also develop a set of lower bounds for the optimal makespan of the problem. The experimental results with the procedures that we propose show that the search procedures which are based on vector representation perform reasonably well. Among the various procedures based on this representation, our tabu search implementation was the most effective.In the context of FSPM/b problem, we also conduct an experiment with a third set of data which is available in the open literature.

The experimental set-up consists of a flat plate with an inverted airfoil mounted above its surface. This set-up permits laminar separation bubbles to be examined over a range of Reynolds numbers and pressure distributions. An SMA-actuated mechanical turbulator is developed in the present work. A multi-element hot-film array is used to detect the laminar separation, transition to turbulence, and turbulent reattachment in the laminar separation bubble. The effects of turbulator height and Reynolds number on the mean, the standard deviation, the skewness, and the kurtosis of the hot-film signals are examined. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical predictions of laminar separation, transition, and turbulent reattachment obtained using a viscous/inviscid analysis code.For the range of trip heights examined, that is up to 30 percent of boundary layer thickness, the adaptive boundary layer trip is not suited to provide proportional control of a laminar separation bubble, as no monotonic variation of location in separation, transition, or reattachment is observed with varying trip height. However, the hot-film measurements show promise for providing in real time the identification of the primary features of the laminar separation bubble.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010508-105403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ARCHAEAL RIBONUCLEASE P HAS MULTIPLE PROTEIN SUBUNITSHOMOLOGOUS TO EUKARYOTIC NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEASE P SUBUNITS</field><field name="creator">HALL, THOMAS A.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;RNase P removes the 5&#180; leader from all transfer RNA precursors, and is thus a required factor for protein synthesis.

Current techniques employed in the microprocessor include register renaming to eliminate register anti- and output (false) dependences, branch prediction to overcome control dependences, and data disambiguation to resolve memory dependences. Techniques for value prediction and value speculation have been proposed to break register flow (true) dependences among operations, so that dependent operations can be speculatively executed without waiting for producer operations to finish. This thesis presents a new combined hardware and compiler synergy, value speculation scheduling (VSS), to exploit the predictability of operations to improve the performance of microprocessors. The VSS scheme can be applied to dynamically-scheduled machines and statically-scheduled machines. To improve the techniques for value speculation, a value speculation model is proposed as solving an optimal edge selection problem in a data dependence graph. Based on three properties observed from the optimal edge selection problem, an efficient algorithm is designed and serves as a new compilation phase of benefit analysis to know which dependences should be broken to obtain maximal benefits from value speculation. A pure software technique is also proposed, so that existing microprocessors can employ software-only value speculation scheduling (SVSS) without adding new value prediction hardware and modifying processor pipelines. Hardware-based value profiling is investigated to collect highly predictable operations at run-time for reducing the overhead of program profiling and eliminating the need of profile training inputs.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010508-151111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanical and Laser Scribing For Use As Precision Shaping Techniques</field><field name="creator">Love, Bryan Matthew</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this research has been to develop a model for mechanical and laser scribing processes used in the manufacture of hard disk drive heads. The scribing techniques are used to create small distortions on thin plates, allowing control over the shape of the plate. Analytical models for the scribing techniques allow more accurate control over the shape of the hard drive head, therefore increasing the performance of the drive. Using finite element techniques, prior models of mechanical scribing were extended to the three-dimensional case, allowing varying scribe length and placement. A force model for laser scribes was developed using similar finite element techniques and calibrated using experimental results. The laser scribing force model was parameterized, allowing the distortions by wide variety of scribes to be computed using simple equations. Consideration was given to modeling multiple scribes and complicated scribing geometries.

Heritage tourism provides economic benefits and cultural sustainability to local communities. This dissertation analyzes perceived levels of authenticity and spending by visitors to heritage festivals. The economic impact of visitor expenditures upon the host regions in North Carolina (USA) is also analyzed. Existing and potential visitor target markets are identified. The festivals studied are Scottish Highland Games, and analyses are based on survey data collected from Grandfather Mountain Highland Games and Flora Macdonald Highland Games held in North Carolina. Perceived authenticity is measured as the average authenticity rating of events offered at the Games and statistically related to visitor characteristics. Second, visitor expenditures are compared across age and income groups and regressed on other visitor characteristics, including the visitors' experience at the event. Finally, economic impact of total visitor expenditures is estimated with an input-output model that calculates income, output and value added impacts. The results provide useful insights for Highland Games and local government officials with respect to future promotion. Highland Games in the United States are staged authenticity, but this does not make them inauthentic. There are important differences in perceptions of authenticity among visitors with regard to gender and historical background. Tourist expenditures are positively related to annual household income and distance traveled. When potentially endogenous attributes acquired at the Games (such as enjoyment) are added to the model, they increase the statistical significance of the model. Finally, the Highland Games visitor expenditures have the biggest economic impact on the lodging industry. This is followed by impacts on eating and drinking, admission and registration, gasoline and retail industries. Since the multipliers are small, the games have a rather small percentage impact on their host regions. However, they generate both large direct expenditures as well as indirect and induced effects. The results of this study show that the Highland Games boost heritage tourism in North Carolina by providing events perceived as authentic and economic benefits to the local community.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010511-132908</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploration of Micromachines to Textiles: Monitoring Warp Tension and Breaks during the Formation of Woven Fabrics</field><field name="creator">Gahide, Severine Francoise</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;MicroElectroMechanical Systems, or MEMS, is an emerging high technology that has proven to be very successful in several industries such as medical, automotive and ink jet industries. The technology philosophy is to integrate sensors, actuators and electronics onto a silicon substrate (polysilicon batch) to form as small as a square millimeter micromachine at low manufacturing cost. Such advantages prompted investigating the potential applications of MEMS in textiles.Initially, we identified possible applications of MEMS technology in spinning, weaving, knitting, fiber formation, nonwovens, testing and evaluation, and dyeing and finishing. Based on a perceived real need and large potential market for a successful device, it was decided to concentrate efforts into the development of a MEMS based detection device to monitor warp tension and end breaks in weaving. Thus replacing the abrasive and passive traditional drop wire with gentle and active device that has the potential to expand the markets for weavers. A macro prototype device (sensors, software and hardware) to monitor warp tension and break was designed and built. Descriptions of the device components along with weaving specifics are given. To demonstrate the benefits of the device, several experiments were conducted. The experiments along with their results are reported. The experiments include:&#61623; Simultaneously monitor tension of eight individual warp ends in real time &#61623; Identify complex weave patterns through matching tension fingerprint with weave floats and intersections&#61623; Detect yarn tension trends while weaving&#61623; Quantify variations of warp tension across beam width&#61623; Identify variations of warp tension at the warp sheet edges&#61623; Monitor the behavior of the warp let-off mechanism&#61623; Detect broken warp yarns&#61623; Assess warp yarn damage caused by using drop wiresBased on the results of these experiments, it can be concluded that monitoring individual warp yarn tension could provide a useful mean for woven fabric producers as well as weaving machine manufacturers. From these findings, the micromachine, an array of piezoresistive sensors, was designed and built.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Management and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010514-171836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A New Approach to Checking Sequence Generation for Finite State Machines</field><field name="creator">Serdar, Burak</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;This thesis presents a formal model of checking sequencegeneration for finite state specifications, based on the machine identificationproblem.

This formal model is used toprove fault coverage properties of some of the existing checkingsequence generation methods.

Adipose tissue is highly heterogeneous, with wide variations in fat cell size, lipid composition, blood flow rates and cellpermeability. Since TCE is highly lipophilic, the uneven distributionof lipids in the adipose tissue may lead to an uneven distribution of TCEwithin the fat. These physiological characteristics suggest that thedynamics of TCE in the adipose tissue may depend on spatial variations within the tissueitself.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The first PBPK model for inhaled TCE presented here is a system ofordinary differential equations which includes the standardperfusion-limited compartmental model for each of the adipose, brain,kidney, liver, muscle and remaining tissue compartments.Model simulations predict relatively rapiddecreases in TCE fat concentrations following exposure, which may notreflect the accumulation and relative persistence of TCE inside the fattissue. The second PBPK model is identical to the first except forthe adipose tissue compartment, which is modeled as a diffusion-limited compartment.Although this model yields various concentration profiles for TCE inthe adipose tissue depending on the value of the permeabilitycoefficient, this model may not be physically appropriate for TCE,which is highly lipophilic and has a low molecular weight. Moreover,neither of these two PBPK models is able to capture spatialvariation of TCE concentrations in adipose tissue as suggested bythe physiology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The third model we present is a hybrid PBPK model with adispersion-type model for the transport of TCE in the adipose tissue. Thedispersion model is designed to account for the heterogeneities within fattissue, as well as the corresponding spatial variation of TCE concentrationsthat may occur. This partial differential equation model is based onthe dispersion model of Roberts and Rowland for hepatic uptake andelimination, adapted here for the specific physiology of adiposetissue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Theoretical results are given for the well-posedness of a generalclass of abstract nonlinear parabolic systems which includes the TCEPBPK-hybrid model as a special case. Moreover, theoretical issues related to associated general least squares estimation problems are addressed,including the standard type of deterministic problem and aprobability-based identification problem that incorporates variability inparameters across a population. We also establish thetheoretical convergence of the Galerkin approximations used in our numericalschemes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The qualitative behavior of the TCE PBPK-hybrid model is studied usingmodel simulations and parameter estimation techniques. In general, theTCE PBPK-hybrid model can generate various predictions of the dynamicsof TCE in adipose tissue by varying the adipose model parameters.These predictions include simulations that are similar to the expectedbehavior of TCE in the adipose tissue, which involves a rapid increaseof TCE adipocyte concentrations during the exposure period, followed by aslow decay of TCE levels over several hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results are presented for several types of parameter estimationproblems associatedwith the TCE PBPK-hybrid model. We test theseestimation strategies using two types of simulated data: observationsrepresenting TCE concentrations from a single individual, andobservations that simulateinter-individual variability. The latter type of data, which iscommonly found in experiments related to toxicokinetics, assumesvariability in the parameters across a population, and may includeobservations from multiple individuals. Using both deterministic andprobability-based estimation techniques, we demonstrate thatthe probability-based estimation strategiesthat incorporate variability in the parameters may be best suited forestimating adipose model parameters that vary across the population.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Applied Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010516-105855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modifications of the DIRECT Algorithm.</field><field name="creator">Gablonsky, J&#246;rg M.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;GABLONSKY, J&#214;RG MAXIMILIAN XAVER. Modifications of the DIRECTAlgorithm. (Under the direction of Carl Timothy Kelley.)This work presents improvements of a global optimization method for boundconstraint problems along with theoretical results. These improvements arestrongly biased towards local search. The global optimization method known asDIRECT was modified specifically for small-dimensional problems with few globalminima. The motivation for our work comes from our theoretical results regarding thebehavior of DIRECT. Specifically, we explain how DIRECT clusters its search neara global minimizer. An additional influence is our explanation of DIRECT'sbehavior for both constant and linear functions. We further improved the effectiveness of both DIRECT, and our modification, bycombining them with another global optimization method known as ImplicitFiltering. In addition to these improvements the methods were also extended tohandle problems where the objective function is defined solely on an unknownsubset of the bounding box. We demonstrate the increased effectiveness androbustness of our modifications using optimization problems from the natural gastransmission industry, as well as commonly used test problems from theliterature. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Applied Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010521-153035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparing Bayesian, Maximum Likelihood and Classical Estimates for the Jolly-Seber Model</field><field name="creator">Brown, George Gordon Jr.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;BROWN Jr., GEORGE GORDON . Comparing Bayesian, Maximum Likelihood and Classical Estimates for the Jolly-Seber Model. (Under the direction of John F. Monahan and Kenneth H. Pollock)In 1965 Jolly and Seber proposed a model to analyze data for open population capture-recapture studies. Despite frequent use of the Jolly-Seber model, likelihood-based inference is complicated by the presence of a number of unobservable variables that cannot be easily integrated from the likelihood. In order to avoid integration, various statistical methods have been employed to obtain meaningful parameter estimates. Conditional maximum likelihood, suggested by both Jolly and Seber, has become the standard method. Two new parameter estimation methods, applied to the Jolly-Seber Model D, are presented in this thesis. The first new method attempts to obtain maximum likelihood estimates after integrating all of the unobservable variables from the Jolly-Seber Model D likelihood. Most of the unobservable variables can be analytically integrated from the likelihood. However, the variables dealing with the abundance of uncaptured individuals must be numerically integrated. A FORTRAN program was constructed to perform the numerical integration and search for MLEs using a combination of fixed quadrature and Newton's method. Since numerical integration tends to be very time consuming, MLEs could only be obtained from capture-recapture studies with a small number of sampling periods. In order to test the validity of the MLE, a simulation experiment was conducted that obtained MLEs from simulated data for a wide variety of parameter values. Variance estimates for these MLEs were obtained using the Chapman-Robbins lower bound. These variances estimates were used to construct 90% confidence intervals with approximately correct coverage. However, in cases with few recaptures the MLEs performed poorly. In general, the MLEs tended to perform well on a wide variety of the simulated data sets and appears to be a valid tool for estimating population characteristics for open populations. The second new method employs the Gibbs sampler on an unintegrated and an integrated version of the Jolly-Seber Model D likelihood. For both version full conditional distributions are easily obtained for all parameters of interest. However, sampling from these distributions is non-trivial. Two FORTRAN programs were developed to run the Gibbs sampler for the unintegrated and the integrated likelihoods respectively. Means, medians, modes and variances were constructed from the resulting empirical posterior distributions and used for inference. Spectral density was used to construct a variance estimate for the posterior mean. Equal-tailed posterior density regions were directly calculated from the posteriors distributions. A simulation experiment was conducted to test the validity of density regions. These density regions also have approximately the proper coverage provided that the capture probability is not too small. Convergence to a stationary distribution is explored for both version of the likelihood. Often, convergence was difficult to detect, therefore a test of convergence was constructed by comparing two independent chains from both version of the Gibbs sampler. Finally, an experiment was constructed to compare these two new methods and the traditional conditional maximum likelihood estimates using data simulated from a capture-recapture experiment with 4 sampling periods. This experiment showed that there is little difference between the conditional maximum likelihood estimates and the 'true' maximum likelihood estimates when the population size is large. A second simulation experiment was conducted to determine which of the 3 estimation methods provided the 'best' estimators. This experiment was largely inconclusive as no single method routinely outperformed the others&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010525-142731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CONTROL OF DIFFUSING DUCT FLOWUSING ACTIVE VORTEX GENERATORSWITH HOT-FILM SENSOR MEASUREMENTS</field><field name="creator">Jones, Warren Anthony</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Experiments have been conducted using vane-type vortex generators to control flow separation and exit flow distortion in a diffusing duct. The primary purpose is to examine the feasibility of using surface-mounted hot-film sensors to determine the extent of exit flow distortion. The experimental set-up consists of a two-dimensional blow down type wind tunnel with a variable diffuser exit. One diffuser wall is curved to produce a Stratford-like pressure gradient. The wall's placement is adjustable such that the adverse pressure gradient can be adjusted to promote separation. An active vortex generator array that can be placed at three streamwise locations is used to reduce the extent of flow separation and exit distortion.Diffuser surface pressure and exit total pressure measurements are obtained and compared to the hot-film data. The time-averaged mean and rms voltages from the hot-film data are used as indicators of flow separation and exit flow distortion.Results show that, with the use of the vortex generators, high mean voltages and low levels of rms voltage correlate well with improved pressure recovery. Conversely, poorer pressure recovery is associated with lower mean voltages and higher rms values compared to the baseline cases. Increased total pressures at the diffuser exit are accompanied by increases in hot-film mean voltages. These indicate higher shear stresses, which also correspond to increased flow uniformity. Lower variations in the rms voltages compared to the baseline cases also correlated well with improved total pressures at the diffuser exit.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010528-224402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laboratory evaluation of the horizontal movement of pyriproxyfen to larval microcosms by gravid Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Aedes triseriatus (Say)</field><field name="creator">Chism, Billy Dell</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Horizontal movement of the insect growth regulator (IGR) pyriproxyfen to larval microcosms by gravid container-inhabiting mosquitoes, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Aedes triseriatus Say, was evaluated under laboratory conditions. In larval susceptibility bioassays determining emergence inhibition (EI), both species were found to be highly susceptible to the IGR. Aedes albopictus exhibited an EI50 of 0.200 ppb, while Aedes triseriatus was 7 and 3.5x more susceptible with an EI50 of 0.0288 ppb. A randomized complete block experimental design was used for each species to evaluate the horizontal transfer of the IGR by gravid females force contacted with pyriproxyfen-treated oviposition strips. For Ae. albopictus, experiments were blocked by treatment rate of pyriproxyfen (0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mg/cm2). Effects of numbers of treated females (1, 3 and 5 females per bioassay cage) on horizontal movement of the IGR was evaluated within each treatment rate. One treatment rate of pyriproxyfen (0.2 mg/cm2) was evaluated for Ae. triseriatus. A significant (P&lt;0.05) curvilinear response in emergence inhibition was observed in Ae. albopictus and Ae. triseriatus over the three population densities of treated females evaluated. Notably, the shape of the response curves for the two species were opposite. Lower but equivalent levels of mortality were achieved at densities of 1 and 3 treated Ae. triseriatus females per cage with significantly higher levels of inhibition of emergence observed at 5 females per cage. At 1,3, and 5 females per cage, mortality of Ae. triseriatus averaged 20.8%, 26.9%, and 70.4%, respectively. For Ae. albopictus, mortality at the higher two population densities was similar and significantly larger than was observed at the lowest population density. Mean mortality of Ae. albopictus ranged over the 3 treatment rates from 3.5 to 30.2%, 47.8 to 67.3%, and 58.6 to 73.1% at densities of 1,3 and 5 females per cage, respectively. Amounts of pyriproxyfen transferred by gravid females were estimated from the log dose-probit mortality data obtained in larval bioassays.In binary choice bioassays, horizontal transfer of biologically active amounts of pyriproxyfen from treated (0.3 or 0.4 mg/cm2) to untreated microcosms was achieved by Aedes albopictus. Three microcosm configurations were utilized in an attempt to manipulate mosquito oviposition behavior to increase the amount of IGR transferred. Emergence inhibition (37.8%) for microcosms completely wrapped in black paper was significantly higher (P&gt;0.05) than two other configurations utilized. Forcibly exposing gravid females to pyriproxyfen-treated surfaces did not affect their fecundity. However, mean percent egg hatch between egg clutches laid in the 1st and 2nd gonotrophic cycles declined significantly (P&lt;0.05) by 30%. To assess the residual activity of pyriproxyfen, 1st instar Ae. albopictus were added to microcosms used in forced-contact experiments. Mosquito mortality declined markedly indicating that pyriproxyfen was not highly residual in larval microcosms. Use of IGR-treated oviposition containers to achieve horizontal movement of pyriproxyfen to mosquito oviposition sites in the field is a promising management technique. However, laboratory results were often variable, suggesting that interactions between females within the oviposition site caused a differential transfer of pyriproxyfen to larval microcosms. Comparative studies of the oviposition behavior of each mosquito species are warranted and would potentially provide information needed to improve the technique.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010530-101221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EFFECTS OF VITAMIN E SUPPLEMENTATION ON PORK QUALITY CHARACTERISTICS OF HAMPSHIRE CROSSES AND BERKSHIRE CROSSES</field><field name="creator">Hasty, Jennifer L.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;HASTY, JENNIFER. EFFECTS OF VITAMIN E SUPPLEMENTATION ON PORK QUALITY CHARACTERISTICS OF HAMPSHIRE CROSSES AND BERKSHIRE CROSSES. (Under the direction of Eric van Heugten). An experiment was conducted to investigate whether pork quality characteristics could be improved by feeding supra-nutritional levels of vitamin E (as a-tocopheryl acetate) to Berkshire x PIC and Hampshire x PIC finishing pigs. Diets contained 0, 75, 150, 300 or 600 mg a-tocopheryl acetate/kg and were fed ad libitum for six weeks. Pigs were biopsied on 0, 21 and 42 d to evaluate potential pork quality. After the six-week feeding period, pigs were humanely slaughtered at a commercial facility and the right loin was taken from previously biopsied pigs for pork quality measurements. Chops were packaged and placed in refrigerated illuminated conditions and displayed for 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 d. Loin sections were vacuum packaged, refrigerated and stored for 25, 35, 45 and 55 d. Supplemental vitamin E had no effect on improving average daily gain and tended to increase average daily feed intake. Average daily gain and gain:feed were greater for the Hampshire crosses and average daily feed intake was greater for the Berkshire crosses over the six-week feeding period. Supplemental vitamin E had no effect on carcass characteristics but there were differences between the two genotypes with Berkshire crosses having greater back fat and a lower percent yield, loin eye area, and lean percent. Supplemental vitamin E had no effect on biopsy fluid loss or pH. Hampshire crosses had greater fluid loss measured on day 42 than Berkshire crosses. There was no effect of supplemental vitamin E on initial (taken 45 min after slaughter) or ultimate (taken 24 hrs after slaughter) pH or temperature of the carcasses. There were no differences between genotype for initial pH and initial or ultimate temperature; however, ultimate pH was greater for Berkshire crosses. Serum and tissue vitamin E levels both increased with increasing levels of vitamin E in the diet and tissue vitamin E levels were greater for Hampshire crosses. Drip loss taken 24 hrs after slaughter was not affected by supplemental vitamin E and was lower in Berkshire crosses. However, there was a tendency for increasing level of vitamin E to decrease drip loss for the display chops of Hampshire crosses. Drip loss for the vacuum packaged loin sections was not affected by supplemental vitamin E and was lower in Berkshire crosses. Minolta L* values, taken 24 hours after slaughter, were not influenced by vitamin E. There was a trend for increasing levels of vitamin E to linearly increase a* and b* values. Hampshire crosses had greater a* values than Berkshire crosses, indicating redder meat. Supplemental vitamin E had no effect on any of the Minolta color values for the display chops or chops from the vacuum packaged loin sections. Berkshire crosses had lower L* and b* values and Hampshire crosses had greater a* values for both the display chops and chops from the vacuum packaged loin sections. TBARS values measured for samples collected 24 hrs after slaughter were not affected by supplementation of vitamin E but were greater for Hampshire crosses. TBARS values for Hampshire crosses were consistently greater over the display period. For day 4, 6, and 8, TBARS values decreased with increasing levels of vitamin E in the diet. No differences were seen in 0 or 2 d samples. TBARS values for Hampshire crosses decreased linearly with increasing levels of vitamin E in the diet but no effects were seen for Berkshire crosses. TBARS for chops from vacuum packaged loin sections were not affected by supplemental vitamin E and did not differ between genotype.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010602-194653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Benzene and Its Effect on Erythropoiesis: Models, Optimal Controls, and Analyses</field><field name="creator">Cole, Cammey Elizabeth</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Benzene (C_6 H_6) is a highly flammable, colorless liquid. Ubiquitous exposures result from its presence in gasoline vapors, cigarette smoke, and industrial processes. Benzene increases the incidence of leukemia in humans when they are exposed to high doses for extended periods; however, leukemia risks in humans subjected to low exposures are uncertain. The exposure-dose-response relationship of benzene in humans is expected to be nonlinear because benzene undergoes a series of metabolic transformations, detoxifying and activating, resulting in multiple metabolites that exert toxic effects on the bone marrow. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for the uptake and elimination of benzene in mice to relate the concentration of inhaled and orally administered benzene to the tissue doses of benzene and its key metabolites, benzene oxide, phenol, and hydroquinone. Analysis was done to examine the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the system. We then formulated an inverse problem to obtain estimates for the unknown parameters; data from multiple independent laboratories and experiments were used.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The model was then revised to take into account the zonal distribution of enzymes and metabolisms in the liver, rather than assuming the liver is one homogeneous compartment, and extrahepatic metabolisms were also considered. Despite the sources of variability, the multicompartment metabolism model simulations matched the data reasonably well in most cases and improved results from the original model, showing that data for benzene metabolism and dosimetry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since benzene is a known human leukemogen, the toxicity of benzene in the bone marrow is of most importance. And because blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, we investigated the effects of benzene on hematopoiesis (blood cell production and development). An age-structured model was used to examine the process of erythropoiesis, the development of red blood cells. Again, the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the system of coupled partial and ordinary differential equations was proven. The system was then written in weak form and reduced from an infinite dimensional system to a system of ordinary differential equations by employing a finite element formulation. The control of this process is governed by the hormone erythropoietin. The form of the feedback of this hormone is unknown. Although a Hill function has previously been used to represent this feedback, it has no physiological basis, so an optimal control problem was formulated in order to find the optimal form of the feedback function and to track the total number of mature cells. Numerical results for both forms of the feedback function are presented.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Applied Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010606-172722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural and Microstructural Characterization of III-Nitrides on 6H-SiC (0001) Substrates.</field><field name="creator">Preble, Edward Alfred</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Characterization of nitride films on 6H-SiC (0001) wafers via x-ray, TEM, and AFM was accomplished on standard GaN thin films with AlN or AlGaN buffer layers. TEM sample thinning capability was improved through the use of Nomarski in an optical microscope to gauge the thickness of the sample during preparation. TEM analysis was then completed of Au and Pt films deposited on chemical vapor cleaned GaN with annealed up to 800&#176;C. Chemical reactions were detected in x-ray measurements of the 800&#176;C Pt samples and GaN/metal interface roughening were confirmed by TEM images in both metals. Interface roughening is attributed to the chemical reactions and interfacial stresses greater than the yield stress of the metal created during heat treatments by the difference in the thermal expansion coefficients of the GaN and the metals. The GaN rocking curves were found to track very closely to the values of the underlying substrate and changes in buffer layer growth temperatures were found to change the screw and edge dislocation populations of subsequent GaN layers. GaN grown on 1030&#176;C AlN buffer layers showed the lowest edge dislocation populations when compared against buffers grown in the range of 1010-1220&#176;C, even though the 1220&#176;C AlN was much smoother. AlGaN buffer layers provided more edge dislocation reduction, with a 1090&#176;C Al0.2Ga0.8N layer yielding the best GaN rocking curve values found in this work. GaN films with AlN buffer layers grown on hydrogen etched SiC substrates did not show rocking curve improvement when compared against samples with unetched substrates. The AlN layers showed extremely narrow, substrate limited, on-axis rocking curve values, but it is not clear as to whether additional defects are present that may broaden the off-axis rocking curves, causing the poorer results seen in the GaN films. Reciprocal space maps of uncoalesced, maskless pendeo epitaxy samples revealed that the wing regions are shielded from poor substrate material when compared against the seed material. The wing regions also have lower strain and rocking curve widths than the corresponding seed material.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Material Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010607-163647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Application of a Reduced Order Computational Methodology for Eddy Current Based Nondestructive Evaluation Techniques</field><field name="creator">Joyner, Michele Lynn</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;In the field of nondestructive evaluation, new and improved techniques are constantly being sought to facilitate the detection of hidden corrosion and flaws in structures such as airplanes and pipelines. In this dissertation, we explore the feasibility of detecting such damages by application of an eddy current based technique and reduced order modeling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We begin by developing a model for a specific eddy current method in which we make some simplifying assumptions reducing the three-dimensional problem to a two-dimensional problem. (We do this for proof-of-concept.) Theoretical results are then presented which establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions as well as continuous dependence of the solution on the parameters which represent the damage. We further discuss theoretical issues concerning the least squares parameter estimation problem used in identifying the geometry of the damage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To solve the identification problem, an optimization algorithm is employed which requires solving the forward problem numerous times. To implement these methods in a practical setting, the forward algorithm must be solved with extremely fast and accurate solution methods. Therefore in constructing these computational methods, we employ reduced order Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) techniques which allows one to create a set of basis elements spanning a data set consisting of either numerical simulations or experimental data. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We investigate two different approaches in forming the POD approximation, a POD/Galerkin technique and a POD/Interpolation technique. We examine the error in the approximation using one approach versus the other as well as present results of the parameter estimation problem for both techniques. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, results of the parameter estimation problem are given using both simulated data with relative noise added as well as experimental data obtained using a giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensor. The experimental results are based on successfully using actual experimental data to form the POD basis elements (instead of numerical simulations) thus illustrating the effectiveness of this method on a wide range of applications. In both instances the methods are found to be efficient and robust. Furthermore, the methods were fast; our findings suggest a significant reduction in computational time. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Applied Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010608-103545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ROBUST METHODS FOR ESTIMATING ALLELE FREQUENCIES</field><field name="creator">Huang, Shu-Pang</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;HUANG, SHU-PANG. ROBUST METHODS FOR ESTIMATING ALLELE FREQUENCIES (Advisor: Bruce S. Weir) The distribution of allele frequencies has beena major focus in population genetics. Classical approaches usingstochastic arguments depend highly on the choice of mutationmodel. Unfortunately, it is hard to justify which mutation modelis suitable for a particular sample. We propose two methods toestimate allele frequencies, especially for rare alleles, withoutassuming a mutation model. The first method achieves its goalthrough two steps. First it estimates the number of alleles in apopulation using a sample coverage method and then models rankedfrequencies for these alleles using the stretchedexponential/Weibull distribution. Simulation studies have shownthat both steps are robust to different mutation models. Thesecond method uses Bayesian approach to estimate both the numberof alleles and their frequencies simultaneously by assuming anon-informative prior distribution. The Bayesian approach is alsorobust to mutation models. Questions concerning the probability offinding a new allele, and the possible highest (or lowest)probability for a new-found allele can be answered by bothmethods. The advantages of our approaches include robustness tomutation model and ability to be easily extended to genotypic,haploid and protein structure data.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010614-213208</field></doc></add>
